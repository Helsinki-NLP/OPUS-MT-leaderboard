28-year-old chef found dead in San Francisco mall
A 28-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stairwell of a local shopping center.
The brother of the victim testified that he could not imagine anyone who would want to harm him, "At last he went uphill again."
The body, found Wednesday morning in the Westfield Mall, was identified as 28-year-old Frank Galicia from San Francisco, the forensics department in San Francisco said.
The San Francisco Police Department said the death was classified as murder and the investigation is ongoing.
The victim’s brother, Louis Galicia, told ABS station KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who used to work as a chef in Boston, had gotten his dream job as a chef at the Sons & Daughters restaurant in San Francisco six months ago.
A spokesman for the Sons & Daughters said they were “shocked and devastated” by his death.
"We are a small team that works like a close family and we will miss him sorely," the spokesperson said.
Our thoughts and condolences are with Frank’s family and friends during this difficult time.
Louis Galicia stated that Frank initially lived in hostels, but that, "things finally went uphill for him."
"He found an apartment, he had a girlfriend," Louis Garcia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said that he could not imagine anyone who would want to harm his younger brother.
He was a kind person with a big heart.
His way of connecting with his family was to always cook us something, prepare us dinner," said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to participate in any kind of confrontation.
He was the brother who swam with the stream.
“In everything that goes wrong in the world, he was that uncut diamond that shone brightly every day,” he said.
Anyone with information on the case is asked to call the SFPD’s phone number 415-575-4444.
Jennifer Aniston: I always get stuck in drawers
Jennifer Aniston doesn’t always have to be perfect or successful.
This is what the Hollywood star has now made unmistakably clear in an interview.
"I am always put in drawers or get labels from outside, which usually have little to do with me and reality."
“I don’t want to always be perfect and successful.”
“Honestly, I think these things are rather sniffing.”
Jennifer Aniston (47) can only laugh at the fact that she is considered "Miss Perfect", as she explains in the current "Cosmopolitan".
The actress prefers to spend her time at home, in front of the TV with loose buns and Mexican food, says the magazine.
“We women don’t have to be married or have children to be perfect,” she said.
In her new film "Mother's Day - Love is not a child's play", Aniston is seen as a single mother of two sons.
The film will run from August 25.
Golfer Langer receives the sports pyramid
His experience on the horse is impressive.
At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer and some colleagues were looking for a bit of variety with a ride on the beach.
For the 58-year-old, it was a first.
CHIO: "Golden Sports Pyramid" for Bernhard Langer
After a few minutes the horses remembered their end of work, they chased home to the feed troughs in a quick gallop.
A mile at that speed, I was afraid.
“It wasn’t a good experience,” Langer says.
And so the riding career ended again.
On Saturday, Germany’s best golfer of all time – 101 tournament wins – was back near horses.
He let himself be led with his family over the ALRV facility, he did not even swing on a horse for photo purposes.
Langer was in Aachen for the first time and thus also at the CHIO.
The reason was quite convincing.
The German Sports Aid presented the man from Anhausen with the Golden Sports Pyramid as part of a small gala.
There is no shortage of awards for the likeable athlete.
Bundesverdienstkreuz, Silver laurel leaf, Champions-Tour-Player of the year...
Even the British Queen has already ennobled him.
Langer is the 18th winner of the Sports Pyramid.
In Aachen he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday.
“This award means a lot to me,” says Langer, “because it is not only awarded for sporting success, but also for social commitment.”
For decades, Langer has been supporting young talent.
And so he immediately passed on the prize money of 25,000 euros.
With 15 other outstanding athletes, the two-time US Masters winner was admitted to the "Hall of Fame of German Sports" on Saturday.
Among the award winners are the athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the gymnast Eberhard Gienger, the fencers Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the rower Peter-Michael Kolbe, the bobsleigh rider Meinhard Nehmer, the judoka Frank Wieneke, the show jumper Alwin Schockemöhle and posthum Wunderhard the handballer.
Many of these sports legends had come to Aachen on Saturday.
After the official part, the illustrious company moved to the Spring Stadium, where the Lavazza Prize ran.
Bernhard Langer kept his distance from the big animals.
Clinton and Trump’s Economic Policy: It’s All About the Money
Investing in infrastructure and preventing the TTP trade deal – that’s what both Clinton and Trump want.
However, the two US presidential candidates are divided on tax and energy policy as well as on a fundamental issue.
The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are based on a fundamental, rather philosophical difference.
The, about the role of the state.
Trump wants to keep those in doubt rather small and warns against how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations.
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate it to death, he says.
He himself would be completely different, Trump claims.
He will massively reduce regulations, and he is pushing for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates – for private individuals and for businesses.
Clinton, on the other hand, says: The state has certain tasks to perform, it has opportunities to open up to the disadvantaged and needs money for this.
That’s why taxes would be raised for the rich, she says.
Interestingly, both are very close to the topic of infrastructure.
Trump and Clinton say they need to invest in it almost word for word.
The Democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.
State investment programs in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the state-critical Tea Party wing of the Republicans, for example.
So there could still be internal discussions about Trump.
The differences in energy and climate policy are more pronounced.
Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and restart coal production in the United States.
Oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas, he wants to terminate the Paris climate agreement.
Clinton, on the other hand, explicitly wants to expand renewable energy with her investment program and demands: "A country will become the superpower of clean energy and create millions of jobs."
"It's probably going to be either China, Germany, or America - I want us to be."
But the two competitors are not too far apart from each other not only in terms of infrastructure, but also in the case of international trade agreements.
TPP, the trans-Pacific trade agreement, both do not want to sign.
At the same time, however, both do not want to isolate the US from international trade - but simply to better protect American jobs.
They should be paid more, says Clinton.
The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a starvation wage.
He wants to raise it to $15 an hour.
What Trump wants to do on this question is not entirely clear: once he says: The minimum wage must be raised, then he says that it must not be changed.
But the big discussion in the coming months is likely to develop more around the tax policy of the two camps.
On the one hand, there is Trump, who wants to relieve the burden on the economy and citizens in order to boost growth.
His critics accuse him of only increasing the budget deficit.
On the other side is Clinton, who wants at least the rich to pay more taxes, and her critics say that more taxes are not the solution.
“Every refugee woman has experience of sexual violence.”
Sexual violence is almost part of everyday life for women who flee on their own.
When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized.
A house offers refuge.
There are four women in a large kitchen.
Each has a baby who is at most one year old.
One of them put her little son in his arms.
He looks curiously into the room with big eyes.
His mother stared at the table.
Until she realizes that she is being watched.
She smiles briefly and kisses the little one.
The scene seems normal.
Until you talk to Katrin Bahr.
She is the divisional managing director of Condrobs, a provider of social assistance services in Bavaria, and deals with the topic of women on the run, among other things.
The four women in the kitchen are refugees.
They live in the north of Munich in one of the few decentralized accommodations for single women and their children in Bavaria.
In January, Condrobs opened the facility together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women’s Aid.
It was recently officially opened.
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.
There are no men, not even as visitors.
The exception is a security guard at the door.
“It’s no exaggeration to say that every woman who arrives here has experienced sexual violence while fleeing,” Bahr said.
“Men flee because of wars, because they are politically persecuted, because they are threatened with torture or death, or because their families send them to Europe as hopefuls,” she says.
For women, other reasons for fleeing predominate: “Many steal away secretly because they see no other way out.”
In their homeland, they have experienced sexual violence, forced marriage, honor killings, slavery or forced prostitution.
That drives them away.
On the run, this continues.
“That smugglers, for example, demand a sexual act for a bottle of water is not uncommon,” Bahr says.
And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.
Anyone who believes that the end, as soon as they arrive in Germany, is wrong, says Bahr.
Here, too, single women in refugee shelters would often be considered inferior and, at worst, abused.
This leads to the fact that about 90 percent of the women who live in the accommodation in the north of Munich are traumatized, she estimates.
"Some of the children certainly did not come into being voluntarily."
Many women are so used to not saying anything.
"Or they don't dare to speak openly about the experience because the shame is too great".
Since they often do not know how to help themselves, it needs more accommodation just for them, Bahr demands.
In Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for housing refugees.
When asked whether they knew of a project similar to that in Munich in their area of responsibility, some answered no.
In the Upper Palatinate and Upper Franconia, for example, there is no such thing in government accommodations.
Even in Swabia, refugee women alone are not accommodated separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, press spokesman for the government.
In Upper Bavaria, Lower and Middle Franconia there are in some community accommodations floors or own houses only for single women and their children.
The exception is Lower Bavaria, where there are two central accommodations exclusively for women.
The Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality in the European Parliament also calls for women to be accommodated separately from men.
A study published for the committee states, “It is very important that men and women are housed separately.”
"If privacy is lacking or men and women are housed together, it can lead to - continuing - violence against women".
In particular, the washrooms should be separate and easily accessible for women, says the study.
How much the women feel this need for protection can be seen in the crowd at the house in Munich.
“Since it’s been talked about that we exist, we have a long waiting list,” Bahr says.
It is easy to open a second house.
Residents on strike: calls for new industrial action
Deputies of resident doctors have called on their union to approve new industrial action in their disputes over a new contract.
The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has called on its entire Council to approve more industrial action from the beginning of September.
The JDC said ministers had failed to address concerns about the treaty.
Resident doctors and medical students voted in July on the rejection of a contract that was agreed with the BMA.
It was rejected by 58% of its members who voted in the elections.
In a letter to members posted on Twitter Thursday evening, JDC chairman Ellen McCourt said the government had remained “persistently calm” to problems, leading to the treaty being rejected.
She said: “In light of this, the JDC Board has voted to reject the proposed new contract completely and has requested official renegotiations on all your concerns.”
In response to the government’s silence, the JDC Board today made a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve an ongoing program of escalating industrial action beginning in early September.
The disputes led to interns striking six times this year, the first total outages in the history of the NHS.
The head of the BMA interns Dr. Johann Malawina resigned after the election to reject the agreed contractual conditions that had been recommended by the BMA.
He told BMA members during the sessions, which took place even before the vote by 54,000 interns and medical students, that the contract was beneficial and should be accepted.
After the vote, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said that the contract for doctors in England would be forcibly introduced.
Russia and Turkey: An ‘Alliance of Outsiders’?
It was a gesture that ended a crisis.
Leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and announce an official end to the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of the St. Petersburg Palace, I cannot deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most.
There was the handshake, yes.
But Putin’s smile looked slimy and he barely radiated warmth, even for his restrained circumstances.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his "dear friend" Putin - five times, according to a report.
I couldn't count it anymore.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their pre-crisis levels, but will even improve.
The next day, a newspaper reported that Erdogan had behaved as if nothing bad had ever happened.
His enthusiasm seemed to indicate the opposite.
But a lasting coolness emanating from Putin showed that the head of state of Russia had not forgotten anything.
Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: Turkey’s shooting down of a Russian fighter jet on the Syrian border.
Moscow’s reaction at the time was furious.
Putin lashed out and accused Ankara of having fallen in the back of Russia.
The offense was even greater because it was committed by a supposed friend.
Rebuilding trust will be difficult, if not impossible.
Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.
For months, the state-controlled media carried out a fierce, unrestricted attack on Ankara.
Suddenly, it seemed that the Turks were to blame for everything.
Most serious were the allegations by senior officials that Erdogan’s own family had benefited from the illegal oil trade in areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He vehemently denied this.
But in St. Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to look ahead.
After all, this meeting took place only because Putin received from President Erdogan the apology he wanted to hear.
Russia has achieved some sort of victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of a ceasefire are clear.
Erdogan primarily needs all the friends he can get after he was nearly removed from office in a failed coup last month.
Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.
But there are also economic reasons.
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.
The number has decreased by almost 90%.
In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be facilitated when the flights are resumed.
They are counting on a late-season onslaught of the Mediterranean.
This week, the state TV forecast cheaper fruits and vegetables as soon as Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again.
A report in Vedemosti put it this way: "Tourists there long, tomatoes here long."
But the visit had additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry at the West for considering its response to the attempted seizure of power as a weak response.
Added to this is the ongoing resentment over the snail pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin – who is eager to take advantage of the cool mood and reduce Turkey’s relationship with the West.
The Russian head of state certainly won a bonus in Ankara for calling for support for the elected organs of state after the attempted coup.
This is a matter of course for Moscow, which itself has a deep-seated fear of regime change.
The summit meeting in this splendid palace by the sea allowed Russia and Turkey to present what one analyst once described to me as an “alliance of outsiders”: two countries that feel alienated from the West and mistreated and are now allied.
Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still major differences between the two.
The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave itself the role of peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.
It could be significant that after nearly three hours of initial talks, both presidents said at the press conference that they hadn’t even touched on the issue.
The President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize them.
There is no clear consensus on where to find a common denominator on Syria.
But after months of open hostilities – and given the potential for a complete disaster when NATO member Turkey shot down the Russian fighter jet – it is certainly better that the two heads of state at least talk to each other again.
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available to customers outside of Scotland
According to the CEO of the bank, the RBS brand will only be reduced to a back-office role.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank’s global ambitions.
The bank has distanced itself since it nearly collapsed and had to be rescued eight years ago.
During this time, brand strategists have used “RBS” to protect other end-user financial brands.
She supported the international sport with millions of pounds in sponsorship, from Six Nations Rugby to Wimbledon winner Andy Murray.
But now she has decided to focus more on national brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland, but will not be initialized.
In England and Wales, all RSB references, the decentralised headquarters and the stock exchange listing will change to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already being used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller retail brands that will gain more importance – Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt’s Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed by clients and staff during a tour of Inverness-shire.
He told BBC Scotland: “The RSB brand will become our investor brand as well as the brand under which our employees will be employed as we become more of a bank of brands now.”
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I say now that we are not pursuing global goals, but local goals.
Each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with customers under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will no longer continue its Six Nations sponsorship and that it will increase the visibility of the various brands in its sports sponsorship.
“It’s time for us to become the bank of brands, because how do we focus inside (we asked) to make this a better bank for customers?” said the CEO.
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and launched these brands.
But with our work, the focus on customer needs and not our own, I think you’ll see a lot of change.
We can relaunch these brands, so I think the time has come.
Frankie Dettori wins his 3,000th win at Newmarket on Predilection
Dettori sprays champagne after a double at Newmarket that brings him 3,000th profit
Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th British win at Newmarket on Friday.
He set a milestone on predilection, which will be coached by John Gosden, on his local racetrack with his second win of the night.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach the milestone in the flat race.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddry and Willie Carson.
Three-time winner Dettori, who previously won at Ghayyar, said, "It's something special."
I am very emotional because my family is here too
I am very happy that it happened at Newmarket because I ended up here 30 years ago.
It's not a big meeting, it's not Royal Ascot - it's a banal Friday night with 20,000 people.
I am relieved and very humble.
Dettori picks up the cheers as he takes victory on predilection
Two jockeys have reached the milestone in the obstacle race – jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time winner Sir Anthony McCoy, who achieved more than 4,300 wins in a record-breaking career.
Lester Piggott, the nine-time Derby winner, had 4,493 career wins
Frankie is one of the best jockeys in modern times and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone that few before him have achieved.
He has style and is strong, but it is his tactical intellect that distinguishes him from the others in the weight control room.
He is a fantastic ambassador for racing, his enthusiasm and charisma has been inspiring fans for this sport for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that he would have already won 6,000 if he wasn’t just a weekend and big tournament jockey!
Frankie has already ridden winners in GB for almost 30 years, which is great.
He has a lively personality, which is good for a British race, but beyond that he is an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dismount
From Flying Finishes to Flying Dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the flagship of British flat racing for two decades.
It was nerve-wracking.
A string of major tournament wins, including his famous "Glory Rich Seven" in 1996 at Ascot, but he also survived a plane crash and received a drug ban.
Three years ago, he initially struggled when he returned from his six-month lockout, but he showed an impressive strength of character to defy his doubters and return to his best form.
And it’s far from over – Dettori used to say that he wants to continue competing until he’s at least 50.
Russia's Putin fires Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly dismissed his chief of staff Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin’s closest circle of trust for many years.
The 63-year-old was appointed Special Representative for Environmental and Transport Affairs.
In a statement issued by the Kremlin, Putin “ordered Ivanov’s release from his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration without giving any reason.”
Anton Vaino, who has been Ivanov’s deputy since 2012, was appointed as his successor.
Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in 1972 in Tallinn, Estonia, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the Embassy in Tokyo.
The Kremlin’s website states (in Russian) that he was later the head of protocol and chief of staff of government personnel.
Regarding his appointment, he said to Putin: "Thank you for your trust."
I think that the most important task of the government is to support your activities as head of state regarding draft laws and controls to implement your instructions.
Putin told Russian TV on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.
Do the smiling faces convince?
This move has made Moscow shrouded in mystery.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin’s closest confidants and, like him, works for the Soviet secret service, the KGB.
As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a televised meeting with President Putin, both men claimed that the chief of staff was resigning at his own request.
But despite the smile on the cameras, few are convinced of this – especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
Is this the result of some kind of power struggle?
Nobody knows that right now.
But the official claim — that a man once touted as a potential president suddenly wants to lead Russian environmental policy — met with great skepticism.
In his remarks to Putin quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said "it is true that in an interview in early 2012 I asked you to entrust me with this very complicated post - one could almost say - for four years of arduous posts.
As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months.
Ivanov assumed the post in December 2011.
He was previously Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, a former member of the KGB.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov as one of five people he trusted most.
It was once thought that Ivanov could become president of Russia after Putin’s second term, since a third term of Putin would have violated the constitution.
But this post was taken by another close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister before becoming president again three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds star Thomas Gibson fired after beating producers
Gibson was involved in a physical altercation on the series' set in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, announced in a joint statement its termination.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, publicly apologized Thursday before announcing his resignation.
On the set there were artistic differences and a difference of opinion.
I regret the incident," he said in a statement.
Details of how Gibson’s character from the series, which follows a team of FBI agents, are expected to be released at a later date, according to statements from ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
The 54-year-old, who previously starred in the sitcom Dharma & Greg, has been a part of the series since its first season in 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds and have put all my heart and soul into it for the last 12 years," Gibson said in a statement released on Friday.
I was hoping to be there until the end, but that won't be possible now.
I’d just like to thank the writers, producers, actors, our wonderful crew and most of all the best fans you could ever wish for in a series.
The planned broadcast of the twelfth season is scheduled for September 28.
Mystery of fish landing in Garden in Banff
A Banff resident asked for help in identifying the fish, which appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks the 75 fish could be sand eels spied from a fountain.
Mr. Bain, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, posted a video of the spectacle on Periscope in the hope that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two-inch-long fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connected to Fife
<0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion project to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have connected the north deck of Queensferry Crossing to the viaduct – meaning the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of four closures of the "deck blowers" that are approaching completion around each of the bridge's three towers.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 inclined cables.
The <0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017.
Economy Minister Keith Brown paid a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the countryside to the bridge.
He said: "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Crossing.
We are all witnessing an engineering feat of truly epic proportions in this project of over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for fitting.
Overall, almost 79% of the total bridge deck is in place and the last section of the deck gets a concrete cast for the deck today in Rosyth, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge.
Michael Martin, Project Manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said: “The first closure represents a significant milestone in every bridge project.
In this fantastic project, the closure represents future-oriented building and civil engineering.
After the installation of the last road deck section and its connection with the North Tower Deck under construction, we then had to close the remaining gap on the north or land side.
This was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters south.
This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.
Massive, as the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled up at an incline of about 3%.
It’s tricky because the tolerances the team is working towards were tiny – they were just a few millimeters on each side.
Fortunately everything went very well.
Rescue in Moelfre Bay: Three men 'lucky to be still alive'
Three men have "lucky to be still alive" after being thrown off Anglesey by their fishing boat.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station sounded an alarm at 13:20 BST on Friday after a crew observed the event in Moelfre Bay.
The three men had difficulty swimming in safety as their boat moved on by its own power.
"We saw the boat turn around near her and imagined the worst," said the head of Moelfre's rescue station Vince Jones.
"Fortunately, the strong winds already blew the boat out of range until we let it into the water," he added.
Two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat, while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and found hanging on a buoy without a life jacket.
They all boarded the coastal rescue boat and were taken back to the rescue station.
Mr. Jones said, "The three men who were thrown into the water are lucky to be unharmed and still alive.
Although the boat engine had an emergency stop square, it separated from the person who steered the boat when the boat capsized.
Someone was watching over these men today.
Seriously injured - man stabs his ex-girlfriend
A man attacked his ex-girlfriend in Hamburg-Harburg with a knife and seriously injured her.
As the police announced yesterday, the 50-Year-old had got the key to the apartment to get his personal things.
Instead, the intoxicated perpetrator cut his ex-girlfriend’s clothes.
When she came into the apartment, he stabbed her twice.
The 44-year-old was injured in the hand and body.
The police were able to arrest the perpetrator.
While the 50-year-old destroyed the clothes of his ex-girlfriend, he called his mother.
She then alerted her sister.
Together with her partner, the 45-year-old wanted to reassure her brother.
She couldn’t get him to leave the apartment.
That’s why she left the house with her partner.
On the street they met the man's ex-boyfriend.
When the two women entered the apartment again, the 50-year-old pushed his sister aside and attacked his ex-girlfriend.
Who builds cheap apartments in Braunschweig?
The SPD and the Greens believe that investors should be taken much more seriously in the future.
How do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 cheap apartments in the next few years?
The SPD is proposing an "Action Concept for Housing" for the next Council meeting.
Disputes are programmed.
First and foremost, it is about the question: who should actually build the cheap apartments?
So far, there has been no regulation.
SPD leader Christoph Bratmann says: "We agree with the Greens: If you want to build on urban areas, you have to designate 20 percent of all apartments as social housing in the future."
However, the cheap apartments can also arise in the existing.
However, the big issue in the town hall is, according to Bratmann: "How do you deal with investors who want to build on private land?"
“We want investors to build at least 10 percent of the apartments on such areas, but as much as possible 20 percent of the apartments as social housing.”
A new urban housing program, which will cost millions and still needs to be financed, will provide incentives.
The problem, says Bratmann: "There is currently no agreement between the political groups."
The CDU wants investors to make as few regulations as possible.
The left still wants tough conditions for investors.
Nevertheless, according to Bratmann, the situation on the housing market is beginning to worsen.
If the action plan is implemented, this will provide additional tasks in building management.
More staff is needed.
It is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers.
But the program is not yet complete: because the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway.
But how do you compensate for the loss of another 1,300 cheap apartments, whose funding will expire in the next few years?
By 2020 alone, there will be 500 homes.
In order to prevent this, according to the planning policy spokeswoman Nicole Palm, now expiring bonds should be purchased from the city.
In addition, consideration should be given to bringing housing back into price-fixing.
This is possible in the West.
The problem could be solved in one fell swoop.
Because in the Weststadt, deadlines expire at the end of the year.
Around 1800 apartments could be brought back into the price-fixing for cheap apartments.
This is what the owners want, the housing companies don’t.
Because if the number of social housing in the western city is drastically increased again, one moves away from the goal of so-called mixing.
There should no longer be a concentration of socially disadvantaged people in only a few districts.
The Greens expect that there will still be movement in the discussion.
Group chairman Holger Herlitschke says: "For a broad majority, the CDU has to get on board."
It has concentrated on more construction sites for single-family homes.
But that does not mean that a compromise cannot still be found.
Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that pays off
It is fascinating to watch the world change.
The fact that teenagers and children no longer go outside to play, but rather prefer to spend their free time staring at screens, has been lamented by many over the last decade.
Pokemon Go is all about getting people off the sofa and getting them more active.
The time spent on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then to video games and finally to smartphones.
Therefore, it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive.
I’m referring, of course, to the Pokémon Go craze, an app based on the characters that were first created for the video games in the 1990s (later an animated series, playing cards and other spin-offs).
Like many pop culture phenomena, interest dropped somewhat before the game’s release in the US, Australia, and New Zealand in early July.
The market launch in other countries was delayed by the massive demand, which overloaded the servers.
Within days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, players go outside with their smartphones and look for Pokémon that are tracked with a GPS and, once found, can be “photographed” (via a screenshot on the phone) or “captured.”
A generation that played the game when they were younger joined in the madness and jumped off the sofa for the search.
In the U.S., the game led to a significant increase in steps that the “average” person takes every day.
Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch that tracks 35,000 users, recently told the Washington Post that within two days of the game’s launch, the number of tracked people exercising 30 minutes each day jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company doesn't know who's playing Pokémon Go - it just sees the raw data to improve performance.
Many public health education campaigns that want to get people to “take 30 minutes,” “get off the couch” and “be active every day” have fallen on deaf ears because many public health messages are boring and come from people who look miserable.
However, the importance of sports cannot be overstated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps with weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes, and a long list of benefits that is too long to list here.
But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it makes people do something outdoors that they enjoy.
Thus, three pillars of health are covered - exercise, fresh air and sunshine, as well as fun.
Some people even make new friends while hunting.
As always, there are grumpy spoilers who always have to complain about something.
And yes, someone could walk up to a door.
What's the matter?
A breakthrough has occurred.
Even though smartphone apps like Fitbit have been able to track our activity before, they gave us no reason to exercise like this game does.
The new will lose its appeal and its use will wane over time.
However, due to Pokemon’s success, there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with getting active in the real world, helping many people on the hunt to be more active, fitter, and healthier.

Simone Biles wins gold in women's gymnastics
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is immune to all this.
Dynamic on the jump horse.
Effortlessly on the beam.
Breathtaking on the ground.
Brilliant in every way.
And finally, an Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast climbed to the multi-fight title on Thursday and widened the gap between herself and the rest of the world in front of everyone under the spotlight of the Olympic Games.
Her total of 62,198 was clearly ahead of silver medalist and "Final Five" teammate Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.
The American women Simone Biles plays on the balance beam during the women's individual multi-fight final in gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.
Biles is the fourth straight American to win a multi-fight title and fifth overall, while cementing her reputation as the best of her generation or even of her generation.
She burst into tears as her final result was shown and her long journey came to an end at that moment.
This success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who has taken their sports to new heights:
Biles has dominated her sport for the last three years, winning 15 World Champion medals – including 10 gold medals – with such amazing exercises that include a mix of ambition and precision that the 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton said of her that she is “the best gymnast I have ever seen.”
She expected a final test in Brazil, a competition that was not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a burden of oversized expectations.
Not returning to the family in Spring, Texas with a handful of gold would be considered a disappointment.
The Americans Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman hug after winning gold and silver in the women's individual multi-fight final in art gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday
Biles won the first medal on Tuesday, while she served as an exclamation point at the farewell party of retired team coordinator Martha Karolyi.
Although Biles insisted during her long journey to the top that she never planned for the future, that’s not really true.
Part of their ground exercises – which include their typical tumbling pass – are tuned to Latin American music that would fit on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio at home.
It's not a coincidence.
This girl, adopted as a young child by her grandparents and discovered by coach Aimee Boorman's mother during a school trip to the gym where Boorman was training, became a force.
She hasn’t lost a multi-fight competition since the summer of 2013, a winning streak that will last as long as Biles wants.
Even though Mustafina easily led through two turns, the picture trickled.
Suspended beams and floor gymnasts - in which Biles holds the world championship title - were lurking.
She caught up again with 15,433 on the floating beam - and put one more on the ground with a 15,933.
Raisman hugged her gently as they awaited her final outcome—a sheer formality—and tears flowed on Bile’s shiny red, white, and blue eyeliner as the vision she once described in her collection book became a reality.
Raisman's performance was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she struggled for third place, but the bronze medal went to Mustafina in a tiebrake.
This time, the 22-year-old team captain, who the Americans call "Grandma," had a lead.
After her ground exercise, she threw kisses at the audience, overwhelmed by a comeback that sometimes seemed doubtful.
As for Biles, the rapidly spreading tweet of the 19-year-old from the beginning of this week has a whole new meaning:
Police: 3 victims in serial killer case shot dead while listening to music in car
According to police reports released Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot dead in one of the deadliest attacks in a decade in the first Phoenix serial killer case while chatting in the car and listening to music.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Maleah were shot on June 12 while the car was parked in a driveway, authorities said.
The perpetrator fired eight shots from a handgun while standing on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle, according to the report.
Police said the triple murder did not appear to have been the result of a robbery, as the attacker did not take the handbags or the $2,900 that was in the possession of one of the adult victims.
Phoenix Sgt. Jonathan Howard’s police spokesman said the shooting led investigators to take a closer look at whether it was linked to four previous attacks.
In total, seven people were killed and two others injured in nine attacks, mainly in Hispanic residential areas within four months.
"It's happening in a residential neighborhood in front of a house," Howard told KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have used several vehicles, including a brown Nissan from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s, and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Investigators refused to disclose the evidence that led them to conclude that the attacks were linked and committed by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized for her injuries and later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter Maleah died on the spot.
A witness told police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
Authorities also released a police report on the shooting, which targeted an empty pickup truck half an hour before the triple homicide and is believed to be the work of the serial killer.
Investigators found cartridge casings and secured a bullet from the seat as well as bullet fragments from the engine compartment.
Mother of a 6-year-old with microcephaly: "It gets better"
Like most 6-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But like most of his peers, Edmund has microcephaly, the result of a genetic disorder that his mother Elizabeth Picciuto knew nothing about during her pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was, I can't do it.
I can't do this.
I didn't get into that.
Which is not at all true -- of course, they got involved," she said.
Her husband Vincent and her were told that Edmund may never be able to recognize her and that he may not even survive.
Some doctors even went so far as to suggest institutionalizing him.
“My first response to that was, ‘I didn’t know people were still doing that,’” Picciuto explained.
Edmund can walk with the help of a walking aid.
Edmund could neither sit nor crawl until he was three, and he still could not speak.
But he is slowly making progress.
He can walk and cycle with support.
He also loves to play and sing with his two brothers.
Elizabeth shows the sign language that Edmund has come up with for "Please sing something to me."
"We're teaching him sign language," Picciuto told CBS News.
But it's not a typical sign language -- she says. Edmund invented some signs on his own.
Microcephaly has a variety of causes: genetic as in Edmund, as well as infections with viruses such as measles or the Zika virus during pregnancy.
The symptoms and prognosis can vary greatly.
It is still too early to say how it will affect the lives of those infected with the Zika virus.
Picciuto remembers the emotional price of an uncertain future.
I kept asking what was going to happen?
What will happen?
And she still doesn't really know.
I haven’t asked for the prognosis in a long time because I don’t expect anyone to be able to tell me.
But Picciuto has a hopeful piece of advice for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the Zika virus.
It'll get better.
You know it will get better for you.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rains, flooding gives cause for rescue in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rains and large-scale flooding in Louisiana forced the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday, with more rainfall expected throughout Saturday.
Numerous rivers in southeastern Louisiana and southern Mississippi flooded their banks and threatened large-scale flooding after extreme rainfall, the National Weather Service reported.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and assistance to the affected communities is already on the way.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the governor’s Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, said requests for high-water vehicles, boats, and sandbags were increasing.
Steele said that the Tangipahoa community alone had requested ten thousand sandbags.
A flood warning system will be deployed across much of southern Louisiana until Saturday.
The weather service announced that an additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall in this area.
A flood early warning system was deployed in southern Alabama on Friday, while it continued to rain in the Mobile area.
The River Comite near Baton Rouge and the River Amite near Denham Springs, both located in Louisiana, are likely to reach record levels over the weekend.
The meteorologist Alek Krautmann says that both rivers could flood many homes in the suburbs near Baton Rouge.
He also said that a downstream flood in Ascension Parish poses a danger, as these will flow slowly into Lake Maurepas across the trodden rivers.
The Tickfaw River, south of the Mississippi state border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest level ever recorded at 9 a.m. on Friday.
Rescue teams were still piling people out of the floodwaters in the Amite and Wilkinson counties of southwest Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were among those rescued near Gloster on Friday.
Hansford, 62, says water from Beaver Creek, which is usually more than 400 feet away from his home, rose sharply overnight.
He said that another stepson living nearby had warned him.
"We woke up and the water came in and came in," Hansford said.
It reached my waist.
His wife told Hansford that in the 48 years she lived there, she had never seen such a high point of the river.
Hansford said he and his family members had all the disabilities and he was the only one who could swim.
Hansford said emergency responders rescued all three in a large military truck and took them to the nearest fire station in Gloster, where they were housed until Friday.
Krautmann said the flooding had "spread quickly" as there were still heavy rainfalls and that authorities were considering evacuation instructions.
According to Krautmann, an observer near Livingstone reported from midnight to Friday morning of 13.75 inches of rain.
Krautmann said the ground had been significantly soaked by the rains since Wednesday.
Authorities said heavy rains and road flooding caused the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and school dropout in five school districts.
CBS subsidiary WWL reported that a deputy in Tangipahoa reported 200 flooded homes.
Residents were evacuated to two churches, both of which were now flooded.
Robby Miller, head of the community, said authorities had rescued 72 people and seven pets washed up by the flood.
Emergency shelters have been set up in the towns of Amite and Hammond to accommodate the evacuees.
“As soon as the water starts to go back, they will be able to go back to their homes,” he said.
In the town of Hammond, Tangipahoa municipality, nearly two dozen streets were closed due to the flood and sandbags were provided for residents to take away, hoping to keep the water out of their homes and shops.
"The last major flood we had was in March," said Lacy Landrum of the city administration.
This appears to be a similar incident.
In Mississippi, Harrison County emergency manager Rupert Lacy said it continued to rain on the Gulf Coast.
According to his information, a handful of houses were reported as flooded on Thursday, but so far on Friday none have been reported.
Keith Townson, Manager at Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has lived in the area for 40 years.
“I’ve seen water in places I’ve never seen before,” Townson said, “and it’s still coming.”
Mahaj Brown, 6, "holed by bullets", survives shooting in Philadelphia
Police say the 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia this week, the second time a 6-year-old child has been shot.
The boy's grandparents identified him for CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.
The grandparents stated that Brown suffered several gunshot wounds, including in the lumbar, leg, arm and abdomen, but that he was conscious during his transport to the hospital.
"He's been through a lot, his little body was riddled with bullets," his grandmother Delores Melendez told the station.
I just can't believe it.
The condition of the boy was classified as critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several surgeries.
The boy's family told the station that he is expected to recover.
He should have started first grade in a local elementary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in Germantown.
Three men were also shot: two at the age of 29 and a 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition; the other two victims are in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The boy was found shot in the front seat of a car along with the 29-year-old, who is in a critical condition, the broadcaster reports.
The other two victims were not in the car and the police are investigating whether one of the injured men could be the perpetrator.
Investigators told CBS Philadelphia that there had apparently been a crossfire between several shooters.
Bullet casings for assault rifles traced back to various assault rifles covered the crime scene.
It seems that this was clearly an ongoing struggle.
On the street, on both sides of the sidewalk, there were sleeves.
So there seems to have been several armed fighters here who were very actively involved," police chief Anthony Ginaldi told the Philadelphia police station.
Several homes and vehicles were also hit in the area.
There were no arrests and police are reportedly reviewing the surveillance video.
On Tuesday, another 6-year-old girl was hit by a crossbar on her arm as she played outside her home in the residential area of West Oak Lane.
She recovers and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That’s what I imagine among the women’s Olympic team in gymnastics for more than one reason.
First of all, I’ve been at every Summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA has never been more dominant.
And secondly, this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who have been inspiring to many young girls of all colors.
The structure of this team, which round out Aly Raisman, who is Jewish, and Madison Kocian, who is Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This team finally reflects the United States.
It has solidified the black and Hispanic female presence at the forefront of this sport.
For the past four years, the number one female gymnast has been an African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were #1 and #2.
This shows strength.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was a surprise Olympic winner and America cheered.
Now the world has been able to witness the incredible performance of triple world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez delivering unexpected yet masterful gymnastics routines.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth heterosexual American to win gold at an individual multi-fight event for women.
Team member Aly Raisman won silver.
We are experiencing the pinnacle of this sport, but this is not what gym classes across the country look like.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all took the same path as Aly and Madison to make it into the Olympic team.
They are the "Last Five" because the next Olympic team will have only four gymnasts on the team, and this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as coach.
But the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport and gymnasts are primarily in private gymnastics clubs maintained by parents who pay for the training, furnishing, travel, clothing, competition and hotel costs (for the coaches and their gymnasts and families).
The majority of these gyms are located in wealthy suburbs that can support the business.
In these clubs, the gymnasts receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment for the families.
Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, have both been training their athletes since they started gymnastics.
We need to give the communities and countless young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie a more affordable and accessible gymnastics training.
I founded my gymnastics foundation of 20 years.
At my events, we offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem to over 15,000 urban youth (especially black and Hispanic) and trained national and international winners.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to provide the youth with high-quality gymnastics that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.
This combination offers lifelong benefits for health, as well as for school and professional success.
It’s the inspiration of this team that gets thousands of young girls interested in gymnastics and that’s great.
It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.
This is such an exciting time.
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real representation of "Girl Power" by getting the Olympic team gold and thank you, got so many young girls with different backgrounds motivated to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
Residents Want to Organize More Strikes After Rejecting Jeremy Hunt's Proposal
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting a reformed contract with the British Medical Association officials, but 58 percent of the 37,000 interns who voted in an election rejected it.
In July, Hunt had revealed plans to forcefully introduce the contract, saying that the NHS was in a “no-man’s land” and any further delay would be detrimental to staff and patients.
The first interns are to receive a new contract that includes changes to night and weekend work to improve care at inhospitable times.
Dr Ellen McCourt, chair of the BMA’s Committee on Resident Physicians, said in a statement last night: “Assistant physicians continue to have serious concerns about the proposed contract, particularly that it will fuel the current workforce crisis and fail to treat all physicians fairly.”
With just eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract, progress needs to be made and time is running out.
Efforts on the part of the BMA to resolve the disputes through talks met with reluctance on the part of the government to participate and sometimes with deafening silence.
This happened to a promise Jeremy Hunt had made just last month that his door would always be open.
"Jeremy Hunt must act now, lift enforcement and address resident doctors' concerns".
If he does not do so, the resident doctors have made it clear that they are ready to carry out further industrial action.
The last strike at the end of April saw a postponement of nearly 13,000 routine surgeries and 100,000 appointments, as nurses and specialists were involved in providing cover to doctors on the picket line.
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the amendments by adopting the reformed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association.
The BMA wants a better weekly pay for the 54,000 interns who will be subject to the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, Director General of the NHS staff, called on the interns to end the strike.
Mortimer said: “Labour action achieves nothing of the few, but strains already overburdened teams and service providers and gives the patients, caregivers and their families only worries, distress and interruption.”
Over the past two months, we have spoken to the board of assistant doctors and responded positively to the concerns about guardianship and whistleblowing with the Ministry of Health and other ministries.
Employers hoped that continued positive engagement on other important issues – such as posting, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning from a work break, training costs, mutual recognition of the curriculum, training leave and the gender pay gap in medicine – was a sign of how serious employers, Health Education England and the Ministry of Health were about compliance with the agreements with the BMA in May.
The <0xC2><0xA3>2-per-day drug that can lower heart attack risk
Thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a <0xC2><0xA3>2-per-day drug after being recommended by authorities to administer this to more people for an extended period of time.
The anticoagulant drug ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease.
The drug is given as early as 12 months after a heart attack, which reduces the risk of stroke or another heart attack.
NHS regulator NICE has recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
NHS regulator NICE has recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Around 140,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer another heart attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulations of fatty material in artery walls that form plaques.
When the plaque breaks apart, it can cause a blood clot that clots the blood flow to the heart, causing a heart attack.
When the blood clot dissolves, it can flow through the blood stream and clot the blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already had a heart attack are at a higher risk of having another.
Ticagrelor, which is manufactured by the British company AstraZeneca and marketed under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots less likely.
NICE’s guidance draft, published today, recommends a 12-month intake of 90mg of ticagrelor, followed by 60mg with a twice-daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Evaluation Center, said: “Despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke – often with disastrous consequences.”
Fear of another heart attack can have a significant negative impact on a person’s quality of life.
Experience shows that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
Through a preliminary recommendation from Ticagrelor, we are pleased to be able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it.
Information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years. The draft guidance does not recommend treatment beyond this period.
Culture of Political Correctness Allows Election Fraud to Bloom in Muslim Areas
Former Mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year at the instigation of a government report on corruption
A culture of political correctness has led to widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities being knowingly ignored, as a scathing government report revealed today.
Former Cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles verbally attacks police, election observers and town halls for ignoring evidence of election abuse due to “ethnic and religious hypersensitivities.”
The former Minister for Integration and Local Government, who is now an anti-corruption king, said that intimidation of voters for religious reasons would be so bad that police should be allowed to set up barrier tapes outside of polling booths to protect intimidated voters.
He recommends that voters should carry an identity card to prove their identity in elections.
At the moment, a voter only has to give his name and address.
The report suggests applying non-removable ink to a person’s finger when they cast their ballot to prevent someone from voting twice.
Whistleblowers should be given more protection, says Sir Eric.
It calls for the press to have more access to community documents and decisions by non-official committees or working groups.
“This not only serves against electoral fraud, but is also intended to protect the municipal government from the broader corruption and financial fraud culture that goes along with it,” he said.
The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of the Tower Hamlets election scandal in east London.
Last year, a special electoral court ruled that acting mayor Lutfur Rahman should be removed from office after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman had “cynically perverted” the religious sentiments of his Muslim community, and that he had silenced his critics with accusations of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman is said to have led his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him.
Up to 300 votes were either doubtful or the result of an imitation in which one person chooses as someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud all over the country.
He was especially alarming about the fraudulent postal vote – in which older members of the Muslim community put pressure on people to vote for a candidate of their choice.
Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean up the electoral system, including keeping IDs to prove identity
“As evidence, pressure has been put on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, to vote according to the will of the elderly, especially communities with Pakistani or Bangladeshi backgrounds.
"There were concerns that... state institutions would have knowingly ignored such behavior due to "politically correct" hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion."
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including banning political activists from editing postal voting records to stop “election harvesting.”
The report, which is being considered by Theresa May, also calls for tougher registration checks to prevent the electoral roll from being used for immigration and social fraud purposes.
Consider options to ask voters for your ID before the election.
Use non-removable ink on a person’s finger once they have cast their vote to prevent someone from voting twice.
Perform systematic checks on a person’s nationality to ensure they are eligible to vote.
A three-year limit on requests for automatic postal voting.
Prohibition that political activists edit complete postal ballots and envelopes of postal ballots.
Give the police the power to set up barriers around election stations.
An amendment to the law that facilitates an indictment of intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983.
Ban on photography at polling stations.
Requirement that only English be used in the polling stations (with the exception of Wales).
Intensification of training to ensure that employees enforce the rule that voters go to the polling booth alone.
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it "astonishing" that no criminal complaint was filed after the Tower Hamlets case.
"The Electoral Court has declared Lutfur Rahman and his deputy unfit to stand trial due to a litany of corrupt and illegal practices," he said.
He was found guilty for a number of reasons, in accordance with the high requirements of the criminal proceedings.
He also criticizes the ineffective "hacking controls" of the election registration departments of the town halls.
Sir Eric said: “Last year’s court ruling in Tower Hamlets was a warning sign.
Our country, as the mother of parliaments, has a proud heritage, but the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and denial by some authorities threaten this good reputation.
Crazy for Kate’s biker doppelganger and other famous doppelgangers from Olympic athletes in Rio
Fans of the 2016 Rio Olympics have fallen out of line this week over French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who has proven to be an impressive doppelganger for the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympian is far from the only gold-fighting athlete this summer who has his own famous doppelganger — at least not if you can believe social media.
In honor of the Rio Olympics and all the famous faces that are currently glimmering on our screens, FEMAIL has created a list of Olympians who are more than just Hollywood celebrities.
The Hunter and the Wolf: U.S. team member in archery Brady Ellison, left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since his childhood
Apart from Kate’s doppelganger on the track, many people on the internet pointed out how a certain archer could be the twin of A-Promi Leonardo DiCaprio.
U.S. archery team member Brady Ellison has caused an onslaught on Twitter after images of him looking eerily similar to the Wolf of Wall Street star surfaced.
In fact, the archer got the craziness on social media and admitted that he has been hearing since childhood that he looks like Leo.
"I don't see much resemblance myself, except for facial hair," Brady told the Huffington Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I'll take that as a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons since London 2012 will undoubtedly come to the fore this year: the burgeoning similarity between British long jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
The Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina with her large, expressive eyes should be able to pass as a double for the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to glee star Matthew Morrison for years.
One step higher: This user believes that Nathan is the "athletic version" of the Inception actor
Another ongoing comparison has been drawn between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who has similarly heavy eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver medalist Yulia Efimova has more than sun-tanned skin and blonde hair than actress Annalynne McCord, while American Nathan Adrian has been attested by fans to resemble an “athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt.”
Strong women: Football star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, right, have a similar face shape and eyes
Not the only one: A Twitter user was very happy that others noticed the similarities too
Theory put into space: According to this user, there may be a reason for the similarity of the pair
A Twitter user explained her satisfaction that “the rest of the internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are nearly identical.”
In fact, American football star Hope Solo and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter have an incredibly similar face shape and eyes.
Other popular comparisons included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to that of actress Laura Linney, as well as the gold medalist in gymnastics Gabby Douglas, who has her own beautiful, wide smile that resembles that of Bring It On Star Gabrielle Union.
CBC commentator for the Olympics apologizes for his statement that Chinese swimmer ‘died like a pig’
Byron MacDonald's analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's fourth place at the Dr 4x200m freestyle swimming relay outraged viewers of the CBC live broadcast of the Olmypian Games on Wednesday
Canadian broadcaster CBC had to apologize after one of its commentators said that the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer “went off like a mief” and “died like a pig” during the race.
Commentator Byron MacDonalds thought his microphone was off when he gave his own opinions at the end of the 4x200m freestyle swim relay.
MacDonald, who had been brought on board the CBS commentary team to add more “color,” could be heard saying, “This little 14-year-old Chinese lost her connection, baby.”
Too excited, went off like a mief, died like a pig.
Thanks for that.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second stage of the swim team 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor jerk, which allowed the Canadians to close the gap to China.
Viewers across Canada reacted quickly online after being shocked by the tone and language
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted, “Did the CBC commentator just say that the 14-year-old swimmer from China ‘died like a pig’?”
The idiot didn't realize they were still on the air."
Ai Yanhan from China was described as follows at the final 4 x 200m freestyle swimming relay for women: "This little 14-year-old Chinese lost her connection, baby."
The criticism against Byron MacDonald on Twitter came quickly and hard, in which many called him up
Twitter users didn’t hold back when they heard how insensitive Byron MacDonald was
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: “Wow, #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and make us all look like racists. #angegelt.
A short time later, Scott Russell, who hosted the CBC broadcast, apologized live for MacDonald's comment, saying, "We apologize for airing the comment about a swim performance."
It was an unfortunate wording, we're sorry it happened."
CBC ended up apologizing more than 90 times to the people who responded to the remark via Twitter
Commentator Scott Russel had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald
CBC copied and pasted its apology to more than 90 other Twitter users who had complained about MacDonald’s comments
The network also quickly apologized and issued a message.
We sincerely regret that these statements have been made and that it has been made possible for them to be broadcast.
We quickly apologized to our viewers on the air last night and to our followers on social media.
To make one thing clear, Byron’s comments related to the swimmer’s performance and not to her as a person.
Still, they were inappropriate and an unfortunate wording, and Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized on the show and tried to justify his comment by stating that it was not his intention that it be interpreted as a personal attack.
"I would like to take a moment to apologize for the comment I made after the women's swim relay on the CBC Olympic broadcast," he said.
"I was referring to the swimmer's performance and not to her as a person."
Of course, no disrespect was intended and I am very sorry."
Shopper in Primark outraged over woman shamelessly trying on underwear in the middle of shop
Buyers didn’t know where to look when a woman took off her clothes in the middle of a Primark to try on underpants.
To make the situation worse, she looked at what she looked like in it, took it off and put it back on the shelf.
She continued to browse and tried on four pairs of underpants at a shop in the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone.
The Primark store at the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone, where the woman tried on the underpants before putting them back on the shelf
A mother of two, Jenny Davidson, who was in the store at the same time, said that after the mysterious woman tried on the underwear, "she put on her clothes again and left the store without buying anything."
She said, "People couldn't believe what they saw."
Standing in the middle of the sales floor, she took a pair of underpants from the display, took off her own tights and pants and tried them on.
"She wasn't even trying to find a more discreet place to do it - she just stood there, cheeky like Oskar."
"Everyone stared as she took off the underpants again, which she obviously didn't like, as she put them back on the shelf."
She repeated the same thing with three more underpants before finally deciding she didn’t like anything, got dressed again, and walked out.
"She didn't seem to mind that she was watching someone - or thinking about the person who might be buying the underpants she had tried on."
Mrs Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said: "How disgusting to think that someone would take home underwear that another person had on and that was not washed."
The incident occurred Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson added, “As I’ve learned, employees have been trying to pull the garments out of the sale after she left – which is just as good.”
"I would hate to go home with a new pair of underpants and find out that another woman was wearing them and took them off again and they weren't washed."
A spokesman for Primark said: "Primark is aware of the incident that occurred on Tuesday, August 9 at our Folkstone branch."
All eligible products have been withdrawn from sale.
How to Protect Yourself from Weapon Attacks with Krav Maga
The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a little safer for you.
We spoke with Rhon Mizrachi, a grandmaster of the Krav Maga Association in New York, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close range.
Regardless of whether you are approached from the front or from the back, this video will show you how to turn the tables for your robber.
When approaching from behind, the first thing you should do is turn around so that you can see your attacker and “get out of the line of fire,” says Mizrachi.
Then grab the weapon between your forearm and shoulder before hitting it in the face with your free elbow.
Then, with your knee in his groin, twist the weapon out of his hands as the attacker curls in pain, and run to his face and move backwards as they point the weapon at him.
In attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the firing line, grab the gun and twist it so that the attacker cannot shoot.
At the same time, shift the weight onto the weapon and hit the attacker on the chest, then twist the weapon out of his grip before they move backwards and point the weapon at him.
Sounds difficult?
Watch the video to see exactly how Mizrachi does it.
But keep in mind that in the event of a robbery, it’s safest to hand over your money – unless you’re a Krav Maga grandmaster.
Traveler Ian Wright scrapes his tongue in Europe’s dirtiest places for a travel guide
A British traveler subjected his immune system and strangulation reflex to a serious test - licking some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.
Presenter and travel writer Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk, scraped his trains on a euro bill, a railing at the Piccadilly Circus, a flushing knob of a train toilet, as well as a public telephone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system.
Before licking each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he will engage in.
But the experiment, filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," brought some surprising results to light.
The thought of licking the flushing knob of a train toilet that has already been used by thousands of others may be completely repulsive, but in fact, there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.
On his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about promoting gut bacteria, as well as his own health.
Fortunately, nothing he licked left more than a bad aftertaste in his mouth.
Mr. Wright became known for testing the resilience of his gut by traveling the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
From public railings at train stations to flush buttons of toilets, the task definitely put his immune system under a test.
“Already as a child I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, soil, worms and muddy water.”
In the film, he lived up to his reputation.
The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.
His test swab showed a luminometer number of over 4000 units.
In comparison, the luminometer number of freshly washed hands is less than 60.
But there was a Russian toilet he refused to lick after her luminometer number was over 4,000 units, while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60
Mr. Wright and Finnish dairy manufacturer Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength", which shows the number of bacteria in various places such as the bathroom
In the film, he says, “This comes close to the worst thing I’ve ever smelled in a toilet.”
There's nothing dirtier than that!
I'm not gonna lick anything here because it's disgusting in here.
"The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with Finnish dairy manufacturer Valio.
The company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamins C and D, to support the promotion of gut bacteria and the immune system.
Valio’s Senior Venice President for Snacks, Juices and New Categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: “We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics.
We did some crazy brainstorming that ended with us saying, "Let's call Ian."
They claim that interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon
Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a larger context – the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health, and how it’s linked to the immune system.
The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information about it in an interesting way.
I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added: “Let me put it this way – I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had licked some of the things I instructed him to lick, such as the disgusting Russian toilet shown in the film.”
Of course, there were things where it was easier to get Ian to lick them and others where this was quite difficult.
I'm glad we shot some of these dirty goodies on film."
In a 2015 survey conducted by Valio, 84 percent of all respondents associated lactic acid bacteria with the well-being of the stomach and intestines in particular, and 58 percent said they use products that contain attached lactic acid bacteria at least occasionally.
A Social Family Destroyed in Saltash, Cornwall
An anti-social family left their social housing after a breakdown with a damage of <0xC2><0xA3>50,000 because they had terrorized their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown from their Saltash, Cornwall property after a long list of complaints.
After being forcibly removed from their property, shocked employees of the housing cooperative found the property in irreparable condition.
The walls had gaping holes, wooden floorboards were torn open, garbage was scattered on the floor and graffiti was smeared on the walls.
The family have been relocated and it is believed that she now lives in a private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, who works for property management at Cornwall Housing, said she fears the apartment could no longer be repaired.
She said: “It was an absolute nightmare for the people here and I don’t think people have to live that way.
There are many things to consider as this property will probably be considered a not so beautiful part of Cornwall.
The family is infamous and so is their reputation.
The couple had three sons living in the apartment in the meantime, and police said the terror inflicted by the family included street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking, and excessive shouting, arguing, and swearing.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, received an order for antisocial behavior in June.
In some rooms of the house, which may be demolished, old garbage was found
In the estate where drugs were traded in the past, the wooden floorboards were torn open
Neighbors said they saw them fighting in the street and had to be called the police on a regular basis
Cornwall Housing forcibly delogged her and her partner from the property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to move out voluntarily.
The deluge was cheered by relieved neighbors who said their lives were made to hell.
One said, "They didn't care about anyone."
We lived next to them for 20 years and it was always bad.
The countless times we tell the police here are incredible.
“We couldn’t sleep this morning.”
We got up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it!
Now that they are finally gone, it will be beautiful.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighborhood Enforcement Manager at Cornwall Housing, said the family had failed to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house to which the police were called at regular intervals for 20 years.
On the overgrown side of the town hall, garbage and old toys were thrown down
He added: “It is a shame that the tenant has failed to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and that of their family, as delodging is always the last step that Cornwall Housing considers.
This was a very difficult case, as the behavior was extreme and her actions had to be terrible for her neighbors to watch.
I appreciate all the work done by my team, the Devon and Cornwall police, and members of the community who approached us courageously and provided us with the information.
I hope that this development will bring comfort to some neighbors and convey the message that antisocial behavior will not be tolerated.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times, but that they were all over 20.
A dirty mattress left on the floor in one of the bedrooms of the house after delogation
Home management workers will now have to clear out piles of garbage surrounding the house
In 2014, police raided the house and found over 70g of cannabis, as well as scales, paraphernalia and <0xC2><0xA3>1,700 worth of cash.
Skeldon received a fine after pleading guilty to possession of a class B drug in commercial intent.
She claimed the money was for a tombstone belonging to her son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After being homeless, it is assumed that Tanya and her partner now live in a private accommodation in Plymouth.
Many of the walls of the house were plastered with graffiti.
Police say they will delocate tenants who don't follow house rules
Angela Crow of the Devon and Cornwall Police Department said the delodging was a clear warning to other tenants who did not follow the house rules.
“This goes to those who think they can behave without self-blame, as well as those who have been harmed by such behavior,” she said.
Devon and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behaviour that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal in panic after a low-flying military jet flies over beach
Sun worshippers in Aveiro, Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
A Portuguese P-3C Orion Air Force plane made an incredible dive
The Air Force stated that it was on a training flight, but insisted that there was no security risk.
This was the moment when frightened tourists start to panic after a low-flying jet crashes over a full beach.
Dramatic video footage showed the military plane flying almost within reach over the sun worshippers on the beach section in Aveiro in northern Portugal.
The holidaymakers sprang up as they understandably began to worry about the noise of the jet engines, without first seeing what was coming to them through the clouds.
The incident happened yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the many holidaymakers who posted videos about the dramatic fly-by on social media, said: “It flew by twice really deep and there was a moment when it looked like it was crashing.”
Nuno Arroja added, “I was just surfing and it felt like the plane was falling down on me.”
Tourists on Aveiro beach were panicked when the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly low
The Portuguese Air Force stated today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and had to fly so low that this was the only way to detect them.
The spokesman said the jet flew slightly lower than usual due to poor visibility caused by nearby wildfires, but the air force insisted that security was not compromised at any time.
Fires have devastated parts of mainland Portugal this summer, killing four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that due to the conditions - heavy fog and fire smoke - the pilot had to fly so low, which limited his view
The aircraft was on a training flight in which the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise
Supercup: Barca with worries against Sevilla
Sevilla - FC Barcelona are fighting on Sunday for the first step to the first title win in the new football season.
The Catalans will face Sevilla in a duel for the Spanish Super Cup, and the second leg will be played at Camp Nou three days later.
The double winner has to compete with the losing cup finalist and reigning European League champion, among others, Neymar, who competes with Brazil in the Olympic football tournament.
Goalie Marc-Andre ter Stegen is also missing.
The German suffered a ligament sprain in the knee during training, which clarified the one-on-one question at Barca at least for the time being in favor of Claudio Bravo.
The Chilean International and Ter Stegen have been vying for number one status in Barcelona for two years.
Coach Luis Enrique waived a clear decision in this respect and left Bravo in the league, but Ter Stegen in the lead in most other competitions.
Before the first competitive game of the new season, the Spanish champion has doubts about the fitness of the team, which was humiliated 4-0 in a test match by Liverpool on Saturday.
Lionel Messi and Co. did not really know how to convince at the 3:2 test against Sampdoria on Wednesday.
Sevilla, on the other hand, have to digest the 2-3 defeat after extra time in the European Supercup against Real Madrid and are aiming for the second triumph at the "Supercopa de Espana".
Barcelona is the record winner in this competition with eleven successes so far.
Ma Long in a league of his own to table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic champion.
The 27-year-old defeated his compatriot and "title defender" Zhang Jike 4:0 (12.5,4,4) in a one-sided final on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro.
Thus, the world-ranking first won the "Golden Grand Slam" with successes at the World Cup, World Cup, World Tour final tournament and Olympic Games.
Bronze went to the Japanese Jun Mizutani.
The two Chinese made it into the final as expected and made the title among themselves.
It was clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese would win the individual title under the sign of the Five Rings.
Last non-Chinese on the top Olympic podium was the former SVS-N<0xC3><0x96>-legionary Ryu Seung-min from South Korea.
Ma and Zhang were left alone at the record, between sets and time-outs they had no coaches with them.
They had retreated to the stands and let their protégés go off on their own in fair competition.
"The matches so far I have played for my country."
“I play for myself in the final,” Zhang said.
After the game, gold and silver medal winners posed with the China flag.
The match itself was unexpectedly one-sided.
Ma only really struggled with his 28-year-old opponent in the first set.
After that, he set the pace at the plate and dropped Zhang from there only a total of 13 points.
The superiority of Ma did not develop the expected rousing match.
Nevertheless, there were enough breathtaking balls to see.
Mizutani won the bronze medal against 40-year-old Vladimir Samsonov 4-1.
The Belarusian had suffered a rib injury in his quarter-final against the German European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov, was then under medical treatment, had to "ultimately" content himself with sheet metal.
By the way, the Swedes Jan-Ove Waldner (38/2004) and Jörgen Persson (42/2008) had become Olympia-fourths in a similarly high table tennis age.
Donald Trump Admits ‘Major Problems’ in Election Campaign
The leadership of the U.S. Republicans is plagued by massive concerns about losing their majority even in traditionally conservative states.
Presidential candidate Donald Trump now admitted weaknesses of his election campaign in the former Republican stronghold of Utah.
A rare moment when the normally cocky and self-assured multimillionaire voiced some sort of concern, correspondents reported.
After dropping 16 rivals within his own Republican camp, doubts are now growing about his success in the fight for the White House.
“We have huge problems in Utah,” Trump told evangelical Christians, who he asked for support in key states like Ohio, Florida, or Virginia.
Blame it on false reports about his candidacy, he resumed his well-known media scuffle.
Republican strongholds wobble
Utah is usually a safe bank for Republicans.
According to a survey conducted by SurveyUSA in June, Trump and his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, were on the same page.
Other institutions see Trump ahead, but not with the distance that is common for Republican candidates in the state.
Arizona and Georgia are also considered to be at risk.
In an interview with CNBC, Trump responded to the question of how he wants to stop Clinton’s advance again: “Just as I have done so far.”
“This will either be successful, or I will have a very nice, long vacation.”
He does nothing but “tell the truth.”
“If it’s not enough for him in the end for reasons of political correctness, that’s fine,” Trump said.
Then I return to a very good way of life.
According to press reports, the Trump party is said to have threatened to cut funds in support of his election campaign if he can not present better poll values.
Instead, they want to support the Republican candidates for Congress more.
Olympia: Dreiste fraud in doping test
The IOC wants to set up a disciplinary commission on the case.
Kenya's athletes are threatened after the second doping affair at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
After a fraud attempt at a doping control in the Olympic village, Kenya has sent a coach home.
The International Olympic Committee announced that it would immediately set up a disciplinary commission to investigate the case.
A Kenyan official had said that the former sprinter and current coach, John Anzrah, had given a urine sample in the Olympic village under the name of the 800-meter runner Ferguson Rotich.
This was reported to the team management of Kenya by the doping controllers.
The IAAF has asked the IOC for information on the case to conduct its own investigations, an IAAF spokesperson said.
"Depending on the results of the investigation and the subsequent actions of the IOC, the IAAF will conduct an assessment," the IAAF said in a statement.
“He (Anzrah) went to the doping control station and pretended to be Ferguson Rotich, gave the trial and signed it,” Kenya’s Chief of Mission Stephan Arap Soi said in a statement.
He was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete who was on the World Anti-Doping Agency’s list of training controls.
Ferguson Rotich had become the world championship fourth over 800 meters in 2015 in Beijing.
Four days earlier, Kenyan athletics delegation chief Michael Rotich had been withdrawn from the Rio games.
He is said to have informed athletes in his country about upcoming doping tests against cash payments.
According to media reports, he was arrested on his return to Nairobi airport.
Kenya has been under special observation at the IOC for a long time after numerous doping offences.
The announcement of the more than 2000 doping target controls launched by the IOC ahead of the Rio Games has unusually previously indicated that athletes from Kenya and Russia in particular are being targeted.
The World Anti-Doping Agency had put a lot of pressure on the African country before the Summer Games in Brazil to create an anti-doping law and a functioning control system.
The law was passed a few weeks before the start of the Olympics.
As a result, WADA removed Kenya from the list of countries whose anti-doping efforts comply with WADA rules.
Kenya is considered a great runner nation.
The country's athletes won the most medals at the 2015 World Championships in Beijing.
In a number of television reports of the ARD, accusations were repeatedly raised that in Kenya doping funds are easily accessible and there should be a significant mentality of sports fraud.
IOC member Richard Pound recently called for a similar investigation in Kenya as he had done in Russian athletics.
It could be proven that this sport was doped extensively and systematically.
Russian athletes were banned from the Summer Games.
Salzburg's "West Side Story" with Cecilia Bartoli
In the year of Shakespeare, the Salzburg Festival presents the "West Side Story" with Tony and Maria as a tragic love couple, similar to Romeo and Juliet.
And then there was Cecilia Bartoli.
A musical conquers Salzburg: the "West Side Story", Leornard Bernstein's masterpiece.
The artistic director Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical to the temple of classical music and fulfilled a childhood dream with the role of Mary.
In the orchestra pit the Sim<0xC3><0xB3>n Bol<0xC3><0xAD>var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel: "This music is full of rhythm", he enthuses.
We always say that it is very Latin American.
There are many Latin American ingredients in their tempo and melody.
It is a wonderful mix, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.
I would say that we really have Bernstein's music in our blood!
In this production Bartoli plays an elderly Maria.
She remembers with melancholy her love for Tony, while the younger Maria plays and dances.
The role of Mary has always fascinated me.
First of all, because it is musically extraordinary!
Then there is Mary’s personality.
She says it in her song: "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and witty and bright".
So she is smart, of course also naive, and very passionate.
“It is very similar to me, my Italian character, which I have as a Roman,” laughs Bartoli.
Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."
It is such an honor to work with her.
She is a tremendously generous person.
And Bartoli returns the compliment: "Dudamel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate!"
Conducting is a necessity for him.
You see it in every one of his movements, in his gaze, it is his life!
It is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him.
We both have a more southern temperament, a fire, a passion and also a cheerful approach to life, that is very important at all!
For the American director Philip Wm. McKinley, the "West Side Story" is highly topical: "This play is about prejudice and fanaticism."
Today we have the refugees, then the Puerto Ricans went to New York, and the New York residents did not want them.
They are the same topics, and they are just as meaningful today as they were then.
59 years later, the piece is still relevant.
London Schoolgirl Who Joined ISIS Killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIS, reportedly died in Syria.
Lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said her family learned of her death a few weeks ago in Raqqa, Syria.
It was suspected that she was killed by a Russian airstrike in Raqqa, the group's stronghold in the country, ITV News reported on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and died, according to her family, shortly after she planned to leave the war-torn country and return to England.
“One can only hope that the only good lies in it — as a reminder and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going to a war zone — to keep people from ever making that decision,” Akunjee said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other schoolgirls from east London boarded a plane to Turkey and then boarded a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultana’s family was told that she married an ISIS fighter in Syria – and within a few months became a widow.
Reid says Clinton will stay with Garland as Supreme Court candidate in case of election victory
Harry Reid, leader of the Democrats in the Senate, is convinced that the Democratic presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton, will nominate Judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court.
Senate Republicans have blocked Garland’s confirmation since his nomination by Barack Obama in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell believes the next president will appoint the successor to the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.
Reid said Thursday during a conference call that he expects Clinton to select Garland "with some degree of certainty."
A Reid spokeswoman later said he had not yet spoken to Clinton about whether she would nominate Garland and he speculated.
He praised Garland, saying Clinton’s team would not cause trouble with a new candidate.
Garland is the U.S. District Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
Raid said Republicans blocked Garland’s nomination are lackeys and aides to Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He also stated that Donald Trump was unsuitable for the presidency.
Treats wants nude calendar for "women and for men"
Treats Magazine is working with photographer David Bellemere to release a 1970s Pirelli-inspired calendar for 2017.
But instead of famous naked people, they want to find the next generation of top models for their 2017 NU Muses Calendar.
Treats editor-in-chief Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his nude magazine was different from old-school playboys because “playboy is for men.”
I do this for women.
Apparently, he thinks the calendar does too.
"We need to return to portraying timeless and classic nudity, where both women and men feel comfortable and inspired by these images of a female body," Shaw said in a press release announcing the release of the calendar.
Women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art.
Models can submit their images online or in person at open casting calls in Los Angeles and New York.
Turkey: Kurdish community expects mass exodus
“Anyone who does not adapt and praises Erdogan is sitting on packed suitcases,” says Ercan Karakoyun, chairman of the Gülen-based Dialog und Welt Foundation.
The Kurdish community of Germany expects tens of thousands of asylum seekers to flee from Turkey to Germany in the short term.
In the medium term, it could even become "a few hundred thousand", believes the association chairman Ali Toprak.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s crackdown following the attempted coup has led the Kurdish community of Germany to expect a mass flight to Germany.
"In the short term, I expect tens of thousands, in the medium term, with a few hundred thousand people seeking protection from Turkey in Germany, if the Erdogan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition," said Ali Toprak, chairman of the association.
Because the government had already overrun Kurdish strongholds with criminal actions months ago, 500,000 Kurds within Turkey are on the run.
After the failed coup, secular and oppositional ethnic Turks would be added.
Many will want to start anew in Europe if they continue to be oppressed in Turkey.
“It cannot be that a state that takes in refugees itself produces refugees in its own country,” Toprak said.
The head of the association complained about the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish, but also in Alevi cities.
Erdogan wants to increase the exit pressure on the remaining Kurds.
"They are the last large minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have been exterminated or expelled in the past hundred years," said Toprak, who is also a member of the CDU.
The head of the federation demanded that the federal government “position itself as sharply as Austria against Erdogan and his supporters”.
In Germany, too, a "witch hunt" against Erdogan critics is taking place.
For the first time in the last few months I no longer feel safe in Germany.
The German branch of the Gülen movement also fears the flight of many Turks abroad.
More Turks will seek asylum in Germany, especially Kurds and opposition members.
The branding as Gülen supporters destroys teachers and other academics' professional existence.
"Those who do not adapt and praise Erdogan are sitting on packed suitcases, by the way, also the kemalists and seculars," Ercan Karakoyun, chairman of the Gülen-related Foundation for Dialogue and Education, told the "world".
As the newspaper reports, citing figures from the Federal Ministry of the Interior, the Turks already placed the largest group of asylum seekers recognized for political persecution in Germany before the coup.
As of June 30, this had been 11,386 people and thus almost 29 percent of all recognized as eligible for asylum (39,625).
In this survey there are not those who have fled from war, poverty or lack of prospects.
Eligible for asylum under the Basic Law are exclusively political, i.e. from the state side, individually persecuted.
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: "Going where it hurts"
Strange Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania: The locals get nothing from the summer election campaign - and the holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to choose the state parliament.
In Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania they understood.
In 2021, the state election will not take place again directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Schwerin Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.
Because it is not stupider than before: summer holidays, heat and state election campaign - that bites itself.
The locals, who are to be convinced by the election campaigners, are on holiday.
The vast majority of holidaymakers who are in the country, traveling on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are not locals, so are not allowed to choose the state parliament.
In addition, there are practical problems: During the holidays, helpers who hang up posters, inflate balloons, distribute flyers and count votes in the end, are only difficult to find.
Until September 4, 2016, the election day and last holiday, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania once again has to endure an election campaign just past the people.
The hot phase, if you can even say that, has just begun.
And it is also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of an SPD/CDU coalition, must fear for his office.
The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in polls.
It will be exciting how much newcomer AfD is doing and what is left in the end suitable for coalition.
Sellering, 66 years old and head of government since 2008, is doing an almost inconspicuous election campaign, one dispenses with his large posters.
He travels through the country, spreads roses and chats a little with the people, just like his legendary and word-for-word predecessor Harald Ringstorff did.
Otherwise, Seelering has got cold feet and blames Chancellor Merkel for the blossoming of the AfD.
Their refugee policy, their “we can do it” has accelerated the rise of right-wing populists, which will probably now cost him the beautiful office.
The CDU and its top candidate, Interior Minister Lorenz Caffier, have already experienced what it is like to campaign in the right place at the wrong time.
She has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to large-scale rallies; Merkel’s Bundestag constituency is located in the northeast.
But the target group was not right, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony than Mecklenburg and Vorpommern.
"There was probably a majority from other federal states," complained Vincent Kokert, general secretary of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, recently in the NDR.
But it is not a pity to anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel.
Otherwise, the Northeast CDU largely dispenses with the usual election campaign booths on marketplaces and in front of shopping centers with umbrellas and balloons.
That, says Kokert, only plays a "subordinate role".
The Union has also noticed that you are crumbling away the base in the countryside, that it has to make a lot of effort to find a connection to the people again.
It is like the Left, the SPD, the Greens: hardly present in the far reaches of the country.
However, the advice of the CDU campaigner Kokert to his fellow campaigners is self-evident: "They must go where it hurts, namely where the people are: village festivals, golden weddings, every birthday party must be used".
Because there is a lot at stake, Sellering has now called his SPD for a particularly committed election campaign.
In polls, the Social Democrats were last with 22 percent behind partners CDU (25) and only slightly ahead of the AfD (19).
In the 2011 election, the SPD had clearly won with 35.6 percent ahead of the CDU (22).
The Greens, a small party with seven percent in the polls, are likely to make the leap into the state parliament.
They turn the need for holidays into a modern virtue and, for the most part, transfer their election campaign to the Internet.
"Online election campaign", the state chairman Claudia Müller calls it.
Otherwise, green campaigners go in search of local voters among holidaymakers.
Silke Gajek, the leading candidate, is curving through the Mecklenburg lakes with a houseboat and finds it also beautiful.
Her impression: "Election leave in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania is not a punishment".
B27 refurbishment: restaurants suffer from closure
There is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is being renovated.
For those responsible for the construction work, which starts at 5.30 a.m. and ends around 8 p.m., there is praise everywhere.
"They made everything pretty jagged," says Elvira Tetzlaff from the jet filling station.
This is a superteam.
There is also no delay.
The construction site could be moved to the south at the beginning of the week at halftime, by the end of October everything should be ready.
There is also praise for the willingness of those responsible for the construction work, for example when it comes to setting up makeshift entrances.
Since the construction site moved south on Monday and the closure of the Aspergstra<0xC3><0x9F>e in Ofterdingen was lifted and thus the connection to Rottenburg exists again, the traffic situation within the town has relaxed.
The citizens can now travel from Ofterdingen on both sides of the B 27 again.
The traffic through the area seems to be going back.
"There were sometimes considerable complaints," says Florian King, deputy head of the head office responsible for the traffic management of the renovation.
The residents of Bachsatzstra<0xC3><0x9F>e, Steinlachstra<0xC3><0x9F>e, Hafnerstra<0xC3><0x9F>e and Weiherrain had to deal with more traffic noise, because many people were looking for sneaky ways and were more familiar with their navigation system than with the signs.
As a result, some trucks became frayed in residential areas.
Since the speed limits were also not observed, the municipality increasingly requested the measuring vehicle from Mössingen.
"There were significant transgressions," says King, who informed himself about the situation on site.
Two to three per minute have already been flashed.
The fastest was 77 km/h in the Tempo 30 zone.
Since the construction site has moved on, however, it has become quieter.
For the business people on the B 27 it is only a small consolation that for customers from Rottenburg the road is now open again.
Business people do not like to look at the cards.
But the fact that the B 27 restructuring has led to slumps in sales for them is clear to anyone who is asked.
However, some are more and some are less affected.
For those who have less to do with the "end customer", i.e. produce for other companies, the refurbishment has hardly any consequences.
At Autohaus Maier, Thomas Sulz also speaks of a "very slight decline", but also admits that of course "the running customer is missing".
The most crowded are the restaurants along the road.
J. Albert Göhner, owner of the Steakhouse, formerly Krone, finds clear words.
It is already threatening to existence.
Not only him, but all restaurants have "hit hard".
The customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil were missing.
We have to be happy about every euro of sales.
He estimates the loss in sales to be "well over 50 percent".
The street renovation had its operation "returned by two years".
Half of his employees were laid off.
If I had a company with 4,000 employees and half of them had been fired, politics would have reacted differently.
Instead, at Göhner’s request for financial compensation, President of the German government Jörg Schmidt replied that the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the situation at B 27.
Göhner knows about other counties where such a thing was handled more generously.
With all the complaints, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist.
After all, the family business has been located here since 1715, it refers to its long history.
He can understand that other regulars now stop by less often because of the complicated traffic management.
If you can't drive here, it's nice somewhere else.
Göhner has no doubt that his regular clients will return after the end of the renovation work.
Despite the crises with BSE and avian influenza, Göhner considers the impact of the B 27 construction work on his clientele to be the biggest crisis his restaurant has experienced in its long history.
Six months of construction, that's brutal.
Laws are constantly being tightened in the name of combating terrorism.
Following the recent attacks, Interior Minister de Maizi<0xC3><0xA8>re is now presenting a thick security package.
But what does a toleration status have to do with terror?
And what does the coalition partner say about all this?
Thomas de Maizi<0xC3><0xA8>re gives the conciliator.
All his proposals are "politically reasonable" for the coalition partner, says the Federal Minister of the Interior at the presentation of his new security package.
They do not overwhelm anyone.
Other, more advanced points would initially be discussed within the parties.
I am also involved in this.
As Minister of the Interior, however, he was interested in results and in a "achievable consensus" within the coalition.
After the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, De Maizi<0xC3><0xA8>re allowed a little time to pass before presenting his conclusions for security in the Republic.
But now they are all the more extensive.
Some things are already known, announced, targeted: That a new security authority should take care of the cracking of encrypted communication is not new.
Nor the fact that Germany has to implement several EU directives on passenger data and gun rights.
The call for more video surveillance and personnel for the security authorities also comes as no surprise.
In part, de Maizi<0xC3><0xA8>re is launching a second attempt at proposals that were not yet possible with the SPD: He wants to criminalize sympathy advertising for terrorist groups and to unbutton the German passport for jihadists with dual citizenship.
"These will be difficult points for the SPD," admits the CDU man.
He nevertheless considers this to be reasonable and does not demand anything that has no chances with the coalition partner anyway.
De Maizi<0xC3><0xA8>re also presents a few new ideas.
They have it partly in themselves: He plans fast procedures for deportations and more possibilities for the detention of people before the deportation.
Refugees who are specifically brought into the country should have their smartphones checked beforehand and disclose social media accounts for a security check.
In the case of tolerations for rejected asylum seekers, he wants to put some even worse than before - such as those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers in order to disguise their identity.
Some of them are politically and legally sensitive.
Some things also seem unexplained and leave questions open.
And on some points - in the unequal treatment of the patient, for example - the question arises: what does this actually have to do with security and terror?
Yes, says de Maizi<0xC3><0xA8>re, it is important to differentiate between the issues of refugees and terror.
But it cannot be denied that the attackers of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.
In addition, many people were concerned about security in view of the high numbers of refugees.
And things that occupied people deeply, could not be excluded even in election times.
Internal security has become a huge focus.
First the attacks in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.
Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.
The uncertainty is great.
And yes, there are election campaigns.
The Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly taking a stand on the issue of internal security.
In recent days, there has been a lot going on between the two parties.
First a gruesome dispute over the equipment of the federal police, then about a collection of ideas on security policy by some Union interior ministers, in which the heads of the department also demand a ban on burqas and a departure from dual citizenship.
De Maizi<0xC3><0xA8>re is also struggling here for conciliatory tones.
He does not think of a departure from the double pass.
We have pacified the discussion in Germany.
Reopening them doesn’t make sense.
In the case of a burqa ban, he has constitutional concerns.
Whether his own package is constitutional at all corners and whether it is actually "reasonable" for the coalition partner, has yet to be revealed.
There's a lot in there that could cause a fight.
But the SPD is also currently trying to make a name for itself when it comes to internal security.
Party leader Sigmar Gabriel signals a cautious willingness to talk and says: "The SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further increase security".
Volkswagen is still going strong.
Despite diesel scandals, the number of deliveries worldwide is increasing.
However, not all markets run smoothly.
In the recall, there is a buzz about a term.
Volkswagen is starting the second half of the year with a more restrained start to deliveries.
Europe’s largest car manufacturer has continued to show a plus in the course of the year despite the diesel affair thanks to its many brands and some well-running markets.
But in July, the core brand VW weakened above all in Western Europe and thus again weighed on the total sales, as the company listed in the Dax announced.
With 449100 cars, the VW brand sold 1.8 percent fewer vehicles worldwide in July than in the same month of the previous year.
In Western Europe alone, the second most important market after China, sales were 14 percent down on the same month last year.
In the home market of Germany, deliveries fell by almost one-sixth.
Brand sales manager Jürgen Stackmann attributed the weaker figures from July to two fewer sales days in Europe.
In addition, in some core markets, there has been a “change in the economic framework” of a purchase restraint.
In addition to the situation surrounding the attempted coup in Turkey, the British vote to leave the EU has also weighed on, said a spokeswoman.
In the USA, where the exhaust gas affair first escalated, there is also a minus.
Big support for VW is the Chinese market.
Overall, the mainly affected house brand in Lower Saxony is still slickly affected by the diesel scandal anyway: After the first seven months, only a drop of 0.9 percent to 3.37 million vehicles is recorded.
Group sales manager Fred Kappler continued to show sales growth from January to July.
Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles during this period, with 5.904 million vehicles delivered worldwide.
Volkswagen had manipulated exhaust tests with a software.
In Germany alone, VW is calling for around 2.5 million cars to be converted into workshops.
In the course of the conversion, VW confirmed that the conversion of the cars has no negative effects.
After the conversion of the vehicles, there is no deterioration in terms of fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power.
The car manufacturer issued the customer a "guarantee-equal" certificate after the conversion, but did not speak of a "guarantee", as it was said on Friday in corporate circles.
The reason is legal finesse.
The "Focus" had reported that Volkswagen now provides its German customers with a guarantee for converted diesel models.
This was confirmed by VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport last Monday.
The Department of Transportation confirmed that this meeting had taken place.
"VW has to fully comply with the requirements of my commission of inquiry and the KBA."
"Deviations from this will not be accepted," said Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), according to the ministry.
VW has assumed the guarantee that there will be no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power after the conversion and that all vehicle values relevant to type approval will remain unchanged.
Volkswagen itself does not use the term "guarantee", as it was called in corporate circles.
With the broad term "guarantee", Volkswagen sees the possibility that customers, for example, come to a workshop with engine damage six months after the conversion - and this could be attributed to the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it.
In the interest of the customer, it is also important to avoid any other damage that has nothing to do with the exhaust gas scandal to cause uncertainty regarding possible warranty regulations, as it was said.
That is why VW does not use the term "guarantee".
Raiffeisenbank Gmund am Tegernsee is demanding punitive interest from wealthy savers in the future - as the second institute in Germany.
Bank chief Josef Paul said on Thursday: “It’s only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros in current or overnight money accounts.”
The Federal Association of German Banks speaks of an individual case and sees no signal in it: normal savers would “not have to fear to pay for their savings interest.”
If banks store money overnight at the European Central Bank (ECB), they have to pay their 0.4 percent penalty interest.
Raiffeisenbank Gmund will recover this fee from private and corporate customers from September for deposits over 100,000 euros in current or overnight money accounts.
“The first $100,000 is free.”
“The next 100,000 will cost 400 euros a year in the future,” Paul said.
For some time now he has kept 40 million euros, which could be withdrawn from one day to the next and which he could not exploit.
“They are in my central bank account and cause a cost of 0.4 percent,” he said.
"I can't lay down $4,000 for every million."
He now passes on the costs according to the polluter pays principle.
Simply leaving the cash in the vaults of the Raiffeisenbank would be far too dangerous: "I've already experienced four robberies, I don't want the fifth one!" said the bank's board.
Most clients had understanding and switched to other forms of investment.
Only a few went to other banks.
The Bavarian Cooperative Association said: “The ECB’s extreme monetary policy stance is causing significant costs for all banks.”
Wearing them alone is "permanently impossible in business terms".
Some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account management, credit cards or bank transfers.
The Thuringian Volks- und Raiffeisenbank Altenburger Land made headlines with its Skatbank branch in 2014 with penalty interest for deposits of three million euros or more.
Michael Kemmer, chief executive of the banking association, said: "We do not expect private customers to have to pay fees for deposits across the board, for which the competition in Germany among banks and savings banks is far too strong."
One banker said there was “a clientele on Lake Tegernsee who is a bit more lavishly endowed with wealth.”
"That can be a problem for a small bank" if they keep money for free.
The cooperative bank Gmund, founded in 1911, has branches in Bad Wiessee, Rottach-Egern, Kreuth and Tegernsee.
The region is home to well-known actors, athletes and entrepreneurs.
The Cooperative Association of Bavaria "at the moment no other banks are known, which charge a reimbursement of expenses for deposits of private customers," said spokesman Ernst.
Uwe Fröhlich, president of the Federal Association of German Volksbanken and Raiffeisenbanken (BVR), declared at the end of June: "The threshold to go negative towards the private customer is very, very high".
The competition is fierce, and it threatens the migration of investors to the competition.
Customers in Germany will not accept this in the broadest sense.
Destination records: who actually buys records?
Lonely middle-aged men love records.
Before you rush to the comment section to see it with harsh insults under the pseudonym NichtAlleEinsamm<0xC3><0xA4>nnerMittleren Alter, this statement is derived from current data.
According to YouGov, the much-discussed resurgence of records is not due to a boom in millennials who want to welcome the news of physical items, but to midlife nostalgia.
Those who have recently purchased a record are likely to be between the ages of 45 and 54.
In fact, the 18-24 age group is the most unlikely buyer group.
It’s also not a horde of hobby collectors – it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers are more likely to keep their feelings to themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).
But are the results of YouGov correct?
If this blog were a news report on TV, the camera would follow me as I walk in the middle of a busy street in Soho, wear a modest gray suit, and gestulate wildly before I stop, hold my hands, and say something definite like, “Well, let’s take a closer look at it.”
So, let's take a look at it.
Even though the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm – hotels, restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings that once housed independent sellers – there are still a handful of fantastic record stores.
I would probably ask the cameraman to turn off the camera for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such business and try to assess their age and mind by observation.
Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I follow from Sister Ray (data count: two young women, three middle-aged men) into Reckless Records (data count: eight middle-aged men, a woman, probably around 20), is out for a day because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.
Is he a collector, I ask?
"I guess so," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These records, pictured above (he emailed me the snapshot, I didn’t follow him home), dress up the walls of his living room.
The reason he owns such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his disposable income: he is now able to buy records he couldn’t afford when they appeared and re-buy items he sold when he was young and broke.
"A lot of things I buy are from the late '60s, early '70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12, things that I was probably a little too young to buy," he says.
He agrees that those who buy records are more introverted and like to spend time alone, adding, “I don’t smoke and I don’t drink very much.
That's my truck.
Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many customers he meets apply to the YouGov profile.
However, he has also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media hype, people who have heard about the comeback and see themselves prompted to buy their old records again.
From the conversations I had, people usually got rid of their collection around 1998 or 1999.
Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their records again," he says.
That would explain the boom in fans of the record revival of a certain age.
But what about the supposed emotional meaning of records?
It only takes a few seconds in a store like Phonica to realize that record stores offer a reassuring community of like-minded people.
According to Wez, some of the older customers took offense at the contactless payment system.
Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar record sleeves, objects that evoke happy childhood memories.
“I think sometimes it can be filling a void or possessing material possessions as some kind of comfort,” Wez says.
This is the case with me as a collector and I think it is the case with many people.
It’s an easy way to engage mentally.
"We're like their social workers!" an employee whistles from a pile of records.
A survey by the ICM in April revealed that nearly 50% of people who bought a record last month haven’t listened to it yet.
The survey also found that 41% own a turntable they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record don’t own a turntable.
At this point in the news report, I would probably look very worried as I scroll through a stack of Bossa Nova compilations.
Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (data count: three middle-aged men), has noticed a “trophy aspect” of the revival.
"Someone just came in here recently and said, 'I don't have a turntable, but I'd like to buy a Radiohead record so I can put it on the shelf,'" he says.
This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.
More product-heavy, less music-heavy.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
These are younger people, not older ones, who are slowly coming in.
Fopp, who has devoted almost an entire floor to the records, has a more colorful audience than I go in.
There are couples around 70, tourists taking photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
Even if the atmosphere is a little less relaxed than in the aforementioned stores – Wild Beast’s latest synthesizer and sex-packed pop instead of experimental jazz is booming out of the speakers – it’s good to see such diversity among customers.
None of them look particularly lonely, but gnawing psychological trauma is hard to detect when standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been walking around the store for a few minutes looking at the variety of records for sale.
She makes a window shopping rather than a bulk purchase.
She doesn’t earn much, so collecting records isn’t a real option, she says.
It costs a lot.
It's easy to listen to music from a computer or any other way, but the beauty of records is..." she drifts off with a sigh in love.
I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.
My last stop is a store that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: Urban Outfitters.
While I give the appearance of patterning the jeans hot pants, I watch a group of young teenage girls group around Polaroid cameras for a moment before a father and daughter consider buying a Crosley turntable.
To the left is a staircase, a wall full of records by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics that are essential records for an average collection.
No one looks at them – perhaps because they are purely decorative, some so high up that it’s impossible to touch them.
It is pure "plate art".
But given that each attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and send some customers to the depths of Soho for more, there’s nothing to complain about.
It’s no surprise that a population that has more time and money than others is also the one that spends the most on luxury items like plates.
Even though my research found that YouGov’s results were correct, they do not take into account, at least in record stores in Soho, the large number of female collectors and record lovers who exist in reality, record stores and online forums.
These people probably work hard at school or in offices.
They certainly don’t spend their Thursday morning strolling through Berwick Street record stores and flipping through records while avoiding the staring gaze of a creepy 30-year-old false presenter who’s hanging over the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
The Greenland shark is the longest living vertebrate - video report
Scientists say the Greenland shark has the longest life span of any vertebrate on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studies sharks, says the record was set by a female who is thought to be between 272 and 512 years old and five meters long.
French court rejects offer over demolition of shops in jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais to tear down dozens of makeshift shops and restaurants in the Calais jungle, where thousands of refugees live.
At a court hearing this week, authorities in Calais argued that the state should be empowered to tear down 72 makeshift shops where people within the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer hairdressing services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in makeshift restaurants.
The Prefecture of Calais argued that these places should be demolished because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which posed a fire and sanitation risk.
Humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important because the free meals offered by the state-backed association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.
They also argued that the makeshift shops and restaurants would often provide accommodation and free meals for people in need.
A Lille court ruled that there was no legal basis for expelling people who run the 72 makeshift businesses, but acknowledged that the concerns of the Calais prefecture were “absolutely comprehensible.”
Judge Jean-Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Molla said that the grocery stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much greater role than simply feeding people who “live in extremely precarious conditions.”
He said the areas provide quiet meeting places between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places threatened by the teardown was the camp’s Jungle Book Kids’ Café, which is run non-profit and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes, as well as advice on asylum matters for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed the petition to save the Kids’ Café.
In a letter to the Guardian, it said that the closure “would be a disaster for these children, the youngest of whom are eight years old.”
The two aid organizations Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle camp had risen to over 9,000 people - the highest number to date - after a steep increase in new arrivals over the course of the summer.
Despite Olympic disappointment, Martin remains combative
Despite his disappointing appearance in the Olympic time trial, professional cyclist Tony Martin does not want to let himself get lost.
“I keep an eye on the World Cup, remain confident and continue to fight,” the 31-year-old wrote on Facebook on Thursday before leaving Rio de Janeiro.
He has no explanation for his miserable twelfth place at Sugar Loaf.
“To be honest, I find it difficult to comment on yesterday’s time trial,” Martin said.
He had to calmly analyze the reasons for the debacle.
At the time trial World Cup in October in Qatar, Martin actually wanted to fight for the title.
“I’m going to look at everything that we’ve changed recently.”
"That includes my position," wrote the three-time time trial world champion, who had lost more than three minutes to Olympic champion Fabian Cancellara (Switzerland) on Wednesday on the 54.5 km.
Olympia: Tennis pro Siegemund misses semi-finals
The victory of Laura Siegemund ended in the quarterfinals of Rio: the world-ranked 32nd from Metzingen missed by a 1:6, 1:6 against Monica Puig (Puerto Rico/WTA-Nr.
34) the semi-finals of the Olympic tennis tournament clearly.
Siegemund, who was plagued by back problems, could only perform her serve once and seemed powerless compared to the previous rounds.
On Thursday, Angelique Kerber (Kiel/No. 2) still had the chance to jump into the preliminary round.
The Australian Open winner met the British Johanna Konta (No. 10).
Tommy Haas was the last German professional tennis player to win a silver medal in Sydney in 2000.
Two German DTB starters in the quarter-finals of the summer games had last existed in 1992.
Never before has a German duo been in an Olympic single semi-final.
Group joins start-up for live video game transmissions
Watching other people play video games is a huge trend – Microsoft wants to benefit from that too.
The technology group buys the start-up Beam, which specializes in this hobby.
How much money is going to flow for the acquisition, Microsoft said on Thursday.
Beam didn’t launch its offering until January and already has more than 100,000 users.
You can watch others play, but you can also intervene yourself.
For example, they can give up missions to players and face enemies, as well as provide equipment.
Activision Blizzard is launching a new HD video service for the booming world of esports.
On the way to the global media event, Facebook should help.
The advertising industry is already listening.
Employees at the startup, which is based in Seattle, Washington, are moving to Microsoft headquarters in Redmond, California, Beam co-founder and CEO Matt Salsamendi said.
For the customers, nothing should change as a result of the takeover.
According to Microsoft, Beam will be integrated into the video game department around the Xbox console.
The market for live streaming of video game activities is currently growing rapidly.
Well-known platforms are Twitch and YouTube Gaming.
Twitch was bought by online retailer Amazon in 2014 for nearly a billion dollars.
YouTube Gaming is part of the Google parent Alphabet.
Here comes the enforcement trailer
Germany’s racers have to adapt to the next generation of speedometers: In various federal states, including Hesse and Brandenburg, new flash units are being tested, which are supposed to transfer speed sensors particularly effectively.
The futuristic-looking enforcement trailers of the company Vitronic from Wiesbaden can be used, for example, at accident centers, where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police.
For example, at motorway construction sites or bridges to be renovated with a temporary speed limit, there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure compliance with the speed limit with a stationary speed camera.
However, a permanent mobile setup can be too dangerous or time-consuming.
The enforcement trailer is self-sufficient: its battery lasts for five days during continuous measurement operation, the case data is transmitted in encrypted form via a modem.
Laser measurement technology can also be used to capture all vehicles over several tracks simultaneously.
Variable speed limits as well as transit bans by time, lane and vehicle class can also be monitored.
According to the manufacturer, the trailer can be moved up with any car with a towbar.
So that it is not simply stolen, it is lowered during measurement operation, so that the wheels disappear in the armored and incidentally also bullet-proof outer shell.
In addition, a built-in alarm system is supposed to protect the speed camera from vandalism.
According to Vitronic, the trailer has been tested in various federal states since 2015 and is now also used.
Foreign authorities are also flashing with the new technology: Recently, France has reordered 100 pieces, after an order of 150 pieces last year.
Great Britain takes silver in 7-er rugby after Fiji Masterclass takes gold
Britain’s impressive 7-er rugby performance came to an abrupt halt at the final hurdle in the form of the Fijis in the final on Thursday evening, when they were beaten 43-7 at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji gave a master class in handling, side-stepping, trailing, line running and raw power to win gold – their first Olympic medal of any color.
The defeat was sweetened by the not too bad consolation prize of the silver medal - Britain's fourth on that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament, beating New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The clear defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-finals on the same day could fall back on them in the final.
But regardless of that, Fiji would have beaten a 15-man team at its best in this form.
It could be a consolation for GB – but probably won’t – that at least one Briton will have a gold medal around his neck tomorrow: Fiji’s head coach Ben Ryan, the former head for England from Wimbledon.
GB had a tough road ahead of them.
Eight years ago, they lost every game in the Adelaide Sevens under Ryan.
They only lost one here.
This slump will hurt, but the progress is amazing.
Fiji started wonderfully and let the attacks of GB bounce off out of fun.
It felt to Captain Tom Mitchell and Co. as if you were walking on moving buses. The World Series winners went 5-0 up when Osea Kolinisau tacked over in the corner.
With four minutes left in the game, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner, which he converted.
12-0 and GB barely touched the ball.
An excellent tackle from Mitchell stopped the mountain from man Leone Nakarawa to score a third goal, but it only stopped Fiji.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua left a touchdown in the right corner and it was 0-17 for GB.
Nakarawa added a new one since the restart and there was still over a minute of play ... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou pushed through more weak tackles of the GB team and stormed to the line to score.
The conversion brought a 29-0 to the break.
It’s as if Fiji was born to play the 7 while GB is still learning.
That's the way it is.
GB made fundamental changes at halftime and closed the Fijian gap...for a full four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half, until Joshua Tuisova went through after a brilliant intermediate play of Fiji.
Dan Norton started a try for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game has long been in favor of the South Sea Islanders, whose fans sang, waved flags and danced in the stands.
It was not difficult to admire Fiji’s playful approach.
Mata Viliame made the icing on the cake with another attempt in the last few seconds.
The whistle sounded, the Fijis hugged each other and GB kicked a crushing blow in the grass.
Earlier that day, Fiji had defeated Japan 20-5 in the semi-finals and Britain forced South Africa out of the race in a close semi-final match - Britain's conversion of the difference.
Kyle Brown brought the Boks forward in the first half, but Dan Norton broke through the line with an impressive footwork and scored a goal under the post in the second half.
A brilliant late tackle from Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-Aside team, secured the win - and thus the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired to rowing victory through battle with coach’s cancer
There will be no more emotive gold than at these games and that means something.
From the first rowing stroke to the last, 220 hard hives that go down in history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.
Even though it was just the two of them who were at the helm, there were three voices in the boat, the echo of trainer Robin Williams, who was omnipresent as they rowed for the second Olympic gold in a row in the two-man race without a helmsman, the first women in the history of British sport to set such a standard.
Their dominance was absolute, after all, their 39th undefeated effort, which is also unprecedented.
What we see are two brilliant athletes gliding across the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the nature of triumph to its fullest.
Behind every gold in rowing is a battalion of willing helpers who contribute to the incremental advances that make the difference, and there was no one more helpful than the trainer, who 30 months ago didn’t know if he would even survive that day when he was diagnosed with cancer.
Like he said, he was risky.
I had bladder cancer that is operable and they did.
If you don’t, it spreads everywhere.
It would have been a pretty bad situation.
It changes the outlook a bit.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio were lucky enough to start his treatment in early 2014, off-season, which kept the break to a minimum, if that’s the right term at all under such circumstances.
I needed money, so I had to get better soon.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and walking around the station – 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said some steps would suffice.
That's how it starts.
Rowing itself is a challenge, but that makes it an even bigger one.
In the immediacy of victory, her first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nerve-wracking morning talking a little more than usual and trying to process his own fears.
Stanning, who was a captain in the Royal Artillery Regiment in an operation in Afghanistan, said "I was an emotional wreck this week. This may be a bit extreme, but it means so much."
It just repeats how much that means to me, how much I and Helen and Robin have worked.
It's been three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be anyone, so a massive thank you goes to him. He's the best coach in the world.
I couldn’t have asked for a better coach or a better coach.
Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race in the last five years.
The pair had a hard rhythm that their opponents could not keep up with.
Even in the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to catch up, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.
We were very caught at the moment.
Helen yelled, "Stay in the process, stay in the process."
It is really important not to get carried away.
We had a good start and at the same time we were not looking to do anything great.
We didn’t want fireworks today, we just wanted to get a good result, go out and win the race, which we did.
The couple will take time off for a year before making decisions about their future.
Glover is due to appear at a wedding next week, her own with TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn’t want to say that this was my last race.
That would have meant too much pressure.
In London, it took about six months to realize that I am an Olympic champion.
It was all so new to me and I was so stressed out.
Here it took about four minutes.
It feels so much better," she said.
31 years of exemplary clarity
The managing director of the water purpose association "Veitensteingruppe", Ruppert Göller, is retiring.
The association is considered "Bavarian-wide exemplary".
A small Franconian drinking water association as a model for the large water producers.
Some time ago, it was said in the original tone in a contribution by the Bavarian Radio.
A short time later, the Water Forum of the government of Lower Franconia paid tribute to the special purpose association.
The work of the Veitenstein Group was considered "exemplary throughout Bavaria".
Behind all this is Rupert Göller, who was a member of the special purpose association for 31 years, 28 of which were managing directors.
He was retired at the age of 65.
The drinking water association of the Veitensteingruppe, based in Kottendorf, municipality of Breitbrunn, annually promotes about 150,000 cubic meters of water and supplies 32 villages and hamlets with about 5500 inhabitants.
Its member municipalities are Kirchlauter, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the city of Baunach.
There are water supply contracts for other cities and municipalities.
The current chairman, Breitbrunn’s mayor Gertrud Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert Göller was hired as a water manager in 1985 and was already appointed managing director of the special purpose association in 1988.
“His duties have been very diverse and they ranged from water pipe construction and maintenance work to office and organizational activities, budgeting, calculation of fees and contributions, and emergency operations on weekends,” the chairperson said.
As outstanding events, she mentioned the commissioning and inauguration of the new wells (1994), land purchases in the area of the new wells (1998) and compensation of farmers, the renovation of the high tanks (1999), the new acquisition of a central computer control (2004) and the partial renewal of water pipes.
There has been no standstill and innovations have been added time and again, because water means life and drinking water is the most important food.
In her laudation, she praised Göller’s faithful, reliable and correct service over 31 years.
He has devoted a lot of his life to his water purpose association and he has literally lived the water purpose association as if it were his own company.
A few weeks ago, as a real practitioner, he was allowed to present the success concept of the Veitenstein Group for nitrate reduction in front of the Water Forum of the district of Lower Franconia.
For this he received a lot of recognition and praise.
Rupert Göller, for his part, praised waterman Alfons Griebel, who had worked with him for 28 years.
He is the best water warden and he was a faithful squire.
Together we were an unbeatable team.
From his point of view, he described the construction of wells and the restructuring of the special purpose association as highlights.
The biggest challenge and the most difficult task, however, were the pipe breakage at the high tank near Kirchlauter on 3 January.
Here, at minus 17 degrees, it was necessary to work the whole night so that the villages could be supplied with water.
Even the supply of Neubrunn could once only be maintained, because the high tank from Pettstadt was filled with hoses.
The management of the drinking water association was handed over to Daniel Stürmer from Lauter, who succeeds Rupert Göller.
Soprano Anna Netrebko openly deals with her son Tiago’s autism – and turns to other affected parents: “You must have the courage to talk about it.”
"Medicine has made great progress," the 44-year-old told the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera.
When her son was diagnosed with the disease, she believed she had to die.
But the now eight-year-old Tiago has made good progress and is now learning privately in New York, where there are the best therapists.
“To give an example, if I ask him something that happened two years ago when I was singing at La Scala in Milan, he doesn’t remember anything,” Netrebko said.
But he is the happiest man on earth.
Tiago comes from Netrebko's connection with the bass baritone Erwin Schrott.
She is now married to the tenor Yusif Eyvazov.
Relationship statistics in Bargteheide - Man shoots at life partner
A 35-year-old man shot his partner on Friday at around 10.45 a.m. in an apartment building in Bargteheide (Kreis Stormarn) and fatally injured her.
"The man himself called us and stated that he had shot his partner," a police spokeswoman said.
The perpetrator was on the run, after which he was publicly searched.
Meanwhile nationwide, because Sven S. could be traveling by car.
The man is about 1.80 meters tall, muscular, tanned and has a bald head.
Meanwhile, the police have released a photo of him.
However, it is a few years old.
Meanwhile, the man is wearing a bald head.
The man should not be addressed directly.
He could still carry the gun with him, according to the police.
Anyone who sees Sven S. should call the 110.
The police are talking about a “relationship”.
The victim was born in 1988 and the perpetrator in 1981.
The responsible police in Lübeck initially did not want to provide any information about the course of events or the relationship between the perpetrator and the victim, but they confirmed that a person had been killed.
"It's a homicide."
"We're not saying anything more at the moment," said a police spokeswoman in Lübeck.
According to eyewitnesses, a Special Operations Command (SEK) was at the scene.
Stahl - Lichtblick for the German steel industry
The crisis-ridden and energy-intensive German steel industry is spared additional costs amounting to millions.
Financial burdens that threatened the industry from the green electricity promotion are off the table.
It remains in the exemption from the renewable energy surcharge at the existing plants for so-called self-generated electricity production in the German steel industry, said Federal Minister of Economics Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" (WAZ, Friday edition).
"I'm really glad that we were finally able to achieve this after two years of tough negotiations."
The European Commission had therefore initially planned to ask the steel producers that use gases from the blast furnace for electricity production for their own consumption.
According to the German industry association, the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year.
Gabriel told the WAZ that there is now a principle agreement with the EU Commission after talks with competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager.
Only when the generators in the steel plants are replaced, an EEG surcharge of 20 percent will apply.
But this is also not raised in the steel industry.
IG Metall welcomed Germany’s agreement with the EU Commission on self-generation.
This largely establishes the status quo of the previous regulation.
Gabriel’s successful efforts for the steel industry are of particular importance.
"In terms of our 'steel is the future' campaign, this is a first step."
“More must follow.”
"Climate and employment targets must also be weighed up in the reform of the emissions trading system," said IG Metall CEO Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt.
The steel industry in Europe has been suffering from overcapacity and considerable price pressure since the 2008 financial crisis.
Last year, the situation worsened further when the world’s largest producer country, China, threw massive amounts of steel onto the world market in response to weakening domestic demand.
European manufacturers accuse Chinese steel companies of dumping prices.
Over the course of this spring, the situation has relaxed a bit.
On the one hand, import duties imposed on imported steel show an effect, on the other hand, the economic prospects in China have brightened.
It is unclear how sustainable the price recovery is.
German industry leader Thyssenkrupp remained cautious on Thursday.
In the past, prices had stagnated again.
The industry is responding to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.
Thyssenkrupp did not want to rule out closures of individual plants.
The German steel industry employed around 86,000 people at the end of 2015.
In July, German steel manufacturers remain cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders.
At 3.4 million tonnes, they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the same month last year, the Stahl business association announced on Friday.
After a short increase in May, the amount produced has now declined for the second month in a row.
Since the beginning of the year, production has been two percent lower than in the previous year.
The association anticipates an increase in output in the coming months thanks to an improved order situation.
Community, Mind, Health: Singing is Good for Seniors
Ursel Kipp has accompanied singing her whole life: as a young girl she was in the school choir, she studied music as a teacher, and today the 78-year-old sings in a senior choir.
“Singing moves me – emotionally and physically,” she describes.
After a rehearsal, she feels balanced, happy, and more alive overall, she says.
In addition, she is doing something good for her health and her spirit.
Because singing is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler of the German Senior League.
Most seniors sing in choirs and share the joy of music with like-minded people, Hackler describes.
By being together regularly, seniors can establish and maintain social contacts.
Because social and family structures often dissolve in old age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.
Ursel Kipp has also made this experience in her choir: "To be able to agree and organize, to be able to rely on the others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of togetherness".
Singing can be exhausting in a positive sense, says Hackler.
This is because seniors train a deep and controlled breathing.
Those who regularly demand their lungs do not get out of breath so quickly in everyday life.
Even when it comes to preserving the sound of the voice in old age, singing is an optimal hobby.
Singing often has a very special effect on older people, says Ursula Lenz of the Federal Association of Senior Citizens’ Organisations.
In the older generations, singing together had a much higher priority, it was part of everyday life, both in school and in leisure time, she explains.
Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs awakens many memories in older people, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.
Through lyrics and especially melodies, even people with dementia recall long-standing events.
When singing, a special performance is also required of the head, explains Lenz.
Concentrating on one’s own voice and on a predetermined rhythm while adapting to the other singers is a big cognitive challenge.
Especially older people who live alone practice not only focusing on themselves.
Another positive aspect is the recognition you get from singing in the choir, says Hackler.
An enthusiastic audience is a great compliment.
Self-esteem also grows through singing in the choir.
To show myself: If I practice for a long time for something, I get better and grow beyond myself - this experience strengthens.
There are plenty of good reasons to start singing.
If you want to try a new hobby, do not hesitate - even if you think you have little talent, Lenz advises.
You don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who hears when a tone goes wrong?
In search of the right offer, seniors have different options, Hackler says.
If someone from the circle of acquaintances sings in a senior choir, you can simply join.
Many cities also offer overviews of the choirs in the area.
If you want to sing in a church choir, you can contact the church or the church leader directly.
Many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet.
If you do not have access to the Internet, you can ask your family, friends or neighbors for help with your Internet research.
If you feel like singing, you should definitely join a choir, Hackler advises.
Singing is good for the soul and has something liberating - this applies to every age.
Cats are more sensitive than cats to the cries of young animals
Biologists in Hanover have investigated the effect of calling kittens on adult animals.
To their surprise, the meowing did not leave the males cold - however, in contrast to the females, they always behaved the same.
Female cats can detect the excitability of kittens at the meow of the little ones.
They react ten percent faster to sounds of kittens who think they are in great distress, as scientists from the University of Veterinary Medicine and the Hannover Medical School (MHH) have found.
Cats also respond to the calls of kittens - but always the same.
"Apparently, the acoustic differences between the meowing of less and highly excited young animals are either imperceptible or irrelevant for the males," said biologist Wiebke Konerding of the MHH.
She is the first author of the study, which was published this Friday in the journal "BMC Evolutionary Biology".
In a previous study, the research team had already found that the duration and pitch of the kitten screams differed with the urgency of their need for help.
A total of nine adult tomcats and eight female kittens from MHH’s animal husbandry were observed.
On the one hand, they were played by little ones who were taken out of the box for three minutes and separated from their mother and siblings.
On the other hand, they were confronted with cries of more excited kittens, which were additionally lifted up.
The researchers consider their results to be meaningful despite the small sample size.
“All the females, even those who didn’t have their own offspring, responded to the screams in a differentiated way,” Konerding said.
They turned to the speaker more quickly when the calls of the much more excited kittens played.
This ability may be congenital or develop with sexual maturity.
"One surprise was that the males even responded," the biologist said.
In the past, scientists have repeatedly studied the reactions of women and men to baby sounds in humans.
Also, some studies showed that women reacted more sensitively to infants, regardless of whether they were already mothers or not, reported biologist Marina Scheumann.
Podolski's "Gala" to win the Super Cup
Hakan Sükür is a football legend in Turkey.
In Turkey, an arrest warrant has been issued against the former football star Hakan Sükür.
He is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
For the first time since the coup attempt, an important football game is taking place in Turkey.
Before the duel of the arch-rivals between Besiktas Istanbul and Lukas Podolski's Galatasaray Istanbul for the Supercup in Konya, the official line is clear: "Business as usual" is announced.
Already when the state of emergency was imposed after the coup attempt in July, the government insisted that the everyday life of ordinary citizens should not be affected.
But this does not apply to those who are suspected of belonging to the movement of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is held responsible for the coup attempt.
There is also no stopping before football.
The prosecution issued an arrest warrant against the former starkicker Hakan Sükür.
According to the now in America living Sükur is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
Sükür is said to be a supporter of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is blamed by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for the coup attempt.
Although the state of emergency, initially imposed for 90 days, still applies until October, in fact, this has almost no effect on the lives of most Turks.
The nightly "democracy watch" in public places across the country, Erdogan declared on Wednesday to end.
The sport, like the whole country, is divided into supporters and opponents of Erdogan.
Fans of the workers’ club Besiktas in particular are traditionally not among the president’s friends.
What unites the majority of Turks, however, in the face of dramatic experiences in history, is the strict rejection of military coups.
Even the fans agree - whether their heart beats for Galatasaray or Besiktas.
At cup winner "Gala" Lukas Podolski will be particularly important again.
With 17 goals and nine assists in all competitions, the 31-year-old finished his first season as the club's top scorer.
In the final against Fenerbahce, he scored the 1-0 victory.
The newspaper "Fanatik" praised him: "He was the best on the pitch."
He finished the season in an excellent way and secured the trophy for his team.
Thanks to "Poldi", the disappointing season for the record champion came to a conciliatory conclusion.
After the preliminary round knockout in the Champions League, the "Lions" were also eliminated early in the Europa League.
In the Süper Lig, it was only enough to finish sixth.
The season was not good.
The cup was the only way to win something.
“We did that and that’s the most important thing,” Podolski said.
For Master Besiktas, the game year went better.
Especially thanks to Mario Gomez, who set the basis for the 14th title with 26 goals this season as the Süper Lig goal scorer king.
This is also the reason why the fans continue to hope for the return of the 31-year-old.
Gomez, who was under contract with AC Florence and only loaned to Besiktas, had announced after the coup attempt that he would not return because of the political situation in the country after his European Championship holiday.
"If Mario wants to come to us, he just has to say it," the magazine "Kicker" quoted club boss Fikret Orman as saying.
But the striker would have to be willing to forgo around a third of his estimated annual salary of 7.5 million euros, Orman clarified: "We can't pay his salary at Florence".
Despite Doping: These Athletes Still Have Medal Chances at Rio Olympics
Justin Gatlin, 34, has been suspended twice for doping (2001 and 2006).
Rio de Janeiro - Whistleblower Julia Stepanowa is not allowed to start in Rio.
Other convicted athletics sinners can only laugh about it - they are fighting for medals in Rio.
The topic of doping still determines the headlines at the Olympic Games in Rio.
Russian swimmer Yulia Yefimova, who had claimed her starting right shortly before the games after a doping ban, was mercilessly booed and booed at her start (100 meters chest).
There was a bizarre scene: With a put-on smile, she was still strutting into the hall and had provoked with her appearance.
When it was determined that she would not win gold, the audience broke out into a jubilation storm.
But there are still many other athletes, despite the doping past, at the Olympic Games in Rio at the start.
Here is an overview:
Justin Gatlin (100, 200, 4x100 m relay/USA): The 34-year-old is one of the most controversial figures in athletics.
He has already been banned for doping twice (2001 and 2006 to 2010).
Since his spell, the 2004 Olympic champion and former world champion has run even faster than before, is the world's number one in 9.80 seconds over 100m and is considered Usain Bolt's biggest challenger.
Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce (100, 4x100 m relay/Jamaica): The two-time Olympic champion and seven-time world champion had to sit a six-month lockdown in 2010 after she was proven to be taking the painkiller oxycodone.
She had a severe toothache after an operation, the 29-year-old defended herself.
Sandra Perkovic (Discuss/Croatia): In 2011, the Olympic champion of 2012, world champion of 2013 and European champion from 2010 to 2016 tested positive for the banned stimulant methylhexanamine.
Perkovic denied knowingly taking it and was suspended for six months.
The four widest throws this year go to the account of the great gold favorite.
LaShawn Merritt (200, 400, 4x400 m relay/USA): The Beijing Olympic champion and two-time world champion over 400 m, had tested positive in 2010 and was suspended for 21 months.
A means of penis enlargement was responsible, Merritt asserted.
This year, the 30-year-old over 200 and 400 m is the fastest man in the world to date.
Ivan Tichon (Hammerwurf, Belarus): Hardly any athlete has been stripped of so many medals.
Tichon lost his 2005 World Cup title nine years later after being diagnosed with testosterone doping.
The now 40-year-old also had to give up Olympic silver in 2004 because of steroid doping and the European Championship title in 2006 because of testosterone abuse.
He was awarded the bronze medal at the 2008 Olympic Games in recognition of the decision of the International Court of Sport (CAS).
With 80.04 m he is in second place in the world ranking.
Liu Hong (20 km walk, China): The world record holder and gold favourite was only tested positive in May, but is still allowed to start in Rio.
The 29-year-old world champion was found to have taken a banned dietary supplement, the ban of the World Anti-Doping Agency WADA was mild and expired on July 13.
Bombing terror in Thailand - Austrian injured - Several dead
The Austrian embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman, said Foreign Ministry spokesman Thomas Schnöll, Friday morning.
She had suffered cuts and had been treated in the hospital, but had already been able to leave.
Her return home was scheduled for the beginning of September.
It remains unclear whether the other explosions on the holiday island of Phuket as well as in the southern cities of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon also affect Austrian citizens.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities in this regard, Schnöll said.
In Hua Hin, about 200 kilometers south of the capital Bangkok, two bombs exploded in a nightlife district on Thursday evening.
According to police, one Thai woman was killed and about 20 people injured, including the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.
On Friday morning, two more explosives went off, according to the authorities, another person was killed.
A bomb explosion was also reported from Phuket in the morning.
According to police, a taxi driver was injured in the detonation near Patong beach, which is popular with holidaymakers.
In Surat Thani on the southeast coast of the country, another bomb exploded, killing a municipal employee.
According to the authorities, the explosives went into the air in a flowerbed in front of the coastal police station.
Finally, detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the southwest coast and in Chumphon on the southeast coast claimed several injured.
It is believed to be related to the explosions in Hua Hin, it said.
“The bombings carry the same signature,” army general Danai Kritmethavee told reporters Friday morning.
"We believe this is a coordinated attack."
It is too early to comment on possible motives, but it is probably the actions of Muslim rebels.
Thai media also wanted to identify a pattern of attacks that is typical of the bombings of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.
Thai police, on the other hand, said the attacks were not related to the Islamist insurgency or international terrorism.
“This is just local sabotage, limited to limited areas and provinces,” a Bangkok spokesman said.
Rather, it is assumed that the bombs were laid by opponents of the ruling military junta.
The authorities had received intelligence reports in recent days of imminent attacks in the south of the country, but were not informed of the exact date and locations.
It is unclear which group was behind the attacks.
Police instructed their officials across the country to increase security around key government buildings as well as airports, train stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.
In Thailand, there are always smaller bombings, but they are usually not aimed at tourists.
Hua Hin has a palace that has been used for years by Thailand’s King Bhumibol Adulyadej.
Following the recent bomb explosions, the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends on its website that it strictly follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities.
High security risk (security level 3) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla as well as Preah Vihear and the surrounding area.
After clashes between security forces and Muslim sections of the population, it is advised not to travel to these provinces before unnecessary travel.
Increased security risk (security level 2) applies to the rest of the country.
The attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drafted by the military junta.
This gives the military great influence in the coming years.
Junta chief and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs were an attempt to create chaos as the country moves toward stability, improving economic conditions and tourism.
The military coup, which took power in 2014 after a period of bloody riots, has helped restore stability and order to the kingdom.
However, the military has also failed to get a grip on the uprising of Muslim rebels that has been smoldering for years in the far south of the country.
More than 6,500 people have been killed in the conflict.
Almost a year ago, 20 people were killed in Bangkok in an attack on a popular Hindu shrine - most of them foreign tourists.
It was the bloodiest attack in the country’s recent history.
The right-wing "identitarian movement" has been targeted by the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution.
After several state offices, the constitutional protectors in the federal government have also put the group under observation.
"We see in the 'Identitarian Movement' indications for efforts against the free democratic basic order," said Hans-Georg Maassen, head of the German press agency in Berlin.
Thus, immigrants of Islamic faith or from the Middle East are defamed in an extremist way.
That is why we are now watching the movement.
The "Identitarian Movement" is a group with French roots, which has also been active in Germany since 2012.
It opposes "multicultural madness", "uncontrolled mass immigration" and the "loss of one's own identity through alienation".
Constitutionalists in nine federal states - Bremen, Bavaria, Hesse, Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, North Rhine-Westphalia, Lower Saxony, Saxony and Thuringia - are already watching the "identitarians".
Maa<0xC3><0x9F>en said that his authority had agreed closely with the state authorities in the decision.
“Groups like the ‘Identitarian Movement’ are trying to pick up their target group where it stands,” he said.
In general, extremists try to address them with youth-oriented language, often with pop music.
This is what Islamists and right-wing extremists do.
This is not a good advertisement for your own business.
Propaganda is meant to appeal to people emotionally.
Young people are particularly vulnerable.
That's dangerous.
Recently, there had been reports from several federal states about contacts of the "identitarians" to AfD politicians.
Maa<0xC3><0x9F>en said he had no knowledge of this.
For the protection of the Constitution, possible contacts of this kind are only relevant from a certain point.
It depends on whether the respective party - in this case the AfD - through certain people who are extremist, change their direction and thus become extremist.
The decisive factor is therefore whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party.
This is not recognisable.
In view of the significant increase in right-wing crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee shelters, Maa<0xC3><0x9F>en said he would not yet speak of new right-wing terrorism in this context.
But we have found in recent years that there can be right-wing terrorist structures.
There was the group 'Old School Society' or the Freitaler Group.
It may well be that further right-wing terrorist groups or micro-groups are forming that are planning attacks against asylum seekers, against refugee homes or attacks from other right-wing extremist motives.
A Germany-wide or Europe-wide control of right-wing terrorism is, however, not recognizable.
The previous groups had emerged at the regional level or in social networks.
Maa<0xC3><0x9F>en expressed concern that many of the attacks were on the accounts of people who had not previously appeared in the right-wing scene.
That's what's worrying.
Many of the suspects in attacks on asylum shelters were not previously known as criminals, politically motivated criminals or supporters of the right-wing scene.
"So many people have committed crimes that previously had nothing to do with right-wing extremists, that were perhaps politically indifferent or that have elected, for example, the CDU, SPD or the left, which have then, however, radicalized themselves through right-wing extremist mood-mongering."
Rio 2016: Robel Kiros Habte becomes an internet hit
It is not always the Olympians or world records that make the headlines at the Olympic Games.
This is shown by the courageous appearance of Robel Kiros Habte at the Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro.
In the Aquatics Center, the slightly overweight swimmer from Ethiopia swam so slowly that he was temporarily no longer seen in the TV images.
He simply disappeared - no matter how far the cutout was selected.
In social networks, Habte subsequently became a viral internet hit.
In fact, the 24-year-old finished in the lead with a gap of 48 seconds and finished in 59th place out of 59 starters.
But it was rather his not exactly sporty figure that attracted the attention of the international media.
Why does the 24-year-old still participate in the Olympic Games?
The Ethiopian was granted a special start right by the international swimming association.
This is distributed to make swimming more popular in under-represented countries.
Since most athletes run in Ethiopia, Habte just wanted to do something different.
Preparation is everything: Robel Kiros Habte gets ready for the big race.
Quickly the first nicknames made the round.
Some media referred to him as the "Robel of the Whale".
The English tabloid "The Sun" made fun of him with "Dad Bod" in reference to a "prosperity belly".
His time, he hit only with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meter freestyle, did not matter.
Comparisons with "Eric the Eel" were also made.
At the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, the race of Eric Moussambani attracted media attention.
Unforgettable was the appearance of the swimmer from Equatorial Guinea, when he had to compete alone in a 100 meter freestyle in the lead.
Frenetically, Moussambani was cheered on at the time.
The then 22-year-old learned to swim only eight months before the Olympics and had never completed such a long distance before the competition.

Geretsried - The owner of a shop at Neues Platz has been robbed.
According to police, the 67-year-old Geretsriederin had left her shop at around 5.30 pm on Monday, forgetting to close a window on the ground floor.
When she returned the next morning at 8.15 am, about 250 euros had disappeared from the cash register.
Traces of the perpetrator could not be found.
There is also no video surveillance.
Trump does not see the impending election defeat as closely
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at a campaign event in Florida.
If the election to the US president is not going to happen, Donald Trump already has an alternative idea.
Then he goes on vacation.
“Ultimately, it’s either going to work, or I’m going to have a very, very nice, long vacation,” Trump said in a phone interview with CNBC.
“If it’s not enough for him in the end for reasons of political correctness, that’s fine,” Trump said.
He described US President Barack Obama and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton as the founders of the terrorist militia Islamic State (IS).
Within his party, more and more resistance was formed.
Post enters the trade with electric transporters
An electric delivery vehicle from Deutsche Post in action.
The interest of other companies in the vehicle is obviously great.
The Post also plans to sell its electric vehicle StreetScooter.
The company plans to start trading with the transporter shortly.
From next year, Swiss Post will also be offering its electric vans on the free car market.
"We want to enter into the sale to third parties," said a postal spokesman on Friday.
The company has been investigating for months whether it should also sell its self-developed StreetScooter, with which letters and packets are delivered, to other companies.
Post-CEO Jürgen Gerdes had said that there were always questions, for example from craftsmen.
According to information from the news magazine "Der Spiegel", the Bonn-based group wants to enter the mass production of the vehicles shortly.
The company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per shift per year.
Gerdes had announced that the group wanted to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and in the long term aimed at a complete changeover to the environmentally friendly vehicles.
“We will take a very, very robust step towards 2020,” he said at the end of July.
I imagine we'll change the entire fleet.
The StreetScooter has been active on German roads since 2014.
GfK leadership resigns after disappointing business figures
The consumer research company GfK replaces its boss Matthias Hartmann.
The resignations came suddenly, but not surprisingly.
The difficult situation of the market research company GfK hinted that the chair of CEO Matthias Hartmann becomes all the more uncertain the longer he fails to deliver on his promises.
Turbulence at the helm of the Nuremberg-based market research company GfK: After yet another disappointing business figures and the resignation of the company’s management, the world’s number five in the industry is facing a fresh start in terms of personnel.
GfK CEO wants to leave the company by the end of the year.
The chairman of the GfK Supervisory Board, Arno Mahlert, is already leaving the Supervisory Board with effect from 12 September.
The current member of the Management Board, Gerhard Hausruckinger, will assume the leadership of the Management Board as of September 1, the company announced.
He is to officially take over the function of "CEO" until a successor is found for Hartmann.
As a reason for the resignations, the company called "different views" on the long-term business policy orientation.
Details a company spokesman on Friday did not want to name.
Who will lead the market research company in the future is currently unclear.
Investors said on Friday that shareholders were disappointed with the continued failure of the restructuring initiated years ago.
Mr. Hartmann has been at the forefront of GfK since 2011.
"However, the fruits of the restructuring are still not visible after 5 years," it said.
In view of the recent poor GfK business figures, every shareholder will be uneasy at some point.
“If that were the case with BMW, the Quandts would do the same,” he said.
Following setbacks in the previous quarters, the company had also been unable to stop its loss-making drive in the second quarter of 2016.
At EUR 361.2 million, sales were 6.1 percent below the level of the comparable prior-year quarter.
Compared to the first half of the year, sales declined by 3.4 percent to EUR 721.2 million.
Earnings in the second quarter were mainly impacted by the company’s lower value in the face of its difficult economic situation.
The net amortization of 139 million euros, which became necessary in the Consumer Experience business unit, resulted in a net loss of 148.2 million euros for the Group.
In the second quarter of 2015, GfK had still generated a consolidated profit of 19.7 million.
Accidents - Bus slips in Krummhörn in Graben: Eight injured
In an accident of a coach with 43 seniors as passengers, eight people were injured on Thursday in Krummhörn (district of Aurich).
Two of the inmates suffered serious injuries, police said.
According to her, the 66-year-old driver of the bus of a travel company from Eisenach had to dodge an oncoming truck, which partly drove on the opposite lane.
The bus came off the street to the right and slipped into a ditch, as a spokeswoman for the police Aurich/Wittmund reported.
"Due to the location of the bus, people could not leave the bus on their own," she said.
Firefighters freed the inmates.
Six ambulances and an emergency ambulance arrived at the scene of the accident on Landesstra<0xC3><0x9F>e 2.
The uninjured passengers were taken back to the Krummhörn district of Pewsum by a scheduled bus.
There they should wait for a replacement bus from the travel company.
Investigators asked the truck driver and possible witnesses to report to the police.
From 1 October 2016, the fees per cubic metre of wastewater will amount to EUR 3.44 instead of EUR 2.10 for the Neudorf/Reuth/Welschenkahl wastewater treatment plant; EUR 3.36 for Zultenberg/Lindenberg/Lopp (previously EUR 2.26) and EUR 3.64 for Azendorf (previously EUR 2.18).
At the plant in Azendorf, the wastewater fee will increase again at the latest if appropriate improvement measures become necessary.
According to a comprehensive calculation, the wastewater price in Azendorf will then be 4.37 euros per cubic meter.
As Mayor Bernd Steinh<0xC3><0xA4>user (CSU) reported, it was found in the approval of the budget by the district office Kulmbach that for these wastewater plants undercovers occur.
The Kasendorf market is obliged to operate the plants on a cost-covering basis on the basis of legal bases.
From 1 October 2016, the citizens as well as the commercial and industrial companies from Welschenkahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to dig deeper into their wallets.
The fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent.
As the head of administration Herbert Schmidt pointed out to the committee, a recalculation of the fees for the wastewater facilities of the market community was necessary.
In the period from October 2016 to September 2020, excess or shortfalls from the previous calculation period should also be offset.
Schmidt justified the significant fee increases by saying that all three wastewater plants are relatively small facilities with a very low waste water volume, which is between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year.
Due to the low distribution base, for example, expenses of several thousand euros for necessary repairs would have a serious impact.
In addition, the waste water volume in all three plants was slightly reduced.
Furthermore, a considerable amount of refurbishment and repair costs were incurred in the last calculation period for all three plants, not least because of their age.
The plant in Azendorf is almost 30 years old, the plants for Welschenkahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp almost 20 years.
Schmidt pointed out that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced in the Azendorf wastewater treatment plant due to damage.
At the Welschenkahl pumping station, the almost 20-year-old pumping plants had to be overhauled from the ground up and at the Lopp pond treatment plant, after almost 20 years of operation, the first sewage pond had to be dredged, the sewage sludge had to be disposed of and an additional ventilation option installed in order to be able to comply with the water legislation in the future as well.
Schmidt: "In addition to these extraordinary expenses came the continued care and maintenance costs, which must be taken into account accordingly in the new calculation period."
The same applies to electricity costs, which were still well below the current level in the previous calculation in 2011/2012.
Steinh<0xC3><0xA4>user made it clear that with the low amount of waste water in the three plants, the expenditures for operation and maintenance "stripped through completely".
In doing so, Schmidt added, the market community has been spared from large maintenance costs at the wastewater plants in the past 20 years.
In Steinh<0xC3><0xA4>user’s view, the situation for the above-mentioned plants will remain precarious in the long term, especially since it is not possible to expand the supply area of the Friesenbachtal Association for Wastewater Purposes by adding these plants because they are deficit facilities.
Bulgaria posts inflation for the first time in 8 months
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria in July was 1% on a monthly basis.
This is the highest value (since June 2012) and the first above zero since October last year, when a positive 0.2% was booked.
The annual average inflation of the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was -0.8% as measured by the CPI.
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101.0%, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0%.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) was -0.2% and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0.2%.
In July 2016, prices of the following categories of consumer goods increased compared to the previous month: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%); transport (1.8%); leisure and culture (6.3%); restaurants and hotels (1.2%); various goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell for clothing and footwear (2.2%); furniture, household appliances and routine maintenance (0.5%); health (0.1%).
As in the previous month, prices remained unchanged for alcoholic beverages and tobacco; housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels; communication; and education.
Snapchat's 'anime' effect criticized as Asian cartoon
Snapchat says this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it’s insensitive to races.
With its filter tool, Snapchat allows around 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in a way that is already bordering on the absurd.
You can turn into a pineapple, a dog, or a figure that could be from a Roy Lichtenstein painting.
The filters are blunt, feature twisting tools that generate more than 30 million improved selfies per day.
All missteps go to the public.
Snapchat filters have attracted criticism in the past, accusing the app of promoting blackface or promoting white skin as an ideal of beauty.
When it suggested to some users this week a filter that gave them slit eyes, false teeth and puffy cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asians – “yellow face.”
They wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a bigger problem that the company has with diversity.
The news and outrage became widespread on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat announced it had disabled the feature.
The company offered an excuse: the filter was intended as a tribute to anime characters and not as a caricature of Asians.
But outsiders who have experienced racism, the filter reminded of hurtful clichés.
Others strongly rejected the anime comparison.
In an email, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet about the photos was widely circulated, wrote that the filter was "hurtful and, to say the least, unpleasant."
She added that "it is difficult to argue with the juxtaposition of a very disgusting Asian cartoon and the filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not yellow-faced, but that the yellow face has been pulled to the derogatory extreme.
Snapchat isn’t the only company to cross these cultural tripwires.
American culture seems to be embroiled in an endless struggle for diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in our hands.
And Snapchat’s large audience of young people — who are more diverse in race than their older counterparts — might be more likely to expect sensitivity.
If one of Snapchat’s filters creates an image that is offensive to a user, “it’s much harder for such things to go unnoticed than it used to be,” 25-year-old Katie Zhu said in an interview Thursday.
On Thursday, Zhu, who works as a product manager and engineer for Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account, prompting others to do the same.
In an essay for Medium and in a telephone interview, she said that she believes race-related controversies reflect a lack of diversity in hiring practices on Snapchat.
Zhu criticized the largely white, male-only leadership and ended her essay with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
“Either they don’t have diverse representations of people with different skin colors in their workforce so they can make such decisions,” said the Chinese-American Zhu, “or they have people with different skin colors who work there but aren’t in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say anything about it.”
Others share their opinions, a complaint that Snapchat has largely left unanswered.
The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points out its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss the cultural backgrounds of its employees, but according to a spokesperson, the company recently hired a hiring manager who focuses on underrepresented populations and internal integration efforts.
Zhu, for her part, said that she will leave her Snapchat account closed, adding, “I wonder if they need more users like us to be able to say that that’s not OK.”
Military leadership falsifies ISIS intelligence, congressional committee finds
U.S. Central Command military personnel altered intelligence to paint a more optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than actual conditions on the ground would have allowed, a congressional committee of inquiry reported Thursday.
The preliminary report, prepared by a task force of Republican members of the Armed Forces Committee, Intelligence Committee and Military Budget Committee, reports great discontent among Central Command intelligence analysts who reported how superiors changed their assessments of American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.
Central Command, or Cencom for short, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
“Intelligence information typically declined by high-ranking Centcom commanders regularly painted a more positive picture of American efforts against terrorism than the actual conditions on the ground would have allowed and was consistently more positive than analysis by other intelligence agencies,” a newspaper article quoted the report as saying.
"What happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analysis is presented to our political leaders," said Ken Calvert, a Republican member of the House of Representatives.
The leadership flaws in Centcom go all the way to the top of the organization.
The 10-page report shows in detail persistent problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in the training of the Iraqi armed forces.
While it does not provide direct evidence that top officials under Obama gave instructions to change the reports, it does show how analysts were under pressure from their superiors to paint a more optimistic picture of the threat to the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
“During the first half of 2015, many of Central Command’s press releases, statements and statements before Congress were significantly more positive than the facts,” the report noted.
For example, a Centcom member publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq’s second largest city, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
“After months of investigation, so much is clear,” Mike Pompeo, a Republican congressman from Kansas, said in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the leaders of Central Command changed intelligence reports to downplay the threat posed by ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans created the task force after they were told that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State.
The report, released Thursday, will be complemented by more detailed findings as the investigation continues.
In addition, further investigations of the Centcom reports by the Inspector General of the Ministry of Defense are ongoing.
Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee released their own findings on Thursday, consistent with some of the Republican Task Force conclusions.
“In 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an overly constrained process for producing intelligence assessments of ISIL and Iraqi security services,” the highest-ranking Democrat on the committee, a member of the House of Representatives Adam B. Schiff, said in a statement.
This process, Mr. Schiff said, "delayed the publication of intelligence reports," damaged morale among analysts and "gave unduly little room for dissent."
But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats said they had found no evidence of any intervention by the White House among Centcom analysts regarding a “certain political opinion.”
The preliminary results of the Congressional investigation were released Tuesday by The Daily Beast.
Last August, the New York Times reported on investigations by the Pentagon’s Inspector General, which were taken in after complaints from Centcom analysts.
Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on any reports from Congress while the Inspector General’s investigation was still ongoing.
But he also stated that "experts sometimes have quite divergent opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Department of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defense."
The investigation has repercussions beyond the question of a successful U.S.-led air campaign in Iraq and Syria (a claim now being made by a growing number of Defense Department personnel).
However, last year’s accusations have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.
Criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of disputes more than a decade ago, when a Centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a paper about how the then-government under George W. Bush, contrary to the recommendations of many analysts, provided only a small occupation force in Iraq and spent little time worrying about the consequences of the 2003 invasion.
Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the insurgency against current reporting on the Islamic State.
Last year, Mr. Hooker’s team found that, contrary to the government’s statements, air strikes against Islamic State-held refineries would not have a significant impact on the terrorist group’s financial situation, as they would have put provisional refineries into operation to sell oil on the black market.
However, this finding was not made public, the Times reported in September.
Centcom's then commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the legislature for his overly positive assessment of the war situation at a Senate hearing.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel at Central Command.
USA win fourth match in women's field hockey, a showdown with Great Britain is imminent
One day after scoring three goals during a 6-1 win over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two goals for the women's American field hockey team in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won 3-0.
Five goals in two games was supposed to be a memorable feat, but Bam (27) said she couldn’t remember ever doing so.
“I have no idea,” she said.
I'm not one of those people who remember their gates.
However, she knows this: The Americans are 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are on the same level in their group as the British, who remain unbeaten after their 2-0 victory against Japan.
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final game of the first round.
Both teams have already qualified for the quarter-finals, the game will decide which of the two within their group of six teams will win first and second place respectively.
The first-placed will avoid the strong Dutch women who lead the other group a little longer.
Whatever the outcome of Saturday’s game, the American women’s success story has sparked a surprising vortex, four years after they ended up in the last of 12 places at the past London Games.
Bam was part of that team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had a hockey stick in her hands for the first time at the age of three (her two older sisters played the sport at Drexel University), and at the age of 16 she became a U.S. national player, the youngest in the team’s history.
She missed the Olympics in 2008 because she could not qualify for the squad.
Then came the year 2012, when everything went wrong for her and her team.
The following year, Craig Parnham, an Englishman, became coach of the national team and things began to change for the better.
“A culture change, a mental change, and a physical change,” Bam said.
We didn't have the workload in London that we have now.
We were able to pull the rudder all the way around.
On Thursday evening, Bam opened the Torreigen in the first half of the game with a backhand strike from the close range.
India had gone into the game without a win in the tournament, but the team showed surprisingly tough and kept the score from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into her hands.
She completed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then pulled into the middle and kicked the ball into the goal to give the Americans a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter.
The shutout was the first of the tournament for U.S. goalkeeper Jackie Briggs, who had scored one goal in each of the previous games.
She has a run.
Just like Bam.
"We're in a good position," Parnham said, but how well will depend on the outcome of Saturday's next game.
In the midst of the rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampoline
Wherever you are, however late it is, it is the Olympic Games.
The events in Rio de Janeiro feel constant and inevitable, a raging relay race between competition and striving.
It is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod, which is passed from crossbowman to swimmer to gymnast to triathlete.
You can’t turn on the TV, read a newspaper, or listen to your neighbor’s conversation in the queue at the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or the quarrel between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there is Logan Dooley.
Dooley, who is at the Olympic Games for the first time and a female swarm with dimples, could well have been among these well-known names that will be broadcast during Prime Time, built up by sponsors and feel-good TV advertising if he were a swimmer, gymnast or even fencer.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, competes for gold in Olympic trampoline tournaments.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event the same.
Further from the center, partly in the shade are the sports that are not generally recognized: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
We will always have the breast swimming and may it reign for a long time.
But if I could modestly make arguments for my particular favorite, then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.
Although trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it made its debut in Sydney, it has been perceived so sparsely for the last 16 years that many of those I interviewed did not know it was an Olympic sport at all.
This could also be regional ignorance.
Although the USA sent athletes to the competition, it has never won a medal in trampoline jumping and until 2012 had an athlete who made it to the finals.
The Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians the prices for the women.
Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.
Trampoline jumping has a certain outsider charm, partly because it sounds more suitable for the unenlightened ear for a clown school than for the Olympic Games.
At this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but just an earthbound enthusiast.
It has humorous potential – the cartoonish tremor of its never-ending impact – but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, the two sports that it essentially combines.
The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El trampoline, which means "jumping board."
Aspiring winners jump on a giant trampoline, shoot up to 30 feet into the air, and must perform a series of falling movements (spins, pike and somersaults) before landing on their feet.
They are evaluated according to the official Olympic program by execution, difficulty level and "flight time".
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio.
The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.
Medalists need to go further, faster, up and over in their pursuit of gold, sometimes to the finish, sometimes back and forth, up and down in the playground.
They chase not only the finish line or the exit wall, but also another derisive target in the television broadcast: that of the world or the Olympic record.
The purposeful pursuit is noble, admirable, even fanatical—and it’s enough to even move a viewer to tears.
But it’s also what I find a bit tiring even when watching these games.
The trampoline offers a breather.
The vector of the trampoline jumper is above.
Moving forward is not the goal.
He or she bounces off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, going up, then down, then effortlessly back up.
Again, there is a competition, of course, not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the target, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant suspension of time and gravity.
It’s as Zen as competition at the Olympics can only be.
The women’s qualifying and final rounds will take place on Friday afternoon, streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; that of the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.
NBC will air the finals as part of an afternoon block on both days starting at 2 p.m.
Amid the Olympic mania, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely to be overlooked in the general tumult.
If the rise in consciousness can only be achieved by engaging and objectifying male athletes – as the male U.S. gymnasts recently suggested, according to The Wall Street Journal – then Mr. Dooley is expecting his new fanbase, struggling for air.
'A generation protests' in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the US
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Protesters calling for political change in Ethiopia have met with violent opposition from the government.
Witnesses say that tens of protesters were killed during clashes with police during gunfights.
Is Ethiopia about to collapse?
Over the past decade, it has been one of Africa’s most stable countries, a solid ally of the West with a fast-growing economy.
But in recent months, protests against the government shook the country and spread to more and more areas.
Last week, thousands of people stormed the streets demanding fundamental political changes.
The government’s response was merciless, according to human rights organizations.
Witnesses said police shot and killed dozens of unarmed protesters.
Videos circulating about the protests, which are believed to be from last or early this year, show security guards beating young people with sticks while forcing them to make a handstand against a wall.
The head of the United Nations Human Rights Agency is now calling for an in-depth investigation.
"It has always been difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," Rashid Abdi, the Horn of Africa project manager for the International Crisis Group, told a research group.
Ethiopia is Africa’s most populous country after Nigeria, and its stability is valued by the West.
U.S. military and intelligence agencies are working closely with the Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats beyond the region, especially in Somalia. Few countries in Africa, if any, receive so much Western aid.
Ethiopia’s economy expanded at a remarkable pace.
Its infrastructure has drastically improved - there is a new commuter train in the capital, Addis Ababa.
The streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
Even though Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy – human rights organizations have consistently led the government’s repression – opposition in the country has been curtailed, effectively silencing dissidents.
Many were exiled or imprisoned, killed or driven into the desert.
But that could change.
“If you suppress people and they have no other options but to protest, it breaks out,” said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopia.
All the youth are protesting.
A generation is protesting.
There are numerous complaints covering everything from land use to stranglehold on the ruling coalition’s power.
After a widely criticized election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the parliament.
At the same time, tensions are rising along the border with Eritrea; a fight for this jagged, controversial line claimed hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, which have been more or less defeated in recent years, could exploit the turbulence and re-arm themselves.
Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness after years of simmering beneath the surface are now exploding.
The first one seems harmless: smartphones.
Only in recent years have many Ethiopians been able to communicate via social media, as cheaper smartphones become more common and Internet services improve.
Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, which it does at regular intervals, especially during protests, many people can still communicate via internet proxies that hide where they are staying.
Several young Ethiopians said that they gathered to protest in this way.
The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.
For eons, the Amharas, who come from Ethiopia’s predominantly Christian highlands, prospered in politics and economics while exploiting the Oromos, many of whom are Muslims and live in lowland areas.
But that, too, is changing.
"We are in the process of coordinating under one umbrella," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.
The largest protests took place in areas of the Amhara and Oromos.
Many Amharas and Oromos feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tigray ethnic group, which make up around 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Mr Meles, a former rebel leader, served as Ethiopia’s prime minister for 17 years until his death from an undisclosed illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could think around corners.
Analysts say he was particularly adept at perceiving early signs of dissatisfaction and using special envoys to work on opponents and make them harmless.
"The current regime lacks this basic skill," said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst.
Ethiopia’s new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively obscure reasons to take the position of Mr Meles.
Unlike Mr Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.
Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such an uproar was in 2005 after thousands protested against elections that, according to analysts, appeared to have been botched and subsequently stolen by the government.
During the raids that followed, many protesters were killed, even if there were fewer than in recent months, and this period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts praised Ethiopia’s leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as their measurable progress in poverty alleviation.
But obviously this has not prevented the intensification of the Ethiopian government’s internal resentment.
And it takes on a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protesters attacked Tigray-led businesses in Gondar, an Amharic city, and hatred of the Tigray is becoming more common on social media.
Analysts say the protests put the U.S. and other Western allies in a peculiar position.
The U.S. government used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights over neighboring Somalia, even though it recently announced that it has closed that base.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it does not want its ally to collapse in an already volatile area.
"This," said Mr. Abdi, "is a very thin tightrope."
Donald Trump declares his claim that Obama founded ISIS was 'sarcasm'
Donald J. Trump on Friday tried to dispel the last controversy surrounding his campaign, stating that his repeated claim that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the “founders” of the Islamic State terrorist group was not meant seriously.
This clarification raised new questions about the Republican presidential candidate’s communication skills, whether he was able to communicate clearly and understandably with the American public.
It also puts his comrades-in-arms, who strive to protect him during an eventful phase, in the peculiar position of having to explain statements that he could not have meant.
After making the insinuation at a Wednesday night campaign event, Mr. Trump backtracked on Thursday’s claim, insisting in interviews that he really didn’t intend to hint that the president and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.
But in an early-morning tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was just being sarcastic.
The tweet was in contrast to the previous day when Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews that he meant the accusation completely seriously.
When conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr. Trump somewhat soften the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate didn’t want to know about it.
The last storm of criticism is bouncing down on Mr. Trump as he has tried to focus his campaign on the economic situation due to falling poll numbers.
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton gave speeches on the economic situation in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return to this issue again.
Reporting via Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton’s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring.
Mr. Trump has already advanced sarcasm in his defense.
At the end of July, he drew strong criticism when he said the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton’s emails, but later declared, “Of course I meant that sarcastically.”
This method allows Mr. Trump to shift the linguistic boundaries in politics and then row back as needed.
“I think it’s one of his methods of testing how certain messages are received by his fans, how they arrive, and then, if necessary, “clarifying” depending on how the response is going to turn out,” said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who observes the language of both candidates.
But I also think he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.
Rather than defuse the tone for the presidential election, Mr. Trump has adopted an even more caustic tone as his poll scores have continued to decline.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll released Friday showed a big lead in the states of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.
While Mr. Trump generally tries not to apologize for his provocative remarks, he often accuses his critics of distorting his statements or misinterpreting his humor.
But while he has become increasingly the focus of attention in the final months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump’s jokes have put his loyal associates in the uncomfortable situation of having to stand with him, no matter how provocative his statements may be.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trump’s most prominent advocates, went to great lengths to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview Thursday.
"I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments," said Mr. Giuliani, so he was asked about the correctness of Mr. Trump's statements as to whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State.
It is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called them backbenchers, completely wrong, and that is why it was because he withdrew the troops from Iraq.
Most mainstream Republicans try to argue that the Obama administration, in which Mrs. Clinton served as secretary of state, allowed ISIS to spread by failing to aggressively control the situation in the Middle East.
Prior to Friday’s campaign events in Pennsylvania, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media, accusing them of riding around on each of his words and being biased against him.
He taunted the "poor, miserable" television experts who were trying to understand him and said, "You can't!"
Some of the Democrats mocked Mr. Trump’s apology as yet another proof that he was unfit for the presidency.
Once over the price from the market, Café in Greenpoint comes back
Verb Cafe was a shabby cafe in Williamsburg where you could only pay in cash, which had no Wi-Fi, but served good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, prices were ousted from his Bedford Avenue storefront.
The Soap Cherie store, which replaced Verb in the summer of 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.
Locals mourned it as the last loss in a gentrifying city.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know New York is change, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead, excluding the Chelsea Hotel and verb is now a soap business."
But if New York is change, it is reinvention.
A revived Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere.
The coffee is still good.
The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-time employee of the old café who is the owner and managing director of the new café.
He started working at Verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end.
When a client offered him to provide funds for a new branch, he was excited to do so, he said.
Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot.
Verb used the same distributor for the bagels purchased the same espresso machine model.
It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment too.
He introduced new ingredients.
On the menu are sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are garnishes such as capers and sautéed onions.
There are natural rice bowls.
The café no longer serves beer, but there are fresh juices.
After nine months, Rodriguez said he had noticed a steady stream of old repeat customers.
"Many old customers were also displaced by prices from Williamsburg," he said.
Recently on a Sunday Rebecca Oliveira was one such customer.
Oliveira, 34, used to live in Williamsburg and visited the verb regularly.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she would take the road.
After the verb closed, she gave up drinking coffee for a while, she said.
"I realized it was the coffee and culture in the verb that I liked," she said.
Now she is drinking coffee again, even if she ordered a blended chai tea instead of her usual iced coffee on that day, which is another new addition.
Tom Rosenthal has been another long-standing and loyal customer since the beginning of the verb in 2003.
He went there before work and inevitably always ordered the same.
“I came a quarter past seven, every day, like a Swiss pocket watch and they’re making my everything bagel with butter,” he said.
Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu.
Nowadays, Rosenthal still gets his usual order, but sometimes he alternates his everything bagel with bacon, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez said he had no grudges about the soap business taking up the old business space.
In fact, the owners of the Soap Cherie offered to make a special soap for verb with the cafe’s cold brewed coffee as an ingredient.
"I think we're still going to go into their offer," Rodriguez said.
And the traditional Polish residents of Greenpoints have also accepted the café.
A new client has translated the menu into Polish and Rodriguez said he plans to exhibit it soon so that his new neighbors feel welcome.
The location also has other advantages.
A local juice shop wants to bottle and sell the cold brewed coffee.
There is a chance that the cafe will expand to a neighboring building.
For many customers, a new verb is enough to get their old favorites.
Joseph Witt was a regular customer and said he was devastated when the cafe closed.
When the new café opened, Whitt said that entering the venue and ordering a new coffee felt like a homecoming.
“I had to smell it,” he said.
The depressing food of the economic crisis in “an abundant meal”
In March 1933, shortly after his ascension to the presidency, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch in the Oval Office.
As a foodie, President Roosevelt had a penchant for sophisticated Fifth Avenue delicacies such as p<0xC3><0xA2>te de foie gras and Maryland turtle soup.
His menu that day was a little more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and a plum pudding for dessert.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added, “It was also a message to Americans about how they should eat.”
The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.
Coe’s latest book, “Chop Suey,” was about Chinese cuisine in the U.S., while Ziegelman’s book, “97 Orchard,” tells about life in a Lower East Side apartment building from a food perspective.
Her latest collaboration, “A Decent Meal,” which will appear Tuesday at Harper Publishing, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They showed culinary solidarity when they met for dinner with a reporter at Eisenberg’s Sandwich Shop, a small, no-frills snack in the Flatiron District that has been in business since the 1929 stock market crash.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a cream cheese sandwich with olive pieces, while Coe, 57, ate turkey with mashed potatoes and vegetable mixture.
When the reporter ordered Hackbraten, the couple found it appropriate for a discussion about food in the Great Depression era.
“Rich foods were very popular,” Ziegelman said.
There was peanut bread, liver cheese and bean bread.
They were prepared from an ingredient and something inexpensive that stretches the ingredient.
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they serve them as dinner.
Coe grinned.
"It must have been laying in the stomach like lead," he said.
In the years before the Great Depression, the table was an all-you-can-eat buffet in an American household, especially in rural areas.
Teams of women cooked for male field workers and freshly baked pate was served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. "A Square Meal" records the ways in which the country dealt with being no longer the country of raspberries.
“It was a time when food became a central, tense topic for Americans,” Coe said, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
The new budget diet was just as strained: Mysterious foods like breads and casseroles became staples, the casserole as a "wonderful way to recycle leftovers," noted Ziegelman, as chefs could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce.
Fresh fruit has been replaced by cheaper dry fruit.
Meat, which for years was the center of American cuisine, became a rarely served luxury.
Idiosyncratic mixtures were tried, as high-calorie and nutritious gratification took precedence over taste or even common sense in the kitchen.
During her research for the book, which also includes recipes, Ziegelman prepared a dish from this era, baked onions with peanut butter.
"It wasn't a popular addition to lunch," Coe says.
Ziegelmann continues: "It was surreal."
Peanut butter and baked onions do not match.
It was typical for many of the home business recipes.
Like never before or since, household economists — including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 — have driven the country’s eating habits in this way.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become “household politicians” and to live up to the challenge of turning pampe like creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals.
"A Square Meal" is a celebration of historic tidbits.
Particularly palatable are the reports of the government’s response to the starving citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover’s lass-me-cake-eating attitude.
While publicly praising the simple Iowa farmhouse kitchen of his kitchen, he dined like the million-dollar man of the world he has become.
"He liked continental cuisine like fish with cucumber sauce," Coe said.
He ate in an almost gilded dining room and wore a tuxedo.
He was wonderfully alien to reality.
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had not asked him to make an example with his stomach.
As described in the book, hiring a housekeeper with no interest in flavors by Mrs. Roosevelt led to the White House producing the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most bleakly prepared.
Many of the Great Depression-era ways of dealing with food were discarded as soon as the country got back on its feet.
The legacy lies in our continued focus on calories and food, Ziegelman said, as well as how science has been applied to food.
When writing the book, the couple claimed to have better understood Ziegelman’s mother-in-law’s eating habits – for example, how she couldn’t throw food away.
"She had a real fear of wasting food," Coe said.
Ziegelman recalled, "She actually made people sick."
There was the windbag incident.
After the plates at Eisenberg's were cleared, she and Coe pulled out a dessert they had prepared at home: the plum dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
“It’s called Prune Whip,” Ziegelman said, adding that it was a common trick to give modest recipes a fancy name.
There was no whipped cream, only plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone reluctantly dipped a spoon into the tough, brown slipper.
Amazingly, it didn’t taste bad.
Coe got a lookup three times.
Like a can-do budgeter, he told his wife, "A few chopped walnuts would help."
Killed in bomb attack: He was the hero of Aleppo
He put his own life on the line to help others: Khaled Omar.
He was the hero of Aleppo: Khaled Omar dedicated his life to the people of Syria.
He risked everything to save the lives of others.
Now, the 30-year-old himself has died in a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime.
Omar was a member of the "White Helmets", a civil protection group that has saved nearly 60,000 people's lives so far, according to the Bild newspaper.
2900 volunteers put their own lives at risk to pull people out of bombed homes and to provide first aid in the war zone.
They are the heroes of the war in Syria.
Omar was the face of the group: a video of the civilian protector showing him in an 11-hour rescue of an infant from the rubble of a house went around the world in 2014.
It made the Syrian a shining symbolic figure in the horror of war.
As a hero, however, he never saw himself, said according to the picture: "For me, this is the real jihad."
“If I die saving lives, I think God sees me as a martyr.”
Shortly before Omar himself fell victim to an attack, he had spoken in a video about the last bombings in Syria.
The helicopters dropped four barrel bombs over the Alzadia district, one was filled with chlorine gas.
A woman and two children died, and seven people suffered from shortness of breath.
"We are now removing the toxic remains of the bomb so that children do not play with it," the picture quotes his last words before he died.
The deadly bomb of the Assad regime was supposed to hit terrorists.
Greenland shark: The oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old
Rare sight.
Greenland sharks usually only come to the surface in winter.
This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the research vessel Sanna.
He was born in 1624 and swims with a good 1 km/h through the North Atlantic - until today.
Greenland sharks do not have offspring until they are 150 years old.
The Greenland shark swims leisurely along the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour it comes on average just 1,220 meters far.
Only when it matters, the five-metre-long animal accelerates to a whopping 2.6 km/h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed.
However, this slow-paced lifestyle seems to be a recipe for old age.
Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "Science" about a Greenland shark that could be 392 years old.
"Insanity", comments Alexander Scheuerlein from the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock on this life span, which is a world record for vertebrates.
The evolutionary biologist has long suspected that Greenland sharks are becoming fossilized.
Only the evidence was missing.
Greenland sharks are difficult to observe, after all they live mainly in the Arctic Ocean off the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitsbergen.
Because they prefer water temperatures around six degrees Celsius, they usually only appear on the surface in winter.
Researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland sharks.
They measured their slow-motion speed when they equipped six animals with a transmitter in front of Spitsbergen.
These sharks still make prey: In the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear.
They may hunt sleeping animals or patrol the bottom of the sea of ice, looking for carcasses that swirl down from higher layers of water.
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland sharks that fished off Greenland or Spitsbergen between 2010 and 2013 as by-catch from the depths of the North Atlantic.
The smallest shark was just 81 centimetres long, while the largest was 502 centimetres.
To determine the age of the animals, they used the carbon-14 method to analyze the lens core of the sharks.
This center of the eye lens is formed even before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained in it are not renewed later.
The two smallest sharks had a striking amount of carbon-14 in the lens core.
Their birth should therefore be after the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons tests hurled larger amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.
In the third-smallest animal with a length of 220 centimeters, the lens core, on the other hand, contained a small excess of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons tests, so it should have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012.
All the larger Greenland sharks, on the other hand, had normal amounts of carbon-14 in their lens core, which is produced by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.
In fact, the carbon 14 clock for a 493-centimeter-long Greenland shark showed an age of 335 years, while the record-breaking 502-centimeter shark is likely to be even 392 years old.
It was known that Greenland shark females only get offspring if they are longer than four meters.
Now the researchers were able to assign an age to the length.
Since one of the animals with 392 centimeters was probably on the threshold of sexual maturity and its age was determined at 156 years, Greenland sharks with the reproduction obviously at least one and a half centuries time.
This is also a world record for vertebrates.
It is no coincidence that such methuselahs mainly live in icy waters.
The previous record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland whale with a 120-year-old harpoon tip stuck in its bacon on its neck, was also caught off Alaska.
Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often runs on a saving flame.
So they mature later - and age more slowly.
In order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals often become particularly large.
Because the volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal loses heat.
The heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much greater than that of one gram of elephant.
Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.
"A smaller animal therefore lives more dangerously and should focus on having as many offspring as possible as early as possible," explains evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein.
A very large animal, on the other hand, should rather invest its resources in a long life.
Building land in a double pack
At its most recent meeting, the municipal council focused on topics related to construction.
It was with relief that the committee took up Mayor Robert Putz’s message that “finally the marketing of the recently designated residential building space can begin”.
After the land, parcelling and development questions could be clarified and the applications for surveying made, nothing stands in the way of the sale of the land in the residential areas "Stra<0xC3><0x9F>lweg" and "Schönau-West" (area Binderstra<0xC3><0x9F>e - expansion section 1) to interested parties.
The municipal council is convinced that the building areas in the rural and quiet residential community of Schönau appeal to young families and wealthy senior citizens alike.
As it was said, construction workers can report to the town hall from now on, about the allocation of the plots, the municipal council is expected to advise in its September meeting.
In order to be able to meet requests for the settlement of further commercial enterprises, combined with the creation of jobs, the municipal council decided to amend the new land use plan, which was only drawn up in the spring of this year, in certain areas.
Thus, in the Unterzeitlarn area, the already designated industrial area will be expanded by two plots towards Staatsstra<0xC3><0x9F>e 2112.
Frankfurt benefits from Brexit
The city on the Main therefore has the best chances of attracting jobs and companies relocated from London in competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg.
“It is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Brexit vote,” says Michael Voigtl<0xC3><0xA4>nder, head of the competence area Financial Markets and Real Estate Markets at the IW.
After the Brexit referendum, it is uncertain whether financial institutions will be allowed to continue to conduct financial transactions throughout the EU from London.
For the so-called EU-Passport, they are sufficient for admission in the UK.
These are the big U.S. banks.
Several banks have already announced that they will relocate jobs.
The lobby association "Frankfurt Main Finance" expects 10,000 new jobs on the Main within five years.
For Frankfurt, according to the IW, the headquarters of the European Central Bank (ECB), which combines responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the eurozone, as well as other important authorities such as the European Insurance Supervisory Authority (EIOPA) and the Risk Board (ESRB).
Although the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) is headquartered in Paris, it is less important for the financial sector than the ECB.
“The proximity to the central bank is important for banks, as it allows them to communicate directly with the supervisory authorities,” says IW Professor Voigtl<0xC3><0xA4>nder.
Although Luxembourg is home to a large fund sector, the infrastructure performance of Dublin is also poorer.
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the large airport.
Furthermore, the city with readily available commercial properties.
“It’s not that easy to find free high-quality offices in Paris,” says Voigtl<0xC3><0xA4>nder.
On the Seine, rents for first-class commercial properties are also 50 percent higher than on the Main.
In addition, Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure and less crime.
In a ranking by management consultancy Mercer, the city is in seventh place, Luxembourg in 19th place, Dublin in 33rd place and Paris in 37th place.
Even if quality of life is a matter of preferences: "With its already strong position as a financial location for the European single market, Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors," concludes the IW.
London, however, will remain the most important financial centre in Europe despite the Brexit vote, according to the economic researchers.
This is also supported by the balance of forces: According to figures from Landesbank Helaba, around 144,000 people worked in the banking industry in London at the end of 2015, compared to 62,500 in Frankfurt.
Gilead Receives Legal Expenses from Hepatitis C Patent Dispute with Merck
A U.S. magistrate ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to reimbursement of the legal costs it incurred in the Hepatitis C litigation with pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was cleared of a $200 million in damages payment for violating two of Merck’s patents related to the blockbuster drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni of Gilead after a U.S. judge uncovered a pattern of misconduct on the part of Merck, including perjury and other unethical acts.
When the lawsuit was filed on Thursday, U.S. District Judge Beth Labson Freeman said Gilead is entitled to waive the costs incurred in defending the case.
Merck is trying to align with Gilead, which dominates the market for a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other and claimed ownership of lab work that was based on sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in Gilead’s medicines.
US-backed troops say they have regained full control of Manbij from Islamic State
U.S.-backed forces have regained full control of the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last ISIS fighters in the city left, a group spokesman said on Friday.
The Democratic Forces of Syria (DKS) are currently combing through the city after the removal of the remaining group of fighters who have buried themselves inside the city.
They have freed over 2,000 civilians held hostage by the fighters, Sharfan Darwish of the DPRK-allied Manbij Military Council told Reuters.
"The city is now under complete control, but we're doing clean-up work right now," he told Reuters.
Clintons earn 10.75 million in 2015 and pay 34.2% federal taxes
Hillary Clinton released her 2015 tax return on Friday, which resulted in an income of $10.75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 34.2% for the Democratic presidential candidate and her husband.
In 2015, the Clintons donated $1 million to charities, mostly to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton earned nearly $5.3 million in speech honors; the former Secretary of State gave $3 million in income from Simon & Schuster for her book on her tenure at the State Department.
Clinton’s vice presidential candidate, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, along with his wife Anne Holton, published his tax returns for the past decade.
They paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3% in 2015.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set standards in financial transparency," Clinton campaign aide Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
In stark contrast, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and pullbacks regarding his promises to release his tax returns.
It is common for U.S. presidential candidates to publish their tax returns, although they are not required to do so by law.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have cited a tax audit by the tax authorities as the reason for his refusal.
“You’re on the train,” Clinton campaign aide Ian Sams wrote on Twitter, referring to the publication of the Democratic presidential candidate.
On Thursday, Michael Cohen, Trump’s special adviser, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish anything before the tax audits are completed.
Trump’s critics, including 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, have already said that his refusal raises questions about wealth, his donations to charities, his business dealings, and various other connections, especially with Russia.
Clinton has already jumped on the topic and released a video on Friday on the Internet in which high-ranking Republicans are calling on Trump to release his tax return.
On Thursday, she also addressed the issue during a speech on the economy in Michigan.
“He refuses to do what any other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and to release his tax returns,” she told the crowd.
Politico has reported that Trump paid no or very little tax for two years during the 1990s, and a New York Times business journalist quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax advisers on Friday as saying that this might still be the case.
Federal taxes have become an issue in the election campaign.
Clinton supports a scheme named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett that would ensure that individuals earning more than $1 million pay a tax rate of at least 30%.
President Obama also supports the proposal.
During a campaign event for Hillary Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway industrial conglomerate is based here, called on Trump to come to a meeting to exchange their tax returns.
Buffett said he had also been subjected to a tax audit by the IRS, and Trump had “fear” of voters and not tax authorities.
Clinton’s campaign has published tax returns dating back to 2007.
The Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua, New York, paid on average an effective federal tax rate of about 32% between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 40.5%.
The Clintons’ 2015 tax return showed that they received only $100 of their income as wages, unlike the majority of all Americans.
Their principal investment was a low-cost index fund, from which the Clintons taxed dividends and earnings of $109,000.

Condoms with Chili Powder, Fireworks Promote Tanzania's Elephant Protection
Conservationists in Tanzania use an unorthodox way to keep elephants from going to human-inhabited settlements – they throw condoms at them that are filled with chilli powder.
The method has proven to be effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which had the idea years ago, together with the U.S. Conservation Agency, has intensified its support by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non-violent four-step method to protect their homes and crops without harming animals.
Previously, many have used spears to defend themselves.
Friday is World Elephant Day, dedicated to animal welfare.
"Since we developed the ... toolkit, we have seen a change in attitudes within these communities, and they are much more confident that they can keep the elephants from their fields without harming the elephant," Honeyguide CEO Damian Bell said in a statement.
The first two steps include lighting the elephant with a torch and blowing into a horn.
If it is not deterred, a so-called "chili cloud" is thrown.
Chili powder mixed with earth is packed together with a firecracker into a condom, the end of which is turned to the ignition cord.
When ignited, the condom bursts with a bang and sprays fine dust on chili powder into the air.
A touch quite usually already out to chase away the elephant.
One last option is a launcher that shoots a gold rain fireworks into the air, causing a loud, bright explosion.
City council unanimously decides: No new kiosk building on the banks of the Rhine in St. Goar
Normally, the St. Goar investment projects of tradesmen are accepted with a kiss - after all, especially the retail trade in the core city is considered to be significantly expandable.
However, the city council unanimously rejected the proposal to build a sales kiosk on the banks of the Rhine in the immediate vicinity of the Rhine balcony under construction.
"In principle, we welcome new traders, but at this location in an exposed location on the banks of the Rhine, this kiosk does not fit," explained Michael Hubrath for the CDU parliamentary group.
Jewish director smashes Berlin hotel as Israeli area code removed after 'Arab' call - RT News
A French director with Jewish roots sparked a media uproar after he revealed that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not list an Israeli area code because it had “requested” Arab guests, according to an employee.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentary "Shoah" left out his anger at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his last stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the hotel's country code.
However, the country was not listed among the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, that Israel was eliminated and deleted?
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead, the Kempinksi Bristol offers a way to dial Israel through its own call center.
Looking for an explanation, the director turned to the hotel reception.
The answer he received there “shocked him,” as Lanzmann wrote.
The hotel employee said the measure was a "deliberate decision by the management of Kempinski Hotels."
The reason behind it triggered even more anger in the director.
"The majority of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the area code be deleted," Lanzmann's employee was quoted as saying.
Israeli Ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called this a "great shame," reports the Süddeutsche Zeitung.
We were horrified and dismayed by this event.
That's really embarrassing.
The fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is an even greater shame.
There's no need for an explanation.
We expect the hotel to "draw the right conclusions," the official said.
The incident caused quite a stir on the internet, with people calling it a scandal.
Some told the Kempinski Hotel that it had "given in" to the alleged requests of Arab guests.
"Shame on you," another post said, pointing out that the hotel, which is located on the noble Kurfürstendamm, is near a synagogue.
The hotel quickly dismissed all accusations and called the incident an "accident" and "apologized" to Lanzmann, Der Spiegel reports.
“There was never a direct instruction to not include Israel on the speed dial,” a spokesman for the Kempinski Hotel told the Süddeutsche Zeitung.
It adds that the country code has now been added.
Police use tear gas & rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students
Students clashed with police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo on Thursday as they gathered to demonstrate against the government’s reforms to the public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the protesters.
The difficulties began when police officers tried to disperse the students, causing the police to use rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstrations to express their dismay at the plans.
According to the proposals of the governor of the state of Sao Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, a little less than 100 public schools will be closed, while 300,000 students will be implemented to save money.
Some of the protest participants were seen spraying graffiti against the provisional president Michel Temer on walls.
The latest protests occurred a few days after protesters took to the streets en masse to support suspended President Dilma Rousseff, who had been ousted from office by a Senate vote to remove her from office.
Trade between Russia and Iran suddenly rises to 71% - RT Business
With the lifting of the sanctions, according to the Russian ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, the trade turnover between Moscow and Tehran grew by 70.9 percent year-on-year.
Since the international sanctions against Iran were lifted, the interest on the part of Russian companies in business in the country grew strongly, said the ambassador.
Russian companies are establishing existing ties with Iran, while new companies are ready to gain access to the market.
Of course, further trade expansion is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," Dzhagaryan said.
He noted that trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent in the first five months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 and was $856 million.
In particular, Russian imports to Iran skyrocketed by 91.5 percent, amounting to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran rose 16 percent to $158 million.
The trade boom was achieved through supplies of machinery, land vehicles and weapons," the ambassador said.
Dzhagaryan expects a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia this year.
Last year, the Russian mission issued around 35,000 visas, primarily travel visas, to Iranian citizens.
Furthermore, Iran reached the top 20 countries in terms of the number of tourists in Russia.
You could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia from last year are being broken," he said.
At the same time, relatively few Russians visit Iran, something the ambassador hopes will change.
"I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, which have preserved monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition," he said.
Witnesses needed: Drink market in Waldbröl raided
A robbery was committed on Thursday evening at the beverage market of Rewe XXL on the Waldbröler Gerberstra<0xC3><0x9F>e.
Presuming a firearm, three dark-dressed people, who had masked their faces, demanded the release of cash from the beverage market employee and then fled first on foot and then presumably with a silver-colored VW golf.
How much money was stolen, the police do not tell.
The perpetrators are said to have been between 1.60 and 1.70 meters tall, so relatively small.
The beverage market is directly accessible from the parking deck of the Rewe market and is difficult to see.
After the attack, the perpetrators must have run in the direction of Gerberstra<0xC3><0x9F>e, Friedrich-Engelbert-Weg and fled from the gravel parking lot opposite the car park entrance with the silver-colored car, possibly in the direction of B 256 (Schladernring).
Anyone who has made observations at the time of the crime (around 7:45 p.m.), which are related to the robbery, should urgently report to the police.
Nagold: Fun and games during summer free time
The children and young people of the social pedagogy day group/social group work of the Child Protection Association Nagold spent eight beautiful and happy days with their caregivers on their summer holiday in Nussdorf, near Mühlacker.
In the quiet leisure home Hardtw<0xC3><0xA4>ldle, the lively group was quartered during the first week of school holidays.
Several full-day trips were on the program.
On the one hand we went to Bretten with the visit of the petting zoo.
On the other hand, to Maulbronn, where there was a special children's tour in the world-famous monastery.
The third trip led to Pforzheim.
In the Celtic Museum in Hochdorf, the group learned a lot about the daily life and food of the Celts.
On the hot days, the group enjoyed themselves at the Tiefensee in Maulbronn, which invited for jumping, swimming and splashing.
In terms of cuisine, children and carers were spoiled with their home-made home-cooked meals such as the Sauren Sp<0xC3><0xA4>tzle, the Seebronner Pf<0xC3><0xA4>nnle, Iselshauser-Bloff, the Englischer-Breakfast and Tübingen Bolognese.
In workshops, batik was used, beautiful pieces of jewellery were created from pearls and stones or a Roman mill game was made from wood.
Other highlights of the free time were fishing in a nearby pond, the evenings by the fire and the final "Colorful Evening".
On the day of the journey home, the sun laughed and the children and young people returned home contentedly.
Haigerloch: Pilgrimage to the Gate of Mercy
The ministers from the pastoral unit Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were on their way on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.
Together, four stages were completed.
In order to bridge the time until the next Rome pilgrimage of all ministers in probably two years, the Supreme Minister’s Round St. Anna has decided to prepare and carry out a pilgrimage lasting several days.
Various pilgrimage destinations were examined and finally decided for the episcopal city of Freiburg, where this year on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy with the gate of Mercy at the Freiburg Minster opened for this purpose a special pilgrimage destination was offered.
16 Minions from Bitterbronn, Gruol, Haigerloch and Heiligenzimmern set out.
The evening before, Pastor Storost sent out the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrim’s crosses and gave the pilgrim’s blessing.
From Horb we took the train to the starting point Villingen, where there is also a Minster of Our Lady and thus the pilgrimage route was started from the Minster.
In the morning and evening, the individual day tours were each framed by a short impulse with various prayers, songs and scriptures.
But also on the way, the minis made time and again rest at field crosses, chapels or churches to sing together a song from a specially compiled pilgrim songbook.
For the overnight stays, parish homes of the local parishes were available.
At the stage destinations Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller provided a tasty as well as strengthening dinner and breakfast.
On the second day we continued via Furtwangen to Gütenbach.
The next day they started the stage to St. Peter, which was the most strenuous route, had to first go down about 500 meters in the heat and then climb again.
The well-deserved reward was a barbecue at the bath pond in the evening.
After the morning impulse on the fourth day of pilgrimage in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter, we went on the final stage to Freiburg.
Visibly relieved and happy, the Minis arrived at the Freiburg Minster in the late afternoon and passed through the door of Mercy.
With a small impulse God was thanked here.
In the evening mass in the Münster, the minis arrived at the pilgrimage destination were welcomed by cooperator Markus Obert.
After the service, the pilgrims were able to visit the sacristy and the high altar.
The next day there was still time for the Breisgau metropolis.
In the afternoon we went by train back to Horb.
In the end, all participants agreed that the days were marked by spirituality and a strong community experience.
Scotsman Callum Skinner storms home as Briton earns gold for cycling
Scotland’s Callum Skinner raced to fame last night in the men’s team sprint at the Velodrom in Rio when the British team defended the London 2012 title.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow took on the anchor role that his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had made his own. The lad made the legend proud when he stormed home to claim a victory from New Zealand's favourites.
England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy took the fifth of six Olympic gold medals.
They repeated the trick after taking only a modest sixth place at the World Track Championships in London in March, despite Hoys’ retirement.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.
They did this in time when Hinds showed up.
Hoy's retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.
Skinner was the man they stayed with when they saw potential in the Scotsman that has now unfolded.
Hindes, Kenny - who won four years ago with Hoy - and Skinner set an Olympic record in the qualifying rounds, but in the standard rounds the New Zealanders won in the first round.
And the British trio won the duel with gold.
Hindes was barely behind after his lap, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it.
A change of strategy made up a large part of the transformation, with Hinds driving in a higher gear to slow him down and allow Kenny and especially Skinner to keep up the pace.
Hoy watched from his position as a BBC expert and noticed Skinner, Kenny and Hindes as they climbed onto the podium.
The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said: "It's a flattering comparison."
I'm just here to do my best and make a name for myself.
We set an Olympic record in the finals and beat the world champions.
It was just incredible.
There is no better way to win this.
After the 2012 triumph at Kenny's and Hoy's side, Hindes admitted that after a weak start, he deliberately fell onto the track.
He later retracted this statement and there was no objection from England’s rivals.
With such an overwhelming victory, there was no such problem this time.
Hindes said: "It feels like London with all the GB flags in the stands."
We have come together as a team over the last three months.
We got away so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win back at the Olympics.
This is an event, a gold medal for the nation, which won seven out of 10 titles in both Beijing and London.
If this is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, we can expect a successful five days in the velodrome.
With Kenny's form, it is in the realm of possibility that he repeats Hoy's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.
That would mean for Kenny – who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (an apparently sacred date for British sport; on that day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were also born) – a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.
That would be Hoy's.
Kenny is next in the sprint, which starts today and will run for three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said, “I’m just enjoying this for the moment.”
The team event is always the best.
You can win it with your colleagues.
It feels a little lonely to win alone.
Hindes said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight."
It was the only medal competition of the day, but there was more good news for England.
Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-kilometre race.
They arrived at the finish line in 3:51,942.
The world record, which won gold in London in 2012, was 3:51,659.
The first and final round (22.42) will take place today on the second day of the competition, where Wiggins will certainly be in focus.
He had been arguing with commissioners before qualifying yesterday, when officials called him to measure his height.
Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie advanced in world record time in 4:13,260.
The GB team relies on its strong track cycling team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and win a host of medals.
After a truly extraordinary display of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, expectations for Rio have been lowered.
Dramas played out in the background, according to the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April amid sexism and bullying allegations, as well as the retirement of greats such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, if you look at the first night of the competition in the Velodrom, it looks like the now legendary reputation of GB, which has reached its peak at the perfect moment, could be repeated.
Future of Portland smelting plant questionable due to energy contract cancellation
The future of Portland’s aluminum melt in Victoria – as well as hundreds of workers’ jobs – is at stake as the plant operator will terminate the energy supply contract, cancelling all supply contracts, the supplying energy company said.
This move followed the government’s decision in Victoria earlier this year not to grant any further subsidies to operate the plant.
A 20-year subsidy expires in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs at Alcoa’s Portland facility are at stake.
No fewer than 2,000 jobs, both direct and indirect, could be at risk from closure.
In addition, there could be domino effects as the smelter consumes around 10 percent of Victoria’s total electricity generation.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry smelter, which led to a closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
The Alcoa smelter in Portland is losing money and risking closure.
This move follows years of speculation about the future of the facility, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and most recently due to the price of electricity for the facility.
AGL, which supplies the large aluminum smelter with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, said it expects three more owners to cancel their contracts.
The facility is majority owned by a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares.
“AGL expects the Portland facility to continue to operate, which means further physical demand for electricity through the smelter,” the company said.
AGL further stated that the contracts were so-called “guarantee transactions”, which should have entered into force from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period, so they will end in 2017.
"As a result, AGL expects the contracts to contribute to revenue in fiscal year 17," the electricity supplier said.
All potential effects on revenues on AGL from FY18 onwards are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong forward markets for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL said it had already written off the value of the contracts in its annual closing of $187 million in "expectation of termination."
Alcoa said the decision to book out the contracts does not affect Alcoa's "ability to operate the smelter or provide power to the smelter."
The U.S. company said it had signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which should have come into force from November this year, even if it still owes an explanation as to why it resigned from the contract.
Analysts warn of the potential closure of the Portland smelter in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the industry’s poor economic conditions.
Referring to the analysts’ statements earlier this week, Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland consumes around 600 megawatts of electricity annually and Tomago consumes around 900 megawatts of electricity annually.
If both plants were to disappear from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in demand in the [electricity] market.
And for us as power generators, that would not be good," he said.
More than just a Kardashian reality TV star, Kendall is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashian-Jenner clan Kris is on the cover of the coveted September issue of US Vogue.
Kendall, Estee Lauder’s brand ambassador who ran fashion weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
"In a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover made me cry," Kendall wrote.
The cover’s unveiling followed a bizarre (or simply Keeping Up with the Kardashians-like?), scripted reality video that shows the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (with the exception of the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn, as well as in the presence of the all-time most popular showbiz uncle and producer of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest), as they have planned a classic wen party.
That's the clichéd plot of almost every birthday episode of a children's show (Seacrest put the phrase, "You thought we forgot you?," with the honesty of a cartoon rabbit on a airing spot at 8 a.m.), but Kris had to somehow let her other girls participate in that publicity.
With regard to the September issue of Vogue, a new era of the Kardashians has certainly begun.
Kendall’s big sister Kim may have beaten her on the Vogue cover (she and her husband Kanye West were on it in April 2014), but the cover of the magazine’s September issue is a league unto itself.
The September issue is the best-selling issue of the year for Vogue.
With a scope that is more like a picture book than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a large number of advertisers (according to Fashionista, of the 832 pages of the toy, 615 pages were advertising).
The unveiling of his cover star is so eagerly anticipated that in the last two years, pictures of the magazine leaked before the official announcement.
Women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista, and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have clearly been more “celebrities who model” than “models who are celebrities” on the cover.
Oscar winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga had the honor.
But even with the low chance that Ms. Jenner – described by the magazine as the “breakthrough model” of her generation – falls under the former category, she is in good company.
These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or teens of today who know how to shoot a good Snapchat video (even if all of that applies to Jenner).
They are truly talented women who excel in the entertainment industry.
Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lemonade.
Of course, Jenner’s success doesn’t please everyone.
With her reality TV story, Jenner’s position in the fashion world was always a bit tense.
In June, former Victoria’s Secret model Stephanie Seymour criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid, calling them “the bitches of the moment.”
These feelings boiled up again when the news came out with Jenner’s appearance on the Vogue cover.
But riding around in displeasure seems to pass the point.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue.
She is, in the truest sense of the word, a supermodel.
She runs for Marc Jacobs.
She advertises her Estee Lauder primer.
She and all her sisters are selling you pictures of themselves on their respective paywall apps.
She sells her pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter to LOVE magazine.
And in her spare time she can be seen on reality TV, probably just to see her sister Kourtney and her children.
Municipal Law Centers Reject 160,000 People Annually
More than 160,000 of the country’s most in need of aid are rejected annually by community rights centers, while the industry is anticipating the impact of further cuts in funding on already overburdened transactions.
In Queensland, three out of five people – mostly older people, immigrants, workers in need, victims of violence and those who do not have the means to commit unjust acts and the like – are already being turned away when they apply for free legal advice and legal assistance.
Legal services of the municipality, which are already over-utilized, are getting ready for further cuts.
From June next year, it is planned that these legal centers will lose another 30 percent of their federal funds.
James Farrell, director of Queesland’s Community Law Centers, said that the latest survey by the National Association of Community Law Centers found that thousands of people are already being turned away each year.
Farrell said the situation would only get worse without a repeal of the federal government’s decision.
“Queensland’s community rights centers are chronically underfunded, meaning thousands of people are turned away from important services they need,” he said.
People who leave violent relationships, people with unmanageable and crushing debts, families going through separations, workers being unfairly laid off – all these people have problems of a legal nature and this survey shows that they can’t get the help they need.
As of June 2017, the federal government will cut funding by 30 percent, which means that thousands of Queenslanders in need will be forced to deal with their legal problems without any help.
We call on the Attorney General and Federal Minister of Justice, as well as Senators from Queensland George Brandis, to immediately lift these cuts so that people can get the help they need in the event of legal problems.
Last year, the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for mutual legal assistance to the national average.
It is now time to look at the needs of the community rights centers and their customer communities, and for the Palaszczuk government to invest in this important work.
Donald Trump campaign indicted after employee allegedly pulled gun
New York: Donald Trump’s campaign has been charged with alleged inaction after she was told that her North Carolina campaign manager had pointed a gun at an employee in February while they were traveling in a jeep.
The incident is described in an indictment filed Wednesday in the Charlotte state court by Vincent Bordini, a former software programmer for the campaign in that state.
Bordini stated that he had waited for months for the matter to be settled internally before realizing that "this would not happen."
The campaign manager, Earl Philip, "pushed a gun, put his right index finger on the trigger, and rammed the barrel into Vincent's knee socket," Bordini stated in his indictment.
After complaining to the local and regional campaign leadership, Bordini noted that at least four other people had had had the same experience with Phillip, he stated in the indictment.
"Weapons don't have to be fired to cause damage," Bordini said.
The indictment comes just two days after the Republican presidential candidate sparked an uproar when he told a crowd in North Carolina that the “Second Amendment people” — gun owners and gun enthusiasts — should take action in case his rival Hillary Clinton is elected and appointed judge.
Trump’s campaign made it clear that the media had taken his words out of context and that he would not incite violence.
Bordini’s complaint demands damages from the Due Diligence Campaign and from Philip for bodily injury and permanent psychological damage.
Trump’s press secretary, Hope Hicks, was not available for comment.
Attempts to contact Philip also failed.
WCCB, a local news station in Charlotte, reports that Phillip is no longer an employee of the campaign.
Calls to his consulting company, Innovative Consulting Services, were not answered.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has led a controversial campaign so far.
The proceedings are Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, Supreme Court, County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Berlin/Schwerin: Survey before country elections: SPD and CDU lose
In the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania (4 September) and Berlin (18 September), significant losses for the ruling parties SPD and CDU are looming.
This was the result of representative surveys by the opinion research institute INSA for the "Bild"-Zeitung (Friday).
While the red-black government coalition in the north could continue to rule, this is not possible according to the poll values in Berlin.
In both federal states, however, the SPD would be the strongest party and would thus have a good chance of continuing to appoint the head of government.
In Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, the SPD fell from 35.6 percent five years ago to 24 percent.
According to the survey, the party is only just ahead of the CDU, which could come back to 23 percent.
The third place is disputed between the Left and the AfD.
The left would come to 19 percent (previously 18.4 percent), the AfD would be represented in the state parliament for the first time with 19 percent.
Despite slight losses, the Greens moved back into the Schwerin state parliament with 6 percent (previously 8.7 percent).
NPD and FDP would not be represented in the state parliament with 3 percent each.
According to the survey, the SPD would only come to 23 percent in the Berlin parliamentary election (election 2011: 28.3 percent).
The CDU reached only 18 percent after 23.4%.
It would thus still be behind the Greens with 19 percent (2011: 17.6 percent), but ahead of the Left with 15 percent (previously 11.7 percent).
The AfD would be represented in the House of Representatives with 14 percent for the first time.
At 5 percent, the FDP could hope for a return, while the pirates would miss the move in contrast to 2011.
Nokia 9000 Communicator: The first smartphone
E-mail and internet in slow motion: 20 years ago, the Nokia Communicator came on the market.
The successors dominate the world today - its manufacturer experienced a disaster.
The device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.
It was thicker and bigger, so it was not good in the hand.
On the contrary, it was quite clunky.
The built-in memory was initially eight megabytes, which would be enough for about two high-resolution selfies today.
An iPhone is now shipped with at least 16 gigabytes.
The "Nokia 9000 Communicator" came into the shops exactly 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996 - and it was the first smartphone.
For a few euros, lovers can still buy the devices on the Internet, but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Internet age.
Twenty years ago, however, the Communicator was a sensation.
The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair Cebit in Hanover as "office in vest pocket format".
In fact, the new mobile phone could meet a lot of standards at the time: SMS and emails could be sent and received, even by fax was to reach the Communicator.
Even the access to web pages was possible via HTML browser, albeit agonizingly slow.
A calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.
There was a small antenna, and the phone could be opened up like a laptop.
Then there was a small keyboard and a black and white screen.
The price was quite proud: 2700 D-Mark, i.e. about 1400 Euro.
The average retail price of a smartphone in Germany in 2015 was 392 euros.
No one could have guessed in August 1996 that the Communicator would be the beginning of the smartphone era.
Everything's been different since then.
The smart phones are a success story, though not for Nokia.
The mobile phone division of the Finns experienced an unprecedented disaster, was eventually sold to Microsoft and settled.
The market today is dominated by providers, all of which came much later than Nokia.
Being online anytime, anywhere is everyday life for a lot of people today.
In 2015, there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide.
About 1.4 billion devices were sold, Samsung and Apple alone accounted for 555 million units.
Worldwide sales of the devices amount to around 400 billion euros.
In addition, there are the well-running business of the countless app providers and the telecommunications companies.
A whole industry has now emerged around the smartphone.
The decisive breakthrough to the mass market came only in early 2007, when Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the iPhone on the Mac World.
He promised three devices in one: a music player, a phone and an internet communicator, all easily operated via touch screen.
Apple’s triumphal march began, and even today the iPhone is the company’s most important product.
Nokia, Motorola, and Blackberry, which dominated the market, were lagging behind.
They eventually disappeared, Blackberry has to fight.
Apple and Asian vendors like Samsung are now in charge.
The smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after its invention.
On average, every German now looks at his mobile phone 88 times a day.
"We all have to learn to put the smartphone away," said Janina Kugel, who is responsible for personnel at the Siemens Board of Management.
Permanent accessibility is now considered a curse and a blessing at the same time.
England must steer the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London, but throughout the country.
For me, this was Heathrow’s biggest attraction, as it was in London back in 2012, when we went to great lengths to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the Games.
The Olympics brought great benefits to Stratford and the East End.
And we will do it again by creating new opportunities for locals and businesses near Heathrow.
For our local communities alone, we will create 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment.
Just as they were ahead of us in London in 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of expanding Heathrow is too great.
I have been told that England will never be ready for the Games and that we will embarrass ourselves on the world stage.
The doubters were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong at Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers every question asked.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for many and not for individuals.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, <0xC2><0xA3>211 billion in scientific growth and leave a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across the UK.
We have a great team at Heathrow that has implemented a <0xC2><0xA3>11bn infrastructure investment programme in time and budget, from T5 – voted the world’s best airport terminal five years in a row, to T2 built amid the world’s two busiest catwalks.
Now they are poised to deliver a third runway, backed by <0xC2><0xA3>16 billion in private investment.
The London 2012 Games were a huge success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of Heathrow will be one as well.
It is time for us to steer this Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow, securing our future trade and creating a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is Chairman of the Heathrow Board and former Commercial Secretary to the Treasury.
Adblock Plus, Facebook in the "cat and mouse game" regarding ad blocking
For companies that make money with online advertising, attempts to circumvent ad blocking are a “cat and mouse game,” according to one of the software manufacturers.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced it would block ad blocking on its desktop page, Adblock Plus published a blog post in which it said that users could update their filters in the program to again block ads on the social network.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that its desktop page would change the encoding of its ads to make it more difficult for ad blocking to detect which part of the page is advertising.
But Adblock announced that it has found a new way to bypass the new codes.
In a blog post, Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote that “this kind of back-and-forth battle between the ad-blocking open source community and the by-passers has been going on since the invention of ad blockers,” and that it’s possible that Facebook will soon come up with a new solution.
The fact that the world’s largest social media company has entered the fray is a strong indication of how worrisome ad blockers have become for the industry.
According to a study last year by Pagefair and Adobe, around 200 million people worldwide use ad blockers; almost four times as much in 2013.
With 1.03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook through their mobile devices, mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of Facebook’s advertising revenue.
The company is targeting ad blockers on desktop PCs because mobile ad blockers have no effect on Facebook’s mobile app for the social network and Instagram, a spokesperson said.
Advertising on desktop PCs accounts for a sufficiently large share of revenue, so Facebook considers the investment of such a move to be worthwhile.
On Tuesday, Facebook said it would update its “ad preference tool” to give people more control over ads targeted to them.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblock’s new filters would be worrisome because they would also block content on the page that isn’t advertising.
“This is not a positive experience for users, so we plan to address the issue,” a Facebook spokesperson said in an email.
Ad blockers are a blunt means, which is why we’ve instead focused on developer tools like Ad Preferences to put more control in people’s hands.
Woman run over in suspected suicide on Swiss motorway
The victim was on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are calling witnesses after a woman was run over by several vehicles on a highway in the early hours of Thursday in a suspected suicide.
The incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight.
A woman lay down on the street in the dark “in an act of desperation” and was hit by several cars, the police in Vaud said.
It is obvious that a Swiss woman at the age of 49, who was run over by several vehicles, including a truck, wanted to kill herself.
She died on the spot.
Several drivers have already been heard, but some have still not been identified, police said, urging them, as well as any witness to the incident, to come forward.
An investigation has been opened, which is a "logical" step in such a situation, Gilles Hofstetter told the Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed.
Was a collision preventable?
That’s something the prosecutor has to decide,” Hofstetter said.
Two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers are not being held accountable.
In each of the two cases – where a person was walking in the dark on the highway – it was decided that drivers did not have to assume that a pedestrian was walking on the highway in the middle of the night, as the newspaper said.
Last year, a policewoman was acquitted of negligent killing after she ran over and killed a man lying on the A1 near Payerne one night in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had been drinking and passed out on the street, the court heard.
The court found that the policewoman -- who had responded to an emergency call -- was driving in a justified manner and that the presence of a man on the street was a "completely extraordinary and unpredictable situation," the judge said.
Anyone with more information about Thursday’s incident near Morges should call the police on 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA Climate Model: Venus Was Once Habitable
Venus was probably once habitable, according to the projections of a new NASA climate model.
Scientists at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to discover Venus’ past using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate researchers.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus, with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere, may have once had Earth-like conditions.
Scientists have previously suggested that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus may have had a thin, Earth-like atmosphere, yet slowly continued to spin.
The model also illuminated the topography of early Venus.
The planet probably had more arid regions than Earth, but once had enough water and geographic variability to accommodate life and protect it from rapid evaporation.
Early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matter.
"In the GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of Venus exposes its day side to the sun for almost two months," GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio explained in a press release.
This heats the surface and produces rain, creating a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from much of the solar heat.
The result is average temperatures that are a few degrees cooler than Earth’s today.
The model produced a history of Venus similar to evolution previously suspected by planetary scientists.
Although once believed to be habitable, Venus has been exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light over several billion years.
Their oceans evaporated and their water vapor was burned away by ultraviolet light.
When their hydrogen escaped, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect remained -- the Venus we know today.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns as Avalanche coach
Patrick Roy resigned as coach and vice president of hockey operations for the Colorado Avalanche on Thursday, citing a lack of co-determination in the team’s decision-making process.
Joe Sakic, Colorado’s alternative president/general manager, confirmed the decision, noting that the club will seek a new coach immediately.
"Over the past three years, I have fulfilled my duties as the Colorado Avalanche's head coach and vice president of hockey operations with energy, passion and determination," Roy said in a statement.
I’ve been thinking a lot over the summer about how I could improve this team to give it more depth, this is what it needs and take it to a higher level.
To achieve this, the vision of the coach and vice president of hockey operations must be perfectly aligned with that of the organization.
He must also have a right of co-determination in decisions that affect the performance of the team.
These conditions are currently not being met.
Sakic, who had hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his contributions to the team.
“Patrick informed me of this decision today,” Sakic said.
We all appreciate what he has done for our organization and wish him only the best for the future.
Roy was named the best coach in the league during his debut season at the 2013-14 Avalanches as the winner of the Jack Adams Award.
He led the club to 112 points and first place in the Central Vision, but Colorado was beaten by Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs and missed the postseason in each of the last two years.
The Avalanches hit a 39-39-4 mark in the 2015-16 season, falling behind wild for a second wildcard spot in the Western Conference by five points.
As a Hall of Fame goalkeeper, Roy won four Stanley Cups -- two plays with the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers resume talks, suspend strike
Labour disputes over wages for North Sea oil workers will be suspended as all parties to the dispute sit down for a new round of talks, negotiators said.
Strikes against oilfield service provider Wood Group have been sporadically carried out on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
“Wood Group, as well as the Unite and RMT unions, can confirm that we have agreed to restart the resolution process of the current dispute,” it said in a joint statement.
We will be holding some full-day sessions in the next few weeks, which will start early next year, to re-address the issues.
The unions said their last strike, the first in over 25 years, was a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent.
Wood Group has cut rates to its North Sea contractors by around 9 percent this year due to negative market pressure.
The company’s rate cut follows a 10 percent decline for onshore contractors in 2014.
The company said additional cuts will give the company the space it needs to get through the market downturn.
Shell, for its part, has laid off thousands of people and announced plans to give up its oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as it streamlines its operations as a result of its megamerger with British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices, an economic situation exacerbated by the British decision in June to leave the European Union.
Scottish Member of Parliament Dave Anderson met with labour leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labour disputes in a generation in the North Sea.
The North Sea is important for the regional economy, he said.
“In the North Sea and across the country, we need an economy that works for many, not just a few,” he said in a statement.
In 2016, less than $1.4 billion is expected to be spent on new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of around $7 billion over the last five years.
Kepler measures rotation rate of stars in Pleiades cluster
The latest mission using the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers collect the most complete catalog of rotation rates under the stars of the Pleiades star cluster.
The new data will help astronomers understand why stars in the cluster rotate at different rates and how the rotation periods are related to planet formation.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other clusters of stars, we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age, and even the history of its solar system," Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, said in a press release.
The Pleiades star cluster is located 445 light-years from Earth.
Many stars in this cluster, formed around 125 million years ago, are now reaching adulthood.
They're turning the fastest now.
At peak rotation rates, these maturing stars emit large amounts of stellar winds.
Since these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a braking effect on the stars.
As a star ages, its rotation rate begins to slow.
Kepler measures the rate of rotation of each star by recognizing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- like sunspots.
The latest catalog of rotation rates indicates that more massive stars rotate more slowly than fewer massive stars.
Rebull compares the stars to dancers, with larger stars spinning pirouettes more slowly than smaller ones.
"In the 'ballet' of the Pleiades, we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive, whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," Rebull said.
Because the Pleiades star cluster is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities such as rotation rates.
"The Pleiades star cluster provides an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older," Rebull said.
There is still a lot ahead of us about which we would like to learn more, how the how, when and why stars slow down their rotation rates and hang their "dance shoes" so to speak.
Rebull and her colleagues have reported in detail in three newspaper reports on their latest analysis of the rotation rates of the Pleiades, which will soon appear in the Astronomical Journal.
A controversial baseball star resigns
The tears ran faster for Alex Rodriguez than the US baseball star in the best days from base to base.
After his emotional resignation announcement, the 41-year-old professional will wear the jersey of his New York Yankees for the last time on August 12 against the Tampa Bay Rays.
“I love this game and this team.
“I say goodbye to both,” said the 14-time All-Star Game participant in Major League Baseball (MLB).
Rodriguez was named the league's most valuable player three times, winning the 2009 World Series with the Yankees.
His signature under a ten-year contract has earned him $27 million annually since 2007.
Until the end of the contract on December 31, 2017, he will act as a consultant and youth coach - with full salary.
As a player, Rodriguez paid it back for a long time with performance.
With 696 home runs, 3114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ("Runs") for the Seattle Mariners (1994 to 2000), the Texas Rangers (2001 to 2004) and the Yankees since 2005, he achieved several milestones.
With the Hall-of-Fame members Hank Aaron and Willie Mays, only two other baseball players have similar values in the most important statistics.
However, the 41-year-old should not be admitted to the hall of fame of baseball.
Because as successful Rodriguez - nicknamed "A-Rod" - was on the field, so controversial is his appearance outside the field.
As early as 2009, the superstar on "ESPN" admitted to having taken prohibited steroids between 2001 and 2003.
In August 2013, he was banned for 211 games until the end of 2014 due to an involvement in the so-called biogenesis scandal.
Rodriguez is considered the prime suspect of years of receiving performance-enhancing drugs through an anti-aging clinic in South Florida.
After a legal dispute, the ban was reduced to 162 encounters.
"The league could have done me a favor for 2014, because I played 20 years without a break," Rodriguez said.
His farewell days are not silent either.
While many baseball legends once again get the big stage in their final games, Rodriguez often had to sit on the bench.
"My job doesn't include a farewell tour."
"My job involves trying to win every game," Yankees coach Joe Girardi said.
After all, Rodriguez, who was married to actress Cameron Diaz and is said to be related to pop star Madonna and actress Kate Hudson, got sympathy endorsements from fans of Yankee arch-rival Boston Red Sox.
"We want A-Rod", the supporters sang in the 4-9 defeat against the Rodriguez team.
2016 Olympics: Chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekowa and Adrian Zielinski are first doping cases
Caught: Because of a positive doping test, weightlifter Adrian Zielinski from Poland is not allowed to start in Rio.
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are overshadowed by the first official doping cases.
An athlete would have almost won a medal.
Before the seventh day of competition, the first official cases of doping became known the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 3,000-meter obstacle runner Silwia Danekowa from Bulgaria and Polish weightlifter Adrian Zielinski were tested positive and excluded in Brazil - just before the start of the already critically eyed athletics competitions, these news come to the fore.
Last Sunday, Chen discovered the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide, which is used as a masking agent for doping substances.
The International Court of Sport CAS confirmed its exclusion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon local time.
On Sunday, the 18-year-old had taken fourth place in the final over 100 m butterfly, only by 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal.
On Friday, Chen should have participated in the 50m freestyle.
Chen has applied to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) for the opening of the B-sample and a hearing.
The national association takes the matter "very seriously and demands full cooperation from Chen in the investigations," Xinhua quoted in a statement: "We will cooperate with the International Court of Sport CAS and will accept the verdict."
For the first time in history, the CAS is no longer responsible for sanctioning athletes with positive cases.
Also on the night of Rio, the news of the positive test at Danekova leaked, the 33-Year-old went on the offensive itself.
“I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive,” she told Bulgarian TV channel BNT.
She was innocent, "the only explanation could be food supplements," the athlete explained.
According to the report, the banned substance is said to be the blood doping drug EPO.
Danekova has been suspended for the time being, according to BNT, the B-sample is already positive.
Bulgaria’s Prime Minister Boiko Borisov immediately responded with criticism of the athlete.
"I don't understand why the athletes don't draw the right conclusions," he said, "We Bulgarians are under observation, so many have already been excluded."
For example, all weightlifters from the chronically doping-affected nation are not allowed to participate in Rio.
On Friday, the case of "Adrian Zielinski" became known, the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested positive for the anabolic steroid nandrolone like his brother Tomasz three days earlier.
Both deny the intake, but both are not allowed to start in the class up to 94 kg.
Before the start of the athletes, especially the case of Danekowa is another serious blow for the reputation of the entire sport.
The IAAF had banned the entire Russian team from starting, except for one exception because of systematic doping, and the Kenyan running team also produced numerous bad news in Rio.
In swimming, the previous offenses in China had also caused fierce disputes between the athletes.
The Frenchman Camille Lacourt attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang harshly.
"Sun Yang pees purple."
"When I see the 200m freestyle podium, I want to surrender," Lacourt told French radio.
Sun was also the focus of a confrontation with the Australian Mack Horton.
"I have no time and no respect for doping fraudsters," he said.
Sun had tested positive for trimetazidine in the Chinese championships in 2014, but only had to wait a three-month ban.
Data theft: How perfidious hackers extort their ransom
Programmers of blackmail malware are currently targeted at companies - and are successful in doing so.
According to a recent survey by malware defense specialists Malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, the UK and Germany, 40 percent of the companies surveyed have been victims at least once in the past twelve months, in some cases multiple victims of an attack with extortion software.
In Germany, almost 20 percent of companies have already been the target of ransomware blackmail.
40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ransoms demanded by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the attacked systems and data again.
The perpetrators specialize their extortion software according to the observations of Malwarebytes increasingly on attacks in company networks.
If they are successful there, the potential ransom to be extorted is significantly higher than for private users.
"We are currently witnessing a frighteningly rapid evolution of malware," said Marcin Kleczynski, CEO of Malwarebytes.
In 2008, most malware programs were still designed to send advertising.
Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for themselves.
At first, private users were the target, but the shift to corporate attacks has been alarmingly fast in recent months.
Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: once active on a victim’s computer, it searches specifically for recently modified files such as Word, Excel or database files as well as archives of images and videos.
These files encrypt the ransomware and delete the originals permanently.
The software then presents the demands of the extortionists.
In order to get the final encryption code to the files, the victims have to transfer money – usually in the form of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin.
But where private users’ personal photo database is at stake, companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases without which production stops.
The damage is correspondingly higher if a ransomware strikes.
22 percent of the affected German companies reported a loss of sales due to ransomware, 13 percent even had to completely interrupt business operations, in one case people were in mortal danger.
In Germany, several hospitals have already been victims of attacks, whose patients may be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records.
"We always say to the victims: don't pay, you're only promoting the problem," Kleczynski explains.
But 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay get their data back.
For managers, it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpetrators in the face of standstill in the company.
The hackers, in turn, know this and try everything to build a good reputation.
In a recent study, the security researchers from F-Secure have examined the user interfaces and the contact with the blackmailers and come to the result: The perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service in order to make more money.
They explain to their victims via chat how to pay via Bitcoin, set up freely accessible support websites or decrypt sample files for free.
And if private individuals are redeemed after payments of a few hundred euros, companies have to negotiate hard and pay five-digit sums to get their data back unencrypted.
In view of the potentially high and relatively risk-free profits from ransomware blackmail, the hackers are becoming more professional and sharing the work, security expert Chester Wisniewski of antivirus provider Sophos explains: "A single person can write a ransomware within about a week."
However, it is more likely that they are three or four people.
The programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software toolkit to the actual blackmailers.
The previous malware kits were created by purchasing the malware itself, consulting and additional tools for a one-time fixed price of between $1,000 and $10,000.
“The scope of delivery includes an adjustment tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed,” says Wisniewski.
The blackmailers then seek out more hackers to spread the freshly purchased software among the victims.
We live in a service economy.
So you log into one of the underground forums, buy the set from a criminal and assign another one to install the software on as many PCs as possible.
Payment is made per infected computer.
"Usually, the criminals then commission spammers to spread it," Wisniewski explains.
The risk of ransomware is now known to many companies that better protect their data.
More than 50 percent of company IT managers in the Malwarebytes survey trust in being able to defend against ransomware using file backups and scanner software.
Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.
“If encryption of data alone is no longer a sufficient threat to successful recovery, the perpetrators instead threaten to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations,” said Marcin Kleczynski, CEO of Malwarebytes.
This means that the potential for damage is many times higher than before, depending on the type of data.
In the future, the perpetrators could also target completely new targets in the Internet of Things.
At the Defcon hacker conference, security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control.
In the middle of winter, the activation of such a blocked heater could well be worth a ransom for some victims.
If the perpetrators then block an entire production line in a factory instead of heating in the future, ransomware could also become an issue in Industry 4.0.
One for each case
HONDA HR-V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
In the small HR-V Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupé and also the versatility of a minivan.
Sounds pretty cluttered, but the HR-V, which was built on the same new platform as the new Jazz, actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life.
Although the only 1.60 m high HR-V looks rather small, the passengers have a lot of space both in the front row and in the rear, it does not seem cramped at any point.
The materials of the interior are well processed and look pleasant, only the cockpit top falls off a bit.
The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles in terms of storage space.
There is not only a trunk of 453 l with high and 1026 l with folded backrests available, but there are the "Magic Seats".
This is less magical than it sounds: the rear seats can be folded up like cinema chairs and thus offer storage space that is 1.24 m high from the floor to the ceiling.
The boot can be loaded well, but the loading height of 650 mm is slightly higher than that of the comparable Peugeot 2008.
The tested 1.6 l diesel with 88 kW/120 hp accelerates the HR-V very powerfully in wide speed ranges thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm.
He should be able to do his job a little less.
The everyday consumption of 4.7 l/100 km is pleasing.
There is another engine: a 1.5 l petrol engine with 96 kW/130 hp.
All-wheel drive is not offered.
The handling is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.
However, the steering should be a bit more direct.
The equipment in the tested top variant "Executive" leaves nothing to be desired.
Safety systems include the City Emergency Brake Assist (operates up to speed 32), the Collision Warning System and Lane Keeping Assist.
The collision warner sometimes irritates because it evaluates many obstacles as "approaching objects" when manoeuvring.
The high-beam assistant works very reliably.
And the intelligent speed control reacts to the traffic sign recognition and throttles the speed if necessary.
The full connectivity is only available for the top equipment: 7-inch touchscreen, navigation, app integration and more.
Two USB and one HDMI socket are located under the armrest and are therefore somewhat cumbersome to achieve.
The approximately 29000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are fine.
If you do not want to invest so much, you will receive the petrol engine from 20,000 euros, the diesel from 23,000 euros.
The engines meet the Euro 6 emissions standard.
With the HR-V, Honda offers a versatile and everyday car.
Airline is not liable: crash on passenger bridge
An airline is not liable for a passenger’s fall on the passenger bridge.
The Düsseldorf Higher Regional Court argued that liability is only conceivable in the case of hazards that are typical for air traffic (Az.: 18 U 124/14).
The plaintiff had broken a kneecap in the fall.
However, the accident could have happened anywhere - it is a general life risk, according to the court.
The airline did not have to pay compensation to the man.
Illness: When the organizer pays
Sick holidaymakers will only receive a refund after their trip if the cause of the disease can be found in the hotel.
However, this is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests show the same symptoms.
In the case under negotiation, a family was seriously ill with diarrhoea and vomiting on the second day of their Turkish holiday.
She spent almost the entire holiday in the room.
Their illness led the holidaymakers back to a defective sewage treatment plant, which allegedly polluted the seawater.
The family was of the opinion that the trip was defective - and complained against the organizer.
In court, the plaintiffs had no success.
The sewage treatment plant was indeed defective.
But the organizer only learned about it shortly before the plaintiffs left.
He had to assume by then that the seawater was okay.
He did not violate his information obligations, according to the verdict.
Especially since no impurities were found in the samples of the water.
The illness of several hotel guests - possibly due to contagion among themselves - is part of the general risk to life.
Out of 691 guests, only 38 were ill.
De Maizi<0xC3><0xA8>re said that after the violence perpetrated by refugees in Würzburg and Ansbach in July, many people were worried about further attacks.
The state must react calmly and decisively to terrorist threats at the same time.
What is certain is that our country will not respond to the violence of the perpetrators with hatred and division.
We will not grant this triumph to the terrorists.
If offenders have to leave the country faster, however, this increases security and also strengthens the approval of the population for the refugee policy.
De Maizi<0xC3><0xA8>re wants to implement the proposals until the 2017 Bundestag election.
He also announced a further reinforcement of the security forces, "in a medium four-digit order of magnitude over several years."
Sympathy advertising for terrorism must again be punished.
Video surveillance should be improved, the gun law should be amended in such a way that above all the purchase of weapons on the Internet is made more difficult.
The last much-discussed duty of confidentiality for doctors is to be preserved, according to de Maizi<0xC3><0xA8>re.
However, in dialogue with the medical profession, he wants to look for solutions on how to reduce the danger to the citizens, he said with a view to psychological abnormalities.
In order to counter the radicalisation of refugees, the Minister believes that better social care is necessary.
Teachers need to be better prepared to deal with traumatized people.
To prosecute criminals in special areas of the Internet (Darknet), de Maizi<0xC3><0xA8>re plans to use undercover investigators.
SPD leader Gabriel said: "The SPD is ready to talk about anything that helps to further increase security".
It is important that the Minister of the Interior has clearly spoken out against actionism.
"That was a slap in the face for the sharpeners in the CDU/CSU," Gabriel told the newspapers of the Funke Mediengruppe (Friday).
De Maizi<0xC3><0xA8>re had previously rejected calls from the Union for a ban on burqas and the abolition of dual nationality.
He considered a general ban on full veiling to be problematic under constitutional law.
You can't ban everything you refuse, and I refuse to wear the burqa.
You can talk about rules, for example, in road traffic or for witnesses in court.
Greens leader Simone Peter accused the minister of wanting to simulate energy and ability to act with ever-new anti-terror packages.
Left Party leader Bernd Riexinger said: "Fleet slogans and a tightening of the right of residence do not bring more security to the people of this country."
Better traffic flow on the motorway feeder
It regularly accumulates on the bypass road - here is a picture from November.
But that should change: the right turn lane should be extended.
This is good news for all car drivers who are stuck in traffic on the surrounding road every evening when they drive over the motorway (A 43).
The state road construction company will extend the right turn lane by 700 metres next Tuesday and Wednesday (16/17 August) in the area between Hammer Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e and the Weseler Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e exit.
Drivers can then thread right directly from Hammer Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e.
The big advantage: traffic splits up earlier, which improves the overall flow on the busy section of Bundesstra<0xC3><0x9F>e 51.
The CDU faction in the district representation Münster-West had the idea with the extended exit.
The narrowing of the roadway on the feeder is particularly annoying for drivers between 5 and 7 p.m.
On weekdays, the backwater stretches to the bridge over the Albersloher Weg and sometimes beyond.
The reason is the bottleneck on the B 51 just before the exit Weseler Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e.
From here, the traffic is only single-tracked over the motorway bridge.
The second track had to be rebuilt a good three-quarters of a year ago.
The reason: Static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer has the required load-bearing capacity to accommodate, above all, heavy-duty traffic in two lanes.
How long this bottleneck and the associated workday congestion will last, the responsible state company can not say.
However, years are to be expected: because the bridge has an official remaining useful life until 2034.
For the extension of the right turn lane, the state company deliberately chose the less traffic time during the school holidays, because handicaps are to be expected.
Traffic will pass the construction site on Tuesday and Wednesday in one lane.
Intercultural travel: cultural offers for schools
The international class of the forest school attended the play "The Invisible House".
The association Nima's and the Young Theatre are now planning a music project.
The Nima's association enables young people with a migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster.
The "Klasse International" of the Waldschule Kinderhaus has attended a performance of the award-winning play "Das unsichtbarige Haus" of the Junges Theater Münster.
In the context of the "Intercultural Journey" initiated by the association Nima, 19 pupils between eleven and 15 years of age attended the staging in the Kleines Haus.
Since the beginning of the year, the association, which has set itself the goal of cultural integration of young people with a migration and refugee background, has been offering schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project.
Most of the young people in the class came to Münster between September 2015 and March 2016 from Afghanistan, Iran, Serbia and Syria, among others, and spoke little German.
Thanks to the choreographies, the scenic images and video animations, it was still possible for them to follow the course of the action, according to the press release of the Junges Theater Münster.
The Nima's association, founded by Dr. Tannaz Westerberg from Sprakel, and the Junge Theater will work together in the coming season as part of a music theatre project.
From October to December, young people with and without a refugee and migrant background between 14 and 20 years of age should be given the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the fields of singing, dance, acting and music.
Offers for children and families in the field of theatre play and theatrical language teaching are in the planning.
The project "Intercultural Journey" continues.
In view of the increased numbers of refugees, the association expects many classes to participate.
Rain instead of shooting stars: hope for weather improvement
The weather has made the shooting star-gazers in the southwest of Germany in the night to Friday a line through the bill - but there is still hope.
The night was ill-suited for observing the celestial spectacle because of clouds and rain, said the chairman of the Welzheim Observatory, Hans-Ulrich Keller, on Friday morning.
Our hope is on the night of Saturday.
The weather is supposed to be good, then we will certainly see many shooting stars in the sky.
The stars are Perseids, which are among the fastest shooting stars at 216000 kilometers per hour.
They get their name because they seem to come from the constellation Perseus, which rises in the northeast.
Relaxing Night: Tips for Preventing Sleep Disorders
In the evening you roll around forever, at night you lie awake for hours, in the morning you can no longer think of sleep far before the alarm clock rings.
This is anything but restful.
After all, people are in good company with such problems: According to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than ten percent often or permanently find their sleep to be unrecoverable.
How do you express sleep problems or sleep disorders?
There are several forms of sleep disorders, and they can be based on a variety of causes, emphasizes Hans-Günter Wee<0xC3><0x9F>, board member of the German Society for Sleep Research and Sleep Medicine.
However, what is commonly understood by this is insomnia, i.e. a sleep-inducing disorder.
Many people find that sleeping through the night is unsatisfactory or insufficient, says Jens Wagenknecht, a member of the board of the German General Practitioners’ Association with practice in Varel, Lower Saxony.
What is behind sleep disorders?
The causes of sleep disorders are complex.
Organic, psychological or behavioural factors, but also drugs, can be behind this.
Not infrequently, the sleep disorder is an expression of another disease.
“Very early waking up is common, especially in depression,” Weess says.
And it may be that different factors affect each other.
If you have a herniated disc, for example, you can lie down badly, wake up every two to three hours and possibly start to think about everyday problems and worries, Weess gives an example.
This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.
When should I go to the doctor for sleep disorders?
Anyone who does not sleep well for at least three nights a week for a period of one month and is impaired during the day should go to the doctor, advises Wee<0xC3><0x9F>.
The impairment can look quite different: one is knocked off, tired, unslept, has difficulty with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood changes or physical complaints such as stomach or headaches.
To alleviate the sleep disorder, it is important to find out its causes.
Treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy or medication – classic sleeping pills only in exceptional cases and for a maximum of two weeks.
There are hardly any established sleep physicians in Germany, emphasizes Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary sleep medicine center of the Charité Universit<0xC3><0xA4>tsmedizin Berlin.
Therefore, if you have sleep problems, you should first contact the family doctor, advises Wee<0xC3><0x9F>.
He can check whether the problems have a physical cause.
Who should go to the sleep lab, and what happens there?
For examination in the sleep laboratory, doctors advise, for example, in snoring with respiratory failure, in case of pathological daytime fatigue, in case of sleepwalkers or if one does not find the cause of a sleep disturbance, explains Fietze.
You don’t really have to prepare for the investigation.
You should spend the day normally.
"Please don't take a nap," says Fietze.
After wiring, you go to bed at your normal time.
In addition to the electrodes on the body, one wears nose glasses, a chest strap and a sensor on the finger.
In addition, a camera on the ceiling records the sleeping person.
How can those affected get their problems under control?
There are quite a lot of adjustment screws that you can use for a better sleep.
Weess counts on: Regular sleeping and rising times, not lying in bed too long, not sleeping during the day, not watching TV to fall asleep, avoiding alcohol and not looking at the clock at night - then one immediately begins to calculate, and this is not at all beneficial.
What the jungle camp has to do with missing medals in swimming
The former German swimmer Markus Deibler has commented on the disappointing performance of the DSV team at Olympis via Facebook.
In December 2014, he won gold for the first time at the World Short Track Championships in Doha and also set his first world record.
Now, the former DSV athlete Markus Deibler has stood up via Facebook protecting his former teammates in the criticism.
“In a country where an Olympic champion gets a €20,000 bonus and a jungle king €150,000, no one should be surprised about missing medals,” the 26-year-old wrote on his Facebook page.
The support system in swimming is poor, while the doping controls are very good.
This means that we cannot compete with countries that are very supportive and do not take such a close look at or even engage in doping.
“I’m not saying that the controls should be stopped here,” he said.
If he wanted to start a comeback, Deibler would have to be registered nine months before his first start of the National Anti-Doping Agency Germany (NADA).
The same should be done with countries.
“Anyone who cannot be controlled by independent WADA/FINA controllers for a certain period of time before the World Cup/OS must not participate,” demands the Wahl-Hamburger, who now runs an ice cream shop.
Airport: Gang of Baggage Thieves Arrested
Professional Thieves at Dusseldorf Airport
Civilian police officers from Düsseldorf police on Thursday succeeded in arresting two women and two men aged 50 to 61.
The suspects had committed several bag and luggage thefts as a gang.
Around 9.30 p.m., civilian officials in the area of Düsseldorf Airport recognized a gang known to the police from past theft crimes.
The two women and two men had committed several offences since mid-July of this year and had acted in a collaborative, labor-sharing and particularly professional manner.
The specialists of the Kriminalkommissariat 34 can prove four crimes to the thieves who had entered Germany specifically to commit crimes.
In total, they had captured more than 15,000 euros.
Old buildings, a few lime trees, in between a remnant of cobblestones: The Rigaer Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not seem so at first glance, but the police count it as one of the "dangerous places" of the city.
If you walk along the road from east to west, you will pass playgrounds, a freshly painted kindergarten and an organic shop.
Someone sprayed "ugly!" on the facade of a gray house.
Opposite of a Lidl, which is also to be demolished soon, is already being built: By 2017, a house with high windows and 133 new rental apartments is to be built here.
In recent weeks, however, articles about this "trendy district", as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain calls them, have been preferably illustrated with burning cars.
The reason is the house with the number 94: Once it was occupied, meanwhile the residents have leases, but on the ground floor still rooms are occupied and are used for events.
Berlin’s interior senator Henkel, in particular, has spoken out several times since the beginning of the year for a tough police action against the project, calling the area a “no-go zone” for police officers and the 94 as a starting point for autonomous violence.
After the premises on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, with 300 police officers were cleared on June 22, the police patrolled for three weeks with 30 to 40 officers and three crew cars on site, blocked parts of the road and prevented visitors from entering the house with the number 94.
Meanwhile, construction workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown homeowners.
On July 13, a Berlin administrative court ruled that the eviction had been illegal, and a day later, police and construction workers left under the jubilation of sympathizers and residents.
On this summer afternoon, the street seems peaceful: parents go for a walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others talk in front of Sp<0xC3><0xA4>ti.
In the immediate vicinity of the house projects are a primary school and kindergartens.
Left-wing violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in the neighbourhood since 1999, and Jana*, who raises three children here, are particularly annoyed by the police presence.
With the residents of the house projects, they share the concern of rising rents and gentrification.
It doesn’t sound like a neighborhood that mostly wanted police protection from vandalizing leftists.
The ditch that the Berlin senator and the police open between squatters and their neighbors does not seem to exist.
Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working class district, which even today has a low average income and a high risk of poverty compared to the rest of the city.
House occupations and the resulting housing projects have long been part of the neighbourhood: in 1990, numerous houses in the former GDR were occupied, including almost the entire Mainzer Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e very close to the Rigaer.
While the Mainzers had been cleared in a real street battle under a large police force, many of the projects in Riga were legalized and are still partly inhabited by the people who occupied them 26 years ago.
At the same time, the district has increasingly become a magnet for tourists and electoral Berliners from all over the world in recent years: with them, residents from the GDR and former squatters share their neighbourhood.
This is also reflected in the rents, which have risen by almost 60 percent in new rentals since 2009.
Many of the new buildings in Riga are being attacked as symbols of this development: they can be recognized by panes thrown in or freshly painted facades that have been hurled with color bags.
No other road has been mentioned so often this year along with the words “left-wing autonomous violence.”
One reason that not all neighbors see this as a problem may be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: According to statistics, crimes such as assault are almost exclusively directed against police officers.
The majority of the crimes are property damage, which tends to hit the new buildings and newly renovated houses.
For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in a tenement for 17 years next to the controversial 94, there can be no question of uncertainty.
As far as violence is concerned, she is appeasing: the people in the 94 are her neighbors, they certainly weren’t.
Even the famous burning cars are no longer available directly in Riga.
For the studied architect, her street is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary: "Here you help each other, live together on the street and get more from each other than elsewhere".
Neugebauer deliberately moved to Rigaer Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e – and stayed.
That’s why it was so important to her that the residents get their street back: from the police, the politics and the media, who in July all of a sudden claimed the interpretive sovereignty over the district.
But in the eyes of residents such as Neugebauer, the road continues to be taken away from them: through faceless new buildings in former building gaps that displace the old residents.
"These are, after all, condominiums that are not interesting for many here - people who are not so well-heeled live here," she says.
"I absolutely cannot condone violence and destruction."
But what to do if no one ever listens to you?
There is frustration on all sides, also with the police and the residents.
Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding for newcomers who are angry about colour bombs: the house projects and the left scene belonged to the neighbourhood.
Anyone who moves here should be aware of this - just like someone who moves to a pub district can complain badly about noise there.

Urbach: Annika Deuschle is the new refugee officer
Annika Deuschle is the contact person in terms of integration and organizer.
She is also a local social worker.
Since July, Annika Deuschle has been the refugee representative for Urbach.
The social pedagogue supports the team of the administration around Achim Grockenberger.
She sees herself as the contact person for all actors: refugees, the Refugee Aid Working Group, administration, authorities and anyone else involved.
Regine Kunde from the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle is now there, the egg-laying woolly milk sauce, which has a problem above all.
For example, some had meant - less mockingly but rather aiming at the multitude of desired areas of responsibility - when the administration wanted to tender the position.
We were looking for an administrative specialist with a talent for languages and people, combined with many years of experience in the field of social work, just an egg-laying Wollmilchsau.
But administrative work is not her central area, says Annika Deuschle.
Above all, it is about organization, working with the people on site and also behind the scenes as well as networking activities.
The 31-year-old has been with us for about six weeks.
It has a 50 percent job for three years.
"It was high time," says Regine Kunde, that Annika Deuschle supports honorary and full-time actors.
There are big and small problems, organizational, human and communication problems.
Soon there will be new containers in the Wasenstra<0xC3><0x9F>e
It has been a serious problem for some time to find housing for the following refugees who have been recognized.
The municipalities are responsible for the connection accommodation.
They must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented accommodation.
The costs of building, renting or renovating these accommodations must be borne by the municipalities themselves.
The responsibility changes from the district office to the municipality and job center.
Problem: There are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.
The search has been very difficult for some time.
De facto, the administration does not find private housing.
It does not work so far, but you are dependent on private apartments, according to Deuschle.
Therefore, communal apartments must be improved, as it is so beautifully said.
So soon new containers will be set up in the Wasenstra<0xC3><0x9F>e.
But it’s not just about homes.
Perspective is the key word, Regine Kunde and Annika Deuschle agree.
In addition to a permanent residence, there are internships, training places, school places, one-euro jobs and temporary jobs for refugees and migrants that need to be found or established.
"More places would be good," reports Regine Kunde.
Many work in the building yard or help janitors, do charitable work - and this is motivated and very neat, as Annika Deuschle reports.
She hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive external impact.
This is not “employment therapy.”
But work doesn’t just mean work.
The day needs a firm structure, say Deuschle and customer.
People need to develop a sense of belonging.
So it needs offers such as sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses.
Professional courses are rare.
So here, too, administration and volunteers are stepping in.
It is crucial that the refugees get the feeling that they are wanted and welcome in Germany.
The length of the proceedings is a problem.
They have to explain to the refugees that it just takes time and they can bridge the time meaningfully, for example with language courses.
Anyone who at some point develops the feeling that he cannot help anyone in Urbach, is not allowed to work and is useless, he will never integrate.
The vast majority are motivated.
But there are also problem cases, says Kunde honestly, "people who can't do anything, so the work of Deuschle and Kunde is always to motivate others.
This is all a "mammoth task".
A difficult question: After the recent events, are the two afraid of radicalization, even in a small community like Urbach?
"No," says Regine Kunde quite clearly, "what some may call naive", but a residual risk cannot and does not want to exclude them.
But the helpers are already more sensitive.
These incidents are also an issue for refugees.
They were afraid that the attackers would bring them into total disrepute.
“They want to show that they have nothing to do with it,” says Regine Kunde.
Many would like to stay in Urbach.
Main and volunteers must therefore look for activities on site and in the region.
They always have in the background that a new shock of refugees and migrants could soon come to Urbach.
Does Germany need an upper limit?
To answer this question clearly, politics is afraid.
In fact, it’s unfair to ask for help on the ground.
“We have not yet arrived in Urbach where we want to go,” says Annika Deuschle.
No new refugees, that would ease the situation.
Regine Kunde also makes it clear that the Urbachers are already busy with integrating the previous people reasonably.
There are currently about 100 people, mostly young men.
But when people are in need, you have to help them, both women agree.
The political situation in the world is so complicated that there are no easy answers.
Schorndorf: Burglars wanted by helicopter
The police helicopter flew over various areas for about an hour - unsuccessfully.
Two unknown men forcibly entered an apartment in an apartment building in Lindenweg on Friday morning at about 8:50 a.m.
The resident surprised the two and put the ungulate to flight.
The two men were about 1.65 to 1.70 meters tall, probably masked, wearing both blue jeans and black hoodies.
They fled towards the city centre.
The police used several patrol crews as well as a police helicopter for the search.
The search went on without success.
Perhaps the unknowns stood out before the act near the apartment or during their escape.
Baden-Württemberg: Police investigating after rocker attack on snack bar
After an attack on an Ulm snack, the police investigate six suspects from the rocker milieu for serious breach of land peace.
In the case of searches for housing, evidence and drugs were secured, said the police on Friday.
Around 20 masked men of a rocker-like group had thrown bottles and stones against the window of a snack bar, according to police in July.
After that, they are said to have attacked two guests and slightly injured one.
Then they fled.
At the snack bar and the adjacent building a damage of 10000 euros was incurred.
According to the investigators, it is about a dispute in the Ulm Rocker milieu between a Kurdish and a Turkish gang.
