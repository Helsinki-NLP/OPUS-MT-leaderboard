Obama receives Netanyahu
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not exactly friendly.
The two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as Tehran’s destabilizing measures in the Middle East.
The meeting will also focus on the conflict with the Palestinians and the two-state solution discussed.
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been tense for years.
Washington criticizes Israel’s continued settlement construction and accuses Netanyahu of a lack of will in the peace process.
The Obama-promoted deal on Iran’s nuclear program has further worsened the relationship between the two.
In March, at the invitation of the Republicans, Netanyahu delivered a controversial speech to the US Congress, which was partly seen as an affront to Obama.
The speech had not been arranged with Obama, who had refused a meeting with reference to the upcoming election in Israel.
In an emergency call, Professor confesses to having shot his girlfriend
In an emergency call, Professor Shannon Lamb told the police in a slightly shaky voice that he had shot his girlfriend and that the officers had to come to his house.
Lamb was important to emphasize that his "sweet dog" was still alive and probably excited, and he said the dead woman's family contacts could be found on the cell phone.
Inside the house, officers found the body of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note scribbled on a white block: "I'm so sorry, I wanted to, I could undo it, I loved Amy and she's the only woman who ever loved me," according to authorities in the letter, and he was signed by Lamb.
There was no indication that Lamb, who taught in two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already traveled 300 miles to the school grounds where, according to police, he shot and killed a popular history professor, Ethan Schmidt, at the door to his office.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford said university staff heard the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
He said Lamb made the fateful emergency call sometime afterward.
Until the end of the day, there was another death: Lamb took his own life when the police surrounded him.
A day after the university shooting that forced students and faculty to hide behind closed doors, authorities are still trying to get a sense of what motivated Lamb.
The details published by investigators at both ends of the state, as well as what students and staff who knew him said, helped draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher.
Students said they were looking forward to his lessons.
Police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said he had no history of violence or a criminal history.
Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book he wrote, in which he mentioned the “wonderful people” with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History, whose faculty includes 17 members, and many students attended courses from both.
At the same time, there were some inclinations to problematic behaviors.
One student, Brandon Beavers, who praised Lamb, said he also seemed a little excited and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said Lamm told him he was dealing with stress at the end of the 2014-15 academic year.
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University for a leave of absence for health reasons, saying he had some health problem.
This year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in the university’s employment policy meant that the doctorate for which Lamb had worked so hard would not be a guarantee for him of an automatic path to employment as an assistant professor.
University President William LaForge said he knew nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr Lamb's imagination."
These are questions that Lamb can no longer answer.
After escaping from campus, the police later found Lamb's trail when he re-entered Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb killed himself with a .38-caliber gun in the backyard of a house about a mile south of his parents' home on the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi, Washington County coroner Methel Johnson said.
His car was still running in the driveway.
It wasn’t immediately clear why Lamm went to that house, but Johnson said she believes he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb began his work at the university in 2009, which has 3,500 students in a city of about 12,000 inhabitants and taught geography and pedagogy.
He received his doctorate in pedagogy in the spring.
One of Lamb’s longtime friends described him as intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamm was 20 when they met through mutual friends.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was the cool older guy who spent several years trying to teach her to play the guitar.
He was the womanizer at the time.
All the girls melted away when he was there," said Hairston, now 40 and living in the Jackson suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss were obviously together for some time.
In the distress call, Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but there was no record of a marriage.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in the brick house adjacent to a bayou in Gautier.
Police said the dog was fine.
Prentiss' ex-husband, Shawn O'Steen, said they were divorced 15 years ago, but had remained friends and had a daughter who was now 19 years old.
"She was totally devastated," O'Steen said of his daughter.
She and her mother were absolutely best friends.
O'Steen said he had never met Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail he had heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both performed at a summer fair three years ago.
Later they played together one or the other gig.
O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various companies online.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a dimly lit bar near Gautier, said he saw Lamb and Prentiss Night for the last time on the night of September 5 after Lamb finished his guitar and harmonica playing in front of a scanty audience.
There was no sign that anything was wrong.
“Just a happy couple,” he said.
We were cleaning up and joking with each other.
I mean, they both had a good sense of jokes.
Schmidt, the dead professor, led the freshman seminar program and specialized in Native American and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at the school.
He was married and had three small children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his Brotherhood and the Student Committee.
On the Delta State campus in Cleveland, about 900 people, including faculty, staff, students, and community members, attended a candlelight memorial celebration on Tuesday night.
Schmidt's wife Liz and his brother Jeff Schmidt also attended the vigil, while the university choir sang "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace".
Classes will resume on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students to come back," LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press authors Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report.
This story has been corrected to reflect that police now say Lamb made the emergency call after he shot Schmidt, and that Lamm in his emergency call described Prentiss as his wife, but there is no indication that the two have ever married.
Toys R Us Plans to Hire Fewer Workers for Christmas
Toys R Us says it won’t hire as many Christmas season employees as it did last year, but the toy and baby products retailer says it will give the employees and seasonal workers currently employed by it a chance to work more hours.
The company said it plans to hire 40,000 people in stores and distribution centers across the country, with 45,000 workers still hired in the 2014 Christmas season.
Most jobs will be part-time jobs.
The company said it will begin job interviews this month and the number of employees will increase from October to December.
While the holidays themselves are still months away, the Christmas business is moving closer, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to equip stores with employees who sell, ship and deliver products.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his "date" with Princess Diana
The premiere of Back to the Future was a big moment for Michael J. Fox.
It was also notable for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the theater waiting for the Royals, and I realize the seat next to me is empty, and it's gradually becoming clear to me that Princess Diana is going to be sitting next to me," he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary, "Back in Time."
The movie begins, and it comes to mind that I’m a simulated yawn and an arm’s length away from being on a date with the Princess of Wales.
"Back in Time", a documentary about "Back to the Future", presents interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as with director Robert Zemeckis and producer Steven Spielberg.
"Back for the Future" premiered 30 years ago.
“It’s really for me,” Spielberg said, “undoubtedly the biggest time travel movie ever made.”
"Back in Time" will be available on VOD, DVD and selected cinemas in October.
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon says his response to Russia’s increased military support for Syria is: “There is no military solution” to the nearly five-year-long conflict, and more weapons will only exacerbate violence and misery for millions of people.
The UN chief once again calls on all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban told a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the foreign ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council – the US, Russia, China, the UK and France – on the sidelines of the General Assembly ministerial meeting later this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He regretted that the divisions in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers “make this situation unsolvable.”
Ban called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in dealing with the crisis in Syria that they have demonstrated in reaching a nuclear deal with Iran.
8 polls that show that Donald Trump is to be taken seriously.
Some have tried to brand it as a flop.
Others dismissed him as a joke.
Some are waiting for a collapse.
But no matter how some Republicans try to pull Donald Trump down from the top ranks in polls, it hasn’t (yet) worked.
Ten of the last eleven national polls showed Donald Trump leading in the double-digit range, and some are starting to seriously wonder what it means for the chances of nominating the real estate mogul.
Of course, it is still too early in the election period.
No one claims that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.
Experts emphasize that at this time in 2011, Rick Perry’s leadership was handed over to the rising Herman Cain, none of whom won even one state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election.
But outsider groups like Jeb Bush’s Super PAC and the conservative business group Club for Growth are now recognizing Trump’s stamina and starting to let their dollars flow to topple him.
Here are some recent survey scores that suggest that the real estate mogul is not just a temporary phase:
Trump’s popularity has turned 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a Monmouth University poll showed that only two in ten Republicans saw the real estate mogul positively.
By mid-July, it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52 percent.
Now, six out of 10 Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say they have a negative opinion.
And these figures are held in early states.
A Quinnipiac vote in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans have a good opinion of Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy with Trump as a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would either be “enthusiastic” or “satisfied” if Trump were nominated.
Only two out of 10 say they would be “angry” if he were the candidate.
Only Ben Carson creates about the same enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they are “enthusiastic” vs. 40 percent saying the same thing about Trump).
Next in terms of excitement?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be “unsatisfied” or “angry” if Jeb Bush, the establishment’s favorite, became the candidate.
A majority of Republicans don’t see Trump’s temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump is widely criticized for his bombastic and insulting statements, 52 percent of Irish voters tending to Republicans believe the real estate mogul has the right temperament for a president, according to ABC News/Washington Post on Monday.
The same number applies in the nation’s first primary state, Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think he has the personality for a commander-in-chief, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Still, 44 percent think he doesn’t have the personality to effectively carry out his office, and nearly six out of 10 independents say his temperament doesn’t fit the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters are getting used to the idea.
When they put on their scholarly hats, Republican voters think Trump is real.
When asked who is most likely to win the GOP nomination, four out of ten say Trump is the best bet, according to a CNN/ORC poll last week.
That’s a shift since four out of ten put their money on Jeb Bush at the end of July.
Full disclosure: GOP voters did not have the clearest crystal ball in the past.
At this point in the final cycle, four out of ten Republicans thought Rick Perry would win the nomination versus just 28% for the final candidate, Mitt Romney.
Nevertheless, it turns out that a large number of GOP voters view Trump’s campaign as plausible.
Even if the Republicans rallied around another candidate, Trump still beats almost everyone.
Some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely contributing to Trump’s leadership, while anti-Trump support is diffusely distributed among more than a dozen other candidates.
But a Monmouth University poll in early September shows that in a hypothetical head-to-head race between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump reaps majority support.
He is 13 points ahead of Carly Fiorina, 14 points ahead of Marco Rubio, 15 points ahead of Walker, 19 points ahead of Jeb Bush and finally 33 points ahead of Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie.
It's a head-to-head race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to beat him?
Ben Carson would overtake the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypothetical head-to-head race.
A narrow majority of Donald Trump fans say they have formed their minds.
A new CBS/NYT poll on Tuesday shows that just over half of voters who support Trump say they’ve cast their votes firmly.
Of course, a lot can happen to change that, and no one can really say never to change your mind.
46 percent said they leave the door open to switch to other candidates.
Still, Trump’s strongest competition at the moment is from other outsiders, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they’ve formed their minds are twice as likely for Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico “rapists” in his campaign speech two months ago, immigration has been the linchpin in the 2016 public discourse.
Some are concerned that Trump’s bombastic language will keep key Hispanics away from the Republican Party and damage reorientation efforts.
But according to Monday’s new ABC/Post poll, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So as long as immigration remains in the spotlight, Donald Trump will apparently do the same.
Frustration over the government is climbing to new highs.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson now account for about half of the support of Republican voters, mostly due to their outsider status.
Six out of 10 Republicans say in ABC/Post’s new Monday poll that they’d rather have a political outsider than someone with government experience.
And they're angry with Washington, too.
A survey by Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three out of four Iowa Republicans are frustrated by the Republicans in Congress, with 54 percent “dissatisfied” and 21 percent “inferiorly upset.”
Munich, Sylt and Co.: The five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
Here in Hobookenweg is the most expensive residential complex - with a view over the North Sea Watt.
In the street, a square meter of a thatched roof house costs an average of 73,300 euros.
"The range of objects on Sylt is naturally limited," says the study - therefore the high price.
A new study shows in which special locations a square meter costs the most.
Of course, 18,70 euros per square meter for a student booth in Munich are not really little.
In contrast to Germany’s top residential areas, however, the price is similar to Peanuts.
The real estate service provider Engel & Völkers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential locations - with prices per square metre at dizzying heights.
There are several tens of thousands of euros nix - per square meter, mind you.
But good, who can afford it...
By the way: Munich is not at the top here for once.
Champions League: Bayern dream start thanks to Müller and Götze
Two-time top scorer in Piraeus: Bayern star Thomas Müller simply has a run.
A happy goal by Thomas Müller paved the way for FC Bayern to a well-deserved 3-0 win at Olympiakos Piraeus - then it ran.
A sovereign start to the Champions League season.
World champions Thomas Müller and Mario Götze have given FC Bayern a dream start to the "Mission Milan" in the cauldron of Piraeus.
The team of coach Pep Guardiola won their opening match in the Champions League with the Greek record champion Olympiakos in a hot atmosphere thanks to Müller's double pack (52./90.+2) and Götze's goal (89.) earned with 3:0 (0:0).
The twelfth starting success in series will be the first step towards the final on 28 May 2016 in Italy, where Guardiola wants to finally bring the Henkelpott to Munich in the third attempt.
In his 28th goal in the Champions League for the Bayern leadership, Müller received kind help from Olympiakos goalkeeper Roberto, who let a shot of the world champion, imagined as a flank, pass.
"We will not underestimate them," Bayern captain Philipp Lahm had promised before the game in the Karaiskakis Stadium in front of 31,688 hot-blooded fans - and the Munich kept his word.
They showed a concentrated and committed performance without shining.
Piraeus had won their most recent six home games in the premier league, including against well-known clubs such as Manchester United, Atlético Madrid or Juventus Turin.
In 2011, Borussia Dortmund (1:3) also stumbled here.
But Bayern, undefeated in seven European Cup matches with Greek teams, did not want to be the next victim.
They were courageous, but often too unimaginative in their offensive efforts.
The attacks were too often initiated by a game shift on left-winger Douglas Costa, who rarely got through against the former Braunschweig player Omar Elabdellaoui.
Müller was more lucky from the right when his flank from the right half field hit the left upper toreck.
In the 67th minute, the world champion gave the possible 2-0.
The best opportunities in half one had Robert Lewandowski.
First, when Olympiacos striker Ideye Brown hit the Pole's header off the line (26th).
Then by direct acceptance, the goalkeeper Roberto parried with the knee (35.).
Although the Bavarians played their usual dominant game, Piraeus was able to make pin stitches.
But goalkeeper Manuel Neuer was reliable.
So when he pointed a shot from Ideye across the bar (56.).
Before Neuer, Guardiola had a four-string defense with David Alaba in the center next to Jerome Boateng, who did well.
Mario Götze, back in the squad after muscular problems, initially sat outside.
The World Cup hero gave the green light only after the final training, said sports director Matthias Sammer at "Sky": "If you want to make something different from it, that is already malicious".
Guardiola also decided against him at the first change, when he brought Kingsley Coman for the battered Lewandowski (59.).
Götze came late for Arturo Vidal (76th) and made everything clear 13 minutes later, Müller added one more penalty.
Before the game, there were riots in the stadium.
After a smaller group of partly masked Bayern fans in their spectator block had apparently provoked the supporters of host Piraeus with words and gestures, the security forces intervened and proceeded with batons against the Munich supporters.
At least one Bayern fan was transported out of the stadium.
People who smoke have a higher risk of losing teeth.
Smoking damages not only the lungs, but also the teeth - this is what a long-term study in Potsdam suggests.
The good news is that if you give up, the risk goes down quickly.
Smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early.
This is the result of a long-term study by an international research team, including several employees of the German Institute of Human Nutrition (DIfE) in Potsdam.
Compared to non-smokers, smokers were 2.5 to 3.6 times more likely to lose their teeth prematurely.
The scientists had observed more than 23,300 participants.
The main causes of tooth loss are tooth decay and inflammation of the gums, the DIfE emphasizes.
For this periodontitis, smoking is a risk factor, the authors emphasize.
The link between smoking and tooth loss is therefore attributable to more frequent gingivitis in smokers.
It is unclear to what extent smoking also increases the risk of caries.
However, people who quit smoking may reduce their risk within a short period of time, write the researchers in the "Journal of Dental Research".
However, it could take more than ten years for the risk to fall back to the level of non-smokers, explained first author Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham.
You have to convince people to become non-smokers, said study leader Heiner Boeing of the DIfE: "Smoking shortens the lifetime."
Not smoking is good for the lungs and vessels and, according to our findings, also leads to good dental health into old age.
In Germany, more than 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years are affected by toothlessness, the DIfE said.
Previous research has already indicated that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss.
The new long-term study confirmed the findings.
Archaeologists encounter remains from Late Antiquity on the banks of the Rhine in Cologne
Archaeological finds have been made again on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne.
Near the construction site for the new Rheinboulevard, archaeologists from the Romano-Germanic Museum have unearthed skeletons and remains of historic buildings, museum director Marcus Trier said Tuesday.
Since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine, historians have been looking for so-called ground monuments.
In all construction projects in the district of Cologne, the museum is always involved as a specialist office for archaeological monument preservation.
In the third construction phase of the Rheinboulevard, the archaeologists were now able to find what they were looking for.
It was already known from textual documents that a fortress stood on the site in the 4th century and a church in the 8th century, Trier explained.
In addition to the remains of the fortress and the church tower, a cemetery with around 350 graves was discovered, which probably belonged to the church.
Young woman caught by freight train
After a young woman has died at the train station in Geilenkirchen-Lindern, the Federal Police asks the population for help.
Early on Wednesday morning at around 1.40 a.m., the woman from the direction of the station building, coming at the end of the platform, crossed the tracks and was caught by a freight train coming from the direction of Mönchengladbach.
By recording the train, she has suffered the most serious injuries, according to the Federal Police.
She was treated by a local doctor and taken to a hospital by rescue workers.
The investigating officials have no knowledge of the reason for the night track crossing of the young woman.
The incident may have been witnessed by witnesses or local residents may have heard acoustic perceptions.
Residents or passersby of Linderner Bahn, Ziegelb<0xC3><0xA4>ckerweg, Thomashofstra<0xC3><0x9F>e and Leiffarther Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e (L364) are eligible.
Information about the cause of the accident can be provided at the 24-hour and free hotline of the Federal Police on telephone 0800/6888000 or any other police department.
EU Commission proposes new court in dispute over TTIP
In order to defuse the dispute over the planned transatlantic free trade agreement TTIP, the EU Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbitration system.
The controversial private arbitration institutions for disputes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system, which in its functioning corresponds to significantly more traditional courts.
"We want to set up a system that citizens trust," said Commissioner Cecilia Malmström.
Sweden plans to introduce the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US.
The German government announced support.
TTIP aims to create the world’s largest free trade zone with 800 million people.
The plans to reform the current arbitrations provide in concrete terms that the EU states and the US jointly select independent judges for a new investment court.
They are said to come in equal parts from the EU, the USA and third countries.
For the first time, a second instance is planned.
It would allow for appeals against judgments.
So far, the parties to the proceedings have agreed among themselves on arbitrators, there was no possibility of objection to their judgments.
In the discussion of recent months, it has become clear that citizens did not trust the old ISDS system in terms of fairness and justice, Malmström commented.
In the long term, she wants to work towards an international investment court.
There, for example, disputes between Chinese companies and EU states could be resolved.
Investor-State Arbitration (ISDS) is one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TTIP.
The traditional arbitration courts are criticized by opponents as a kind of parallel justice, through which companies can obtain damages at the expense of taxpayers, evade national laws or enforce a reduction in consumer and environmental standards.
In initial comments, anti-TTIP organisations such as Campact described the EU Commission’s proposals as inadequate.
Above all, it was criticized that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada (Ceta).
The German State Secretary for Economic Affairs Matthias Machnig (SPD) described the plans as great progress.
The Commission takes into account key points that Federal Minister of Economics Sigmar Gabriel worked out with other EU trade ministers in the spring.
The old system of private arbitration is off the table.
The French government also welcomed Malmström’s plans.
The European business association BusinessEurope warned against restricting the scope for action of the economy by introducing too many new rules.
Small and medium-sized enterprises in particular could be disadvantaged as a result, it said.
When talks on the TTIP (Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership) can be concluded remained unclear on Wednesday.
Negotiations have been going on since mid-2013.
However, the issue of investor protection has not yet been discussed with the US.
Initially, a framework for the agreement should already be in place by the end of this year.
This date is no longer valid.
Delicate Folk by Sufjan Stevens in Hamburg
Eleven years ago, Sufjan Stevens sat on stage at the Cologne Prime Club (today: Luxor).
Next to him is a flipchart, on which the shy-looking folk singer has recorded the picturesque US state of Michigan with felt pen.
The entire audience, about 40 people, is almost gripped by Steven’s presentation.
He tells about his meticulously and delicately arranged songs by means of various places, which he draws on the map again and again.
Where they originated and what it looks like there, in his home.
Since then, Stevens has proven to be a wonderfully creative lunatic.
With the 2003 released and third album "Greetings from Michigan: The Great Lake State", cleverly composed songs appear, which harmoniously nestle very close to American folk of the late sixties, but can drift at any time into the great opulent.
There is a rumor that "Michigan" is the first part of a daring series: each of the 50 US states should be sung in succession.
But already in 2004 and near the Rhine, "Seven Swans" has already appeared and positively breaks certain expectations.
Stevens appears reduced here.
Live is enough for him guitar and banjo.
A year later, the New York-based musician returns to the series.
"Illinois" ("Sufjan Stevens Invites You To: Come on Feel The Illinoise") is a widely acclaimed masterpiece released in 2005.
Exuberant with ideas and stylistic finesse.
The album enters the American Billboard charts and is not missing in any annual best-of list of influential music media.
After extremely productive experiments, Stevens then makes extensive use of electronic set pieces on "The Age of Adz" (2010).
This sixth decent studio album is still broadly orchestrated, but carried by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effect and reverb.
Long since the smaller clubs emerged, the stage shows here become a colorful spectacle of neon headbands and large fluorescent stage decoration.
Sufjan Stevens is currently touring Germany as part of a five-piece band.
In the dark kept hamburger More!
He mainly presents the theatre "Carrie & Lowell", which has been available since March.
Although almost 2000 guests are now trapped in their chairs, the much more mature Stevens returns to intimacy and folk.
Without a word to the audience, the group of excellent musicians plays through the broadly enriched album.
From the audience you can hear that the lecture is "opulent" and you can thus "basically throw away the record".
Only for an encore Stevens thanks modestly, plays acoustically few older songs and finally bows to thunderous applause.
Jeremy Corbyn's Prime Minister's Question Time Debut
Since his election, Mr Corbyn’s debut at the Prime Minister’s Question Time has been eagerly awaited.
The new Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is to make his debut at the Prime Minister’s Question Time and engage with David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will rise to ask the first of his six pre-set questions shortly after noon, with his performance likely to be scrutinized by the media and Labour MPs up close.
He called for "less theater and more facts" at this weekly event.
He also said he could skip a few sessions to leave them to colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Corbyn’s leadership, as it comes after his appointment as a member of the Shadow Cabinet and after his speech at the TUC Annual Meeting on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Labour leader’s decision to remain in silence on Tuesday while singing the national anthem at a commemoration of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain has provoked criticism from a number of Tory MPs and is at the centre of several front-page stories in the newspapers.
Mr Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem has attracted attention
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he had “stood in respectful silence” and acknowledged the “heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain”.
But a member of Mr Corbyn’s shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told the BBC Two Newsnight programme that he had advised the Labour leader to sing the national anthem, “regardless” of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers have refused to serve on Mr Corbyn’s top team, citing economic, defence and foreign policy differences, while less than one-sixth of the Parliamentary Party originally supported him as leader.
BBC Political Correspondent Robin Brant says that political differences are also "stacking up" within Labour, following Mr Corbyn's comments on the position on the European Union and the limitation on profits.
Mr Corbyn told the TUC conference that Labour is making changes to remove the whole idea of a limitation altogether.
Hours later, Mr Smith, the shadow labour and pensions minister, said the party was “very clear” that it was only against the government’s plans to lower the <0xC2><0xA3>26,000 to <0xC2><0xA3>23,000 limit.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader to face David Cameron, since he has been head of Tory, over the last decade beyond the dispatch box in parliament.
The Labour leader, who has promised a different policy approach, says he has "crowd-sourced" ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and has been given more than 30,000 suggestions.
The Islington North MP has said that the Prime Minister’s Question Time is too confrontational, and that he will refrain from both “punishment” and barbaric arguing, and has instead set out to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.
Mr Corbyn has said that Angela Eagle, the shadow economy minister, will represent him if he does not attend - for example, when Mr Cameron is traveling abroad.
He has also brought up the idea that other colleagues occasionally take the floor, and that he had approached John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, to discuss the issue.
When he became a leader in 2005, Mr Cameron said he wanted to move away from the politics of a “Kasperle theatre” style, often linked to the Prime Minister’s Question Time, but a few years later he admitted that he had failed in it.
Since it was first broadcast on television in 1990, Question Time with the Prime Minister was considered the most important barometer of a leader’s and his leadership’s judgment in the House of Commons and his position among his fellow parliamentarians, although critics have argued that it has become a caricature and requires far-reaching reforms.
'Shots in Joburg': Homeless youth trained to become photographers
Johannesburg’s city centre is a tough place if you’re homeless.
But a group of former street children has found a way to learn a skill and earn a living.
"I was shot in Joburg" (I was shot in Joburg) is a non-profit studio that teaches homeless youth how to take photos of their surroundings and make a profit from them.
BBC News has met one of the first graduates of the project.

GBP rises as wage growth accelerates in the UK
The pound surged after data indicating an increase in wage growth in the United Kingdom, while the FTSE 100 was boosted by the SABMiller bid target.
Between May and July, earnings excluding bonuses in the United Kingdom grew by 2.9% compared to the same period last year.
Since 2009, this percentage has been the fastest and most accurate estimate of the timing of an interest rate hike.
The pound rose more than 1% against the dollar to $1,5505 and had climbed to 0.84% against the euro to €1,3730.
The FTSE 100 Index closed with an increase of 1.49% to 6,229.21.
SABMiller was the outstanding stock in the market and made a 20% jump after receiving takeover offer from rival AB InBev.
A transaction would combine the two largest breweries in the world and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares were 0.9% higher after encouraging news from rival luxury goods group Richemont.
Richemont’s latest sales beat all expectations and also showed that sales in China – a key market for Burberry – are once again reporting growth.
Shares of Glencore rose 5% after the mining giant said it raised $2.5 billion through a stock sale as part of its debt reduction strategy.
The shares of the packaging and paper group Mondi were the biggest losers on the index, down 4.3% after Goldman Sachs set its rating to "sell".
JD Sports increased 3.1% after the sportswear company reported a pre-tax result of 46.6 million for the half-year.
The head of JD Sports says higher wages are jeopardizing expansion.
JD Sports CEO Peter Cowgill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean “more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers.”
But it’s unlikely that this purchasing power will offset the higher labor costs at his company, he says.
The cost could hit JD Sports’ expansion plans, he added, and that could mean there are fewer additional jobs.
Justin Bieber in the capital: On a Bieber expedition in Berlin
Justin Bieber, Megastar.
Lappish 21 years young, a H<0xC3><0xA4>nfling with super chic hairstyle.
The guy with the platinum-blonde hair is 100 million euros.
More like that.
Monsieur Bieber is currently in Berlin.
And the U17 generation is going crazy.
Like Wiktoria Rudzinska.
The 15-year-old has never heard the name Ritz Carlton.
It's okay.
Hundreds of fans accompanied Justin yesterday.
Including Ewa and Viktoria from Poland.
Since 7 a.m., however, the Polish woman has been sitting on the cold stone slabs in front of Berlin’s luxury hotel at Potsdamer Platz.
The Bieber Building: This is where you idol, whose posters are hanging in Szczecin, has been living since Monday evening.
The suite where the Canadian singer lives costs just as much a day as her mama Ewa earns in half a year.
If at all.
She says, "Actually, my Wiktoria would have to be in the tenth grade in high school."
"I'm fulfilling a dream for her."
Compulsory schooling?
Who's itching?
Not the fans.
Neither did Bieber.
He took care of it anyway.
For the advertising during the Superbowl's commercial break, he collected three million, a two-year deal with an anti-pickle company flushed many, many dollars into the Bieber account.
And with every doll that looks like him and goes over the counter, Bieber also collects.
When Justin Bieber drinks a coffee, you are amazed at the window.
He is said to have captured more than 100 million like this.
Some say the hype is going too far.
Others emphasize that Bieber is currently in the US and UK with his new single "What do you mean?" at No. 1.
Bieber himself, whose fourth album is due to follow in November, is not interested in the many zeros at first.
At least he does.
Pegida Poster Brings Lebanese to Potato Döner Idea
Potatoes or kebabs?
Both are possible - in the potato doner developed by the Oldenburg snack bar owner Hani Alhay.
Inspired by the saying "potato instead of doner" on a poster of the Pegida movement, Alhay has put potato and meat together on a skewer.
The idea came from a poster at a Pegida demonstration with the inscription "potatoes instead of doners", which he had accidentally seen on TV.
Since then, a skewer filled with meat and potatoes has been turning in his shop.
“This is multicultural for the stomach,” says Alhay.
The idea has meanwhile been registered by the Lebanese at the Patent Office in Munich.
According to the authority, it has recently been protected there as a utility model.
Alhay therefore does not want to reveal how much meat and how much potatoes the skewer contains.
“It tastes even better together,” he says.
Culinary understanding among peoples is also well received by its customers.
Metcash launches ground-based campaign to combat Aldi incursion
Metcash is trying to protect the IGA branches from an Aldi march in South Australia and Western Australia.
Food wholesaler Metcash has launched a down-to-earth campaign to defend the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in the run-up to a $700 million Aldi invasion.
As Aldi prepares to open two distribution centres and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening their relationships with local food suppliers and building the IGA brand through mainstream marketing and social media marketing, as well as events such as the Adelaide show.
IGA dealers and suppliers jump on board, with brands such as Dunsborough-based ice cream maker Simmo distributing samples in IGA stores and store owners selling discounted tickets for the South Australian Football League to loyal customers.
Metcash is expected to release further details of its defense strategy on Sept. 29 as the food, alcohol and equipment wholesaler conducts its annual Investor Strategy Day.
There’s a lot at stake as South Australia and Western Australia account for nearly 30 percent of Metcash’s IGA retail stores and generate higher profit margins than Metcash’s IGA network in the Eastern states.
Buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are notoriously provincial, and IGA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland – more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in the Eastern states.
However, analysts like Morgan Stanley believe that twelve months after opening its first markets, Aldi will snatch about five percent of the food market in these two states and take away sales from all existing players, but mainly independent retailers.
According to a report published this week, analyst Tom Kierath of Morgan Stanley estimated that IGA retailers could lose $360 million in revenue per year and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that next year, Aldi will open 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA, generating revenue of $500 million and $600 million in each market.
The loss in the food and grocery business and in the amounts on Metcash’s high fixed-cost basis could cost Metcash around $13 million in pre-interest and pre-tax profits, Mr Kierath said.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the Eastern states, mainly to Aldi and Coles, although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that IGA buyers are the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley estimates that Metcash’s revenue in the food and beverage business will fall by 3.8 percent in 2016, by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, and will reduce its market share from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, leading fund manager Hamish Douglass, the founder of Magellan Financial Group, told a business dinner in Melbourne that Metcash is likely to disappear within a decade.
Metcash declined to publicly respond to Mr Douglass' comments.
But it's assumed that a Metcash board member contacted Mr. Douglass last week.
IGA’s market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010, and revenue from Metcash’s food and beverage trade, which serves approximately 1,200 IGA retailers, has fallen by 43 percent since 2012, reflecting operational debt reduction with pressure on revenue and margins.
However, the wholesaler resists and invests more than $150 million to match sales prices with Coles and Woolworths on hundreds of products each week and to improve IGA retailers in improving their stores through faster-growing fresh foods and providing a better selection of private label foods.
Metcash CEO Ian Morrice says the price adjustments and store refurbishment programs will pick up momentum and hopes the wholesaler will return to profit growth for the first time in four years in 2017.
Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by the President of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves praise rather than criticism for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the “collateral damage” in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyrgios and deserves praise rather than criticism for his own behavior, according to the president of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented duo, repeatedly referred to as the "Special Ks", came into the spotlight through Kyrgios' infamous altercation with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
In a fiery qualifying game in Cincinnati soon after, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated twice by the referee, with Harrison exclaiming, "Wawrinka should have beaten Kyrgios, and I should have beaten the kid."
While he was last seen smashing a tennis racket after a spasm thwarted a potential U.S. Open victory by Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was steadfastly defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Groth for second place in the singles behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-final against Great Britain.
"One thing that I'm pretty excited about is the fact that in my opinion Thanasi got a little involved in the dispute," Healy said.
He broke a racket when he lost in the U.S. Open due to a spasm, but he’s not the first player to break a racket out of frustration with himself, and I know Thanasi well enough to know he’s not proud of it.
But, really, he did extremely well in the U.S. Open, even under the rather provocative circumstances with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves a lot of credit.
He has a great team around him, he has a great family around him, and I think he was treated a little too severely.
He is a very mature 19-year-old, he works very hard, and he fits into the team and so on, he has never had a problem with the other players, he is respected in the changing area, he trains hard, he is in good shape, he is a very stable and mature young guy, and I think he deserves to be judged by his own merits.
Healy also supported the decision not to take Kyrgios into account in the important preliminary decision that begins on Friday, and he describes the "joint decision" as the right one for all, but he assures the Canberra man to return to the team as a long-term fixture."
"First, we want the team to be completely focused on the competition and not on all the controversies around [Kyrgios]," Healy said.
And I think Nick made the climb very quickly, as people like Federer and Murray pointed out. He's getting in the public eye, and he's made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we're trying to support him, we're trying to make him understand the consequences of his actions. Some time out of the spotlight, where he can only think about it, I think it's appropriate, and it's best for him.
Europe’s refugee crisis: Hungary declares state of emergency, closes border, holds back refugees
Hungary declared a state of emergency and sealed off the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday, arresting all those trying to enter the country illegally, all with the aim of stopping the influx of migrants.
Chaos followed at the border as hundreds of migrants gathered in a no man’s land and Serbian officials reacted with outrage.
The people who had fled from violence were stuck for an unknown time in a strip of land on the road between the two checkpoints of the countries and built tents and settled there.
But frustrations increased.
When a police helicopter hovered over them, the migrants chanted "Open the border!" and shouted insults at the Hungarian riot police.
Some refused food and water in protest.
Serbia’s foreign minister said it was “unacceptable” that migrants would be sent back from Hungary as more and more arrived from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution and not a collateral damage.
Talks with Brussels and other countries must take place in the coming days," said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The turbulence at the Hungarian-Serbian border came a day after the 28-nation bloc failed to agree on a common immigration policy at a contentious meeting in Brussels.
However, the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people seeking refuge in stunned Italy and Greece, expressing their hope that eventually - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be reached that the EU states would take in another 120,000 refugees, including some from Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the continent’s immigration crisis.
Hungary, however, did not set its hopes on an early action by Brussels or its neighbours.
The state of emergency declared in two southern regions on Tuesday gave authorities more powers to deal with the crisis, allowing them to block roads and speed up asylum procedures.
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto, meanwhile, said that his country is also planning to build a barbed wire fence along its border with Romania to stop the influx of migrants through the country – after it ended a fence on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D’Agata reported that even prison inmates were deployed in the race to create the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a significant bottleneck and entry point into the European Union for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has insisted that most incoming economic refugees are in search of a better life, not war refugees who are entitled to protection – a view that is strongly at odds with other EU states, including Germany.
The new laws, which came into force at midnight in Hungary, make crossing the border or damaging the 4-meter (13-foot) high fence that the government had built along the southern border with Serbia a crime, which also stipulates higher prison sentences for convicted traffickers.
“Due to the situation created by mass migration, the Hungarian government declares the state of emergency,” government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We say it very clearly: Illegal border crossing is a crime.
Parliament has yet to procedurally approve the military deployment expected next week, but Associated Press reporters have seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs at the border for days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, national security adviser for Orban, said authorities caught 45 people trying to cross the border, while 15 others had already penetrated deeper into the country.
They come over by damaging the fence, they are now in police custody and are accused of committing crimes under the new laws.
Authorities are in the process of repairing the fence quickly.
Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after a barbed-wire train car arrived to close the borders.
Chaos surrounded the main border crossing near Roszke, Hungary, when the Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container to process people’s data and squeezed a crowd into it.
About 20 managed to get in, but thousands remained outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main highway connection of Serbia and Hungary, saying they would refuse food and water until they were allowed to enter Hungary.
2016 election: Hillary Clinton’s lead over Bernie Sanders halved in national poll
Former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double-digit lead in the Democratic race for the nomination at the national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders is gaining ground over her.
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of Democratic voters in the primaries (58 percent previously), while Sanders comes in second, with 27 percent (up 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he will run for president, receives support from 15 percent of Democratic primary voters.
More than five months before the start of the primaries, most Democratic voters say it is too early to say that their opinion is clear which candidate they will support.
But Clinton’s supporters are more consistent in their election than the other candidates.
Since the CBS News poll, Clinton has lost to a number of demographic groups, while Sanders has made some gains.
Clinton holds a big head start among women and moderates, but those head start have diminished.
Their support for the men has dropped significantly, and Sanders is only 5 points behind here.
Clinton’s advantage among Democratic voters under 50 has evaporated, and she and Sanders are now on the same level.
However, Clinton still has a big lead among the older voters.
Last month, Clinton was ahead of Sanders with a double-digit lead in the Liberals, but Sanders now has a 5-point lead in that group.
About half of Democratic primary voters nationwide say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she were nominated by the party.
A quarter would support her with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support her because she is the candidate.
6% would not support it.
Perhaps not surprisingly, Clinton’s current supporters are particularly enthusiastic about her.
Views are more mixed among those who do not currently support Clinton – only about a quarter would enthusiastically support them.
While 48 percent of Democratic primary voters say they support Clinton with enthusiasm, fewer Republican voters say so over their top candidate Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton’s supporters are asked in an open-ended question why they want her to be the candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), followed by the view that it’s time for a woman to become president (13 percent) and that she’s the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton’s supporters also mention her connection to Bill Clinton (9 percent).
Consent to dealing with the problems and eligibility are also cited.
As the vice president throws a potential for the presidency into the balance, 57 percent of Democratic primary voters want to see him in the race — though a third believe he shouldn’t.
When Democratic primary voters are asked who would be their second choice for the party, Biden is at the top.
Of Clinton’s supporters, more than half say Biden would be their second choice far ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton’s lead over Sanders increases from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 without him in the race.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance of winning the election; however, that figure has dropped from 78 percent last month.
Biden is by far a second in this measurement, but the percentage that sees him as the "most selectable" has gone up.
Nevertheless, when asking what is more important in a candidate, Democratic voters call questions about eligibility.
Similar to last month, not a single Democratic candidate or potential candidate stands out as unacceptable to these primary voters.
The Democratic candidates or potential candidates yield good results on some important characteristics among voters of their party’s primaries.
Majorities consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden to be honest and trustworthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities.
Biden scores the best in the three candidates on honesty, while Clinton’s strength is leadership.
Thirty percent of Democratic voters don’t believe Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many say that about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent have no opinion of him.
Democratic primary voters generally also see Clinton, Sanders, and Biden ideologically in accordance with their views.
In all of these measurements, about a quarter of Democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders.
As questions about Hillary Clinton’s use of a personal email address and a server continue to be asked during her tenure as Secretary of State, most Democratic primary voters are satisfied with her explanation of the matter, saying that it did not affect their opinions overall.
But it’s a different story in the American public at large.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with their explanation, while only about a third are satisfied.
Public opinion on this was divided in March, shortly after the problem came to light.
Most Americans said the email controversy had no effect on their general opinions of Clinton, though 36 percent said their opinion of her had worsened.
It’s mostly Republicans, more than six out of 10, who say their views of Clinton have gotten worse.
Although Clinton is seen as honest and trustworthy by her party’s voters, this continues to be a problem for them among registered voters overall: only 32 percent see her as honest and trustworthy, eight percent less than last month, and 15 points less since May.
62% of eligible voters do not consider her an honest and trustworthy person.
At the same time, 55 percent of eligible voters nationwide also view Trump as not honest and not trustworthy.
Clinton and Trump, however, get good marks on leadership.
Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson, and Bush performed best in honesty.
A majority sees Sanders more as honest, but like Carson, many have no opinion of him.
The error rate for the sample of 351 Democratic voters in the primaries is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson moves close to Donald Trump in nationwide poll
Ben Carson is behind Donald Trump in the latest CBS News/New York Times poll
The two candidates now account for half of the voter support in the new poll, and others are losing traction dramatically.
Republican voters continue to support Trump in large numbers nationwide, with support growing from 23% in the last CBS poll conducted before Fox News debate last month, to 27% in Tuesday’s poll.
But Carson shot from 6% to 23% over the same period.
The survey also found that Carson is well received by demographic groups and outperforms Trump among Republican voters with higher education.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, is teetering off with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, who has fallen the lowest, from 10% support last month to 2% now.
Former Florida governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee and Florida senator Marco Rubio are in third place with 6%.
The margin of error in the sample of 376 people from Republican voters in this latest poll is plus or minus 6% and was conducted in September.
The latest CNN/ORC poll released last week shows Carson rising in the polls — he ends up at 19% support among Republicans, behind Trump with 32% support.
The recent ABC News/Washington Post poll also showed Trump clearly ahead of Carson.
Looking at a Carson rising last week, Trump found some side blows for the former neurosurgeon, even after Carson apologized for questioning Trump’s faith.
“We need energy,” Trump said last Saturday during a campaign appearance in Iowa.
Pleasant bathing temperatures: The eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees.
Even if peak values are only measured in the distance, a trip to the Mediterranean Sea is enough for beach holidaymakers to still find warm water.
A bath in the North Sea or Baltic Sea at a maximum of 17 degrees should be a rather short pleasure.
Some people no longer go into the sea there: The water in the North and Baltic Seas has a maximum of 18 degrees this week, the German Weather Service (DWD) informs.
Bathing temperatures, on the other hand, continue to offer the Mediterranean: in the east it even reaches up to 29 degrees.
In the Adriatic it is 25 degrees in the top, in France 23 degrees.
The Red Sea in Egypt reaches 28 degrees.
Five members of the Brotherhood charged with the death of a Baruch College newcomer
Nearly two years after a student passed away during a harassing ritual of a student compound in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, murder charges are filed against five people.
Members of New York's Baruch College Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during an introductory ritual in September 2013, delaying his transportation to the hospital, which contributed to his death, police said.
Officials said he had been blindfolded with a 30-pound backpack full of sand, and repeatedly attacked as he tried to approach a target across a frozen field.
Mr. Deng finally complained of a headache, then fell unconscious.
The members of the Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood did not call 911 after Deng passed out, reportedly waiting an hour before they took him to a hospital, police said.
However, they had time to change Deng’s clothes, google his symptoms, and contact Andy Meng, the Brotherhood’s national president, for advice, police chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference.
"At this point, the members began to hide utensils and put the well-being of the Brotherhood fundamentally above that of Michael Deng," Wagner said.
He could not be revived, and he died the next morning from his injuries.
According to an autopsy report, Deng was repeatedly injured with blunt force injuries to the head, trunk and thighs.
"Too many families have been destroyed by the Brotherhood's harassment, and at least one student has been killed every year since 1970," Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng's family, said in a statement.
Brotherhoods and their members must be held accountable, and this move by authorities is very important.
A Monroe County Grand Jury recommended an indictment for third-degree murder for the first five members.
Thirty-two members of the Brotherhood, including Mr. Meng, are also charged with harassing and forming a criminal organization.
"We want to hold not only the people involved responsible, but if there is an organization that has sanctioned this - officially or unofficially - we will hold them accountable as well," Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College has banned the Brotherhood, and the National Brotherhood has revoked its membership in the local group.
This will happen if the Fed raises interest rates.
A rate hike is coming, and the bull market will falter, yields on bonds will rise, and the economy will slide into recession.
We know that.
What we don’t know is how long it will take and how long it will last.
In particular, history provides the economy with little guidance on how to proceed.
A recession came within just 11 months of the first rate hike and lasted 86 months.
The Federal Reserve’s aggressiveness in raising interest rates is often, though not always, a factor in how the economy and financial assets react.
Therefore, representatives of the US central bank have stressed so strongly that investors should focus not on when they start to raise interest rates, but rather on the period needed for normalization.
In fact, several variables play a role.
In the end, however, market participants might find that all the excitement about a rate hike may have been exaggerated.
“The Fed’s first increase since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of ‘cheap money’,” Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, said in a statement to clients.
In contrast, we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest rates to normal levels, but still to low levels to lead to the seismic shock that many seem to fear.
However, this does not mean that there will be no impact.
Here’s a look at how some areas of the economy might react based on historical trends:
As the market saw last month, anticipating interest rate hikes can make things volatile for a while.
Once the increase arrives, the impact is not so dramatic.
“There seems to be a tendency for asset gains to stall 12 to 24 months after the first hike, which perhaps reflects the delay in monetary policy,” Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study on what happens after interest rate hikes by the Fed.
More specifically, over the past 35 years, the market has mostly been in the uptrend — about 14 percent — on its way to raising interest rates, pretty flat in the 250 days after that (average profit of 2.6 percent), then back to normal after 500 days, with an average return in the past six past cycles of 14.4 percent, according to a recent analysis published by Bob Doll, chief investment strategist at Nuveen Asset Management.
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares tends to occur later in the increase cycle and the return begins to decrease.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but interest rate hikes often encourage them.
In the current case, the Fed is faced with some conditions that did not exist before and that could accelerate a recession.
What is most remarkable here is that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point in a Fed rate hike.
According to Deutsche Bank, with 118 interest rate hikes since 1950, nominal GDP was only twice below 4.5 percent.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent, few expect this to continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Interest rate hikes on such a fragile economic backdrop could be risky, raising the question “whether it’s different this time around,” Deutsche Bank said.
Market participants have been gearing up for a Fed rate hike all year, and all eyes were on this week’s Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which ends Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe the FOMC could approve an increase in this session, futures trading only gives a 25 percent chance.
"In our study, all of the increase cycles from 1950 to the present have occurred in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and eclipsed pre-recession highs very quickly after the beginning of the recovery," the report said.
In contrast, this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase.
The current cycle is by far the longest the Fed has waited since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and so far this is 74 months.
The fixed income was also volatile, as the market anticipates an interest rate hike, and the pattern is quite similar to that in the capital market.
The main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than on stocks when they change their strategic course.
For bonds, yields appear to change direction as soon as the first increase/decrease in the cycle occurs.
At the end of the increase cycle, bond yields fall immediately, Deutsche Bank said.
Charles Schwab’s strategists believe that the rise in interest rates will bring yields between longer and shorter bonds closer together, leading to a flattening of the curve.
High-yield bonds often bring better returns in such a climate, though “we’re still careful to expect higher returns,” Kathy Jones, fixed-income analyst at Schwab, said in an analysis.
What’s interesting, Jones says, is that markets have already adapted to Fed strategy expectations.
“In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are some signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of tighter monetary policy,” she wrote.
Short-term interest rates have risen, the yield curve is flatter, credit spreads have widened, and volatility has increased – all features of the market as the Fed tightens its strategy.
By and large, companies that do the bulk of their business in the U.S. will benefit as interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.
Multinationals with high debt will be worse off as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive in the global market, as well as financing their debt.
“History shows that ‘quality’ stocks tend to respond extremely positively three months after an initial rate hike,” Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report for the clients.
Firms with a strong balance sheet outperformed firms with a weak balance sheet by an average of 5 percentage points after each of the interest rate hikes in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Companies with high returns on capital and low volatility on their shares also outperformed their low-quality counterparts by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points) respectively.
Debt becomes a big problem.
Companies with a high percentage of flexible interest rates will lose the most, Goldman said.
Outside of pure stock games, consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar.
Savers could see profits from higher returns, even if experts disagree on how quickly that will happen.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, says Member of Parliament Andrew Bingham
The Conservative Member of Parliament criticized the station for its "dumbness"
He argues that he is increasingly indistinguishable from commercial rivals.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, saying they only imitated The Brits.
Parliamentary colleague Damien Collins attacked the show The Voice, saying that this was not very original.
BBC Radio 3 "turns" to Classic FM, claims a leading member of parliament and increases new pressure on the broadcaster to prove it is doing something the private broadcasters are not doing.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told BBC bosses that the public service radio station was “dumb” and increasingly indistinguishable from its commercial competitors.
“Radio 3 seems — I don’t like using the word ‘dumb’ — but it seems to be turning into Classic FM,” he said.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, which launched last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which launched last year, seem to be just under a different name.
So, if you're trying to do something else - these are two spontaneously mentioned examples where you're actually just imitating what's already on the market," Mr Bingham said.
BBC Director-General dismissed the allegations, arguing that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and educating the public.
What I learn from Radio 3, I will not learn about classical music anywhere else.
And there is a commitment to live music and making music that is truly second to none.
“And I think Radio 3’s commitment to finding new music and commissioning new works is really important,” he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Davey argued that harder work needed to be done to engage the audience than it has in the past because the British are less informed about classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production that came under fire during the hearing in the Committee on the Selection of Culture, Media and Sports for stepping on the feet of commercial rivals.
Tory MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice – the BBC’s musical talent show, which was bought by Dutch producer Talpa Media for an estimated cost of <0xC2><0xA3>22 million.
Do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - with Paloma Faith and Boy George as judges - was produced "in a special BBC way".
He added that he wished the company would “find a hit from our in-house stable” the next time it started an entertainment series.
However, he refused to exclude the order of further series of The Voice in the future or spend money of the fee payers for other entertainment formats.
Internet sales rose the slowest in August, and Black Friday may be responsible
In the first three months of 2015, there was a seven percent increase in online sales.
Last month saw the lowest result since records began in 2000
Online sales strengthened three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
Experts believe Black Friday slowed spending in November
For over a decade, virtual shopping has boomed, and many of the UK’s main shopping streets have turned into ghost towns.
But experts say there are now signs that online sales are stagnating after new figures showed just seven percent in the first three months of 2015.
Total spending for August presented the lowest increase in growth since records began in 2000, with only a five percent increase over the previous year.
Experts say there are signs that online sales are stagnating after new figures indicated only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015.
“If you look at the growth rates for previous years and go back to 2000, that’s always evolved over time,” Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG sales index, told the Guardian.
He explained that online sales increased three years ago when shoppers started making purchases with their mobile phones.
It meant that more people could shop online and that people could do so in different environments, such as at home on the sofa.
But now this is settling in, and we may see growth slowing down.
The Black Friday phenomenon, which was imported from America, is cited as a reason for the declining sales.
Experts believe buyers are withholding their purchases before this event, which takes place on the last Friday in November.
Last year, five times the average number of buyers flocked around their computers to make their bargains, and some merchant websites crashed.
Experts believe that Black Friday, when shoppers battled for bargains, could deter shoppers from making purchases.
A study by the British Retail Consortium found that out of <0xC2><0xA3>5 spent, just over <0xC2><0xA3>1 was spent online.
Some products, such as televisions and washing machines, now make more than a third of purchases through web stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of in the fashion chains in the inner cities.
Muslims Buried in Mecca in Crane Accident - Bin Laden's Family Is Sanctioned
The bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims through the streets at the first funerals in Mecca
Saudi Arabia partly blames the collapse of the huge Saudi bin Laden group
The health ministry said a total of 394 people were also injured after the crane crashed.
Hundreds of Muslims gathered as 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those killed when a crane collapsed at Mecca’s Grand Mosque.
Mourners, dressed largely in white, filled the stretch to pay their respects as the first of the dead made their final journey to Al Moaissem Cemetery.
The procession of mourning passed at the Holy Place, where only days before a construction crane fell through the ceiling of the mosque and then onto the worshippers.
The bodies were released for burial when the Saudi king imposed a sanction on the Bin Laden family’s construction company over the disaster, which also left 394 injured.
The corpses of 29 worshippers who were killed when a crane crashed through the Great Central Mosque of Mecca were carried through the streets.
Among the dead was Qasim Akram from Bolton, Greater Manchester, father of four, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane crashed.
Mr. Akram was with his parents before the start of the annual Hajj in the Great Mosque.
Saudi officials have already pledged that the Hajj to Mecca will continue with thousands who will continue to come to the city.
Today King Salman said the Bin Laden group should not have left the arm of the crane when it was not in use.
An Arabic version of the decree, published by the state-run Saudi Press Agency, said the bin Laden group was co-responsible for the collapse.
The English-language service of the news agency did not report this detail, but said that the management of the company is prohibited from traveling abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman vowed to reveal what caused the fall of the crane that plunged into a courtyard of the Grand Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered in front of the Hajj, which will take place later this month.
The Bin Laden Group did not issue any statements about the Krans collapse, and its representatives were not available for comment.
The Royal Decree also rebuked the group for lack of current security measures and for not cooperating with meteorologists.
Dozens of cranes surround Mecca’s Grand Mosque as part of the massive construction project led by the Bin Laden Group.
The Bin Laden family has been associated with the ruling family of Saudi Arabia for decades and is taking on major construction projects.
The late leader of Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, was a renegade son who was expropriated by the family in the 1990s.
The crash of the crane came amid strong winds and rain, just days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage required at least once in the life of every healthy Muslim.
Officials said 158 people remain in the hospital.
Government officials ordered 1 million rials (<0xC2><0xA3>174,000) to be paid to the relatives of those killed and the same sum to be paid to those permanently injured.
Other injured receive half of this amount.
B&Q Boss Says the Time of Cheap Eastern European Craftsmen Is Over
Britons are increasingly employing artisans, says Veronique Laury
The number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe has risen
As a result, 200 more Screwfix stores targeting artisans are opening
At the same time, Kingfisher will close 60 B&Q outlets nationwide
By Rupert Steiner, City Chief Correspondent of the Daily Mail
It is claimed that Britons lay down their hammers and brushes in favor of the use of skilled Eastern European craftsmen who carry out the work in their homes.
If you can skillfully use a hammer or a brush to paint walls, you seem to be a minority today.
Britons are increasingly employing craftsmen to do DIY jobs in their homes, according to the head of the company behind B&Q.
Véronique Laury, new managing director of Kingfisher, which owns the DIY chain, said that a large increase in the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe offering services at the lowest prices is now obsolete.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open 200 more Screwfix shops aimed at artisans and close 60 B&Q outlets.
Mrs Laury said she wants to employ more women in B&Q stores, as eight out of ten shop-buying decisions are made by women.
At the moment, the men predominate among the employees.
She said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends that have more single female households making more renovations than in the past.
Mrs Laury said: "There is still a majority of men working in our stores.
We need to shift this more towards a balance.
Basically, half of our customers are women, with 80 percent of decisions about women buying items.
Women play an important role in the decision-making process.
Mrs Laury, who is one of only five women at the top of a UK leader listed in the FTSE100 Index, has also restructured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions.
Kingfisher is almost the only company that has exactly 50 percent of the team staffed with women, including its management and CFO.
Mrs Laury said: "This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here.
It was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board.
Kingfisher reported a decline in half-year profits and sales after the group shouldered the costs of closing stores.
Due to the trend, Kingfisher, which owns Screwfix and B&Q, will open 200 new stores.
Officials of Aich/Dob for infidelity in court
On Wednesday, two officials of the Austrian volleyball vice-champion Aich/Dob had to answer for infidelity and tax evasion.
The defendants did not plead guilty.
One of them had also been charged with abuse of office.
He was acquitted of this charge in May.
The current trial has been adjourned.
According to Chief Prosecutor Robert Riffel, in the preliminary investigation, it had crystallized that the defendants in the years 2006 to 2011 used funds from club accounts, which they were allowed to dispose of in their functions, for private purposes.
The damage is estimated at around 400,000 euros.
Sports officials have also been charged with financial crimes.
This fact was ruled out by the chairwoman of the court senate, Judge Michaela Sanin.
It will be negotiated at a later date.
For the rejection of the infidelity, the defense stated that the association had at no time incurred a financial disadvantage.
The sports officials would have charged only expenses compensation and led the sports club, for which they worked from 1982 to 2011 and in which they had invested a lot of time and money, out of the debt - the liabilities in 2001 amounted to around 600,000 shillings (about 44,000 euros).
"At that time we were faced with the situation: do we continue to lead the club or do we lock it up?" said one of the defendants, in the bread trade auditor of the tax office.
Together with his colleagues and co-defendants, he then decided to take on this task.
With all the risks.
"We have advanced money, put our life insurance policies as security at the bank," he said at the interview.
It was agreed with the association: they can manage the money freely, only no debts may be incurred.
In addition, with appropriate financial success, the payment of the expenses compensation had been decided retroactively until 1991.
Therefore, a part of the expenses compensation was only paid years later, namely from 2003, when there was a plus in the account.
Therefore, flat-rate and not detailed debits also appeared, explained the former chairman.
The accounts and savings books managed the two defendants jointly, the second defendant said.
The judge asked why the payments had not been disclosed to the association in detail.
The association was not interested in the details of the financial affairs, only the freedom from debt was important, so the answer.
When investigations began in 2011 against one official for abuse of office, an amount of 120,000 euros was transferred to the club account.
This was a rebuttal, the defendants said.
This securities account ran in the name of the second defendant and was, according to his statement, not known to the association.
“Why?” the judge wanted to know.
The respondent did not know the answer for a long time.
Then he finally said that he believed that this was the best thing for the club.
If something had happened to him, no one would have known about this money, the prosecutor put in the room.
The co-defendant was informed, the official justified.
This transfer was formulated as "damage compensation".
Why damage compensation?, wanted to know the judge and prosecutor.
The first defendant then stated that he did not agree with this formulation because the association had never suffered any damage.
But what should I do if the lawyer says, "You're all out of the tailor with this."
"Am I a legal representative?" he asked.
Furthermore, the official said that he had never received a penny salary, he had only charged mileage and diets.
He had charged the association 1,000 euros per month for diets, but the actual effort had been much higher, he added.
The defendants were unable to provide accurate documentation for the early years.
After an audit in which everything had been assessed as correct, these had no longer been kept, they explained.
The second defendant had also received mileage.
All repairs were carried out in cash, for which he had to drive from his place of residence Völkermarkt to the bank in Bleiburg, he explained in his statement.
The trial will continue on September 23 with the questioning of witnesses.
Hewlett-Packard to cut another 30,000 jobs
In addition to the personnel reduction that has been ongoing for three years, the computer giant will reduce further jobs when the company is split up.
The job cuts at the US computer giant Hewlett-Packard (HP) are coming to an end.
As part of its restructuring, the US technology group is planning to cut 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customer division.
As a result, costs of 2.7 billion dollars (2.4 billion euros) are to be saved, the company said on Tuesday.
The move will lead to a special charge of around $2.7 billion, which will be incurred from the fourth quarter.
The reduction of 55,000 jobs in the last three years has not yet been completed.
At the end of the 2013/14 financial year, HP still employed around 302,000 people.
The Hewlett-Packard share fell 2.3 percent after the stock exchange.
The company, which has grown up with printers from Palo Alto, California, is currently splitting up: This year, the computer and printer business is to be bundled in a new company - separate from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies as well as other services.
Both business units are to be listed on the stock exchange.
A further disappointing PC sales as well as a weaker demand from corporate customers for its services recently added the world’s second-largest PC manufacturer after Lenovo.
In the third quarter at the end of July, PC and printer sales declined by 11.5 percent.
Sales fell 8 percent to just under $25.4 billion.
As a result, revenue declined in 15 of 16 quarters.
HP is responding to the change in the industry with a split and massive job cuts.
The 76-year-old company, led by Meg Whitman, reacted late to customers buying smartphones and tablets instead of traditional computers and doing more and more business online.
Whitman’s restructuring plans provide for a total reduction of around 55,000 jobs.
Conflicts: Majority support the anti-IS training mission
However, direct participation of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq would be overwhelmingly rejected: 54 percent opposed, 35 percent agreed.
The fact that other states are flying airstrikes against ISIS in Iraq and Syria is 61 percent positive.
24% are opposed to intervening in the conflict.
A cooperation with the Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad rejects 51 percent of the respondents, 20 percent would be in favor.
29% could not decide.
Car: Second Press Day at the 66th IAA
The focus of the trade fair will be on connected, self-driving cars and electric mobility until 27 September.
After two press days, Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 66th International Motor Show under the motto "Mobility connects" on Thursday.
The general public can visit the IAA from Saturday.
As two years ago, the organizers of the Auto-Verband VDA expect about 900,000 visitors.
Röszke: Outbreak of violence at the Serbian-Hungarian border
The Hungarian police have used tear gas and water cannons at the Serbian border at Röszke against several hundred enraged refugees.
Euronews correspondent D<0xC3><0xA1>niel Bozsik witnessed the outbreak of violence at the border checkpoint.
He reported by phone:
A group of refugees crossed the border.
A police line had formed behind it and a water cannon was ready behind the policemen.
40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones, sticks and plastic bottles at the officials.
The officers initially used pepper spray continuously.
The police then used tear gas.
A lot of tear gas was sprayed towards the refugees.
Thus, the group was dissolved.
The refugees have now been waiting for something to withdraw.
A pregnant and apparently injured woman was carried out of the area.
Children who had inhaled the tear gas shouted.
Other refugees collapsed and suffered from shortness of breath.
The press officers of the Serbian police also suffered injuries from the use of tear gas and pepper spray.
Time to decide on interest rates for the US Federal Reserve
The world is watching as the US Federal Reserve meets on two days, Wednesday and Thursday, to make the important decision on whether or not to raise interest rates for the first time in almost a decade.
A survey of 80 economists polled by Reuters found that a little more than half who thought last week that the Fed would do so now think the Fed will hold on a little longer and keep interest rates at the current level of 0 - 0.25 percent.
It’s a historic event because it’s been seven years since the Fed put interest rates on NULL.
“For the first time, we are approaching a situation where a large central bank may be leaving the zero range and starting a process of normalizing interest rates,” said Angel Ubide, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy is at a relatively good level of performance, trillions of dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only low inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore the less rosy outlook on global conditions.
It has warned markets to prepare for an increase, but the signs suggest that the odds against such a move are good.
The decision is due to be announced at 20:00 CET on Thursday.
Delta State University killer leaves apologies
After shooting and killing his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning—and before he shot and killed his colleague later in the day—Shannon Lamb wrote a note to say he was “sorry” about the first murder and wanted “he could undo it,” authorities announced Tuesday.
Police in Gautier, Mississippi, said Lamb, a lecturer in geography and social science education at Delta State University, called the emergency number around 10:00 on Monday morning.
He said he shot someone and killed someone.
Lamb told the emergency services officer that the police had to send police officers to his home.
He said, "I shot my wife last night" and he also mentioned that there was a "sweet dog" in the house but who "will not disturb anyone", but will probably be excited.
The police asked the caller for his name, but he did not give it.
Lamb gave no explanation for his gunshots.
When police entered the scene, they found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a handwritten note from Lamb, 45, stating, "I'm so sorry, I wanted to, I could undo it.
I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me".
After writing the note, Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a professor of history, before finally taking his own life on Monday evening when police surrounded him.
University President William LaForge said he knew nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr Lamb's imagination."
Despite reports on Monday that Lamb allegedly believed Prentiss also had a relationship with Schmidt, authorities said Tuesday that there was "no information, no evidence" for a "triangular relationship."
Prentiss was described as a "good person" by Shawn O'Steen, who testified that they had been married for about seven years.
The two divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.
O'Steen said he and Prentiss had a daughter who was 19 and she was "destroyed."
He said that Prentiss' daughter was "absolutely best friends."
Prentiss worked online from home, according to Linsday Knowles, who was identified by the Sun Herald as a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles said that Prentiss, who owned a dog named Lightning, had been dating Lamb for about three years.
“She always wanted to help other people,” Knowles said.
Police said Lamb called relatives at some point on Monday to tell them “he’s not going to jail.”
When police caught up with him on Highway 1 near Greenville later that night, Lamb drove his car to the side, fled on foot, ran into the woods, and killed himself with a shot.
Lamb received a Ph.D. from Delta State University in the spring of 2015, according to his life's work on the university's website.
Stars who have lost their lucky charm
The actor (left), in the picture with his son Redmond (right), had some stressful years.
In 2001, he fought leukemia, and in 2009 he lost his longtime partner, Farrah Fawcett, to cancer.
The actor also allegedly struggles with drugs, and in 2008 he was convicted of drug possession.
All of this will surely take its toll.
Eurowings: Lufthansa is reorganizing the Group
Lufthansa is planning a major restructuring of the Group.
The Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros a year with a better organization alone.
150 of the world’s 1,000 or so executives will have to pay for their jobs.
There are, however, new negotiations with the pilot trade union.
Lufthansa is reshaping its corporate structure and upgrading its low-cost subsidiary Eurowings.
The aim of the reorientation is to make a profit contribution of around 500 million euros per year from cost and revenue synergies, the airline said on Wednesday.
Among other things, Lufthansa will no longer have a board of directors for its passenger business.
The low-cost airline Eurowings should be developed as independently as possible.
Karl Ulrich Garnadt will be responsible for Eurowings in the management team headed by Carsten Spohr.
With the repositioning, Spohr underlines the importance of Eurowings, with which the Group intends to compete against Ryanair and Easyjet in the future.
So far, the organization of the 120,000-strong company has been complex.
The airlines operated under the umbrella of the Passage Airline Group, which provides three-quarters of annual sales of 30 billion euros.
New negotiations with the pilots
In the collective bargaining conflict with the Pilots' Association Cockpit (VC), the negotiations are to be resumed after the court-stopped strike on this Thursday.
This was reported by the union.
The topic of the talks will be the retirement scheme for pilots.
Cockpit wants to achieve sustainable results "in one year with a projected record result" as quickly as possible.
The conflict between the union and the airline has led to several strikes in recent months.
In addition to the transitional care of the pilots, the background is the savings concept "Wings".
In the fight against competitors, Lufthansa plans to outsource routes to the Group’s low-cost airline Eurowings.

Manchester United's Luke Shaw can't play for months due to double fracture
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg in Manchester's Champions League defeat at PSV Eindhoven.
While this will make the left winger cry and keep him out of the game for at least six months, Louis van Gaal does not give up hope that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The injury was caused by a reckless attack by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute after 20-year-old Shaw broke into the PSV area.
He was treated for nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said: "He has a double leg fracture and is in the hospital."
He will be transferred tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated on in Manchester.
It’s terrible – a boy who comes to Manchester United at 18, has it very hard and then plays fantastically, and then that happens.
In the dressing room he had an oxygen mask on.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, it'll take six months, and he won't play in the group stage.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno seemed happy to escape a red card and the imposition of a penalty.
Nicola Rizzoli, the referee, did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal suspected that the Italian referee was wrong.
You can judge for yourself if I say that a penalty and a red card were due.
It was a very bad attack with both legs.
A tweet on Shaw's account read: "I thank you all for your messages. Words can't describe how broken I am, my path to recovery starts now, I'll come back stronger."
Related: Manchester United suffer the loss of Luke Shaw in the defeat at PSV
With the European Championship in France, the England defender has an additional incentive to recover until next June.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV coach, said: "It's a very bad injury."
When a player leaves the court with this type of injury, everyone is very sad about it.
It is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent.
Moreno suffered a leg fracture when Mexico played against Van Gaal's Holland team at the 2014 World Cup.
“He’s doing very hard because it wasn’t his intention to hurt the opponent, and then when you hear that it’s a very bad injury, that’s not good,” Cocu said.
It was impossible for me to see the moment.
The only thing I could see was the ball moving in a different direction, so it looked like he [Moreno] had touched him, but I couldn't see the attack on Luke.
Speaking to SBS6, Moreno said: “I know how it feels, I know how hard it can be.
I feel very bad about it. I'm so sorry.
PSV player Andrés Guardado was also taken to the hospital after a foul by Chris Smalling.
Does David Cameron know The Lorax better?
It’s one thing all parents will soon learn: If your child loves a book, it won’t be long before you know it almost by heart.
Unless you're David Cameron.
When asked by a provider of childcare systems to name his favorite children’s book, the Prime Minister chose The Lorax, Dr. Seuss’ 1971 environmental fable.
It was a difficult choice, Cameron writes in a message on the company’s SuperCamps website, and continues: “Funny, moving, creative and with a powerful message, it’s a book I love to read to my children, because there always seems to be a picture or message we’ve missed so far.”
All well and good, except that the following paragraph, in which Cameron allegedly describes the plot of the book, instead reproduces a synopsis of the 2012 film version, which added new characters and details to expand the rather short original text.
"In the middle of the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted, hoping to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams, by fulfilling her desire to see a real tree," it reads. A love interest was Dr. Seuss, whose real name was Theodor Seuss hostage and who died in 1991, however, completely unknown.
As if that wasn't suspicious enough: The text submitted by Cameron reads in part like the summary of the Lorax film presented on the Internet Movie Database website and starts like this: "In the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted, hopes to win over the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams."
Although he admits to being a pragmatic father, it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the plot of the book that an unnamed boy hears the local environment being ravaged by the money-hungry, tree-cutting, Thneed-knitting Once-ler despite the protests of the eponymous Lorax, a crouching, mustache-like creature who "speaks in the name of the trees."
Most likely, such a relatively low PR task was delegated to a helper who did not read The Lorax to a child 20 times in a row.
A Downing Street spokeswoman said the text probably came from Cameron’s constituency office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron’s staff, but made no further immediate comments.
Adam Lyth was clearly threatened with expulsion from England’s team, but it’s still hard to do.
To come across Pakistan in the UAE is a difficult task, but if you see the squad that England have chosen for the tour, a repeat of the 3-0 Test series defeat is not on my map.
I wouldn't rule out an away win.
Alastair Cook’s site may be less experienced than the one three years ago, but there are good spin players in the batting lineup, and the community spirit is strong; they won’t carry any scars from 2012, just a youthful-positive attitude.
With the ball, Moeen Ali develops as a spin bowler and Adil Rashid, even if he represents an unknown size at test level, is an option for the attack.
Adam Lyth leaves the England Test squad and is replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to skip Adam Lyth is, of course, difficult for me as his head coach in Yorkshire to analyze.
In his seven tests, there were two good attacks under difficult conditions, and the simple but harsh reality is that cricketers are geared towards results.
There were no question marks at Joe Root, for example, and that led to the nomination since — and I said this earlier — players are their own best picks.
A long time ago, the course of Lyth would have been extended, but he was in control of his own destiny.
Hopefully, if he hits out more runs for Yorkshire, there will be another chance.
England coach Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude, even if he didn’t perform so well, and that doesn’t surprise me; he’s above all a team man.
The question of how much time a test hitter gets to set his mark is difficult.
Lyth got seven chances – like Sam Robson before him – while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got the chance to play home and away.
The only accusation you can raise is that England first used Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean – when Lyth was at his best – but that lost chance is now in the past.
Alex Hales comes in, and he's a batsman that I appreciate.
He is an X-Factor cricketer, which we saw at Yorkshire early this season, when he scored 236 against us on a Trent Bridge pitch, which hit us very hard.
He must be given at least the same chances as the one before him, but of course this depends on the team line-up in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of letting Moeen beat Cook, which would provide an extra spin bowler and get four quicks, popped up, and I don’t mind.
I don't see why a batsman can't hit there, and this left-hander has already shown that he's a devil's man of cricket players.
Moeen may not have done his job for his County Worcestershire, but he’s a number 3 for them, and there’s not much difference.
My former teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 Tests at the first drop before appearing as an opener in 2001.
He made three hundred runs immediately and did not look back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the squad as a back-up spinner, and in my limited dealings with him he impressed me a lot as a young man.
People might look at his stats — an average of 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball — and think it’s a punt, but there aren’t a large number of backup spinners raising their hands and the coaches have opted for youth.
He will learn a lot on this tour.
Aside from the team, England have made some wise additions to the coaching staff.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the batsman from Sri Lanka, as a consultant for the Test matches could be a master coup.
He is one of the nicest guys in the game, who will bring a wealth of experience as he has played in all conditions and against all attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful commitment to the setup.
I’ve always felt that he was created for the international cricket competition, as a player or as a coach, and like Mahela, he has insights that we can benefit from.
Sometimes new voices in the locker room can bring a breath of fresh air, even if the news is in line with what has been said before.
Colly’s teammate at Durham, Ben Stokes, is not being used in the One-Dayers, Root got a similar break against Australia and I, for my part, have no problem with that.
Some won’t agree, but coaches and team-uppers don’t set the schedule.
And you have to remember that as with the players, their jobs depend on the results.
Such decisions are not made with an easy heart.
The Brexit camp (Brexit = UK exit from the EU) could gain inflow if the economy falls into a slump by 2017
David Cameron’s untapped renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU will get deeper into trouble every day, even without the election of the brilliant Jeremy “Is it yes or no?” Corbyn to the leader of Labour or the TUC, who fought fiercely over Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their Corbyns and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomat friend recently said that some member states, as deeply entangled in various crises as the EU is and not always out of their own guilt, are fed up with Britain’s self-created agenda of split concessions and disruptive treaty changes that they mostly don’t want.
In Brighton, the TUC decided at its annual meeting that they do not like it if they endanger social protection.
We could also call it Dave and George’s selfie agenda.
Prime Minister and finance minister climb at summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument, with or without local greats, then come home and say they are winning allies for reforms.
It's always about me.
My European friend, who wishes for a Britain looking out inside the EU tent - "Don't leave us alone with France," says Berlin - and lets us see that more and more short-sighted ministers and officials in some capitals have come to the point where they don't care if we stay or leave.
Germany’s cautiously prudent Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave office before it looks bad for her, as has happened with the overly long-standing ones like Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France’s Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande looks forward to his re-election or his replacement in 2017.
He is also a fading force.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government, Spain a left-wing one.
It’s hard to imagine them ripping off a leg to help the selfie Brits, whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland’s exit from the UK – something they also don’t want because most have similar separatist tendencies.
Therefore, some such ministers may even intentionally be planning unhelpful remarks, entirely in the SNP style, during Britain’s 2017 referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process, my friend suspects.
"The renegotiation was a bust" and "Great Britain has gained nothing of value from the renegotiation."
Europeans know how predatory Fleet Street can be at their expense and which EU skeptics are the oligarchy of the press barons, as they were not during the 1975 Tony Benn-inspired referendum that supported our entry in 1973 with a 2:1 ratio.
You may faintly remember Boris Johnson, the arch-euro opportunist who made a name for himself as an “EU banana straight” Brussels correspondent in the early 90s.
With all his craziness, Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.
These included the medley of tax-fearing rogues, phone-hacking foreigners, and the pseudo-non-residents who own most of our major newspapers.
Tony Blair actually thought similarly about them, but found that if you’re sitting in a cage with a hot gorilla, you’d better hand out bananas to distract him rather than become his lunch and dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairian than Blair himself when he opposed Cameron’s vortex, because Blair had put the principle over the EU’s unadopted constitution, which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, opening a back door for him.
The press never forgave him.
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me a friendly pat on the back on Monday in Westminster – I told him he didn’t need to waste any more time for me – seems in danger of repeating Neil Kinnock’s boycott of Murdoch’s 80s strategy, a mistake then and now.
It may take time, but he needs to develop a coherent strategy to win the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position on Europe is - I'll put it mildly - in development.
He says we should stay in a reformed EU.
Well, most people outside of Ukip’s traditional blue dye tendency and the wilder climes of Tory’s little Englishism can probably say yes to it.
It's what Hilary "A Benn, but no Bennite" Benn said on radio and television this week, as the Boy Scout fought in it, not admitting that Corbyn's appointment of the provoking John McDonnell as shadow chancellor was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 1970s when his old father tried on television to be disloyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job.
Hilary's fight was even more attractive.
But fighting to stay “under all circumstances” — Benn’s expression — was not what McDonnell said, nor what JC told his fellow campaigners and MPs, according to all reports, at their closing session on Monday night.
Whatever the messy bottom-up image of Corbyn wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - news discipline remains important around the clock in the age of TV and above all in the whirlpool of social media, a hotbed of paranoia and betrayal.
It is right not to give Cameron a free ticket to Europe, which allows him to take Labour’s support in the referendum campaign for granted, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins probably thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbyn’s fundamental ambiguities about EU membership – in line with their Bennite siege economy, their anti-capitalist past – are no longer just a matter of esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents, for whom the narcissism of small difference is a central tenet of dogmatic disputes.
As with his ambiguities about NATO - Tom Watson is firmly convinced that JC will not launch a campaign to leave - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to find a sense of purpose for their superiors at home in everything.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspicious voters - to make concessions to the British, if all this can be pointless?
The US is already quite disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a reduction in the Tory government’s cost of power, which I was reminded of at the start on Monday of what was called the British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticize Public Health England report on e-cigarettes
Claims by a state-funded agency that e-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking originated from a meeting of 12 people, some with links to the tobacco industry, researchers said.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet by criticizing the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in their report on e-cigarettes.
PHE released the “Principle Report” last month, describing it as a “comprehensive review of the evidence.”
But some researchers have questioned the resilience of the data, pointing to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
An editorial in the medical journal Lancet last month attacked the “extraordinarily windy foundation” upon which PHE based its main conclusion.
Two other researchers write in BMJ and have asked if the claims are “based on stone or sand.”
Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of efficacy."
They said the public expects PHE’s claim that “the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking” to be based on a detailed review of evidence and modeling.
In fact, this statement comes from a single meeting of 12 people who were convened to develop a model for a Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) to synthesize their opinions about the harms of various nicotine-containing products; the results of the meeting were summarized in a research report.
McKee and Capewell said a sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose managing director is said to have previously received funding from British American Tobacco (BAT) for an independent study.
He also signed BAT’s references to public health in a sustainability report, they said.
One of the 12 participants at the meeting stated that they were receiving funds from an e-cigarette manufacturer, but not the funding they are said to have received from the tobacco company Philip Morris International, they added.
The reasons for selecting members of the panel are not provided, but these include several well-known e-cigarette champions, some of whom also provide industry funding in the paper.
Some other participants in this session are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by PHE’s tobacco management.
The group’s research “characteristically admits” that there is a lack of “hard evidence of damage to most products at most criteria,” McKee and Capewell wrote.
However, none of these compounds or limitations are discussed in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said PHE’s claims that “there is no evidence yet that e-cigarettes serve as a way to smoke for children or non-smokers” were premature.
Prof Kevin Fenton, director of health and well-being at PHE, said BMJ’s claims had already been responded to before.
He said, “E-cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking.”
Every second lifelong smoker dies from his addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are small in comparison, but that we continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public about what the evidence proves and what it does not, especially when there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people die each year from a smoking-related illness, and smoking costs the National Health System <0xC2><0xA3>2 billion a year.
By clearly presenting current evidence that e-cigarettes are not without risk, but represent only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking, we are fulfilling our national responsibilities.
BBC to give up EastEnders, former Channel 4 boss says
Former Channel 4 chairman Luke Johnson has said the BBC should stop broadcasting programs like EastEnders and The Voice, saying that commercial rivals would “give their right arm” for hit shows like the Albert Square Soap.
Johnson said the broadcasting fee should only be used to make the kind of programmes that are not broadcast by other UK broadcasters.
He criticized the BBC for placing public service programs, which are likely to be seen by a smaller audience, in highly controversial time slots against the most popular shows of their rivals and from broadcasters such as BBC4.
After BBC Director-General Tony Hall said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations, Johnson said he had been unsuccessful in trying to get in touch with the BBC for six years during his time at Channel 4.
"I have problems with the idea that BBC commissions or broadcasts programmes that would also be clearly shown by unsubsidized rivals," Johnson told the House of Lords Communications Committee as part of its investigation into the future of the BBC.
If you want to keep the broadcasting fee, which I do not think is a good idea in the medium or long term, you should at least put your production on programs that others do not make or commission.
They send The Voice in a first-class time window because they want to achieve the broadest possible support for their future.
The idea that nobody else would show this is a joke, it’s ridiculous, it’s of course nonsense.
Johnson said: “I don’t see why a regressive tax program could be funded even without subsidies.
The Voice is one such program, EastEnders is another, admittedly both in-house productions.
Honestly, other channels would give their right arm for that.
I am trying to see how this is going to be public television.
I don't think this would diminish the BBC at all.
Johnson, a serial entrepreneur who ran Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said the BBC was to blame for the hunt for reviews "because of the ambitions of the people who work there, and because they believe this is the best way to secure long-term support."
His comments on the BBC’s most popular shows echo what the former head of Sky, Tony Ball, suggested in his 2003 MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh that the BBC should sell shows like EastEnders.
Johnson said that the more public-law niche programmes "should go to BBC4, where you pretty much can't measure the audience, but they do their jobs, and they can argue when they go on their hypocritical missions to justify <0xC2><0xA3>4 billion in broadcasting fees, "Well, of course, we've created all these obscure programmes that no one has seen."
They put her in a window of time where no one ever wanted to see her.
On the broadcasting fee, Johnson told the committee: "I urge you to find a more regressive system in terms of terms of who can get the best value out of this.
Of course, you all think, we all think that you get a great value for <0xC2><0xA3>150 a year here, but for people who are a lot of money for the <0xC2><0xA3>150, ask me if that’s true, because they don’t consume much from the BBC.
Former Sky and Channel 5 boss David Elstein, who also testified before the committee on Tuesday, called for the BBC to review its Reithian mission to “inform, educate and entertain”.
He said little of BBC production would now be officially classified as education – he said it was 1% of their TV production and 0.1% on radio – and she should take an example at public television stations in Australia and Canada to change this to “inform, educate and entertain”.
On the issue of partnerships, Elstein said the BBC should do more in areas such as the Proms, which he said only a handful will be shown on television, and enter into alliances with commercial broadcasters to make everything available online.
'Sonogenetics' can control brain cells through sound waves
The video shows how the nematodes change direction the moment they are irradiated with sound impulses.
Scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by bursts of sound waves.
The tiny nematodes change direction the moment they are irradiated with sound impulses that are too high for human hearing to be heard.
The impulses work by turning on motor neuron cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultrasound waves.
Researchers read and write brain activity with light
The researchers said the worms showed the power of a new procedure called sonogenetics, in which ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain, heart and muscle cells outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that the procedure could one day replace deep brain stimulation, an invasive procedure that delivers electrical impulses into people’s brains to treat the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease.
Threadworms usually do not respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they did when surrounded by a liquid with microscopic air bubbles.
The bubbles, he found, amplify the ultrasound waves, which then penetrate into the worms.
The amplified ultrasound waves act on structures called TRP-4 ion channels found in the membranes of some of the worm cells.
The sound waves cause these ion channels to open and activate the cells to which they are assigned, according to a Nature Communications report.
To create ultrasound-controlled nematodes, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of their motor neurons carry TRP-4 ion channels.
When he applies ultrasound to the modified creatures, the sound waves are amplified by the microbubbles and transmitted to the worms, where they turn on the modified motor neurons.
The method has some similarities with Optogenetics, a groundbreaking tool that enables scientists to turn on and off neurons with pulses of light.
But Chalasani said that Sonogenetics might have some advantages over this technique.
Unlike light, which has to be sent down to the desired location in the brain at an optical fiber, low-frequency ultrasound waves can pass through tissues unhindered and can thus be sent into the brain from the top of the skull.
"We believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus, it is possible to make the targeted human neurons temporarily susceptible to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments," Chalasani said.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.
Illegal torture devices - right on your doorstep!
The ads embarrass Britain’s arms trade
Watch the Amnesty International Anti-Weapons Trade Show video.
Terrible killer drones!
Ankle shattering leg cuffs!
Cluster bombs!
And electric shock rods that cause excruciating pain but leave no trace!
The cheerful voice and cartoon images leave no doubt that this advert for the world’s largest arms fair is a combative parody produced by Amnesty International to highlight the British government’s willingness to sell weapons to repressive regimes via the Defence and Security Equipment International Jamboree at the ExCeL Centre in London’s Docklands.

But a separate campaign also leads to many posters that can be seen at bus stops and on the subway trains that require a second look.
"Important announcement: Do you ride DLR from 15 to 18 September?" (Docklands Light Railway) you read in the fonts of the London Underground and the trademark of the DLR line, which transforms into the image of a tank.
In September, a swarm of arms dealers will drive with DLR... customers are asked to help stop the arms fair.
The 300 posters are by artists who have exhibited their work at the Museum of Cruel Designs in Banksy’s Dismaland.
A collective called the Special Patrol Group helped distribute in London and used "Ad Space Hack Packs", a <0xC2><0xA3>6 pack of hex keys that is claimed to "gain access to around a third of the bus stop advertising space on the planet."
Transport for London doesn't find this placarding "vandalism" funny.
One of the parody ads produced by Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Crueol Designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists are becoming more critical and trying to bring political works to audiences outside galleries.
Many artists get to work with activists within protest movements and notice that they have to go outside into the real world for their art to have an impact on society.
Another of the anti-gun trade posters greets the commuters in the subway.
The Amnesty video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was created by the advertising agency VCCP, which works non-profit with the graphic artist and voiceover artist, who also works for free.
VCCP creative director Matt Lever was amazed at the silence surrounding the advertising for the arms fair – through a blank space on the ExCeL calendar – and thought, “Let’s give them the campaign they’re trying to avoid.”
They toyed with the invention of a more realistic shady corporate advertising, but "by bluffing with bright colors and animation, it sticks more strongly."
“They’ve done a fantastic job in helping us raise awareness about the sale of illegal torture equipment at the fair,” said Tom Davies, Amnesty International.
What we need now is an intervention by the British government and a guarantee that torture equipment will not be used illegally on our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art around the arms fair comes from the area within ExCeL, where exhibitors sell fantastic euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab reveals an order from the U.S. Army regarding "the AT4CS RS shot down from the shoulder."
This includes a "uniquely shaped warhead that delivers outstanding after-effect effects inside the target."
Whatever it does, it won’t be pleasant.
Eight golden rules for living in student dormitories
Eleven years ago, as a self-forgotten 19-year-old, I moved into a student dormitory, still believing in Berets and moral relativism, but only now do I remember the strained smiles of those I angered—and the numerous, lengthy complaints about others.
Most of what I’ve learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.
Moving into student dormitories ranges from slightly nerve-wracking to absolutely terrifying.
It’s tempting to chat: People tell you where you come from, if and where you took sabbatical, where you stand in relation to Corbyn, and why you “honestly don’t love or hate Marmite because seriously, guys, it’s just a yeast extract HAHAHA, I’m in my room.”
Breathe through.
And help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest.
It directs the conversation and helps you figure out the people you like unlike those you wouldn’t talk to, even if your eyelashes were on fire and those were fire extinguishers.
Leave people.
People’s rooms often turn into drink receptions, movie night venues, and communal hangouts, but they’re also the places where people dress and put their underwear right.
Related: Don’t Think About Starting a Relationship at College
Introverts receive rough treatment at the university.
Your room should be a refuge, but many student dorms form a space-to-space strolling culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifelong friendship.
This can be hell for someone trying to recover.
Nothing in the culture allows you to say, "I like you, and I want our friendship to continue, but you have to go away so I can get back the energy I used to interact with you."
Try to sense when a fellow student is exhausted from socializing - and send him an SMS instead of knocking.
Speaking of knocking, do it.
A guy in my dorms had the idea that an unlocked door was an invitation.
He saw some things.
Make friends through baking.
As you begin college at the height of back mania, knocking on people's doors to imagine with a plate full of brownies is less strange than the 1950s greeting "Welcome to the neighborhood, I've baked you something. So, and now please smile when I ask you a few personal questions."
Offering homemade treats is a great way to make friends.
Your roommates feel obligated to chat and may end up associating your face with a tasty surprise.
Of course, this depends on whether you are a decent baker.
Poorly mixed lumps of flour, sugar, and fat cause people to fall asleep when you knock.
Stealing food is a common crime in student dormitories.
Of course, stealing chicken is a theft, but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea as well?
Check with the dairy owner.
Chances are good that they say to serve themselves, even if they are cooking inside.
If someone steals your stuff, it’s annoying, and you have my sympathy—but try to deal with it more balancedly than my roommate, who added a dish soap to her milk to punish thieves.
She's in prison now.
You should not make any noise that will keep people from sleep or work.
It’s not just about being a decent person, but that you’re one of the people sitting in the glass house in the truest sense of the saying.
A girl in my hallway asked her neighbors if they cared to turn Drum & Bass down a little, because it was three o’clock in the morning, and she had a test in the morning.
They responded with even louder music.
When they finally stopped at 5 a.m., she kindly let her neighbors sleep for two more hours before letting her own music splash, shut her door, and went to her three-hour exam.
Wouldn’t it be romantic if your future spouse happened to move into the same dorm?
Conversely, wouldn’t it be abysmal embarrassing if you thought a roommate was your future spouse, hugged her, divorced her again, and then had to see her every day and maybe witness her pulling all the mutual friends over to her?
Of course, the heart goes its own way — but if a hot roommate is definitely not your future spouse, at least try to make sense of your lower body.
In the exciting moment when you notice someone has left their keys in their unlocked room, the line between an ulk and bullying is finer than it seems.
A good prank is funny, but it only takes moments for it to become a boomerang.
Teach a valuable and amusing lesson about safety by hiding - but never mess up anyone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock their door, and put their keys in a glass of water, which you then put in the freezer - but tack their possessions on the ceiling no more than twice.
Terraced houses for refugees, single parents, low earners
The real estate entrepreneur Markus Gildner builds terraced houses for people who do not have a lot of money in the middle Franconian Eckental.
For example, for refugees - but also as a signal: "Not only refugees need housing, but also the single mother and the low-income earner."
"I show how you can still build cheaply and well today," says the 44-year-old in an interview
Thousands of refugees will be forced into the housing market.
The entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes he knows how quickly affordable housing can be created: he builds terraced houses for refugees in one project.
Mr Gildner, many refugees will be pushing into the housing market.
What solution do you offer?
Markus Gildner: The mass accommodation in containers or gyms has no sustainability.
For the most part, people stay here.
In view of the refugee flow, we will also need sufficient housing in the coming decades.
A completely banal, three-storey terraced house is the solution.
Gildner: A terraced house needs the least space.
It facilitates integration.
This is different when you put people in blocks of flats.
Each of the six houses currently being built in the pilot project consists of three housing units for four asylum seekers each.
Each apartment has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a living room.
It may be that many refugees will say, it is peace again, I am going back.
Then the houses can be easily rebuilt according to the respective needs.
What are the costs?
Gildner: The price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184,000 euros, without land.
That's manageable.
The construction took six months.
That's appropriate.
Did the building codes complicate their plans?
Gildner: Under construction law, I have completed my project correctly.
It always makes the threatening Damocles sword special construction and the pitch ordinance particularly complicated.
It's creepy.
It is still assumed that anyone who creates three apartments in a terraced house needs at least three parking spaces.
Only in the cities is there a lack of space for it.
Refugees and asylum seekers do not have cars.
How did the residents react to their terraced house project?
Gildner: There were some who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers.
Which is definitely not true.
But aren’t you intensifying the competition for affordable housing?
Gildner: It’s true: we had a construction boom in Germany in the last five years, but luxury apartments were built that hardly anyone can afford anymore.
My project has the message, even the normal people need housing.
Not only refugees, but also the single mother or the low-income earner.
I show how you can still build cheaply and well today.
That's what it's all about.
Markus Gildner (44) studied microsystems engineering in Regensburg and initially dealt with environmental analyses.
iOS 9: How to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is released
The new operating system can be requested by going to the Settings app, tapping "General" and then selecting "Software Update".
When it is ready, the phone gives you the option to download and then to install.
Some encountered problems after installation because they received an error message saying that the "software update failed".
To work around the problem, users are advised to either wait for the rush to return or try to update through iTunes.
The phone itself guides you through the rest of the process.
This may mean deleting apps to make room, but Apple has made it less likely to do so by streamlining the update, and it will be easier to do so if you use a special tool to delete apps and then reinstall them once the process is complete.
It is worth making sure that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is near a charger so that the battery is charged.
If the charge is too low, Apple won’t allow the update to continue, as the phone may shut down halfway and this could result in a cancellation of the update.
iOS 9 Release Still on Schedule Despite WatchOS Delay in Reviewing iOS 9: The Least Exciting but Best Update So Far iOS 9: How to Prepare for the New iPhone Operating System
You should also make sure to check our checklist of all things before your download to prevent things from going wrong and to protect yourself if they do. iOS 9 brings new features, including a much smarter personal assistant and huge new productivity features for the iPad, as well as changes that speed up and fix the operating system.
Rosberg's only currency: full attack
Nico Rosberg knows only one motto in the fight for the world title in Formula 1 against his clearly leading Mercedes team-mate Lewis Hamilton: "Full attack".
The World Cup runner-up stressed before the start of the decisive seven overseas races, “that I have nothing more to lose”.
53 points separate the runner-up ahead of the Singapore night race this Sunday from defending champion and two-time champion Hamilton.
The Briton has already won seven of the previous twelve races of the season and also tackles the floodlight Grand Prix in the city-state as a favorite.
In 2009 and last year, the 30-year-old Briton won the race.
Whether the current smog in the city-state will affect the Singapore Grand Prix is still unclear.
For days, a haze bell has been hanging over the city, triggered by fires on the neighboring island of Sumatra.
Bad Kissinger Chess Club has a prominent member
The chess club "Schachfreunde Bad Kissingen", founded three months ago, has added another member to its ranks, thus increasing the number of members to 19 players.
The new member is the entrepreneur Paul Gauselmann, a passionate chess and tennis player, who stayed more than 40 times in Bad Kissingen for the cure.
Gauselmann is a recipient of the Federal Cross of Merit 1st Class and honorary citizen of the cities of Espelkamp and Lübbecke.
Gauselmann supported the chess club in Bad Kissingen with a donation that Chairman Alfred Klein accepted.
This makes it possible to include chess players who are unable to raise the membership fee.
Youth work and talent search should also be promoted.
Gauselmann wishes that the membership in the chess club and also friendly contact to the tennis club "Rot-Wei<0xC3><0x9F>" be seen as an expression of his connection with the spa town.
District office looking for direct contact
Saludis and the Antonistift Altenzentrum have joined forces under the mantle of the Social Foundation and opened a new contact point at Graf-Stauffenberg-Platz.
In addition to consultations, you can also take part in courses there.
The social foundation pulls it down from the mountain into the city center.
More specifically, the Graf-Stauffenberg-Platz.
A new district office was recently opened there.
Here, right next to the shopping market, senior citizens and those seeking advice will now receive information on questions such as nursing care insurance or health and nursing insurance benefits.
For years, we have noticed with our outpatient care service that often caring relatives are left alone.
There are endless questions.
"It is not uncommon to not use many of the services of the cash registers, because the complexity of the insurances is hardly understood," explained the new landlord Jutta Weigand, who is also responsible for the Antonistift and the Bürgerspital as well as for the outpatient service "Amadeus" as business unit manager Altenhilfe.
In addition to the consultations, the new district office also offers prevention, health courses and wellness.
For this, the Saludis was taken into the boat.
Therefore, additional offers such as fall prevention, memory training or physiotherapeutic treatment can be used.
The offers of the Senior Center and the Saludis complement each other in an ideal way.
Saludis stands for prevention, prevention and rehabilitation.
"The Senior Care and Care Center," said Heike Riedel, Managing Director of Saludis.
Both managing directors see the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre, especially in the demographic change.
Because this makes a good decentralized infrastructure in the individual districts of Bamberg indispensable in the future.
In addition, Mayor Wolfgang Metzner (SPD) underlined at the inauguration celebrations, the district office also devotes itself to loneliness in old age: "There are numerous events and offers on the program and these invite you to a regular social gathering".
In this way, the Social Foundation makes a major contribution to ensuring that senior citizens can live as independently and well as possible in their familiar environment.
The office is open Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 9 am to 2 pm, Tuesday and Thursday from 4 pm to 6 pm and on Saturdays from 10 am to 12 pm.
Eintracht Bamberg v Würzburger Kickers on 6 October
Now it is official: After the date for the match FC Eintracht Bamberg against the third division Würzburger Kickers had not yet been set due to renovation work at the Fuchsparkstadion, now the 6th of October was set as the date.
The meeting of FC Eintracht Bamberg in the round of 16 of the Bavarian Football Totopokal against the third division FC Würzburger Kickers has now been finally terminated.
The game will be played on Tuesday, October 6, at 7 pm in the Bamberg Fuchsparkstadion.
"We are happy that we now know when the game is going to take place, now we have planning security," says FCE team manager Karlheinz Hümmer, who also points out the ticket advance sales that have now started.
It is special for our team to play against a third division team.
We therefore hope for numerous spectators, and this is not without reason, because floodlight games have a special appeal.
In the round of the last 16 teams FC Eintracht Bamberg moved in 2010 by victories at the district league 1. FC Oberhaid (3:1) and at home against the regional league 1. FC Schweinfurt 05 (3:2).
The winner of the competition receives 5000 euros and qualifies for the first round of the DFB Club Cup 2016/2017.
The defending champion is third-league striker SpVgg Unterhaching.
Viennese architect Karl Mang passed away at the age of 92
Karl Mang, one of the doyens of Viennese architecture, has died.
He died on September 5 at the age of 92, as the Künstlerhaus announced on Tuesday.
With Mang, the Künstlerhaus lost an honorary member and at the same time "one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna", as the broadcast said.
Born in Vienna in 1922, Mang studied architecture at the Vienna University of Technology under Friedrich Lehmann during and after World War II.
Since 1952 he worked as a freelance architect, but also worked as a teacher, writer and institute director.
From 1972 to 1983 he was President of the Austrian Institute of Design.
In the 1980s, he was commissioned to set up the Treasury in Vienna’s Hofburg Palace and to convert the Lobkowitz Palace into the Austrian Theatre Museum.
Parking penalty: Tim Wiese accuses policewoman with money
Ex-footballer Tim Wiese is not well noticed in Bremen.
Once a footballer, Tim Wiese, former national goalkeeper in Germany and with Bremen and Hoffenheim committed, is now a wrestler.
According to his own statement, he wants to have gained 30 kilograms of muscle mass in the past two years.
On the other hand, he did not increase intellectually.
Wiese had his hair cut in Bremen’s city centre when he saw a parking attendant outside issue a ticket for his white Chevrolet Camaro.
Wiese then stormed out of the shop, insulted the official and threw the fine at her feet, as the "Bild" newspaper reports.
The city of Bremen confirms the allegations, but is not yet clear about the consequences for the unusual incident.
"The matter is still under investigation," says the city of Bremen.
Only after that will be decided whether meadow is displayed or not.
Panamanian authorities destroy 4,500 marijuana plants
The fertile soil and rainforest-like climate of Isla del Rey are ideal for the flourishing of marijuana plants.
For three days, the Panamanian authorities have been tearing down the 4,500 plants and burning them.
Men beat up 17-year-old Afghans
Witnesses are looking for the police for an incident in Bad Soden-Salmünster: On Friday evening, around 11:45 p.m., three young men were on their way from Bad Soden on foot in the direction of Salmünster.
One of the group, a 17-year-old Afghan, followed his two friends at a distance of about five meters, according to police, and called them to wait for him.
At that time, the group was at the height of the bft filling station.
Three people were also present on the site of the gas station.
One of these men then shouted at the young man and punched him in the face with his fist.
The victim suffered a broken nose and bleeding from the nose.
When his two friends rushed in and placated the bat, he initially let go of his victim.
The injured young man was brought home by his friends.
The perpetrator pursued the group with a car to their apartment and passed there demonstratively several times.
When the vehicle was no longer visible, the injured man went outside the building to smoke a cigarette.
There he was attacked again by the thug and another male person.
With the help of a baton, they beat the victim’s face and thighs.
The injured person had to be taken to a hospital for medical care.
So far, there is only a vague description of the perpetrator.
One of the men was about 1.80 meters tall.
The second racket is said to have been about 1.65 meters tall and was dressed in jeans and a brown and white shirt.
The police ask witnesses and whistleblowers to report on the phone number 06181/100-123.
Dr. Frank Müller takes over Felstehausen practice and invests 310,000 euros
Silvia Müller-Gongoll and Frank Müller (from left) take over the practice of Karl-Heinrich and Ursel Felstehausen.
Mayor of the Samtgemeinde Mayor Bernd Bormann, Uta Seim-Schwartz and Mayor of Asendorf, Heinfried Kabbert, are also happy about this.
Doctors are missing in many places in the country - Asendorf, on the other hand, is lucky: Dr. Frank Müller will take over the Felstehausen practice there on 1 October.
While Ursel Felstehausen is retiring, her husband Karl-Heinrich will be half-way with his successor in the coming months.
After a reconstruction phase, Müller opens the practice again on 12 October, until then he invests 310,000 euros in the premises at St.-Marcellusstra<0xC3><0x9F>e 6.
It was sympathy at first sight when the Felstehausens met years ago Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller-Gongoll, who is currently completing her specialist training at the Verden hospital and is also planning to enter the practice next year.
“We always had in mind that the millers would fit well into this practice,” says Dr. Ursel Felstehausen and laughs.
"When it happened, I just called her."
The Müller couple liked the idea of running their own practice in Asendorf in the future.
"The proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive for us," says the 39-year-old Müller.
"We want to get to know and accompany the families over the years".
He also sees it as an advantage to be his own boss soon.
And so they agreed, the Müllers bought the house with the practice.
However, they will continue to live in Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
The two-time family father Frank Müller also grew up there, following his medical studies in Hanover with positions in several medical practices as well as in the hospitals in Sulingen, Nienburg and Rotenburg.
He is currently working as a senior physician in Sulingen, he was also appointed in 2009 as a senior emergency physician in the district of Diepholz and is volunteering in the DRK-Bereitschaft Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
From 19 September, the practice will be prepared for the new boss.
While the surgeon Dr. Karl-Heinrich Felstehausen works as a family doctor, his wife Ursel (internissress) specializes in gastroenterology.
The Müllers, both internists, want to settle down as general practitioners.
“The endoscopy comes out,” says 38-year-old Silvia Müller-Gongoll.
After the conversion, the rooms will look more modern.
We will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long-term and stress ECGs and need a consultation room more.
In addition, the computer will be completely renewed.
The Müllers receive a subsidy of a total of 50000 euros as part of a funding program from the district (25000 euros) as well as from the Samtgemeinde (12500 euros) and the municipality (12500 euros).
“This shows how proud and happy we are that the practice will continue,” emphasises Mayor of the Samtgemeinde Mayor Bernd Bormann.
According to Silvia Müller-Gongoll, about 2,000 patients come to the Felstehausen practice every quarter, while the average in northern Germany is about 500.
In Asendorf there is another general practice.
A positive side effect of the takeover by Frank Müller: According to Ursel Felstehausen, the pharmacy will remain in Asendorf.
If no successor had been found, she would have left.
Anyone who visits Müller’s office hours, by the way, will continue to look primarily at familiar faces: the seven medical specialists and the cleaning staff will take over from the Felstehausens.
With their farewell, an era ends in Asendorf, after all, the physicians have practiced there for 30 years.
"In the beginning we only had two rooms," recalls Ursel Felstehausen with a smile.
She feels a little sadness after a long time.
"But we continue to live in Hohenmoor and will certainly see many patients often," says the internist.
Her husband adds, laughing: "We have a 6000-square-meter plot."
"So far I've always pushed myself to gardening, now it could be different".
The couple also has two grandchildren and loves to travel.
Croatia: 'We let the refugees through'
"Now border controls are also being ramped up at our southern border," Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner said.
The controls at the Hungarian border remain in parallel.
It remains clear that anyone who wants to apply for asylum can also do so "as a matter of course".
The care and safety of the people is in the foreground.
But it is also clear, "that it needs clear signals," said the minister.
People need to know that we do not accept borderless migration flows, not even across the Austrian-Slovenian border.
We need a controlled approach.
Croatia considers 'corridor' - Slovenia denied
The Croatian government had previously said that Slovenia also wants to allow incoming refugees to travel on to Austria and Germany and may also build corridors for the refugees.
However, Interior Minister Vesna Györkös Znidar did not see it that way in Ljubljana.
The idea of corridors is “absolutely unacceptable”, Slovenia will rather intensify the surveillance of the border, especially with Hungary.
The border with Croatia, on the other hand, is already heavily controlled as the external border of the Schengen area.
As the minister stressed, Slovenia does not want to close its borders for refugees.
“Every EU member must fulfil its obligations, otherwise the system cannot work,” Györkös Znidar stressed.
As the Croatian government announced, the first refugees had already tried in the night hours to Tuesday, in Eastern Croatia, past the border crossing Tovarnik / Sid, in order to avoid registration.
The Croatian police were able to pick them up in the nearby corn fields.
According to local media, police vehicles with new refugees have been constantly arriving in Croatia’s Tovarnik ever since.
They are mainly Syrians and Afghans, including many women and children.
Rescue services and the Red Cross are also in operation.
In the coming days, his country expects around 4000 refugees, said Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic.
In addition, buses from Presevo on the Macedonian-Serbian border, which had previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border, would be diverted to Croatia, Croatian and Serbian media reported on Wednesday.
However, the government in Belgrade denied that it was instructing people to take certain routes: "Neither can we, nor do we want to do this," it said.
According to the media reports, a first bus with about 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of Sid in the morning, and more buses were expected during the day.
About Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany
The inmates had been on their way through Serbia all night from the Macedonian border about 500 kilometers away.
"We have heard that Hungary has closed, so the police told us to drive here," said one of the refugees.
They wanted to travel through Croatia, Slovenia and Austria on to Germany.
This could actually lead to the postponement of the previous Balkan route Turkey-Greece-Macedonia-Serbia-Hungary, which has already been predicted by observers, to a route a little further west.
Croatia: "Comprehensive possibilities for border control"
Croatia’s Interior Minister Ostojic had previously stressed that his country had prepared appropriate plans for possible exceptional situations in the event of a strong influx of refugees.
He did not mention details, but pointed out that Croatia, as a non-Schengen member, has “comprehensive possibilities for border control.”
Strict controls are carried out to qualify for membership in the Schengen area.
Slovenia has been a member of the EU since 2007, and the EU partners have consistently given the country a good record in terms of the standard of border controls.
On the Serbian side, about 300 refugees are still trapped behind the Hungarian border fence.
According to Belgrade media reports, they had spent the last night at the border crossing Horgos, which leads to Röszke.
According to the Hungarian authorities, the two border crossings Horgos and Backi Breg remain completely closed.
Whether the remaining refugees now want to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear.
Serbian Interior Minister Nebojsa Stefanovic on Wednesday morning tried to calm down during a local show in Horgos: He considers the debates about alternative routes of refugees, after the Hungarian border is now closed, premature.
It would not be very high refugee numbers at the moment.
One cannot yet say whether they would continue their journey via Hungary, Croatia or another country.
Helpers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
However, private Hungarian refugee workers have already started to distribute maps to the refugees, on which alternative routes through Croatia are drawn.
However, the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not safe: in parts of the border area, even 20 years after the end of the Croatian war, there are still uncleared minefields.
On Wednesday afternoon, Croatian police announced that a team of minesweepers had been sent to the border region.
Stock market hackers: Ukrainians pay $30 million
Supranonok is said to have belonged to a ring of cybercriminals who are accused of repeatedly gaining insight into unpublished financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire, Marketwire and PR Newswire since 2010.
The captured information is said to have been used to make insider deals in the financial markets.
In this way, according to the investigators, a total of over 100 million dollars were swindled.
"Today's comparison shows that even those outside our borders will ultimately be captured," the SEC said in a statement.
The trial of 32 other defendants in the case continued.
Most of the defendants are from Ukraine and Georgia.
The perpetrators are said to have acted in both the United States and Eastern Europe.
Ecumenical hospice aid Mannheim exists for 20 years
There is a busy business around the Mannheim Paradeplatz.
People do their errands, sometimes fast steps, sometimes leisurely strolling.
You drive to the two stations of the Mannheimer Autosalon at Paradeplatz.
Stop the trams.
Pulsating, full life with beautiful autumn sunshine and in the middle of it four large plates each with the headline "Before I die I want to die"....
With this action, the Ecumenical Hospice Aid drew attention to its 20th anniversary and is confronted with mixed reactions.
"It's about life, so we went with the action in the middle of the city and among the people," says Josefine Lammer.
The head of the Ecumenical Hospice Service is available to passers-by for questions and discussions as well as the volunteers.
While some passersby spontaneously pick up the chalk and add the phrase "yes to my life", "can read", "go through the USA with the camper", "stop the war" or "do not suffer for a long time", others stop for a moment, read, say phrases like "so far I am not yet" and then go on.
Again and again, small discussions develop on the sidelines about the action itself, about life, how to deal with dying.
Peter Hübinger is also on site.
"Only if I realize that the end of the world will come for me at some point can I live responsibly," says the director of the Diakonisches Werk Mannheim, which together with the Caritas Association is the bearer of the Ecumenical Hospice Aid.
Therefore, this public action is good for the 20-year-old.
However, it is understandable that not everyone wants to communicate publicly on the panels, because it is a very personal matter.
According to Josefine Lammer, the topic of death and dying is still tainted with taboos, even though the hospice movement in recent years has contributed a lot to people opening up.
An assessment shared by Angelika Godefroid.
The death and mourning companion is one of the volunteers from the very beginning.
Faced with the subject through personal experience, she read a lot of literature and decided to get involved in euthanasia.
When the Ecumenical Hospice Aid called for volunteers, it immediately reported and was present at the foundation in 1995.
Godefroid is part of a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - who accompany affected persons and their relatives in private households, hospitals, nursing homes and in the Saint Vincent Hospice.
They are all carefully trained.
Angelika Godefroid can deal well with her task and the experiences she has gained.
“I see life from a different perspective, think it’s precious and appreciate the moment,” she says.
The offer of the outpatient Ecumenical Hospice Service is free of charge and non-denominational.
The financial support of the health insurance funds and donations from relatives and associations enables the training as well as further training and supervision of the death and mourning companions.
Training for new employees is offered every two years.
The panels described on Saturday are now on display in the House of the Evangelical Church (M1, 1a) and in the House of the Catholic Church (F2, 6).
There, too, other personal wishes can be noted on postcards.
FedEx earnings mixed, financial outlook lowered for 2016
FedEx reports disappointing results for the last quarter, and the delivery giant lowered its earnings outlook to a full year due to weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its ground transportation service.
The company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday.
At this time last year, FedEx announced that it would be hiring 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season.
The stock fell over 2.5 percent in premarket trading 45 minutes before opening on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said it would make a profit between $10.40 and $10.90 in the fiscal year ending next May, 20 cents less than the previous forecast.
Analysts expected $10.84, according to a survey by FactSet.
The lower outlook comes despite the price increases, which average 4.9 percent and will take effect on January 4, and despite higher surcharges for ground transportation of heavy and large packages, which will be levied from November.
The company said it still expects earnings to increase year-on-year due to cost reduction, higher revenue and growth in online trading.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said the company is “providing solid returns considering weaker-than-expected economic conditions, particularly in manufacturing and global trade.”
Plans for holiday employment were announced a day later than those of rival UPS, which plans to hire 90,000 to 95,000 additional workers, roughly the same number as last year.
In the quarter ending August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, 6 percent more than in the previous year.
Earnings per share were $2.42 per share, just below the $2.44 per share that 12 analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research predicted.
Sales increased 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts interviewed by Zacks expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx has seen a decline in international priority shipping in recent years, stagnating revenue in its Express Shipping unit.
But the boom in online shopping has boosted results at FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, ground transportation revenue increased by 29 percent, but operating profit was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self-insurance.
The express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices, while earnings declined due to higher labor costs in the freight business.
In premarket trading, about an hour before opening, FedEx shares fell by $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
On Tuesday, they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11.
At their most anticipated meeting in the year, Federal Reserve strategists spend two days this week sitting around a 27-foot Honduras Mahogany table to decide if it’s time to raise the key rate for the first time in almost a decade.
Threatened above them at one end of the ornate, two-story boardroom is a mural of the United States.
The card is a reminder that Fed Chairman Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues should put the nation’s economic interests ahead of everything else.
The central bank has a twofold mandate from Congress: to maximize U.S. employment and keep prices stable here.
But since the Great Recession, the Fed leaders have acknowledged that there is an unwritten third mandate: financial stability.
And this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too narrow to predict, and it will be announced on Thursday whether the U.S. economy is ready to be weaned from the unprecedented incentive by the near-zero short-term interest rate since the end of 2008.
Although most of the data from the economy shows solid growth, recent turmoil in global financial markets could make already cautious Fed representatives anxious to amplify this volatility by raising the interest rate on federal bonds – even by a quarter of a percentage point.
“Obviously, the labor market and inflation will be the most important thing they observe in the first place,” said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at the brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
“But I think if they were looking for a pretext not to raise the interest rate, the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough justification to keep waiting,” she said.
There is no consensus on what the Fed will do, which in itself is unsettling the financial market.
About half of economists surveyed by Bloomberg recently predicted a rate hike this week.
However, financial markets expect the Fed to wait, with a key indicator indicating only a 30% chance of an increase.
This indicates a decline in the stock market if the Fed raises the rate, unless strategists mitigate the blow by promising that another increase is far away.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial average jumped 228.89 points or 1.4% to 16,599.85.
The action was triggered by expectations that Fed policy will sustain the rate this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody’s Capital Markets Research Group.
It would be a surprise if the Fed raised the rates at that time,” he said.
If she does, “she would have to go very far in her statement to reassure the financial markets so they don’t panic.”
Other experts argued that a rate hike would calm financial markets because it would remove uncertainty about when the Fed will trade.
Just a month ago, the Fed seemed well on track to raise the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US.
Yellen had said in the spring and early summer that despite complaints from liberals that more economic progress was needed, she expected an increase in the rate this year.
Although job creation slowed in August, the improvement in the labour market this year was solid.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest in more than seven years and close to the level the Fed sees as full employment.
Wage increases have shown signs of recovery.
And while inflation was consistently below the central bank’s annual target of 2%, the Fed representatives said the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy “can cope with higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension in the labor market,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But financial markets around the world faltered late last month after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial average fell more than 16% below its peak in May when investors feared that a slowdown in China’s economy would curb global growth.
The market has recovered somewhat this month, with the Dow now almost 10% below the May high.
For the Fed representatives, market turbulence influences the complex calculation of when to raise interest rates.
“If the events in the financial markets and the news about the weakness of China’s economy hadn’t occurred in the last few weeks, they would be pulling the reins in this meeting,” said Stephen D. Oliner, a senior research fellow at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former Federal Reserve employee.
Now he predicts that she will wait at least a month to better manage the effects.
“There’s a lot of uncertainty about what the impact will be on the U.S. economy, and there’s almost no reliable data to describe developments in China,” Oliner said.
The health of the global economy is not the Fed’s main concern, so it should not be technically involved in its decision-making.
But in the end, the Fed has become the monetary authority of the world.
The influence of the central bank has been enormous in recent years.
The mere hint by then-head Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could “restrict” its monetary expansion caused confusion around the globe.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, Fed representatives can be expected to not only monitor developments elsewhere, but also consult with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy.
Their decision-making is “more art than science,” said Zachary Karabell, head of global wealth management strategy at Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, VA., remarked this month that "the Fed has a history of overreactions to financial market movements that seem unrelated to the economic fundamentals."
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, which advocates a rate hike, cited decisions in 1998/1999 as an example.
A financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to lower its key interest rate by 0.75 percentage points in three sessions “despite limited discernible impact on growth in the US,” Lacker said.
A year later, the Fed representatives reversed these cuts.
The Fed should only put aspects of financial stability first during a severe crisis such as the 2008 market crash, said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England’s Interest Rate Committee.
The recent turbulence is not coming close to this level, he said.
“She certainly doesn’t want to get into the situation where she’s afraid of a rate hike because the markets are getting upset,” said Pozna<0xC5><0x84>, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and doesn’t mention financial stability, and until that is changed, I don’t think it should be ahead of time.
Do you need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown.
The market/warehouse was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
LAX-C is often referred to as Thai Costco and is a Thai wholesale market that also sells to the general public.
Yes, he is in Chinatown and not in Thai Town.
The market/camp is a one-stop shop, offering a confusing number of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian snacks, and tableware, furniture, religious jewelry and Christmas decorations.
There is even an auto department if you need engine oil.
The store is huge, and it takes over an hour to stroll through the aisles.
If the whole grocery store makes you hungry, there’s a meal for you on the LAX-C BBQ Express.
The kitchen (good and inexpensive) in this shop is located near the cash registers and has various carry-on options.
What there is here: Do you need anything - anything - Thai?
LAX-C probably has it.
Products are inexpensive and a number of them are sold in large quantities.
Fresh produce includes Asian specialties and regional Thai herbs, fruit and much more.
The meat counter is extensive, as is the fish counter - the staff behind the counter will clean and fillet the fish and even fry for you on request.
A good part of the store belongs to the massive freezing department. Here you will find frozen curry leaves, bitter melon and gallant, whole ducks, fish, beef blood and bile, pork natural intestine, fish balls, regional sausage, commercially prepared foods and more.
Who buys here: restaurant owners and chefs, also individual families and individuals.
The wide aisles are suitable for shopping trolleys and forklifts.
You will find here: fresh Monthong Durian next to the ticket office.
The store is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles on the outskirts of Chinatown and downtown - a few blocks away from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking area, along with other shops and restaurants.
Even if the store is well attended, it is not difficult to find a parking space.
Hoyerswerda: Small life support for refugees
More and more refugees are arriving in Germany these days.
Giving you a warm welcome is not possible without the commitment of countless volunteers.
Also in Hoyerswerda there are a number of people who support unselfish asylum seekers in the city.
They include Petra and Klaus Heine.
Petra Heine is a teacher with heart and soul.
Even with her 74 lenses, she still likes to teach.
Every Thursday she does it in the asylum seekers’ home on Dillinger Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e.
There she helps refugees from Syria, Kurdistan, Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language.
Of course, this is a very different lesson than in a real school.
Brazil’s Pediatric Society Rio Grande Promotes Nutrition for Healthy Breastfeeding
Brazilian pediatric organization SPRS is trying to shockingly educate women about the importance of good nutrition during breastfeeding by presenting images of babies sucking on breasts painted with depictions of unhealthy foods.
Breast milk is made up of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins, and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system.
Due to the additional energy requirements, pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day.
However, new research suggests that higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adjustment mothers should make.
A recent study led by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet of the child can negatively affect the immune system.
Exceptions for the new Bernrieder Sporthalle
The municipal council Bernried approved the building application for the 2.3 million euro sports hall.
And he made an exception.
The roof may become flatter for solar system.
The plans for the long-awaited gymnasium construction at the Bernried sports grounds are progressing step by step: In the latest municipal council meeting, the drafted building proposal was unanimously approved without much discussion.
Prior to this, the committee had, among other things, decided on a request for a building law "exception" or "exemption" from the valid development plan.
The "exception" was about the permission for a special form with regard to the roof construction.
According to this, a "saddle roof with non-center ridge and roof overhang" is to be built.
The background to the planning is the planned use of the roof area for solar systems: "This will bring together a wonderfully large southern roof," said Mayor Josef Steigenberger at the meeting.
The "liberation" was again about the roof slope, which for energetic reasons - contrary to what is prescribed in the development plan - should be less than ten degrees.
This significantly reduces the volume of the hall.
A "liberation" became necessary because the development plan does not allow any "exceptions" with regard to the roof slope - whereby the Bernried municipal council usually proceeds more restrictively in the case of exemption applications.
However, gym construction is not a recurring project: "We are not setting a precedent," says Steigenberger.
The gym building at the sports centre is a joint project of the municipality and SV Bernried.
Approximately 2.3 million euros are included in the costs.
Grants are expected from school and grassroots sports funding.
In the next step of the procedure, the building application for the 18 x 36 meter large hall will now be submitted to the District Office for examination.
Klinik Pei<0xC3><0x9F>enberg moves to Schongau
The Pei<0xC3><0x9F>enberg hospital is to be closed earlier than planned - namely in 2016.
At the same time, Dr. Wilhelm Fischer (66) becomes the new Medical Director at the Schongau Hospital.
The station and the majority of its employees move from Pei<0xC3><0x9F>enberg to Schongau.
This is foreseen by the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the district, which District Administrator Andrea Jochner-Wei<0xC3><0x9F> confirmed.
However, a decision on this matter will be taken by the Supervisory Board, which will meet next Wednesday, September 23.
If the plans were implemented, all of the nearly 50 employees at the hospital in Pei<0xC3><0x9F>enberg would continue to be employed.
The vast majority are to move to Schongau with Fischer and the remaining Innere Station.
The rooms are available.
According to Jochner-Wei<0xC3><0x9F>, employees who cannot be brought to Schongau will be offered a job in Weilheim.
Employees are informed of the plans.
The change has triggered the resignation of Dr. Andreas Eder, who has only been Medical Director of Schongauer Klinik since the beginning of the year and is now moving to a private practice in the immediate vicinity of the hospital.
According to Jochner-Wei<0xC3><0x9F>, the name "Fischer" came into play when it came to the question of who should succeed, who agreed to take over the management from 1 October and to move with his team to Schongau.
For the house in Schongau, this means in any case an "upgrading" and a broadening of the offer in the area of "internal medicine", says Jochner-Wei<0xC3><0x9F>.
Fischer is a specialist in pacemakers and defibrillators.
Schongau (180 beds) specializes in gastroenterological diseases at the Inner Station.
For the next two years, Fischer and his team, if the Supervisory Board agrees, will run both houses until next year, when the former Knappschaft hospital, which still has 35 beds, in Pei<0xC3><0x9F>enberg is to be closed after almost 140 years.
So far, the district had planned this for 2018, when the currently ongoing renovation at the hospital Weilheim is completed.
District Administrator Jochner-Wei<0xC3><0x9F>, who is also Chairman of the Supervisory Board, countered rumors that the house, which is owned by the federal government, will in future be used as accommodation for asylum seekers.
Jochner-Wei<0xC3><0x9F> could not say how things would continue with the property, there are several considerations.
Currently, a short-term care of Caritas and a day psychiatry are housed there.
"Nothing better could not happen to us, such an opportunity will not come again," said Fischer about the quasi-movement to the Lech, which was received by the employees "positively and very understandingly".
There was no real prospect for the house, where Fischer has been working as a chief physician for over 30 years.
He was asked by Schongau colleagues to take over the position of medical director.
The hospital Pei<0xC3><0x9F>enberg (once 100 beds) was repeatedly threatened with closure in the past decades, departments were closed, for example, surgery and obstetrics.
The handball players of the Rhine-Neckar Lions are challenged tonight (8:15 pm) at the Bergisches HC.
The leader of the Bundesliga is the clear favorite in Wuppertal, but there is no reason for arrogance.
Last season, the Badens suffered a painful defeat at the BHC and have something to make up for there.
Hunting accident with two injured at Pratau
Two tractor drivers were seriously injured by gunshots during their corn harvest on Tuesday afternoon.
During the harvesting on a corn field near Pratau (district of Wittenberg), several hunters were in action, as the police announced.
After a shootout, a 63- and a 22-year-old man suffered serious injuries and were taken to hospitals.
How exactly the accident happened was unclear at first.
Investigating the criminal police.
Missing 16-Year-Old from Rhineland-Palatinate Victims of Violent Crimes
A suspect has led the police to the body of the 16-year-old missing since Saturday from Rhineland-Palatinate.
During interrogation, the 20-year-old admitted to killing the youth and throwing her body into a canal in Rockenhausen.
A 16-year-old from Rhineland-Palatinate, who has been missing since Saturday, has fallen victim to a violent crime.
The body of the young woman was found Tuesday evening in Rockenhausen near Kaiserslautern, as prosecutors and police announced on Wednesday.
A 20-year-old, who was also arrested on Tuesday evening, is said to have confessed to the crime and led the investigators to the location of the body.
The 16-year-old had been reported missing on Sunday morning, after she had not come home as agreed the night before after a visit to an autumn festival in Rockenhausen.
In the search for the young woman, the investigators first encountered personal belongings of the victim.
In interviews in the circle of friends and acquaintances of the missing, there was finally a suspicion of crime against the 20-year-old.
The alleged perpetrator then led the police to a canal in Rockenhausen, where the body was found.
According to the authorities, the arrested man admitted in police interrogation to having killed the 16-year-old and placed the body in the canal.
The 20-year-old was to be presented to the magistrate on Wednesday, the investigators charge him with manslaughter.
The further investigation is intended to shed light on the more detailed circumstances of the act.
Refugees need shelter: Study warns of housing gap
The situation on the German housing market is tense.
More and more refugees are looking for an affordable place to stay.
The pressure on the housing market is growing.
Social housing is facing a challenge.
The distribution struggles on the German housing market have long since begun.
With the arrival of refugees and job seekers from the EU, more and more people are pushing for a market that is already overloaded in many large cities.
They compete with low-income citizens for the last affordable housing.
To meet the demand for affordable housing, 400,000 new units would have to be built each year by 2020.
This is the conclusion of a study commissioned by the association "Social Housing".
By way of comparison, 260,000 units will be completed in Germany this year.
140,000 homes are missing.
After the first three months of their stay, refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seekers in an initial accommodation.
Many then bump into the housing market and line up in the long lines in front of the rental apartments.
However, according to the Federal Statistical Office, less than half of all asylum seekers lived for rent last year.
However, the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the increasing numbers of refugees.
The study also makes up for significant omissions in housing policy in recent years.
Germany is pushing ahead with a housing deficit that is growing from year to year.
Currently, around 770,000 residential units have been missing in the conurbations, laments Matthias Günther, author of the study.
Many working people therefore had to live in large cities in shared rooms.
Young adults stayed involuntarily longer in the "Hotel Mama" because of the sluggishness on the housing market.
In major cities, the number of square meters per capita has fallen for the first time in recent years.
To solve the problem, the alliance "Social Housing" proposes a new start.
New incentives are expected to boost social housing.
For example, the real estate transfer tax could be waived and the property tax for subsidized housing could be suspended for a limited period.
In addition, according to the alliance, attractive tax depreciation possibilities are necessary.
The funding programme for refugee accommodation of the State Bank KfW is already well received by cities and municipalities.
A good week after the start, more than half of the approximately 300 million euros available had already been called up on Monday evening with 184 million euros.
Now the project could be expanded.
Refugees have free rein: Croatia and Slovenia set up corridor
There is practically no getting through to Hungary, as more and more refugees choose the way via Croatia.
Zagreb announced that it would allow the transit through Slovenia to the north without obstacles.
However, the route is still dangerous.
Croatia wants to reach an agreement with neighbouring Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees.
“I have spoken with the Slovenian Minister of the Interior, and if necessary, we will organize a corridor,” said Croatian Minister of the Interior Ranko Ostojic.
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone.
Croatia is not yet a Schengen country.
After the foreclosure of the Serbian-Hungarian border, hundreds of refugees left for Croatia to reach Western Europe.
500 people have crossed the border at Tovarnik, reports the Croatian TV station RTL.
Hungary had closed its border for refugees the day before.
Moreover, new laws, which came into force on the same day, make ordinary asylum procedures in Hungary virtually superfluous.
Croatia wants to allow the refugees to pass through.
Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic said: "They can travel through, and we are preparing for this opportunity."
These people are there, they are women, children and men who want to live and achieve something.
However, they were people who did not want to live in Croatia.
The Croatian police had picked up the first refugees on the border of Serbia to the EU neighbor Croatia in the morning.
According to media reports, most of them came from Syria, Iran and Afghanistan.
They came both by bus and taxi to the Serbian border town of Sid.
Immediately after their arrival, they would have tried to get to Croatia on foot across the green border.
On the Croatian-Serbian border, the refugees do not encounter border fences.
The border strip carries other dangers: There are still sharp mines from the Yugoslav civil war in the 1990s.
Mine clearance workers are now to quickly create a safe passage.
After the closure of the border, however, there are hardly any more refugees coming to Hungary.
On Tuesday, the police counted 366 people arrested.
Just before the closing on Monday, there were still 9380.
The new Hungarian law classifies overcoming and damaging the border fence as a crime.
35 criminal cases have therefore been opened in the southern Hungarian border town of Szeged.
The convicts face up to five years in prison and deportation from the country.
According to the immigration authority, a total of 94 asylum applications were received on Tuesday in the newly established "transit zones" at the border, of which almost all - 93 - at the most important transition Röszke.
Among the applicants were 13 families with small children and two elderly people.
On Wednesday morning, 40 refugees were still there.
In practice, however, no one has any chance of being granted asylum in Hungary.
According to Hungary, Serbia is a "safe third country".
Rejected asylum seekers should be deported there.
In front of the "transit zone" in Röszke, only a few hundred refugees gathered.
In Röszke, workers began to clean up.
They collected the garbage that tens of thousands of people had left on the roadside in recent weeks.
Barriers were dismantled and one of the reception camps in the border town was rebuilt.
No one wanted to comment on the aim of this conversion.
After the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary, only a few refugees still reach Austria.
The country has also strengthened its border controls.
Around 20,000 migrants were still in the country, according to the government.
In Salzburg, about 1,400 people are waiting for their journey to Germany.
The train service from there to Germany was stopped in the morning at the instruction of German authorities.
In Freilassing, smaller groups of refugees regularly arrived on foot.
Mayor drove "stranded" across the border
"We were busy cleaning up after the bridge festival on Sunday, when suddenly ten people with suitcases stood at the entrance of the tent," said Wernstein's mayor Alois Stadler.
Tourists, they wanted to take the train to Passau.
But because Germany had surprisingly stopped rail traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the flow of refugees, it was closed for them in Wernstein," said Stadler, who immediately offered his help and drove the stranded along with two other helpers and their cars across the border into the Nahe Passau.
Before that, we ate the unexpected guests, with snacks and drinks.
We said we'd take her to Passau by car.
"That was a matter of course for us," said Stadler in the O<0xC3><0x96>N conversation.
You were very grateful.
A man did not let himself be spared to make a generous donation - 100 euros for the fire brigade.
"We were very pleased," Stadler said.
The stranded train passengers had switched from an ICE to a regional train to Passau on Sunday evening in Wels, in order to try it after the short notice that the train traffic to Germany was stopped, but still across the border.
However, the regional train was parked in front of the border in Wernstein am Inn.
In Wernstein, the cross-border is generally high in the course.
The Brückenfest connected with the Bavarian neighbors on Sunday sociably, the day before a two-bridge race sporty - organized by the Union Wernstein and Bavaria from Neukirchen.
The fact that Viktor Orb<0xC3><0xA1>n is now sending more tens of thousands to us is a logical result of a hypocritical policy:
Instead of immediately helping the Röszke camp to establish structures that guarantee humanity, our Federal Chancellor has officially and publicly placed the Hungarian government’s attitude in the haze of National Socialism.
Sufferers of this policy are not only those Austrians who are now confronted with chaotic conditions in the border areas.
Refugees will also have to realize that the "promised land" that invited and welcomed them is nothing more than another refugee camp.
It will be a great challenge, in view of the ongoing refugee flows and the approaching winter, to establish humane conditions for those seeking protection in our country.
And it will be an even greater one - to maintain peace, security and stability in Austria.
Konrad in search of 35,000 winter-proof quarters
Konrad has his hands full with refugee accommodation.
Christian Konrad is used to his word being weighty.
The government has used the former powerful Raiffeisen banker to set up quarters for the thousands of refugees.
Konrad has already got a grip on the chaos at the initial reception centre in Traiskirchen.
"We no longer have homeless people in Traiskirchen," he said of his first success.
The accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who had come to Austria on Monday was also done without much fuss, Konrad said and praised the organizational "masterpiece".
The interior ministry, on the other hand, spoke of a "crisis situation".
In total, Konrad expects a demand of 85,000 quarters in this year.
In order to meet the number, 35,000 more accommodation will have to be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 will be provided by the L<0xC3><0xA4>nder, 15,000 by the federal government.
If there are more refugees, we can do it.
“But it’s not a barrel without soil,” Konrad said.
He has already had talks with the regional leaders.
They had promised him that they would also create quarters for the coming refugees.
"It's going well in Upper Austria," said Ferry Maier.
The former VP-Mandatar supports Konrad.
Tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schönborn, where it will be clarified how the Church will help.
The asylum coordinator also places great expectations in the ORF action "Helping like us".
Private individuals can easily offer accommodation on the platform.
In addition, one hopes for hotels that are empty in winter.
Konrad and Maier yesterday criticized the standards for accommodation as "very high".
In times of emergency, it cannot be that the giver of accommodation must maintain a certain height of the towel rails or the size of the skylights.
For a limited period of time, "emergency standards" would have to apply.
Konrad explains with his experience that he is more successful than the Ministry of the Interior when it comes to accommodation.
I am an older gentleman who is not easily told the untruth to his face.
Persuasion is his most important weapon.
Konrad and Maier do not incur any costs to the Republic, as they themselves declared.
They want to increase their number of employees to three to four.
So far, the search for our own quarters has not been successful.
Konrad wanted to set up a container at Stephansplatz as an office.
However, there are problems with the approval.
Linz calls for a better division
For the time being, no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as Tips-Arena and Design Center to accommodate refugees is planned by the city of Linz.
This is not necessary at the moment, as it is currently possible to accommodate those affected without these measures, says Mayor Klaus Luger (SP).
In the event of an emergency, however, further locations should be checked for their suitability.
The head of the city is critical of the division of the refugees within the federal state.
Other districts also have to make their contribution.
Seehofer: "borders will not be closed"
In a lengthy phone call with the Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU), Governor Josef Pühringer (VP) on Monday agreed on the further action in the refugee question.
Seehofer assured me that the German borders will not be sealed.
The continued travel of refugees to the Federal Republic is still possible.
However, there are now the appropriate border controls.
Special trains with refugees to Germany will no longer exist for the time being.
However, the protection seekers would be brought to Germany by regular trains.
From the other EU member states, Pühringer once again called for increased solidarity on the refugee issue.
For Pühringer, the fact that Austria is now reintroducing controls at its borders is "a logical consequence" of the actions of the Germans.
The next Runtastic is a matter of time
The general refurbishment of the "Neue Werft" in the Linzer Industriezeile is officially completed.
S&T has moved into four of the six floors of the office and production building, and the rest (2700 square meters) will be rented out to young, innovative companies in the technology sector.
"In IT, the smart minds are our raw material - and we have to try to make them work for us," says S&T CEO Hannes Niederhauser.
He could imagine investing in start-up companies of the Neue Werft and later also acquiring some.
Right from the start, S&T wants to cooperate with the new neighbors - of which Niederhauser promises a lot: "The next Runtastic is only a matter of time".
S&T invested 1.7 million euros in the site, 3.3 million euros from the Techcenter, which is part of a third of the city of Linz, the state of Upper Austria and the federal government (FFG).
The building is leased by Linz AG to S&T and Techcenter for 60 years.
30 percent of the 2,700 square meters of remaining space in the building are already rented out, for a further 40 percent there are inquiries.
Lia Peroni owner opened second store in the arcade
The new shop focuses on Furla handbags.
Actually, Jutta Breit wanted to get a dog.
The 49-year-old owner of Lia Peroni in the pigeon market arcade had to postpone this project without further ado: After all, she has now received growth in the form of another business premises.
In the Furla shop opposite the shop, where she sells bags, suitcases, shoes and clothing from various manufacturers, everything now revolves around women's handbags of the brand Furla, purses are available from 75 euros.
Larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros.
The new shop has been in operation since yesterday.
It was rebuilt several weeks ago.
“I’ve been thinking for a long time about whether I should open another store,” says Breit.
The decisive factor for the decision was, among other things, that the Furla producers, who are at home in Bologna, were also impressed by the idea of their own location, where only their handbags are sold.
“We are the only ones in the greater Linz area who sell this brand,” says the mother of two daughters, who herself has Italian roots.
Her fashion interest has been placed in the cradle by her mother.
I like it most when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices.
Why so many women get ecstatic at the sight of a beautiful handbag, even the expert can not answer with the last certainty.
Maybe it’s because a nice bag enhances any outfit.
The Brulljesmacher from Kallstadt
The Palatinate ancestors of Donald Trump came from a place whose inhabitants are called “Angeber”.
This characteristic also connects some with the billionaire who wants to become U.S. president.
Donald Trump (69) is always good for excitement.
Whether he expresses himself xenophobic, tackles journalists rudely or reveals gaps in knowledge in international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presidential office is stirring up the election campaign strongly.
And cut well with it.
This is also registered in the Palatinate Kallstadt, where the grandparents of the real estate billionaire come from.
The New Yorker with the hair dryer is a household name for many in the winemaking village on the wine route.
Some in the 1200-inhabitant place is over -zig corners is related to it.
His grandfather came from Kallstadt in the Palatinate: Donald Trump, here in campaign mode.
Kallstadter Simone Wendel made a film about Trump.
And what do the villagers think about his goal of becoming the most powerful man in the world?
"I think they find this kind of exciting, but they are not so deeply impressed in their Kallstadt style," says Simone Wendel.
The native of Kallstadt has made an amusing documentary about the place and its famous offspring, which includes the Ketchup family Heinz in addition to Trump.
Trump, who is not known for modesty, also speaks in "Kings of Kallstadt" (2014) - with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he lived in Kallstadt.
He did not bring it to the King of Hearts.
Although there is respect for the performance of the family, but also tends to be the opinion that Trump is “a bit of a big mouth”, says Wendel.
Coincidentally, the nickname Kallstadt has in the vicinity is "Die Brulljesmacher" - in High German: the announcers, she says.
Trump comes from the village of the announcers.
Trump's success story began in 1885, when the later grandfather emigrated and opened a restaurant for gold diggers in the United States.
The foundation stone of the real estate group were the first real estate purchases in New York.
But the lives of the grandparents were not free from tragedy: their desire to return to their homeland in the long term failed because of the Bavarian state to which the Palatinate belonged at the time.
He did not take in Trump because he had once left without permission, the director of the Institute of Palatine History and Ethnology, Roland Paul, had declared the film to start.
Trump is the grandson of an “illegal emigrant.”
This is in contrast to the sometimes significant statements of the descendant.
He had repeatedly spoken disparagingly about Mexican immigrants in the US and called for the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants.
“It’s not so likeable the way he’s complaining,” says Hans-Joachim Bender, a distant relative of Trump’s (“Grandma was born Trump, Grandpa was born Heinz”).
The winemaker in retirement sees the American rather distant, "he is always so effusive".
Does he think Trump is coming?
“I can’t imagine that,” says the 72-year-old.
"He never cared about Kallstadt".
Pensioner Veronika Schramm, like many Kallstadters, mentions that a descendant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ during a visit, which was generally well received.
“I can’t imagine that from Donald,” says the 68-year-old.
She would find it better if he did not win the election, because "he has such radical views, I do not know if that is good".
If those who were in charge in the United States at the time of his grandfather had been like him, “he would never have arrived there.”
“There are more interesting topics than him,” says winemaker daughter Sarah Bühler.
And as president?
“It’s not my president,” she said.
“The grapes will ripen without President Trump.”
Wendel’s film, for which Trump has been interviewed for a long time, has seen 12,000 moviegoers, and interest is also growing in the US.
The Upper Bavarian municipality of Ramsau near Berchtesgaden is Germany's first "mountaineering village".
From the hand of the Vice President of the German Alpine Association, Ludwig Wucherpfennig, the 1800-inhabitant village in the Berchtesgaden National Park received on Wednesday the award for gentle tourism.
In Austria there are already 20 "mountaineering villages".
In the neighbouring country, the Alpine Association is responsible for awarding the award.
A "mountaineering village" may have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants.
At least one fifth of its area must be designated as a protected area.
Seven’s Sunrise dominates ratings despite Nine’s attempts to take leadership loss at Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson rush to Canberra to report on the loss of Liberal leadership, but it has not caused any major shifts in ratings for Today.
Nine’s breakfast show was broadcast by the federal capital when Malcolm Turnbull succeeded in toppling Tony Abbott.
The rival Sunrise, with presenters David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was in London as part of a week-long series of international television shows, including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This drawback of the distance didn’t seem to matter to Australian TV viewers, as Sunrise averaged 397,000 viewers across the five capitals, compared to Today 339,000.
Today achieved a slight increase over Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but its figure fell short of last Thursday's (343,000).
Today has closed the gap to Sunrise in recent months.
In August, Today reached an average of 318,000 compared to Sunrise’s 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the gap was between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far in September, Sunrise stands at an average of 349,000 viewers to 314,000 at Today.
This is the most interesting thing that happens every morning.
The winds of change affect these morning people more than Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thanks for checking!

The big news for Seven was the impressive 800-word debut with the former serial star of Packed to the Rafters Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a recently widowed father who decides to settle on the coast of New Zealand with his two children reached a very impressive number of 1.219 million viewers.
Critics had wondered if Thomson could carry a hit show solo without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
Last night's result answered with a clear "yes".
The X-Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.136 million viewers and easily beat The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
Seven had mixed results on evening two of The Chase Australia.
The first half hour of the new quiz show, moderated by Andrew O'Keefe, averaged 446,000 viewers.
The second half hour (17:30 to 18:00) jumped to 623,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuire's hot seat (613,000).
On Monday night, the first half hour of The Chase Australia attracted 520,000 viewers and a whopping 720,000 in the second half.
Hot seat averages 620,000.
The decline in the second night odds of The Chase Australia will give Nine confidence that Hot-Seat will ultimately prevail at 5:30 p.m.
The Chase Australia is a replacement for Million Dollar Minute that failed to outstrip the McGuires show.

The last three agree: Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man – but who will he choose?
Secret revealed? ...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have unwittingly revealed who wins The Bachelor.
The woman Sam Wood ends up with in The Bachelor has been shrouded in secrecy.
And none of the three remaining girls will certainly reveal whether she is the one who received the last rose.
But when we checked in with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski, and Lana Jeavons fellows the day before three turned into two, you may have accidentally given an indication of who will be the winner.
Sam Wood holds his lips tightly sealed until Thursday's finale
All three women have lyrically commented on why Wood is the perfect man, citing his sense of humor, ambition, family values, and positive attitude as reasons for wanting to be his partner.
However, if the question is asked "If not you, who should get Wood's last rose?", her answers could become the spoiler of who won the heart of the bachelor.
Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly named Mackay as Wood's best partner.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have had an easy relationship from day one.
“From the moment I walked in and noticed (Sarah’s) and Sam’s energies, I felt they were pretty compatible, and I thought about that throughout the show,” Jeavons-Fellows said.
"Sarah is standing with both feet on the ground, it's so much fun to be with her," Markoski added.
I've seen them together, and they have the right chemistry.
They feel comfortable and comfortable with each other.
Sarah Mackay believes that she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple.
From her point of view, Mackay said the home visit last week made it clear to her that Wood could be “the one.”
“As soon as I saw him with my friends and family, I realized this is obviously not just a game — I’m now unreservedly tuned in to him,” she said.
And when asked who Wood should choose, if not her, she was enigmatic.
“I don’t know if I can say that,” she said.
I love the remaining girls equally - it's a draw between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor will be broadcast on Ten on Wednesday, 7:30 p.m.
Originally released as Sarah's first choice for Sam Wood?
Jarryd Hayne had several options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after his move to the U.S. – and there were many other teams sending requests for his impressive open training day late last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula and it looks like a smart decision.
Some coaches would have banished Hayne to the bench for the rest of the game when he lost a scuffle like the Aussie rugby league convert did on his first punt return Tuesday in a 20-3 win against Minnesota.
But Tomsula trusted his husband and gave Hayne the next opportunity for a punt return and also in the ongoing game after an injury to Reggie Bush.
Tomsula continued to show his true face in the locker room after the game.
Instead of grinding his rookies through the mill in front of the rest of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly reinforced Hayne in his press conference after the game.
49ers sports reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by special teams coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget his battered catch and take care of the next game.
Jarryd Hayne hits a point that was restored in the first quarter by the Minnesota Vikings
It was certainly not the start Hayne and his massive Australian following had hoped for for his NFL debut.
Hayne left the pitch cursing after the fumble and later told Australian radio duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 that he couldn’t imagine a worse start to his NFL career.
"That was a thing that happens, you just take care of the next game, and that's it," Hayne said.
Hayne compared the Schnitzer to his Origin debut back in 2007, when a pass at in his own in-goal area led to a try for Queensland.
Overall, it was a great experience for the 27-year-old.
Hayne posed for a photo with fans, holding an Australian flag after the game and posting it on his Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Russia’s richest man, was arrested on a Siberian runway by force of arms.
After openly challenging President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his oil company Yukos seized and his democratic efforts stopped.
The Free voters are demanding the recruitment of 1,000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high refugee numbers.
Party and faction leader Hubert Aiwanger warned at the beginning of the FW autumn term in Gro<0xC3><0x9F>wallstadt of a serious crisis at Bavaria's schools, if there are not correspondingly new teachers for the many new students: "We need at least 1000 additional teachers to save the schools from collapse," said Aiwanger.
"Otherwise we will get distortions in the Bavarian education system."
The Landtag faction of the Free Voters will meet in the Lower Franconian Commune until Friday.
Actually, completely different main topics were planned.
But the record number of refugees now also dominates the Free Voter Meeting.
"Of course, the issue of asylum will overlay the clause," Aiwanger said.
Aiwanger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria, as they did during the Yugoslavian wars in the 1990s.
“This is not the way to go, we have to get to the causes,” said the Free Voter Chief.
Rejected asylum seekers want to deport the free voters as soon as possible.
That is why Aiwanger also called for more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum claims: "We also need at least 50 new asylum judges," said Aiwanger.
The head of the FW criticized that several federal states were not consistent: "We would need nationwide uniform standards of the federal states."
"Bayern pushes off, others don't."
“We need to become more capable of action.”
But the state policy in Gro<0xC3><0x9F>wallstadt should not fall under the table.
A long-standing theme remains on the agenda: education policy.
For the new school year, Minister of Education and Cultural Affairs Ludwig Spaenle (CSU) has started the pilot trial "Mittelstufe plus" at 47 high schools, in which an extension of the high school middle school from three to four years is tested - as a result it then takes nine years again until the Abitur.
But this does not go far enough for Aiwanger.
“The G9 issue needs to be accelerated,” the FW boss said.
We demand freedom of choice for all high schools that want this.
Free travel on the G9 wherever you want.
Stronger Wall Street helps Dax on the jumps
The German stock market has closed with profits after a long period of directionless and nervous trading.
Only in the afternoon did a firmer start by the US stock exchanges provide a clear direction, which ultimately drove the Dax up by 0.56 percent to 10 188.13 points.
The MDax of medium-sized values gained 0.54 percent to 19 552.88 points.
The technology-heavy TecDax rose by 1.03 percent to 1736.69 points.

Solid profits were also recorded in the trading venues in London and Paris.
In the United States, the Dow Jones index recently rose by around 1 percent.
Many stock exchanges expect the markets to step on the spot this Friday until after the interest rate decision in the US and also after the big decline on the futures exchanges.
In the meantime, the discussion about the burdens of the nuclear phase-out has pushed RWE’s shares to a record low and left a deep mark on Eon.
According to "Spiegel", German energy companies may lack 30 billion euros in provisions.
The Federal Government denied the figures cited in the press.
The shares of the two largest German energy companies recovered somewhat, but ultimately lost 3.31 percent (RWE) and 6.15 percent (Eon).
Infineon shares rose a further 3.22 percent at the Dax peak.
According to a trader, a positive report by the US investor magazine "Barron's" had an effect on the weekend.
Investors are currently paying too little attention to the German chipmaker.
Investments in future-oriented wafer technologies and a focus on the automotive market should pay off.
Car values were in demand: Even in the traditionally weak summer month of August, more cars were sold than in the same period last year, as the industry association Acea announced at the start of the International Motor Show IAA in Frankfurt.
The papers of the car manufacturers Daimler and BMW increased by 1.34 percent and 2.21 percent, respectively.
Volkswagen’s benefits increased by 1.26 percent.
On the German bond market, the current yield of listed federal securities fell to 0.48 (Friday: 0.50) percent.
The Rex pension index rose by 0.12 percent to 139.55 points.
The Federal Future lost 0.71 percent to 154.11 points.
In the afternoon, the price of the euro fell to 1.1262 dollars.
By noon, the European Central Bank had set the reference price at 1.1305 (1.1268) US dollars.
The dollar thus cost 0.8846 (0.8875) euros.
4 people killed after police shoot rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police fired rubber bullets into a crowd protesting against the proposed new constitution, an official said on Wednesday.
The violence erupted Tuesday evening in Rupandehi district, about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, senior district official, said more than 1,000 protesters had gathered outside a police station, with some of them throwing stones and incendiary bombs.
Mr. Dhakal said the police used tear gas and then fired into the air before resorting to rubber bullets.
20 police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why the rubber bullets used, known to be capable of killing but traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, apparently produced such a high death rate.
The clash was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal’s southern plains, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say new provinces formed under the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence.
There have also been protests in western Nepal by the ethnic group of the Tharus who want their own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been killed in violent clashes since September 10.
August was killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces – an important step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal that has been centrally governed for centuries.
Work on a new constitution has been underway since 2008, but lawmakers accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
Legislators have voted on certain clauses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu this week, and officials have said the new constitution could come into force on Sunday.
Construction area planned in the city
The property at the Emder Jugendzentrum Alte Post is to be redeveloped.
The city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 square meter area.
A mixture of trade, commerce and housing is planned - but there are no concrete offers yet.
Emden - The city of Emden wants to market a 4,000 square meter plot of land in the immediate vicinity of the Alte Post youth centre.
Preparations for this are currently underway.
It is planned to use the site for a mix of trade, commerce and housing.
They are waiting for offers, according to the city.
It is not yet clear which investor is eligible.
Accordingly, no contracts have yet been concluded.
The city of Emden had already bought part of the property, which is located on the Ringstra<0xC3><0x9F>e / corner of Gro<0xC3><0x9F>e Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e, a few months ago and had the building located on it torn down.
Project Hive: Details are on the table
The plans for the holiday home settlement on the Kleiner Meer near Emden are taking shape.
For the first time, the investor publicly presented plans for the project.
Some residents are still worried - they fear the sale of their leisure refuge
For months, negotiations, reflections, debates and drawings had been held behind closed doors.
Now the plans for a new holiday home settlement on the Kleiner Meer near Emden are on the table.
The interested party, the medium-sized company "System-Bau", presented its plans publicly for the first time on Monday evening in the city development committee of the Emder Council.
Originally, this item had been on the non-public part of the agenda.
Under pressure from the project critics and the FDP faction, who accused the investor and the administration of secrecy, Ralf Behrends of the System-Bau management went on the offensive: "We do not yet have an answer to all questions," he said in front of the council members and more than 50 visitors.
But it is good to be able to meet all the rumors now.
The approximately ten to twelve million euro project has been under discussion for months.
Fierce reactions among meerbuden owners who had come to the meeting evoked the pictures and new details about the desired hotel construction.
Roberto Schulz, owner of the meerbuden and member of the board at the representation of the interests of the residents, Pro Hieve, complains: "This will be a giant block that towers over all other buildings".
In addition, like many other project critics, he fears that traffic would increase sharply due to the intended size of the plant: "There must come entire bus loads, so that this pays off," says Schulz.
However, what exactly happens on the one hectare area of the former restaurant is still open.
There is no operator yet.
"First we have to have a coherent concept," Ralf Behrends said.
Because this was still missing, the development plans are still variable.
Twin offspring of gorillas at Frankfurt Zoo
The Frankfurt Zoo is looking forward to the next generation of gorillas.
26-year-old Dian gave birth to twins yesterday.
Twin births are rare in gorillas.
The last one in a German zoo dates back almost 50 years and was also in Frankfurt in 1967, according to the zoo.
The sex of the newborn gorilla twins has not yet been determined, as Mother Dian holds them close to the body.
At first, the "picture" had reported.
NHC predicts 60 percent chance of cyclone south of Cape Verde
The U.S. National Hurricane Center predicted on Tuesday a wide low pressure system about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southernmost Cape Verde Islands that has a 60 percent chance of developing into a tropical cyclone over the next 48 hours.
Another well-defined low pressure system about midway between the Cape Verde Islands and the Lesser Antilles also has a 60 percent potential to form a tropical cyclone over the next two days, the Miami-based weather experts added.
Google Launches Doubling Donation Campaign to Raise $11 Million for Refugees
Google Inc. (GOOGL.O) announced a doubling donation campaign to raise $11 million for humanitarian organizations to help thousands of refugees who have overrun European nations as they flee war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google has an unusually personal approach when announcing the donation call on its blog.
Instead of letting a manager make the announcement, Rita Masoud, a Google employee who fled Kabul with her family when she was seven, wrote about her personal experiences.
“Our journey included many dark train and bus rides, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and anxiety,” she wrote.
I was lucky.
But as the refugee and migrant crisis in Europe has grown, many people like my family are desperately looking for help.
The donations go to four non-profit organisations that provide assistance to refugees and migrants: Doctors Without Borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said that the first globally collected donations up to a value of 5.5 million on google.com/refugeerelief will be doubled to $11 million.
Europe is facing its worst refugee crisis since World War II, largely caused by the four-year civil war in Syria that has displaced more than 4 million people this year.
Many are also fleeing war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

For slightly overweight diabetics, weight loss surgery can be helpful.
The benefits of weight loss surgery for mildly overweight people with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years, according to a new study.
It is still too early to say whether slightly overweight people with diabetes will live longer after weight loss surgery than those who receive non-surgical treatments.
“The mortality data takes a long time to show anything,” said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in weight loss surgery who wrote an editorial on the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight loss surgery or obesity surgery, use various methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the body’s ability to absorb food.
Over the years, obesity surgeries have proven effective in treating type 2 diabetes, but most studies have been done in people who are morbidly obese with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a certain amount of weight in terms of height, is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight, and people with a BMI over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers from Taiwan’s Min-Sheng General Hospital used data collected in a study since 2007, comparing two types of obesity surgery – gastric bypass and gastric tube formation – to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight.
The average BMI among those who underwent this surgery dropped from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year in this study.
Meanwhile, BMI remained roughly the same at 29 in those who received non-surgical diabetes treatments.
Among those who underwent surgery, 36% completely resolved diabetes and 28% partially.
In the medically treated group, the diabetes resolved completely in only one percent and in some cases in only about two percent.
In addition, the results in the controls of blood pressure, triglycerides, and “bad” LDL cholesterol were “generally better in the ‘surgical’ group,” the authors found.
The researchers also monitored patient blood levels of hemoglobin A1c, which reflects blood sugar levels over time.
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent, the researchers write.
After surgery, the average hemoglobin A1c level dropped from around 9 percent to around 6 percent.
In the medical therapy group, however, it remained stable at about 8 percent.
But this better “glycemic control” — as reflected in the improved hemoglobin A1c level — did not reduce mortality in five years, according to lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared average results in the two types of surgery.
By the fifth year, the bypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the gastrectomy group (18.7 vs. 14.2 kg), achieved greater decreases in BMI (7.4 vs. 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1% vs. 2.1%), and had more of a complete overcoming of diabetes (46.9% vs. 16.7%).
While the new study shows no survival benefit of surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to longer life, says Blackstone of the University of Arizona, College of Medicine Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, obese people who underwent obesity surgery were about 29 percent less likely to die over the course of 15 years — compared to a group who tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study showed no benefit for survival in surgery patients, Blackstone said it was reassuring for people with a BMI under 35 who are interested in the procedure.
“This is the critical point of this study because it says that this surgery is lower in this lower BMI group,” without increased risk of death or kidney disease, she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously once the patient with his BMI is between 27 and 30.
“I think we’re waiting too long to get people to take this seriously,” she said.
I think that once they have accumulated those genetic changes that have firmly linked their bodies to obesity and diabetes, a reversal is really hard."
Love story takes place in the Hunsrück
It is a subject that is currently receiving increasing attention in fiction: a young woman, unpopular and unsightly at school, meets the swarm of her youth again after years, and this one falls in love with her.
This is also the case in the recently published novel "Echtlich sind wir nicht so" by Luisa Binder.
Beyond the love story, the novel is likely to be especially interesting for Hunsrück readers, as it takes place in boredom and the surrounding villages.
The full-time author grew up in boredom and is happy that she was able to place a literary monument to her hometown.
"It is impossible that anyone can come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT-News
Europe cannot accept all refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to the violence in the refugees’ home countries.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten-day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which is dedicated to ethics studies.
He demanded that, under the circumstances, the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of individual nations or even continents.
He also stressed that while the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is admirable, it is not appropriate to the situation.
“It is impossible that anyone can come to Europe,” he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised Germany’s and Austria’s efforts in dealing with the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
“Taking care of several thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime you need to think about long-term solutions to how to create real peace and real development, mainly through education, for these Muslim countries,” he stressed.
Ultimately, we need to think about how to reduce killing in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of violence.
“The use of force has never solved these problems,” he added.
The Dalai Lama raised the issue of violence and also commented on George Bush’s actions after the 9/11 terrorist attack, pointing out that the U.S.’s violent response entailed a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 9/11, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush, and I told him that the way to solve this problem is non-violence.
“I know his motives were good, but he used violence, and that has caused unexpected consequences,” the Dalai Lama said.
Fourfold increase in use of hand sanitizer by children in last 4 years
Poison control centers in the U.S. report a nearly 400 percent increase in the number of children under the age of 12 who swallow heavily alcoholic hand sanitizers, according to the Georgia Poison Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Center, cases of hand sanitizer intake in children under the age of 12 reporting poison control centers increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
“Children are increasingly coming to these products, and unfortunately a percentage of them end up going to the emergency room,” Lopez told CNN.
He said that some children drink disinfectants intentionally, while some do it to impress their friends or because of a test of courage on social media.
Videos on YouTube show how teenagers drink disinfectants just because of a cheap experience.
Teenagers reportedly mixed disinfectants with alcohol-containing mouthwash to get a harder drink.
Younger children may be attracted by attractive scents of the disinfectants.
“A child doesn’t think this is bad for him,” Lopez said.
Many of the more attractive (hand sanitizers) are those that are perfumed.
There are disinfectants with strawberry, grape and orange scents, which are very appealing to children.
Hand sanitizers contain anywhere from 45 to 95 percent alcohol.
Especially in young children, even a few splashes can lead to alcohol poisoning.
“It’s highly concentrated alcohol,” Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the Poison Emergency Center at the University of Kansas Hospital, told Fox 4 in Kansa City.
So, you wouldn’t let a sip of whiskey stand around, but people leave these hand sanitizers within reach of children, and if kids get to it, then it’s a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who had recently taken four shots of strawberry-scented hand sanitizer at school, was taken to an emergency room for treatment.
Her blood alcohol concentration was 179, twice higher than the threshold legally considered drunk in an adult, said Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency room doctor who treated her at Gwinnett Medical Center outside of Atlanta.
Nhaijah laughed her words and was unable to leave when she arrived at the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her overnight in a separate children's hospital for signs of brain trauma as the girl had fallen through the alcohol and bumped her head, Ritchey said.
"That was very scary," Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother, told CNN.
It could have been fatal for my child.
Lopez has advised parents and teachers to use alcohol-free products or disinfectant wipes and to store hand sanitizers out of the reach of the child.
Beyond alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants were associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after swallowing hand sanitizers containing a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
Health officials suspect the product contained methanol, a lethal solution, rather than ethyl alcohol, which was noted as an active ingredient.
In January, three fourth-grade students in New York State planned to poison their “bad” teacher by laying out antibacterial products around the classroom,” a police report said.
The teacher is highly allergic to hand sanitizer and banished her from her room.
The police considered the thwarted plan to be "stalking" and referred disciplinary measures to the school board.
Villingen-Schwenningen: Three vehicles damaged
In a rear-end collision on the cross brace between Nordring and Auf Herdenen, a 33-year-old driver was slightly injured in a rear-end collision.
A 60-year-old truck driver drove on the crossbar towards the industrial area roundabout and noticed too late that two vehicles had stopped at the roundabout.
As a result, he crashed his truck into the rear of an Audi and pushed this vehicle onto a Ford Fiesta standing in front of it.
The vehicles involved in the accident suffered property damage of about 10,000 euros, the police said.
The 33-year-old’s Audi was no longer ready to drive and had to be towed.
Rumours: No disharmony at Celtic

Dons raise lead over Celtic to five points
ADAM Rooney's penalty in the first half gave Aberdeen a close victory over Hamilton at Pittodrie, allowing the Dons to create a five-point gap between themselves and Celtic.
Griffiths plays down talk of disharmony
There are rumours of disharmony at Celtic Glasgow, which Griffiths spontaneously dismissed, insisting that he and his teammates are not under increased control as they prepare to confront the Dutch leader.
“I don’t think we’re under pressure, I think the players are looking forward to it.
The lack of title competition in Scottish football bores the Dutch - de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and former Netherlands international Ronald de Boer has said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic since there is no title rivalry with the Rangers.
De Boer, currently an ambassador for Ajax, said: "In Holland they no longer show highlights of the Celtic games and why?"
It's because the Rangers aren't here.
People here aren't just talking about the return of the Rangers.
You're talking about the Old Firm.
They talk about both teams together and that’s what interests them.
There’s a lot of tension in the old-firm games, and it’s not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games.
I will turn things around, Deila swears.
RONNY Deila has accepted that Celtic must fight, but the Norwegian boss vowed to turn things around.
After the defeat against Malmö and the subsequent departure from the Champions League, the defeat followed against 10 men from Aberdeen, who are now clearly at the top of the table with a five-point advantage.
Deila said, however, "Celtic had bad times before, and we will come again."
Now we want to get out of there as soon as possible.
I know it’s very frustrating and a lot of people are very, very angry or sad about what’s happening.
We feel the same way – but we have to move on.
We really, really need the support of Celtic because that makes the players better.
Standing together now is so important.
Warburton cautious on January transfers
Despite his comments just a few weeks ago suggesting he was targeting some January transfers, Rangers boss Mark Warburton is cautious about signing new additions and insists he doesn’t want to disrupt the Ibrox squad’s unity.
Brentford's former boss said: "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window."
The players who come in the summer have this pre-season time to integrate what you’ve seen with our own group this season.
The team is really good.
Sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need.
Celtic target Michu with withdrawal notice
Swansea forward Michu, speaking to Celtic during the transfer period, has indicated that he can withdraw if his contract with the Swans expires.
The 29-year-old has been plagued with an annoying ankle for two years and has not managed to leave Wales this summer.
Hearts on SFA battle over Neilson's comments
The Hearts led 2:1 when Paterson was sent off the field and then lost 3:2, but the defender's red card was later reversed - Collum's third red card revoked in eight months.
Neilson continues what he said, insisting, “I didn’t question integrity, I didn’t comment on performance.”
Griffiths vows to avoid Tynecastle
The incorrigible Hibee was reprimanded after admitting to singing a song with offensive lyrics about ex-Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident took place in a pub in the Roseburn area of Edinburgh, outside an Edinburgh Derby in Tynecastle in March 2014.
"It was a derby, and it was the heat of the moment," the striker said, adding: "It's safe to say I won't be returning to Tynecastle if it doesn't play for Celtic Glasgow."
Tannadice Supervisory Board has confidence in Dundee United Management
Simon Donnelly insists that Dundee United’s board of directors still have confidence in the management team to turn things around – but admits that the decline on the pitch must end.
I think Stephen Thompson has faith in us.
We're going to get the boys back on their feet," Donnelly said.
McInnes happy to "unsightly win" against Hamilton.
Derek McInnes admits that his Aberdeen team had to fight desperately against Hamilton Accies to see a seventh consecutive league win, giving them a five-point lead over Celtic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Rooney's penalty in the first half.
McInnes said: “There is no team that has won everything, in cup games or leagues, that has not won games of this kind.”
Unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged, while rising in the United Kingdom as a whole.
Unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 164,000 between May and July, while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.82 million over the same period.
Scotland’s unemployment rate of 5.9 percent was higher than the UK’s of 5.5 percent, according to figures from the Office of National Statistics (ONS).
Meanwhile, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 during the three months, with the number of employees now at 2,612,000.
Over the course of the quarter, the employment rate for Scotland fell to 74.0 percent, a figure above the UK average of 73.5 percent.
Commenting on the latest figures, Secretary of State for Scotland David Mundell said: “The government’s long-term plan has laid the foundation for a stronger economy.”
It has been almost exactly a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
Over these 12 months, we have seen further improvements in the Scottish labour market, with an increase in employment and a fall in unemployment.
Drunken people disrupted the process
Since the security staff could not pacify the situation, the staff called the police.
Only with the use of pepper spray, the officials were able to take the disturbers into custody.
A breath alcohol test showed 0.89 per mille in a 16-year-old.
The adolescent was picked up by his mother.
A 28-year-old had 2.15 per mille and initially remained in custody.
Why I Will Be Witnessing an Execution in Oklahoma
A little later today, except for a late legal intervention, I will watch a man be put to death.
If it happens, and I hope it doesn't, I'll be sitting in a spectator gallery in the death chamber at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary when Richard Glossip is executed by the poison syringe.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death.
The invitation was already made for the first time in January via his best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day drew closer, I began to fear.
So, why would I do it?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty.
It would provide a unique perspective.
It’s true that journalists are allowed to see executions in the U.S., and as there are often more applications than places available, a macabre lottery takes place to decide who gets elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media spots from 12 to five.
Whoever is selected will watch it emotionlessly.
I can't do this.
I’ll be sitting next to Richard Glossip’s closest friend, with whom I’ve developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two and a half hour visit.
I like this guy.
We laugh a lot when we talk.
Prison authorities say I can’t be a witness and a journalist, so I won’t be allowed to take a notebook and a pen to record what I see.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of abandoning my impartiality.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the prisoner’s story the way he wants, and you’ll get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that she “could have formulated it better,” but she still thinks that what I’m doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn’t tell me what to write, and I wouldn’t do it even if he did.
I told him he could remove me from his witness list at any time.
But he wants an international reporter to be there to write.
When he dies, he thinks public relations will help the movement against the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, a reporter for the Huffington Post, will be sitting next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts I made.
I don’t want to go into all the details again.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of being a beneficiary of the act.
But I think there's a strong chance he's not guilty of murder.
I certainly believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence.
I think his execution is wrong.
And from that perspective, I'm going to see him die.
I cannot claim to be objective.
There will be other reporters you can turn to for help.
What you're going to get from me is what it means to see a man die an unnecessary death.
Man after wet police chase persuaded to come out of Canning River
The Canning Vale police officer remained dry when he persuaded the man from the Canning River.
An attempt by a man from Perth to hang up the police was unsuccessful when he found himself in the shallow and swampy water, just a few yards away from a police officer who was trying to "gently persuade him to return to the shore."
Canning Vale police were called to a trespassing incident in Beckenham on Tuesday.
When they discovered the suspect, he tried to escape them in the direction of the Canning River.
But he didn't get too far.
"He stood in the water and said, 'I'm not coming out, come and get me,'" said Senior Sergeant Shandel Castledine.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec wasn't too keen on getting his uniform wet, so he used a more reliable tactic - "A good cop negotiates".
“Sometimes people do funny things to try to escape,” said Senior Sergeant Castledine.
Championship football player Ben Cousins offers an unforgettable example.
In 2006, Cousins drove his car into the ditch to escape alcohol control and then tried to swim across the Swan River.
His efforts were unsuccessful, but inspired locals to humorously plan a Ben Cousins biathlon.
Peter Moody claims stewards tried to spy on him and threatens to end racing
Peter Moody claims that stewards of Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his stables last year and threatened to end the race immediately.
He targeted the stewards and integrity department of Racing Victoria and claimed they were running a personal campaign against him with Lady Tatai’s Late Scratching due to a race day treatment, the last straw on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he always tried to do what’s best for racing and found himself in difficult conditions when it came to the positive cobalt swab test at Lidaris, which he can’t explain.
He had been withheld for 18 months because of the spying allegations and didn’t want it to “look like grapes hanging too high.”
“I had no intention of saying anything about it, and I’ve been sitting on it for a long time, but sometimes you’re so frustrated that it all comes out at once,” Moody said.
You know it went on.
Sometimes you react, and you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I will go home tonight and sleep well.
I want to walk around with my head up high, and I want my owners to think I’m trying my best for them.
If they start thinking I don’t, then I shouldn’t be a coach anymore.
I have to think about what I will do with my license.
Previously, Moody had let the bomb go off in an interview with racing.com that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable.
“Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart were sitting in a room with a man — whom I’ll name if I’m asked — and offered him employment in my stables to provide information about what I’m doing inside my stables,” Moody said on Racing.com.
You seem to think I'm a fraud.
If that's the case, they should certainly grab their noses because they failed to grab me.
Robert Roulston, former chairman of the RVL, David Moodie, current president of the RVL and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of the RVL, were aware of this at the time and still are today.
Does that make me think it’s going to be personal?
Did the RVL behave cowardly and perhaps blame people outside of coaches for what is going on in the industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I that bad for the industry?
Maybe the people out there think it's me.
Maybe they need to take away my license and violate me, and I have no doubt that what I am saying is making them think about it now.
But I have now reached the point where I don’t care, and that makes me sad.
That makes me really sad.
I will put pressure on them and push them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can go.
The coach’s frustration levels have built up with the long-running cobalt investigation at Lidari, and the late scratching led him to say that he could “throw his license over the table.”
Moody, best known for his preparation of the undefeated champion Black Caviar, called the race day treatment rule "ridiculous" after a pack of mud or clay had been applied to the horse's legs, which violated the rules.
"It's against the rules of racing.
I have to take full responsibility for that,” he said.
"One of my employees mistakenly applied mud to the leg.
It could have been like that last night.
It could have been like this all day yesterday, which is what it was.
It was like that on race day.
Moody could face a three-month disqualification for treatment with the pack on race day. An investigation of this matter has been opened.
It's a joke.
People who make these rules don’t know anything about the horse.
“We all recognize that we need rules, but we’ve gone too far here,” Moody said.
Man Arrested After Driver Escape
Police arrested a man over the weekend after a collision with a cyclist and subsequent driver evasion in Cobram.
The cyclist was taken by helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on Saturday morning on the Murray Valley highway.
Police said the driver continued driving without stopping to help the injured driver.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia turned himself in to the police in Shepparton.
He is expected to be charged with driver evasion and failure to provide assistance and other traffic offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, remains in hospital and is in stable condition.
Melbourne Storm Coach Craig Bellamy Strikes Back Against Rivals Over Allegations of Wrestling
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has described criticism of his players’ tackle as an “agenda setting” of two NRL Premier League favourites.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said the referees allowed the Storm players "ring fights" with his team during the high Storm victory in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a barely veiled remark about the Storm team after his team scored the final victory against the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night, calling the game a "sample example" of the Rugby League and saying the two from Queensland were not "too good" in the wrestling.
Bellamy defended his team's tacklimg, saying they were only focused on their "contact" when tackling.
Bellamy added that criticism of his team from two leading coaches made him feel confident as it meant they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team.
“This keeps popping up — I didn’t hear Trent Robinson talk about wrestling when they beat us 24-2,” Bellamy said Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we haven’t changed anything about our defensive system or techniques throughout the year, but over the last six weeks, we’ve made our contact at Tackles a real focus, and that’s what turned the tide for us.
Trent has been there for three years now, and he obviously has a great team to coach, so he’s probably not used to losing, so it was a bit of a shock to him.
It’s funny how this happens all the time at this time of year.
Bellamy attacked Bennett's idea of "exciting football" and reminded his mentor that Bennett's St George Illawarra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with "boring" football.
Wayne talks about exciting football.
He compared his game on Saturday night to ours on Friday night and how exciting their game was,” Bellamy said.
I remember in 2010 St George was criticized as a boring team, and Wayne said he was going to take a shit about it.
But now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting, especially his young players with their speed.
This is the ball game you want to play when you have that kind of player.
He made that statement in 2010, now he wants all his kind of football to play - not every team has two players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt so they can play like this.
I build stronger trust because they say these things because they’re a bit worried about having to play against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn’t think of us when it came to the Big Games.
Bellamy also pointed out that Storm vs. Roosters had a higher score than Broncos vs. Cowboys.
The game of the Broncos was probably a good game, I haven't watched it yet, but what was the result? 16:12 ?
Our game was 20:18, there were two more tries in our game, but is this an exciting game?
Or are taking breaks and not scoring points something exciting?
For me, it’s the game plans.
If they mention us, it means that we will meet them at some stage.
The Storm team is free this weekend as they have won the right to host either the North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks in the pre-finals at AAMI Park next Saturday night, with ticket sales starting next Tuesday morning.
Serb with $200,000 bail after drug charges
A man who may face a life sentence for attempting to gain possession of 40 kilograms of cocaine smuggled into Queensland has been released on bail of $200,000.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of five men arrested last month after federal police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Solay, which came from South America via Vanuatu and docked in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was observed meeting his co-defendants at the marina during the morning and later at the Café Coomera Roadhouse, where police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo.
Despite a potentially life sentence for attempting to possess a commercial quantity of cocaine, Maksimovic’s lawyer argued that there was no evidence that he attempted to possess the entire quantity and that it may have been in the cafe for a harmless reason.
Supreme Court Justice Peter Flanagan was concerned about Maksimovic’s escape.
He has a strong relationship with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia,” he told the court on Wednesday.
In the criminal case, he lied to the police about his whereabouts.
Maksimovic’s mother and stepfather had jointly offered a $200,000 security deposit to secure his release.
“After reading the affidavits of the two individuals, it is clear that the imposition of a $200,000 security represents a real financial burden,” Flanagan said.
But that alone will not be enough to stop him from not appearing, he warned.
Maksimovic was released on bail, under the conditions that he surrenders his Australian and Serbian passports, reports to the police daily and adheres to a curfew from 18:00-06:00.
Accident on A5 near Karlsruhe: cab breaks apart
In a rear-end collision with three trucks on the Autobahn 5 near Karlsruhe, a truck driver was seriously injured on Tuesday evening.
Two of the three trucks involved had braked in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel.
The third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to avoid at the last moment to the left, as the police announced.
The driver’s cab of the accident-causing vehicle was completely torn apart.
The driver was taken to a hospital seriously injured.
The A5 between Bruchsal and Karlsruhe-Nord was completely closed for more than six hours until 2 a.m.
There was damage in the amount of 122,000 euros.
Stevan Hogg used girl's phone to lure pedophiles to send pictures
A pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to request images of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg picked up the girl’s phone while she was sleeping, logged into an online messaging service from which he received a series of indecent pictures of children sent to him by another user.
The girl later woke up and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the sleeping Hogg’s hand.
She looked through it, found the confusing messages and immediately alerted her mother.
The police took care of it and saw the five images, then analyzed computers found at the address and discovered "relevant" web searches that used terms for searching for indecent images of children.
Hogg then claimed to the officials that he did, as it would “lead to pedophiles on the Internet” and he then “pretended to be a police officer to scare them.”
Attorney Eilidh Robertson told Dundee Sheriff Court: “He said it was an addiction – that he was addicted to scaring people.
He admitted that the searches on the computer were carried out by him, but said it happened because he wanted to claim to be a police officer to scare pedophiles.
He was asked about his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and whom he asked to send more photos.
He said he did it to lure her.
He said he was sick in the head when he drank, and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder.
Ms Robertson added: "When the girl found the messages on the phone, she called her mother and was trembling and crying.
She then saw the indecent pictures on the phone and confronted the defendant with them.
The girl was interviewed and said that the defendant used computers and Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hogg, 23, Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty to the charge of taking indecent pictures of children on June 14 last year, of violating the conditions on January 25 of this year, and of not appearing in court for a hearing on March 24 of this year.
Defense attorney Gregor Sim asked that Hogg not appear in the register of sexual offenders, as one could argue that "no significant sexual element" was found in his offense.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the verdict until October to receive background reports on social work.
Hogg was granted bail in this case, but was held in pre-trial detention for hearings on other pending cases.
He was added to the list of sexual offenders before the date of the verdict.
Smugglers avoid small border crossings to Germany
More and more refugees are being picked up away from the major checkpoints on the German-Austrian border.
Many smugglers left people at smaller border crossings for fear of discovery and arrest.
on the Austrian side, said a spokesman for the Federal Police.
Since Tuesday, more than 1,000 refugees have been picked up along the border river Inn in the districts of Passau and Rottal-Inn.
They had reached the German side on foot over bridges and dams.
There, they are received by federal police and forwarded for registration.
According to the Federal Police, significantly more refugees arrived at Munich Central Station on Wednesday than at the beginning of the week.
Around 700 people arrived in the state capital by 8 a.m. alone, a spokesman said in the morning.
After the reintroduction of controls on the German-Austrian border, refugees had reached the city on Tuesday 1759.
Stuttgart: Outcrop of tropical storm "Henry" in the southwest expected
Meteorologists warn of storm gusts in the southwest from Wednesday afternoon.
Due to a low pressure region over Western Europe, warm sea air is currently flowing into the country, the German Weather Service (DWD) said in Stuttgart.
The strong low is the extension of the tropical storm "Henry", which in recent days moved from the Bermuda Islands across the Atlantic.
Severe storms and thunderstorms are expected especially in Baden.
According to DWD, gusts of 60 to 90 kilometers per hour can still be expected in the Black Forest, on the Swabian Alb and in the Lake Constance district until Thursday morning.
On Friday, the sun can be seen longer.
The masses are doing it: Every two years, the car manufacturers show their innovations at the IAA.
In 2015, there was above all movement in the compact cars, which are currently selling particularly well.
Cars from the compact class are currently in particular demand: According to the Federal Motor Transport Authority (KBA), this segment accounted for around 28.1 percent of new registrations in August alone.
This is also reflected at the IAA (Public Days 17 to 27 September).
Between all the futuristic concept cars and new luxury and luxury cars, many new compact models will be presented this year.
One of the biggest premieres for the German automotive industry is the Opel Astra, which will be at the dealerships in autumn.
“The Astra is an extremely important model for us,” said Opel CEO Karl-Thomas Neumann.
It belongs to the core of the brand.
In order for the volume model to sell well, the new Astra should not become much more expensive.
Opel is offering an entry below the biggest competitor VW Golf, which starts at 17,650 euros.
The current Astra costs from 16 990 euros.
The Astra is available with a new 1.4-litre engine with 74 kW/100 hp.
In addition, the Hessen offers further diesel and petrol engines from 70 kW/95 hp to 147 kW/200 hp, including three-cylinder petrol engines for the first time.
Unlike the main competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus, the Opel Astra is initially only available as a five-door model.
The second variant will follow in the spring of the station wagon, which can also be seen at the IAA.
And besides the Astra, what else is being driven on new compact cars at the IAA?
Renault Mégane: Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra competitor Mégane into the race.
At the trade fair, the Mégane can only be seen as a five-door in a conventional and a distinctly sporty GT version.
It will enter the market at the beginning of next year, then as a station wagon.
Infiniti: The Infiniti Q30 is completely new in the segment.
The Nissan subsidiary wants to find its position in the fast-growing segment with the new model.
The compact Infiniti with its curved lines fully fits into the brand’s design line.
The basic model will have a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW/122 hp.
However, there is also a diesel with 80 kW/109 hp or 125 kW/170 hp on offer.
Suzuki Baleno: New in the segment is also the Suzuki Baleno, which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt.
The model is offered with petrol engines, including a newly developed 1.0-litre turbo engine and an output of 82 kW/111 hp.
According to the manufacturer, the maximum torque is 170 Newton metres (Nm).
Sales of the Baleno in Europe will start in spring 2016.
DS 4: Not completely new, but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4, which can be seen at the IAA.
On the outside, the designers of the noble Citro<0xC3><0xAB>n branch mainly laid hands on the front section: Here, the radiator grille was redrawn and the modified headlights equipped with LED technology.
In the interior, the infotainment system in particular was modernized, the number of buttons was reduced by a touchscreen and Apple’s CarPlay was integrated for the first time.
In addition, a number of revisions and new variants such as the refreshed Mercedes A-Class or the Peugeot 308 GTI are joining the compact class at the IAA.
JVA Berlin-Tegel: Five square meters of cell are inhumane
The Federal Constitutional Court has ruled an ex-prisoner of the prison Tegel right, who was housed for months in a too small cell.
Due to the violation of their human dignity, prisoners are in principle entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in too small cells.
This was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday.
According to the judges, those affected can hope for money even if they were confined in the too narrow rooms for only a few days (Az.: 1 BvR 1127/14).
Thus, an ex-prisoner was successful with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe: Between June and November 2009 he was housed in a single cell with around five square meters of floor space in the Berlin-Tegel prison; the toilet was not separated from the room.
After that, the man, who according to his lawyer is now back on the loose, had been transferred to a larger cell.
His official arrest lawsuit for the unworthy conditions of detention against the state of Berlin failed.
However, the constitutional judges overturned the ruling of the Berlin Court of Appeal and rejected the case for re-examination.
You see the human dignity of the man violated.
Court of Appeal now decides on the amount of compensation
Even if, for legal reasons, only a few days’ imprisonment from the period in question were decisive for the compensation, a claim for compensation was given, it said.
Otherwise, "a withering of the legal protection of the personality would be to be feared."
The Court of Appeal now has to settle the amount of the monetary compensation.
In the past, constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners.
They did not award damages to a prisoner until April because he was locked up naked in a cell.
According to a 2011 decision, the multiple occupancy of a cell without a separate toilet is also unworthy.
Karlsruhe also confirmed on Wednesday the Berlin Constitutional Court, which had certified a prisoner in a parallel case in November 2009 an inhumane accommodation.
The then plaintiff was housed in a similar cell to the Karlsruhe case for between 15 and 21 hours a day for three months.
The Berlin prisons have also made headlines in recent weeks due to a lack of staff.
Prisoners are therefore locked up again and again for 23 hours, the aggressiveness increases, even to fights should have come because of the tense situation.
According to information from the Justice Press Office, 21 positions in Tegel are not filled due to lack of young talent, 19 are to be eliminated in 2016.
Angela Merkel and refugee policy: "We can do it"
The immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept it.
What is happening to Germany?
According to forecasts by the Federal Ministry of the Interior, around 800,000 asylum seekers will come to Germany this year, and according to Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel (SPD), Germany is even able to accept one million refugees.
In the face of the unusual challenge, Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has demonstrated determination: "I say again and again: We can do this, and we can do that".
The following overview gives an overview of what is to come in Germany.
According to different forecasts, between 350000 (estimate of the Federal Ministry of Construction) and 400000 (estimate of the Pestel Institute) apartments are used annually - for the next five years.
This is almost twice as much as is currently being built (250,000 apartments).
But the lack of housing is dramatic, especially in the case of affordable rental properties: Every year, 60,000 to 80,000 social housing units are excluded from the fixed rental price, and refugees will also apply for these particularly cheap apartments.
Federal Minister of Construction Barbara Hendricks (SPD) wants to double the funding, from currently 518 million to one billion euros.
This is far too little from the perspective of the Pestel Institute: 80,000 social housing would have to be created annually and for this the federal government would have to invest a subsidy of 6.4 billion per year.
Scientists and the Federal Minister of Construction agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investments in housing construction.
According to estimates by the Institute for Labour Market and Vocational Research, it can be assumed that in the long term, 55 percent of refugees in Germany can be employed.
Claudia Walter, project manager for integration and education at the Bertelsmann Foundation, criticises that refugees in Germany are not systematically asked for their qualifications to help them get started.
For the integration of refugees, however, it is crucial whether they find work in Germany.
Work is the key for social contacts, for appreciation in the host society, but also for the self-esteem of immigrants, says migration researcher Dietrich Thr<0xC3><0xA4>nhardt.
According to Thr<0xC3><0xA4>nhardt, there has been a political shift in Germany: from a ban on working for refugees to recognition of work.
While there used to be a work ban for asylum seekers of up to five years, this was reduced to three months in November 2014, as was the residency requirement, which limits asylum seekers to a place of residence.
In society, the majority of the view has become established – also due to the lack of skilled workers – that refugees should be given faster access to the labour market.
A major obstacle to access to the labour market is a lack of knowledge of German.
So far, there is still no sufficient offer of general and professional language courses.
Research also shows that jobs are most often mediated through personal contacts.
According to Thr<0xC3><0xA4>nhardt, the development of networks is therefore the royal road to work integration.
The Berlin school administration has found that only a few refugee parents give their children to day care centers, an estimated ten to 15 percent: "For the uprooted parents, it is first of all very important to keep the family together," says Ilja Koschembar, spokesman for youth and family in the Berlin Senate administration.
In order to convince the family of the advantages of the day care center, the administration distributes handouts in different languages.
Should the demand for female educators increase sharply due to the large number of refugees, the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacity - for example by allowing more specialized schools.
In the countries, students without knowledge of German are prepared for classes in welcome classes.
However, they are not always taught by fully trained teachers, but, as in Berlin, also by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language.
There is no shortage of them, says Beate Stoffers from the Berlin school administration.
The German Student Union estimates that about 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany.
In principle, no federal state prohibits asylum seekers or tolerated persons from studying - the only exception so far was Berlin, but interior senator Frank Henkel (CDU) has now given up his stance.
Refugees who are willing to study could gain easier access to the university.
Refugees with a residence permit or toleration no longer receive benefits under the Asylum Seekers Benefits Act when they start their studies.
In principle, the latter do not receive a Bafög, as they do not fall within the circle of persons entitled to a Bafög.
Permitted refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years in order to be eligible for Bafög, and from 1 January 2016 this period will be reduced to 15 months.
But this funding gap must also be closed, demand Steffen Krach, Berlin’s State Secretary for Science, and the German Student Union.
The students should get Bafög immediately.
Islam will play a more important role in the future, because many refugees are Muslims, and for many, religion is an important part of their identity.
The state should successively grant Islam the same rights as the churches have, and further develop the existing state-church-right into a new state-religion relationship.
It would also be important to establish an Islamic welfare association that professionally takes care of the new arrivals.
Rights also include duties.
For example, the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contacts and be willing to cooperate with the state in many areas and give it certain control options.
This includes a willingness to take a firm stand against religious fundamentalism.
The chairman of the Central Council of Muslims, Aiman Mazyek, expressed on Thursday the concern that religious conflicts could also be carried into Germany.
Those who wanted to carry out such conflicts in Germany “have immediately forfeited their right to stay here, in Germany,” he said on the Bavarian Radio.
He proposed to translate the Basic Law into Arabic.
In the future, integration will be a much more important issue for society as a whole than it is today.
As a result, the majority society will also have to change, the reduction of discrimination and racism will become more urgent.
As a result of European decisions, Germany has had an anti-discrimination body and a General Gender Equality Act for almost a decade.
But it is learning very slowly, as the NSU murder series showed, in which police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motive.
Equal opportunities for all: What migrant organisations and the interest groups of non-white Germans have long demanded and what international agreements such as the Convention on Anti-Racism oblige Germany to do, must become a reality in the coming years if the country is to remain peaceful and its new citizens are to use their opportunities - for the benefit of all.
In general, Germany is able to provide medical care for the previously expected refugees, according to medical president Frank Ulrich Montgomery.
“In terms of manpower and capacity, we can do that,” he told Tagesspiegel.
However, additional money must be put into the system.
In order to avoid bottlenecks, Montgomery asks all arrivals to hand out health cards immediately upon registration.
Services rendered could later be settled with the federal states.
And in the long term, it is highly questionable to feed so many people with the limited range of benefits that the Asylum Seekers Benefits Act provides.
Otherwise, the doctors mainly create the language barriers.
Already so far, as the Berlin health scientist Thea Borde has proven, migrants are less well informed about their diseases than other patients.
Interpreting costs would have to be covered not only in clinics, but also in medical practices, she demands.
But many refugees would also be helped with more general medical contact points in the emergency ambulances.
And with a different diagnostic look.
Among refugee children, for example, there are significantly more untreated disabilities, and young people are concerned with HIV education.
But German doctors would come to terms with the partly different clinical pictures from their training, says Montgomery.
"Parasite infestation or tuberculosis are not so difficult to detect", and as far as the shortage of doctors is concerned, there may even be relief in sight due to the refugees.
The Syrians have a highly developed education system, and some refugees are even doctors.
In order to practice, however, they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly take exams again.
At least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill, according to estimates by the Federal Psychotherapeutic Chamber (BPtK): most suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder or depression.
Refugee children are particularly vulnerable, explains Dietrich Munz, President of the BPtK.
A recently published study by the Technical University of Munich shows that one in five Syrian refugee children arrives traumatized in Germany.
Those who suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder suffer, among other things, from so-called flashbacks with shortness of breath, dizziness, palpitations and death fears.
Other symptoms include sleep and concentration disorders, severe frightfulness, and emotional numbness.
In order to prevent the symptoms from becoming chronic, early treatment is necessary, Munz explained.
So far, however, only four percent of mentally ill refugees have received psychotherapy.
Although mentally ill asylum seekers can apply for psychotherapy in the social welfare offices, the treatment usually takes several months.
In addition, in the social welfare offices, usually specialists or doctors who are not trained for mental illness would decide whether a therapy is necessary or not.
This often leads to misjudgments, says Munz.
Manege invites you to dream
With the new production "Passion", the Circus Probst draws on the traditions of circus art.
The aim is to captivate every age group with fascinating acrobatics, animal dressage and unique entertainment.
Now the Circus Probst invites you to dream in the riding stables on the brick wash.
"Our passion is the circus."
“I can’t imagine living without my circus family,” says Stephanie Probst, animal teacher and junior principal.
"Passion" - this is the motto of the current mane staging.
The circus has been in the hands of the Probst family for more than 33 years.
The gift of enthusiasm is therefore in the blood of the family.
“It is important to us to take people away from their daily routine and take them to a completely different world for two hours,” says the 27-year-old junior director.
"Manegencocktail with a cosmopolitan flair", as director Reinhard Probst calls his concept.
50 cities on the nearly 3,000 kilometer long tour can now experience this flair.
The program of the circus convinces with talented artists from all over the world.
Awarded at the international circus festival in Monte Carlo, the Russian Stoliarov Clown Family captivates the audience with wit and charm.
The Castillo Brothers also understand their craft.
With the heroes of the silent films, the Cuban duo wants to take it easy.
Ease and agility - with these words they identify themselves.
Her humorous art on the mast is meant to capture women’s hearts by storm.
In addition to numerous salmon salves, the acrobatics of the Circus Probst also fascinates with tact and agility.
Balancing on a ball with the unicycle?
No problem for He Yuan.
Snake people are fascinating and frightening at the same time.
Wang Lin from China is familiar with the oldest form of acrobatics like few others and is fascinated by its agility.
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every way.
"The animals belong to our family," emphasizes Stephanie's mother, Brigitte Probst.
Malpractices in the keeping of circus animals are all too often an issue at various animal welfare organizations.
Stephanie Probst also comments: "If our animals are not doing well, we are not doing well."
Around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each petting session.
The "four-legged artists", as they are affectionately called, are, if possible, read every wish from the eyes.
We want to work with animals and have fun with them.
If the animal does not feel well, it does not want to go into the arena.
The first thing to do is to take good care of the animals.
The Probst family is particularly proud of their Zebroid Jumbo, a mixture of a Shetland Pony stallion and a zebra mare.
The two animals lived together for eight years in an enclosure and nothing happened.
"But then, suddenly, our little jumbo was there," says Brigitte Probst.
The Zebroid is not yet ready for the riding, but it is the unique mascot of the Circus Probst.
There should be something for every visitor.
“One thing is for sure,” says Stephanie Probst: “No matter if five or 1,200 spectators, we always do our best and are there with all our hearts.”
The Circus Probst invites you to its performances from 17 to 20 September every day at 5 pm and 8 pm.
On Sunday the program starts at 11 am and 4 pm.
Thursday is family day, for the performance at 5 pm the prices are reduced.
In addition, the animal show is open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe makes false speech in parliament
Mr Mugabe, Africa’s oldest leader, fell down the stairs from a podium earlier this year.
He remained uninjured, but the video of the case quickly spread through social media.
The opening of parliament was also marred by claims by opposition MPs that they had received anonymous death threats and were warned not to accompany Mr Mugabe’s address with boos.
Last month they booed him and interrupted him during his speech on the state of the nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The spokesman for the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) Innocent Gonese said that seven opposition politicians received text messages on their phones warning them not to interfere with Mr. Mugabe’s speech.
"The message comes from a number that is not displayed, but it has the title 'death'," he told journalists after Mugabe's speech.
It warns the affected Members of Parliament that the immunity in Parliament ends, and once they leave Parliament, their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective.
The chief spokesman said the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, was “concerned” about the dangers to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard to cut up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is expected to cut 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of its restructuring and savings efforts in the company’s services.
HP will split into two publicly traded companies later this year, separating the computer and printer business from its faster-growing enterprise hardware and services businesses.
The expected job cuts will result in a burden of over $2.7 billion starting in the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
“These restructuring measures will enable a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett-Packard Enterprise,” said Meg Whitman, HP Chairman and Chief Executive, who will lead the unit after the separation.
“Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP is today, and we have a broad and in-depth portfolio of businesses that help companies transition to a new style of business,” Whitman said.
As a standalone company, we are better positioned than ever to meet the changing needs of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than $50 billion in annual revenue and “will be focused on delivering unprecedented, integrated technology solutions to enterprises,” the company said in a statement.
It splits up a company founded in the 1930s by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to manufacture electrical equipment and whose Palo Alto garage has been called "the birthplace of Silicon Valley."
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to cope with the shift from traditional PCs to mobile devices.
The move by HP, the world’s second-largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. tech companies, is the latest in the field, based on the belief that tightly focused companies perform better.
FC Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says teammates must be behind injured Jack Wilshere ahead of game against Dynamo Zagreb
Wenger told Wilshere that it is only September and that if his rehabilitation goes according to plan, there is no reason why he cannot play again before Christmas.
This optimistic scenario already means that Wilshere will certainly miss at least the next four games for England and given his history, his participation in the European Championship next summer is certainly still uncertain.
The great shame about this current problem is that Wilshere had finished last season strong after a separate ankle injury and then recovered back to his old swing during the preseason.
“This kind of injury doesn’t threaten your career,” Wenger said.
It's a bone that didn't heal well.
That's not a big deal.
This was just an accident.
It was not related to his ankles or the injuries he had before.
This may be true from a purely medical point of view, but as Wenger also acknowledged, there is the associated risk of further injury whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season.
It also develops an unpleasant pattern.
Premier Injuries Ltd’s investigation has recorded 23 different Wilshere illnesses since its debut six years ago.
He has also played in only 65 of Arsenal's 157 league matches in the last five seasons.
The broader picture for Arsenal is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs with the most injury days in six out of eight seasons since 2007/08.
Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believes an improvement in injury rate will continue during last season.
“Sometimes when you come back from an injury, you have a vulnerable period of time, a time when you need to strengthen your body and gain combat strength,” Wenger said.
Jack is young enough to overcome this.
I hope his body stabilizes, I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the kind he deserves.
Arsenal will begin their Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Dinamo Zagreb ahead of matches against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday, and Wenger will set a rotation within the team.
Héctor Beller<0xC3><0xAD>n and Aaron Ramsey did not travel to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta should start.
Wenger can also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
“I’m trying to keep the balance and give the players who need a little breather,” Wenger said.
Although Arsenal are clear favourites to progress through Group F, the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is among the playgrounds with the greatest intimidation effect in Europe.
Dynamo is also unbeaten after 41 games after the "invincible" campaign was launched last season.
The stadium was rocked by an earthquake on Tuesday evening, with 3.2 on the Richter scale.
This year it was the 10th in Zagreb.
Wenger believes that Arsenal have learned the lesson of last season’s Champions League capitulation against Monaco and remains driven by the distant hope of leading the club to its first European Cup triumph with its management.
“This drive is immense,” Wenger said.
It has never worked for Arsenal.
We were very close to it in 2006, but on the other hand, I’ve been in business long enough to be realistic.
We are ambitious, but we are not dreamers.
FriendsFest: the comedy show that gives us serious lessons about men's friendships
The lack of similar representations in shows is evident, especially in terms of how the need for men to open up has now become even more desperate than ever before, as suicide rates among young men at a 15-year high prove.
In 2013, it was the leading cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK, and it remains three times more common in men than in women.
In an effort to address the problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) announced 2015 as the Year of Man, with the goal of challenging the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of the fight to overcome this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depressive symptoms found that if the sufferer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with “healthy mood,” his chances of recovery doubled.
For those who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends halve the risks of mental health problems.
But of course, you first have to have friends in order for a friendship to work.
In the age of social media-led communication, with its emphasis on style over substance, the immediacy of the response is often more important than meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, fun-loving and successful, even when in reality isolation dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, image, social status, all at the expense of intrinsic values – our inner yearning for personal development and friendship, which has a much deeper effect on our mental health.
And as a video game creator and billionaire recently explained, money really can’t buy happiness.
The nice thing about Friends was that this focus was turned on its head.
Each character was defined not by his work, but by his personality, which shined through the interaction as a friend.
The humor of Joey and Chandler’s frequent hugs, moments of football-watching in comfortable armchairs, and Ross’s longing for Rachel—all came from knowing that men can definitely relate to it, even if they often hold back from fully exploring their feelings.
As a telephone chaplain explained to me:... "my listening role for people who are depressed and suicidal really showed me clearly how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference."
The men who contact us often feel unable to talk to friends.
The old saying “I get along with it” has an enormous effect, such as the feeling that it is perceived as weakness when you talk about problems openly.”
Friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer more long-term coping mechanisms.
She clearly presents the small moments of men's friendships.
As much as my objective outsider status over the phone may help people in moments of despair, the long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends.
And so, if you’re visiting Comedy Central FriendsFest this weekend with the all-new backdrop designed to celebrate the day, why not take your friends for a drink at Central Perk.
Or, even better, if you see someone sitting around alone in Starbucks, give them a smile and say hello.
You never know what a difference your friendship could make.
Friends is broadcast on Comedy Central from start to finish - the entire 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria meets to help PSG crush Malmö
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his goal against Malmö.
Di Maria makes his Champions League debut on Tuesday and helps PSG pass Malmö.
Here are the game report and reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were on course as Paris Saint-Germain kicked off its Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2-0 win over Malmö at the Prinzenparkstadion on Tuesday.
Di Maria made his Champions League debut as a PSG player less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut putting the French champion on the road, but after that they missed a number of opportunities before finally elevating their lead when Cavani scored a header goal in the 61st minute.
With Real Madrid and Schachtjor Donetsk also in Group A, Paris need a strong start against the Swedish champion as they not only aim to qualify for the knockout rounds, but an improvement on the way to the quarter-finals in each of the last three campaigns.
But while they got the points, it wasn't a class game of Laurent Blanc's team with Zlatan Ibrahimovic's missed chances in front of the goal. He was later substituted in the game against his hometown team and against the club with which he began his illustrious career back in 1999.
"It's not easy to win at home or away in the Champions League, so it's a good start to winning 2-0, causing our opponents problems and looking back relaxed, even if there are certain things we still have to perfect over the course of the season," Blanc said.
“This is a good omen.
We wanted to win and we won, although I regret that we didn't score another goal or two."
Ibrahimovic returned to the Paris team after his injury in one of three changes that could hold a 2-2 draw in his own place against Bordeaux in the First League on the weekend, but he was knocked out by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentinian winger has been referred to as the man who can take PSG to the next level in Europe when he was taken over by Manchester United last month, and he hinted at why as he ran into Marco Verratti's pass behind Malmö's defence before closing off nicely into the long corner of the net past Johan Wiland.
However, if anyone believed that PSG would get a big win, they were disappointed.
Malmö, who beat Celtic in a play-off to reach this level, competed at Anpiff with nine internationals on the field and was a heavy opponent with a five-man defense and two low-midfield lined up.
But apart from a shot by Nikola Djurdjic, who went far past Kevin Trapp’s post in the 34th minute, they offered little in the attack.
Instead, PSG sometimes gave up on itself, with some missteps and poor finishes, not least from Ibrahimovic, who patched up on no less than five attempts in the first half alone and then gave up after Cavani had used him after the restart.
Nevertheless, he proved much more skillful when he brought his fellow players into the game, and it was a pass by Ibrahimovic that Di Maria turned into a shooting shot, which was steered past the post by Wiland in the 52nd minute ...
The second goal finally fell shortly after the hour mark thanks to Cavani, the Uruguayan scored his sixth goal of the season after Ibrahimovic caught a left flank of Maxwell.
This ended all the thoughts that Malmö could come back into the game, and only an excellent intervention by Wiland from the shortest distance to stop David Luiz could keep the end result low before substitute Ezequiel Lavezzi was denied a goal at the end.
Malmö’s coach, Age Hareide, later admitted that PSG played a class above his team, and the Norwegian said: “Our last Champions League game was in December last year.
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish league, which does not have the same level.
Qualifying games are not enough.”
Hats off to Paris!
It was a great game from them!
Glencore Raises $2.5 Billion Through Share Sales
Swiss-based mining giant Glencore, hit by collapsing commodity prices, raised $2.5 billion Wednesday through a stock sale as part of its huge debt repayment plan.
London-registered company Glencore said in a statement that it has sold new shares worth approximately <0xC2><0xA3>1.6 billion to pay off its own debt.
The company, which lost 57 percent of its market value this year, is struggling with falling commodity prices as China’s economic downturn squeezes demand and wreaks havoc on markets.
The issue of subscription rights brought Glencore’s share price to the top of the London Stock Exchange in early Wednesday morning trading.
The stock jumped 2.77% to 131.60 pence on the FTSE 100 index, which opened 0.69% higher.
Glencore announced the $2.5 billion share sale last week as part of broader plans to pay off around a third of its $30 billion debt.
The company sold the new holdings at 125 pence per share, representing a 2.4 percent discount to Tuesday’s closing price.
It sold 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.99 percent of the group.
Concerns about long-term inhibited growth in China have cut iron ore prices by about half, while coal, copper and other commodity prices have fallen by 20 to 40 percent.
Refugees arrive in Weimar
On Tuesday afternoon, 49 people reach the city administration in Weimar after a mostly long flight.
The refugees come from Syria, Albania, Afghanistan, Macedonia and Somalia.
The youngest arrival is a six-month-old girl from Syria.
White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington
Chinese President Xi Jinping will make a state visit to the U.S. at the end of the month, the White House confirmed in a statement Tuesday.
The visit, Xi’s first official in Washington, will take place on September 25 and will return President Barack Obama’s trip to Beijing last November, the statement said.
U.S. President and First Lady Michelle Obama will also host Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan at a state dinner this evening after the two leaders held bilateral talks.
“President Xi’s visit will provide an opportunity to expand U.S.-China cooperation on a range of global, regional and bilateral issues of common interest, while also giving President Obama and President Xi the opportunity to constructively address areas of disagreement,” the statement added.
XI, whose visit was first announced in February, is expected to meet several U.S. technology leaders in Seattle on his way to Washington before traveling to New York City for the UN General Assembly in September.
Obama and Xi are expected to address a number of contentious issues, including Washington’s concerns about China’s alleged cyberespionage and its increasing self-confidence in the disputed waters of the South China Sea.

Xavi: Pep Guardiola prevented 2008 move to FC Bayern
World and European Champion Xavi has been playing for the al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar since the summer of 2015.
FC Bayern was obviously on the verge of signing Spain's superstar Xavi a few years ago, who was playing for FC Barcelona at the time.
Eight times Spanish champions, three times Cup winners, four times Champions League winners, two times Club World Champions, two times European Champions, one time World Champions - Xavi's title list is breathtaking.
In the summer, the now 35-year-old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and moved to the al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar.
But in an interview with Marca, Xavi now reveals that he was already before the European Championship 2008 before the departure from Barcelona.
"I was told that Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a wanted to sell me."
“Madrid won everything, we won nothing,” he said.
And FC Bayern also recorded this.
Xavi: "There was an offer from Bayern."
"Rummenigge wanted me."
In the summer of 2008, Jürgen Klinsmann took over FC Bayern.
Guardiola was the reason that Xavi did not change
But the change did not happen.
And the decisive man for this today works for the German record champion: Pep Guardiola.
Xavi explains why: "Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a signed Guardiola and I played a great European Championship."
"Pep told me that I wouldn't change, that he couldn't imagine the team without me."
“So he got me.”
Who knows how Bayern’s 2008/2009 season would have run with Xavi.
Xavi stood for Barca in the quarterfinals of the Champions League against Bayern over the entire distance on the grass, eliminated the Reds (4:0, 1:1) and celebrated the king class triumph at the end.
Matt Damon plays down diversity in filmmaking
Matt Damon confronted African-American filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion about diversity, saying she was not needed behind the scenes.
During an episode of Sunday Night of HBO’s Project Greenlight, seasoned actor Brown interrupted the show by emphasizing the need for alternative perspectives regarding a black protagonist in the project’s chosen script.
“When we talk about diversity, you’re talking about the cast of the film, not the cast of the show,” Damon said.
Brown responded in shock, with insulting disbelief, shouting "Hoo! Wow. Okay," as the actor's comments of The Martian solidified.
Damon and Brown joined fellow producers Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the show's finalists.
“I want to encourage people to think about — whoever the director is going to be — how they’re going to treat the character of Harmony,” Brown said.
The only black person, and she's a hooker who gets beaten by her white pimp.
The producer of Dear White People championed the film’s directorial rights for finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio; Damon responded that her direction “could end up giving us something we don’t want.”
After the discussion aired, social media exploded with disapproval of Damon’s comments.
Twitter user Mr Pooni expressed his anger at the clip by writing "Matt Damon talks about the only black person in the room, so he can explain her diversity - that's SO WHY it hurts".
The tweet earned more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes since its release.
Damon’s comments come at a time when accurate racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social discussion.
After teenager Michael Brown was killed by a white police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement made nationwide impact, urging lawmakers and authorities to stop discriminatory practices against color.
In February, singer Prince made an allusion to the movement during the launch of the nominated albums of the year at the Grammy Awards.
"Albums still matter", (albums still have their meaning) he said.
Like books and black lives, albums still have their meaning.
More recently, leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement have released a statement in response to Fox News personality Elisabeth Hasselbeck’s question about whether the group should be considered a hate group.
“The Black Lives Matter network is a love group,” the leaders said.
Recently, it was announced that Damon was on a list of entertainers, producers and media moguls invited to visit the Pope to discuss the depiction of the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether he has accepted the invitation or has already met the Pope is unclear.
'American Ninja Warrior' crowned first champion
Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior on Monday night, taking home the $1 million Grand Prix.
The competition show, which just finished its 7th season, had never seen a contestant complete all the stages of its obstacle course.
During the season finale, two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, made it to the finals.
The last task was climbing on a 75-foot-long climbing rope in 30 seconds.
Britten completed the task within the time frame, making him the first athlete to complete American Ninja Warrior's exhausting Phase 4, but Caldiero completed this challenge three seconds faster, making him the winner.
Caldiero spoke to E!News after the hard-fought win, still in shock at winning the $1 million Grand Prix.
“I mean, it’s amazing to think about it, I’ve never made or had more than $10,000 to live on,” Isaac E! said of his pile of money.
All of a sudden .. like I can't even imagine what that is... the future is unknown.
Leading producer Kent Weed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the final and why Britons, even though he was the first to finish the course, did not receive any prize money.
According to the rules, the money goes to the fastest person.
“If there’s more than one finalist, it’s the one with the fastest time,” Weed said.
How much the money is a wonderful price and life changes, it gets the great gratification.
I don't think he has any grudges about it.
He is just so happy to have done what he did.
He received many awards from fans.
He's such a great guy and a family man.
He is a hero to his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If I were to be beaten by anyone, then I'm glad it's Isaac."
And I think Isaac would have felt the same if they had switched roles.
America Ninja Warrior has been renewed for an eighth season, filming will begin in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers sneak past Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS--The second half of the season wasn't particularly fun for the Detroit Tigers.
They used to be one of the best teams in baseball, but today the Tigers are in last place in the American League Central.
The Tigers are reduced to their role as spoilers, but played this part perfectly on Tuesday against the Minnesota Twins with 5-4 at Target Field.
The Twins wasted a chance to advance within a half-game of the Houston Astros for the second American League wildcard spot.
For Detroit, if only for one night, it was a return of the three letter F-word that was so hard to grasp for much of the second half of the season.
“All wins are fun, no matter what,” Tigers manager Brad Ausmus said.
Tiger pitcher Alfredo Simon maintained his early offensive support as Detroit scored three times in the first two innings, then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) hit 6 times in the 1/3 innings and allowed three runs.
It was only his third successful start in his last nine games.
“I want to finish this year strong,” Simon said.
It’s hard to throw every game in the bullpen, and so I want to go into the game with total concentration.
Designated Tiger hitter Victor Martinez had three hits and was in two runs, his first RBIs since mid-August.
It was Martinez's first triple-hit game since he had four hits against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He swung the bat well," Ausmus said.
He looked good in the (stroke training), looked much better in the bullpen, and he brought it straight into the game.
With three runs behind at the end of the seventh inning, the Twins had their best chance of coming back into the game.
Center Fielder Byron Buxton finished the inning with a double on the left field line.
Right fielder Aaron Hicks achieved a colorful streak, and Simon brought his second baseman Brian Dozier to the strikeout before he was replaced by left-handed Blaine Hardy.
Hardy overcame Wall, the only man he faced, in front of designated rookie batsman Miguel Sano, who snatched a two-run from right-hander Drew Verhagen.
With a pair of runners and the final run in the second, Verhagen brought third baseman Trevor Plouffe to a double play.
It was the 27th time in the Major League that Plouffe hit a double play this season.
After Detroit added an insurance run at the end of the ninth inning, Mauer hit an RBI double against Tigers closer Bruce Rondon, scoring 5-4.
However, the right-hander struck out Sano on three pitches for his fifth save.
Detroit benefited at the start of the game from a still immobile Phil Hughes.
The Tigers scored three runs in the first two innings against the right-handed veteran, who had been cut from the injured list before the game, after missing more than a month due to a back injury.
"Obviously not the start I wanted," Hughes said, "but I felt more comfortable when I got started and felt I was going to make some pretty good pitches there in the third inning."
After receiving the leadoff batter in the first, Hushes handed over a single to Second Baseman Ian Kinsler.
A two-out walk for J.D. Martinez brought Victor Martinez into the game, who created a single "up the middle" on the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez managed his 0-21 streak with the runners in the scoring position.
Third baseman Nick Castellanos followed with a single on the right, creating another run, but Victor Martinez was thrown out of the game as he tried to get to third, ending the threat.
The Tigers advanced in the second, scoring a one-out double from catcher James McCann and a two-out single from center fielder Anthony Gose to the 3-0.
“That was a big blow,” Twins manager Paul Molitor said.
He didn't hit very well, but he got the right spot.
Hughes was in a pitch count, scoring no points in the third inning before being replaced by reliever right-hander A.J.Achter.
Hughes had three runs on six hits and a walk with four strikeouts.
NOTES: Tigers RHP Anibal Sanchez dropped out due to a throwing shoulder injury.
He is being examined by Dr. James Andrews, who operated on Sanchez’s shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez, who has been on the injured list since mid-August due to a shoulder strain, is to be activated for the start on Wednesday.
With Sanchez out of the game, LHP Daniel Morris is removed from the injured list to start against the Twins.
Norris 1-1 at four starts with the Tigers since he was acquired in exchange for LHP David Price on July 30
He has been missing since August 20 due to a strain in the right hip joint.
The Tigers and the Twins will end their series of three games at Target Field on Wednesday
Norris (2-2,4.43 ERA) will play against Minnesota’s RHP Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73)
Hundreds of refugees to be accommodated in Wiesbaden
A train carrying hundreds of refugees is on its way to Hesse.
His arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday.
The people who arrived in it will then be accommodated in emergency shelters in Wiesbaden, as the city of Wiesbaden announced on Tuesday evening.
She expected 450 to 750 refugees to arrive.
Several sports halls of the Hessian state capital had been prepared for this case in recent days.
Up to 1000 refugees can be accommodated there temporarily.
They should then be redistributed to other municipalities.
In the last ten days alone, 7,500 people had arrived in Hesse, according to the government bureau responsible for the initial admission.
Frankfurt and Hanau have also set up emergency shelters in sports halls because of the large number of refugees.
Ischinger: German military measures in Syria an option
The head of the Munich Security Conference, Wolfgang Ischinger, considers military measures with German participation in Syria a possibility.
“I believe that decisive reflection on military options cannot take place without Germany,” he said.
He accused the European states of "collective looking away".
Four years ago, one was glad that the chalice of military participation had passed Germany.
"Now the conflict is crashing on our doorstep," he said on Deutschlandfunk.
The former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid on the ground for the refugees.
Austria controls southern and eastern borders
After Germany, Austria has also reintroduced controls at its southern and eastern borders.
Austrian Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner told Austrian broadcaster ORF on Tuesday evening that no one will be sent back to Hungary.
Germany has not sent any refugees back to Austria.
"No, that's agreed," she said.
On the question of an agreement according to which Germany could accept a certain number of refugees from Austria per day, Mikl-Leitner said that there had already been talks between the Director-General for Public Security and representatives of Germany in this regard.
She did not mention concrete figures and referred to talks on Wednesday in Berlin.
In the past few days, tens of thousands of refugees had come to Austria via the so-called Balkan route from Hungary.
Their destination is usually Germany.
Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and her Austrian colleague Werner Faymann, together with several other EU heads of state and government, requested a special summit for next week.
Germany had begun temporary border controls on Sunday.
The EU countries have not yet been able to agree on a common approach to the crisis.
The EU interior ministers want to take a new attempt at a binding distribution of another 120,000 refugees at a special meeting next Tuesday (22 September).
In view of the strong refugee influx in Germany, the federal government wants to support the L<0xC3><0xA4>nder more strongly in the initial reception and distribution of people.
The federal government will manage this together with the countries, Merkel announced late Tuesday evening after almost four hours of consultations with the Prime Minister in the Chancellery in Berlin.
Merkel stressed that those who needed protection would also receive it.
Anyone who has no chance of staying in Germany cannot stay in Germany.
This view was strongly shared in the round.
The Chancellor stressed that the state as a whole must now cope with a “huge effort”.
Thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan route.
Hungary closed its 175-kilometer-long border with Serbia on Tuesday.
A few hours later, the government in Budapest announced that it would also lock the border with Romania with a fence.
Unlike Serbia, this neighbouring country belongs to the EU.
Hungary wants to prevent smugglers from looking for alternative routes via Romania, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said on the planned new border fence.
The Romanian government immediately condemned the plan.
There were first arrests of people who had cut the fence.
In Turkey, thousands of other migrants made their way to the Greek border, according to eyewitness reports.
Cassini spacecraft finds ocean on Saturn's moon Enceladus
Under the ice shell of Saturn’s moon Enceladus, a global ocean is slopping.
This is what researchers conclude from observations of the Cassini spacecraft.
Thus, the moon tumbles slightly on its orbit around the ring planet.
This tumbling motion is small, but too large for a solid celestial body, according to a statement from Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, on Tuesday.
The researchers present their analyses in the journal "Icarus".
It has long been known that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of Enceladus.
As early as 2006, Cassini had discovered ice volcanoes at the south pole of Saturn’s moon, which spew water vapor and ice particles and thus feed the so-called E-ring of Saturn.
At least at the South Pole there must be an underground sea, concluded the astronomers at the time.
However, the extent of the hidden ocean was not clarified.
Rama missing 1860 Munich several weeks
1860 Munich had to do without offensive engineer Valdet Rama for about a month.
An investigation has revealed an adductor injury in the 27-year-old, the club said.
Rama had already complained of pain at the beginning of the week.
According to Münchner Löwen, the diagnosis means "presumably four weeks of compulsory rest".
"It's hard for us, Rama is a harsh loss."
"Of course we have to think now," sporting director Necat Aygün told the Bild newspaper with a view to the possible commitment of a clubless professional.
As a training guest, however, the sixties initially presented a defensive man.
The 30-year-old Hrvoje Cale was most recently active in Belgium and was previously also under contract with VfL Wolfsburg.
“Croatia currently has the opportunity to prove its skills.
Goalkeeper Rubin Okotie can return to team training after his concussion next week.
On Thursday, the Austrian national player is to enter the running training.
Okotie had injured his head in the match at Fortuna Düsseldorf (0:3) in a violent collision.
Contrary to his initial fears, however, he remained without a serious injury.
No diet fruit - mangoes contain a lot of sugar
Mangoes are exotic and juicy-sweet.
But those who want to pay attention to their slim line are often advised against it.
Mangoes contain a lot of sugar, especially sucrose.
However, the exotic fruits are still healthy: they contain B vitamins and vitamins E and C. But above all, mangoes contain a lot of vitamin A and its precursor beta-carotene.
Those who eat the fruits thus support eyesight, immune system and metabolic processes in the body.
When buying mangos should not be too soft or too firm and smell pleasant.
The peel color alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so even green mangoes can taste very tasty.
They should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days.
Then, of course, they taste pure or in sweet dishes.
But a mango also gives a special touch to hearty dishes.
It softens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as chicory and radiccio.
And a mango chutney goes well with fish, poultry, lamb and game.
The U.S. parcel service UPS is again hiring up to 95,000 temporary workers for the Christmas business in the U.S.
The company has already begun recruiting seasonal workers, UPS said on Tuesday.
Above all, drivers are being sought.
Last year, UPS had already increased its staff for the holiday season by 95,000 workers.
Given the booming online business, UPS and its competitor FedEx have been making arrangements since last year early to be prepared for the holiday business.
In 2013, delayed deliveries brought harsh criticism to parcel services.
First blowout, then striking cold front
In the coming night, in the valleys of the northern side of the Alps, the foehn breaks through, as Meteoschweiz announced on Tuesday.
On Wednesday and in the night to Thursday, the hair dryer blows partly with storm strength through the Föhntaler.
After blow-dryers on Thursday morning, we are crossed by a striking cold front that brings heavy rains, gusts of wind and a temperature drop.
As MeteoNews writes in a statement, Switzerland is currently on the front page of an extensive low pressure area over the British Isles in a strong southwest current.
On the northern side of the Alps, the foehn breaks through the valleys at night on Wednesday.
As a result, the foehn blows until Thursday morning in the foehn valleys with gusts of 60 to 100 km/h, occasionally and especially in the Ureland partly also with over 100 km/h.
The hair dryer can in places penetrate into the adjacent Mittelland, and on the mountains even hurricane gusts of over 120 km/h are possible.
While in the north on Wednesday stormy hair dryer provides summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees, the humidity on the alpine south slope begins to accumulate.
This is where rain sets in, which lasts until Thursday evening.
In total, south of the Alps, over 100 litres of rain per square metre must be expected in the next 48 hours, after large amounts of rain have already fallen in the last few days.
On Thursday morning, the air is running out, as a result, a cold front with heavy, partly whimsical rain rolls from west to east over Switzerland.
Together with the cold front, the wind refreshes strongly to stormy, and the temperatures drop significantly.
The following days present themselves autumnally with 15 to 20 degrees in the north, in the south, on the other hand, it gets sunnier and warmer at weekends with up to 25 degrees.
Rome now has a Martin Luther Square
Almost 500 years after the Reformation, there is now a Martin Luther Square in Rome.
In the presence of city president Ignazio Marino, a previously unnamed place in the park on the Oppio hill was baptized on Wednesday in the name of the German reformer.
At the "Piazza Martin Lutero" he is now recognized as a "German theologian of the Reformation".
The park is located in the middle of ancient Rome right next to the Colosseum.
The name was requested by the Association of Protestant Churches in Rome.
Jens-Martin Kruse, pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Rome, recalled on Wednesday that Protestants in the city of the Popes over centuries as a minority could often only live their faith in secret.
With the square, it becomes visible in a symbolic way that their tradition of the Christian faith is welcome in Rome.
Martin Luther (1483-1546) spent a few months in Rome as a young Augustinian monk at the turn of the year 1510/11.
He felt the city at that time as a depraved sin-babble.
His negative impressions, according to historians, may have encouraged him in his later struggle against Rome.
Luther had then initiated the division of the Western Church with his theses against the indulgences trade.
Hammer Künstler invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the (gilded) crown of thorns is one of the main works that Otmar Alt painted for his Bible.
Klaus Altepost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts.
In the beginning was the Word?
No, not with the Otmar Alt Bible, which has now appeared with magnificent pictures.
In the beginning was the picture for Otmar Alt, who formulated his own personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 motifs.
The 75-year-old has received his "language" with colorful colors and imaginative forms - but this is by no means synonymous with "funny" pictures.
On the contrary: Adapted to the respective topics, this can seem quite gloomy.
For about three years, Otmar Alt worked on his Bible project, for which he made a subjective-artistic selection from the many subject areas of the "Book of All Books".
The result is cycles devoted to topics such as the Way of the Cross, plagues, commandments or Our Father.
He has thus spontaneously fascinated several partners: This applies to the Luther publishing house with its theological orientation as well as to the Kettler publishing house with its focus on art books.
And there is above all the author Klaus Altepost, who has dealt with the respective biblical passages on the basis of the painting.
He interpreted the Bible passages selected by Otmar Alt and thus "translated" them into the present day, into current contexts.
These texts are like verbal mirrors of Alt’s painting.
They are embedded between the original bibliography of Martin Luther and a sentence by the artist, who formulates his very personal thoughts on the respective situation.
The jewelry cover has golden letters.
Thus, the 75-year-old allows twice a deep insight into his soul, his emotions.
This is a high level of intimacy.
Emotions were ultimately the trigger for the Bible project: Otmar Alt, born in 1940 in Wernigerode and raised in Berlin, comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant Herrnhuter Order.
"That's where the upbringing happened with the cane," Otmar Alt remembers.
"I tried to work this out so that maybe I could get back together with the Lord's Father."
His second concern is to help art regain more importance in a fast-moving time: "Today, the perception of visual worlds is characterized by advertising, and that is loud.
Symbolism is suppressed.
Artists have a different desire and delight to show things.
Pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative.
"In that respect, I'm a dinosaur."
Otmar Alt wants the viewers to "fall" into the images, let them affect themselves, discover and feel the power they have: "The image seeks its counterpart".
Klaus Altepost confessed on Tuesday at the presentation of the Otmar Alt Bible in the Otmar Alt Foundation, "always" to have been a lover of Otmar Alt's art: "I like how he understands life with his pictures".
Alt did not pay attention to fully comprehending the Bible, but chose the topics that were important to him, even mysterious ones.
"This was not a collaboration on an equal footing," says Altepost: "This is about the pictures, the text merely explains".
For Hans Möhler of the Luther-Verlag, this work is an invitation to "deepen his life and find freedom".
Otmar Alt’s paintings speak for Möhler both the (biblical) language of love and that of responsibility.
Part of the originals - paper and canvas paintings - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition that will open on 15 November at the Otmar Alt Foundation.
Construction start for BMX track is approaching
Plans made, space found, companies commissioned, earth mounds modelled for a circuit: A year later almost everything was ready - but before the official opening of the BMX track was already finished.
Failures in politics and administration caused anger, especially among residents who did not want to tolerate the railway.
So hills deported, new place sought - now with formal planning and application for building permit.
The approval will be received in October, the First Municipal Councillor Sabine Mosebach-Bock was now able to announce in the Children and Youth Committee.
“I hope that this year something visible will happen,” she said.
Work on the former indoor swimming pool should then be started without a "further memorial break".
DFB strengthens its commitment to refugees
The DFB is extending its commitment to refugees until 2019, and the Bundesliga will send a clear signal at the weekend.
Football reacts to the worsening situation in Germany and assures the politicians its help in coping with the upcoming problems.
"I think this is the biggest challenge our country has faced since reunification."
“No one can say it’s none of my business, I have nothing to do with it.”
"Everyone must be interested in getting a grip on this topic," said DFB boss Wolfgang Niersbach.
At the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin, he wants to intensively discuss the refugee situation in Germany.
"I will be at the Chancellery next Wednesday and meet the Minister of State Ms <0xC3><0x96>zo<0xC4><0x9F>uz and the Chancellor there."
“The issue will certainly play a central role,” he announced.
Football can and will help.
But the decisive course must be set by politics.
The German Football Association has therefore extended its refugee initiative "1-0 for a welcome" by four years.
"Through the Egidius-Braun Foundation, we have ensured that this programme will continue until 2019," Niersbach said at the UEFA meeting in St. Julian's, Malta.
Some federal agencies also support this program.
Already this weekend, the 36 professional clubs set a clear signal when they will wear the imprint "Wir helfen - #refugeeswelcome" on the left jersey sleeve instead of the usual sponsor logo (Hermes).
"We also want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can," Leverkusen's sports director Rudi Völler told the "Bild" newspaper (Tuesday) and described the project as "a matter of course".
“The refugee drama is for everyone, no one should look away.”
"We football Bundesliga players can, no, we have to use our charisma, our influence and our opportunities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so incredibly," said Hertha manager Michael Preetz.
Hoffenheim CEO Peter Rettig spoke of a "prominent sign of the league".
The women’s national team invites 100 refugees to Halle/Saale for this Friday’s European Championship qualifier against Hungary.
Niersbach described the support of refugees as "a great joint work of German football".
The fact that all 36 licensing associations have started their own projects in their places is great.
Equally great is that small and smallest clubs are active there.
The message "1:0 for a welcome" that we have spent is lived in football.
“This is enormously important,” he said.
In this and next year, the association, together with the DFB selection and the Federal Government, will provide 300,000 euros each for the integration of refugees.
"The clubs have already called up the entire sum for 2015," Niersbach reported.
Reports: SAP CEO loses an eye in an accident
The CEO of Europe’s largest software group, Bill McDermott, has lost the left eye by a fall in early July, according to several reports.
In the accident on the stairs in his brother's house in the USA, he fell after midnight on a water glass, which he had carried in his left hand, reports the "Economic Week" on Wednesday.
"He almost bled to death, passed out, dragged himself out onto the street - he told us that last week," said Hasso Plattner, co-founder of SAP.
McDermott can do his job.
“In early October, we will meet before the Supervisory Board meeting in Walldorf,” said Plattner.
The 54-year-old manager was present at the meeting and "fully capable of working".
McDermott announced in an interview with the "Süddeutsche Zeitung" (Thursday edition) that he would come back to Germany in October and continue to lead the software company.
"I'm fully there for SAP, fully in my job."
"Of course, I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Hasso Plattner all the time," McDermott told SZ.
McDermott usually commutes between Germany and the USA, but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Walldorf.
He said it was important to him to go public with such a personal story, the manager of the "SZ" said: "Anyone can do something like this."
"It's important to get back up when you fall down."
McLaren replacement pilot Magnussen out of action ...
Magnussen tweeted an appropriate photo, saying he suffered the injury when he fell off the wheel.
He is therefore no more qualified as a reserve driver for the two regular drivers Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button at the night race in Singapore on the weekend than a week later at the Japanese Grand Prix.
Football: BVB without Reus against Krasnodar: Weidenfeller in goal
At Borussia Dortmund, all hopes for a comeback of Marco Reus in the first group game of the Europa League have finally broken down.
The international player will also be missing the leader of the Bundesliga in the duel with FK Krasnodar on Thursday (19:00 / Sky).
"We can't rely on him," Thomas Tuchel said Wednesday.
Whether Reus will be back in the Bundesliga top game against Leverkusen on Sunday, the BVB coach left open: "We expect a return of him to training on Friday".
Given the heavy burden on his pros, Tuchel will not only change his tribal elf at the Reus position.
So he announced a change on the goalkeeper position.
That is why Roman Weidenfeller takes the place of Roman Bürki.
"He trains at an absolute top level," the football teacher praised the world champion.
Whether Weidenfeller will be used in all Europa League games in the future, however, left Tuchel open.
It is very likely that he will also play the second game.
The statement of fellow player Reus that the final move for BVB in the Europa League must be the goal, believes midfielder Julian Weigl comprehensible: "This is not so wrong Marco."
“I think we have a good chance of winning the title.”
Robot cars: government wants to be a pioneer for Germany
According to the will of the Federal Government, Germany should be a technological pioneer in the transformation of the car.
On Wednesday, the Federal Cabinet adopted a strategy paper from the house of Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), which provides, among other things, for investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure.
Dobrindt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the sidelines of the IAA car fair of a "new mobility age".
Automated and connected driving will increase road safety and reduce congestion, Dobrindt said.
He also wants to discuss the issue with his counterparts from the G7 countries, who also meet with industry representatives at the IAA.
The strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport emphasizes, among other things, the importance of mobile broadband expansion and a rapid switch to digital radio.
To test new technology, a test track is currently being built on the motorway 9 in Bavaria.
In order to ensure that the driver is not “burdened with additional liability risks”, the Federal Government wants to “check the legal framework conditions and, where necessary, adapt to the new developments”.
Germany, for example, wants to work internationally to increase the maximum permissible speed for self-driving cars from 10 to 130 kilometres per hour.
The Federal Government also wants to work for an amendment to the Vienna Convention, which so far only provides for people as drivers.
In automated driving, the car is increasingly taking the lead, the driver is becoming more and more a passenger.
The technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data in seconds.
According to a study presented by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, highly automated driving on motorways will be technically possible by 2020.
Nevertheless, driverless vehicles on public roads are "only to be expected far after 2020."
The authors of the study estimate the added value in the field of driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions in Germany to be around 8.4 billion euros for 2025.
“The digital networking of the car can lead to more safety and efficiency in road traffic,” said SPD transport politician Sören Bartol.
However, the question of liability in the event of accidents and the safety of the personal data of the drivers must be clearly clarified.
However, the Germans still see self-driving cars skeptically - much more than the French or Americans.
A survey by the Forsa Institute on behalf of the testing organization Dekra, presented at the AA on Wednesday, comes to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous cars will prevail in the next ten years, 32 percent expect it only in 20 years, 31 percent do not believe it at all.
In France, 21% of respondents expect autonomous vehicles to be in use by 2025, and 33% in the US.
In any case, drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely entirely on a self-driving vehicle.
According to a survey by the digital association Bitkom, only seven percent would agree to hand over control during the entire trip on all roads.
On the motorway, at least 15 percent could imagine this in flowing traffic, 45 percent in traffic jams.
Nearly one in four would not leave the car in control under any circumstances.
Boll cancels team and double start at European Table Tennis Championships
According to the current status, the Düsseldorfer only wants to play in the title matches from September 25 to October 4.
The final decision should be made by 22 September at the latest.
“It’s a huge loss for our team.”
"The boys found out in the morning."
“But we are strong enough to win the title even without Timo,” said national coach Jörg Ro<0xC3><0x9F>kopf during the European Championship course in Düsseldorf.
Boll was on the flight at that time for a long-term agreed sponsorship appointment in China.
The 34-year-old German champion is expected to return on Friday.
“Without Timo, the disadvantage is that we are no longer such a clear favourite,” said European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov.
The Hamelin, who leads the seeding list in Yekaterinburg, also recalled the Euro 2013 in Schwechat.
Timo was also missing at the time, and we became European champions.”
"We should orientate ourselves to this," explained the world ranking fifth.
Manchester United's Luke Shaw has suffered a serious injury to his right leg.
At the Champions League match at PSV Eindhoven, the defender was hit in a tackle by Héctor Moreno and replaced after a long treatment.
The first diagnosis indicated a tibia fracture in the 20-year-old player of Bastian Schweinsteiger.
Gaultier feels too old for an enfant terrible
It is a mixture of a very large fashion show and a wax figure cabinet: the designer Jean Paul Gaultier (63) presented an exhibition about his work in Munich on Wednesday.
The highlights: mannequins that look frighteningly human thanks to video projections.
They carry the spectacular creations of the French designer, who became a big star of the fashion scene with Madonna's stage outfits - and with the fact that he put men in skirts.
"I can't say today that I'm the enfant terrible of haute couture because I have white hair."
“It used to be bleached, now it’s real,” Gaultier said.
For the visitors of the exhibition "From The Sidewalk To The Catwalk", which can be seen from 18 September in the Kunsthalle of the Hypo-Kulturstiftung, it is fortunate that the fashion designer changed his initially negative attitude to a show about his person.
Actually, he was against it, because: "To me, an exhibition sounded a bit like death," he said.
When you die, you go to the museum.
The impressive collection had previously made stops in Montreal and Paris, Canada.
"It's about so much more than just beautiful clothes," said the director of the Kunsthalle, Roger Diederen.
It is about tolerance, acceptance and the vision of an open society.
The exhibits give an insight into the almost impossible work of the man who wrote fashion history without ever having completed an education.
Chronologically, the show is not structured, but it is an excellently choreographed total work of art for which a lot of effort was put into it: For example, a stylist was hired to style the dolls.
According to curator Thierry-Maxime Loriot, the makers have carted 14 tons of material to Munich.
Just before the start of the Oktoberfest there was a special treat: a leather pants outfit with corset.
Heidi meets Madonna.
He has always been interested in strong women (“women are smarter than men”) and people who are a bit different, Gaultier said.
Gaultier’s old teddy can also be seen in the exhibition.
It stands for the designer’s first, tentatively fashionable walking attempts.
As a child (he was not a good student and bad at football) he put on his teddy bras and clothes, Gaultier said.
Playing with a doll, his parents would not have allowed him.
He later taught himself how to design fashion.
He stole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers, as Gaultier told us in Munich.
Later, of course, I bought it.
For his first own fashion show, he was not able to pay the models.
They got nothing, but were allowed to keep the clothes.
Jewelry instead of curtain - Plauener lace as a fashion niche
In the past, the long embroidery machines in and around Plauen were all about making meters.
The embroidered fabrics and laces were created in large quantities for customers, who processed them into blankets and curtains, for example.
That alone no longer works today, explains Andreas Reinhardt, Managing Director of Modespitze Plauen.
Fashion is important again.
In the early days of the Plauener Spitze, fashion played a greater role, was then supplanted by the home textile industry – and is now being rediscovered as a niche.
Reinhardt gives a few examples: lace in jewellery, accessories such as bags and regional costumes.
In general, the so-called vintage fashion, which is based on past style epochs, forms an increasing potential for commission.
Anyone who does not serve niches in the textile industry in Germany is no longer on the market.
With us, they already account for half of all orders.
Together with nine other companies, Modespitze Plauen is a member of the industry association Plauener Spitze und Embroideryen.
Only you are allowed to wear the protected label.
In the last 15 years, around 80 percent of sales have disappeared.
There are almost no more private specialist shops and also the wholesale trade.
Our products hardly reach the customer in this way.
Today, mass-produced goods are produced much cheaper in Asia and sold almost exclusively via chains.
In addition, exports are weakening, currently to Russia and the USA.
Sufficient reasons for new ways.
The industry association also tries to score points through environmental awareness, as Cordula Bauer from the embroidery bead in Falkenstein explains: "Since this year, we have a seal of quality, which shows that we produce ecologically and socially compatible".
Reinhardt adds: "This also relates to the materials used".
Graduate designer Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schneeberg branch of the West Saxon University of Applied Sciences Zwickau - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and specializes in embroidery and lace.
In order to counter the competition from the Asian region, you have to find high-quality and innovative products.
It takes time and courage.
There is a field of tension between the freshest ideas of the designers and the companies, which above all have to think economically," says Schmidt.
Therefore, an existing design is often only slightly varied to keep a customer base.
A few years ago, textile designer Kati Reuter revived the historic snowball peak.
The machine embroiders small beads in some places.
The Plauen goldsmith master Bianca Hallebach-Krau<0xC3><0x9F>e was inspired by this: "Before, I couldn't do anything with traditional Plauen lace".
Now she uses the snowball tip for her jewelry.
In an elaborate process, it characterizes the pattern in silver.
"Many people in the region identify with the topic of Plauener Spitze - young and old," says Reuter.
It also delivers to the USA, Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in Plauen and its surroundings and who want a memento.
With this I see my jewelry as a modern ambassador of the Plauener Spitze.
Disney Is Planning a New 'Mary Poppins' Movie
Legends should not be touched, but Disney is still daring to a new film of his classic "Mary Poppins".
According to "Entertainment Weekly", however, it is not about a new film, but about a kind of sequel that plays 20 years after the first film with the magical nanny.
It is about the experiences of the nanny with the Banks family in times of the Great Depression in England.
Who plays Poppins more than 50 years after Julie Andrews is still unclear.
But the director is already certain: Rob Marshall, most recently with "Into the Woods" in the cinema.
Xi urges wider opening of economy to the world
The economy needs to open up more broadly to the outside world to foster growth, President Xi Jinping told a group tasked with steering the reform on Tuesday.
“China should be committed to attracting foreign investment and know-how and improving business start-up strategies,” he said in an address at the 16th meeting of the Central Leadership Group for Deepening Comprehensive Reform.
Promoting start-ups and driving reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and provide new space for economic growth, Xi said.
The leadership group has adopted a number of policies, including a negative list to regulate market access, relax border control policies, promote state-owned enterprises (SOEs), raise private capital, and overhaul the resident reporting system.
After the statement, a negative list is created that identifies sectors and companies that are not eligible for investment.
The system is gradually tested and improved by test programs.
The initiative is significant as it gives the market a greater role in allocating resources, ensuring a rule of law business environment and making the market more open, the statement said.
The government will also loosen controls over the powers vested in the companies and ensure that companies decide how to conduct their business.
The statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
As part of an offer to open state-controlled sectors, further areas will be opened up for private investment.
“The government will not change its policy on foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of leveraged companies and provide better services to them,” the statement said.
In addition, it will make it easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the "Green Card" by optimizing the requirements and facilitating the application process.
The right of lawyers to exercise their profession and to appoint professional judges and prosecutors was also discussed at a meeting.
Premier Li Keqiang and important leaders such as Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli also attended the meeting, as reported in a statement released after the meeting.
EU wants to double mercury limit in predatory fish
The European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large predatory fish, thus requiring consumers to take a significantly higher dose of the nerve agent.
The consumer organization Foodwatch, which has received a corresponding working paper from the EU, sharply criticized the plans: "Risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policies are passed on to pregnant women and young children with full force," explained Matthias Wolfschmidt of Foodwatch.
According to Wolfschmidt, the limit values of the nerve agent for large fish at the end of the food chain, such as shark or sword fish, are to be raised from one to two milligrams of mercury per kilogram of fish for "economic reasons".
However, large predatory fish are already so heavily contaminated with mercury that about 50 percent of the catches may not be sold on the basis of the still applicable limits.
After doubling the limit values, only 14.5 percent would then be unsellable.
In return for this easing, the EU wants to tighten the limits on other fish from currently 0.5 milligrams to 0.1 milligrams of mercury per kilogram, according to Foodwatch.
However, Foodwatch described this as a "trick", because smaller fried fish, such as carp, are usually so low loaded that they already meet the planned maximum values today.
The lowering of small fish is therefore "a perfidious diversion maneuver that alone helps the economy," Wolfschmidt explained.
Mercury is a heavy metal that is highly toxic to humans and accumulates over the food chain, especially in predatory fish.
The German government therefore warns that "already small amounts, especially in unborn babies, can cause damage to the nervous system".
However, the Federal Environment Ministry states on its homepage with regard to the applicable maximum values that a "health hazard to the general population" is not to be expected.
Mercury is released into the environment mainly by burning coal.
The German coal-fired power plants emit more than six tons of mercury per year, two thirds of the total amount emitted in Germany, according to a written information from the Federal Ministry for the Environment to the Greens-Member of the Bundestag Annalena Baerbock.
The concentration of mercury in fish, such as those in the Elbe, Rhine and Danube rivers, was “continuously and comprehensively exceeded”, the “mirror” was quoted from the paper in March.
Last year, Europe-wide warnings of mercury in fish were already among the most frequently reported health risks in the EU warning system RASFF.
