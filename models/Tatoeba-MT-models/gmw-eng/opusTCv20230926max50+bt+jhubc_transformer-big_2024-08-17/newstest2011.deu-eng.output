The Czech Social-Democrats in Prague do not know Voldemort, nor do they know the "confectionery".
The new councillors of the capital from the ranks of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD will obviously have to overcome certain language barriers in order to be able to understand their old-new colleagues from the ODS in the Prague Council and in the city council at all.
The newspaper Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz has "knocked off" members of the new Council from the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD a bit, how they mastered the notorious slang that has become established in recent years, in which today's coalition partners in Prague were at the helm.
The coded vocabulary introduced by the Prague political elite in the bygone era by Lord Mayor Pavel Bém is borrowed from some of the best-known actors, situations and causes.
Surprisingly, it turned out that the new councils are somewhat in the dark about these new terms.
At least that's what they say.
"Who is Voldemort?"
"I don't know."
"I'm more of a newcomer to Prague politics," Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Kauck<0xC3><0xBD>, the new councillor for culture, responded to the test of the "path vocabulary".
But the councillor Karel B<0xC5><0x99>ezina - a political veteran - also reacted in a similar way.
For example, the term “Golfhole”.
"This is the only expression of those you present to me here that I use from time to time."
"Otherwise, I don't like slang very much."
From the vocabulary published by the daily newspaper Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz in June this year before the election congress of the ODS, the editorial team picked out six terms, especially those that are notoriously associated with the Prague magistrate.
The Social Democrats should define the terms "Voldemort", "biggest Prague golf hole", "going to confectionery", "bulls' necks", "betrayal of the capital" and "bleaching".
Three Prague councilors agreed to the test, the fourth - Anton<0xC3><0xAD>n Weinert, the future head of the Prague school system - promised his participation in the conversation first, but then did not even take the listener off.
The fifth councillor, Petr Dol<0xC3><0xAD>nek, rejected the test from the outset.
"I don't care about these things and how the bourgeois democrats talk to each other, I don't judge."
"It's important to me how we understand each other within the framework of our programs," he countered.
As already indicated, Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Kauck<0xC3><0xBD> allegedly did not recognize in the headline mentioned above that the influential entrepreneur and friend of the ex-mayor Bém, Roman Janou<0xC5><0xA1>ek, is mentioned.
The term "Voldemort" says absolutely nothing to Kaucky and the only term he correctly guessed during the test was "the biggest Prague golf hole".
"This is the Tunnel Blanka," says Kauck<0xC3><0xBD>, but added for safety: "But I know that from the newspaper."
And jokingly: "I'll probably have to take a language course."
The "Golf Hole" is then properly deciphered by Matador Karel B<0xC5><0x99>ezina, but also by Councillor for Environmental Affairs Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Plach<0xC3><0xBD> as Tunnel Blanka.
However, both Social Democrats also know who the term Voldemort stands for and Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Plach<0xC3><0xBD> even suspects where this figure can be found and thus also what it means to "go to the pastry shop".
"I think that means going to some Prague restaurant," Plach<0xC3><0xBD> is pretty close to the puzzle solution, knowing that this is the headquarters of Janou<0xC5><0xA1>ek's companies.
Corresponding to B<0xC5><0x99>ezina, however, he asserts that he has drawn this knowledge from the newspaper rather than that this vocabulary is his own.
According to the test participants, there does not seem to be a similar naturalized slang among the social democrats.
"I also asked my colleagues, but obviously there is no such thing with us."
"We call each other by name, from time to time we also use abbreviations or nicknames," says the chairman of Prague's <0xC4><0x8C>SSD Petr Hul<0xC3><0xAD>nsk<0xC3><0xBD> - nicknamed "Hulda" by his party comrades.
"At school I was called B<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>za (birch), but I don't know if my colleagues call me that," Karel B<0xC5><0x99>ezina tells us his nickname.
The newspaper Den<0xC3><0xAD>k Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz has tried the name and see - it works.
Ratsherr Weinert is friendly to the party comrades of the "Grandpa" or less friendly to the "Old", the representative Miroslav Poche, who drew attention to himself before the elections through machinations in party sponsorship, is called by some colleagues "Igr<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek" (known Czech Lego figure).
Nicknames are thus the only thing that the Social Democrats allow in inner-party language.
Hul<0xC3><0xAD>nsk<0xC3><0xBD> supposedly doesn't like to be called "Hulda", but Den<0xC3><0xAD>k Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz registered another nickname of the Prague chairman.
His nickname "Doctor of the Rubber Stick Rights" is said to be related to the fact that Petr Hul<0xC3><0xAD>nsk<0xC3><0xBD> earned his title of Doctor of Juris at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to stop the torture of "witches" and issued a brochure
Women who are labeled witches in Burkina Faso usually have some common social characteristics.
They are more likely to be of the older generation, they do not find work - for example, for health reasons, they are single and have no children.
If one of these women "becomes" a witch, she will be strictly isolated so that she cannot become dangerous to the rest of the village.
"Men are quite rarely affected by this fate."
“It also saves young and healthy women from having to help in their work and giving birth,” one religious sister describes the situation in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso, which takes care of more than one hundred women who have been expelled from their communities in a special home.
The local government now decided to take action against this abnormal "social measure".
And for this reason, he published a brochure that aims to prevent the "witch persecution".
But there's a catch.
“More than 70 percent of all adults in Burkina Faso cannot read,” the newspaper “derStandard” pointed out the dilemma of the written enlightenment.
But witchcraft is also commonplace in other African countries.
In Ghana, the neighbouring country of Burkina Faso, 27-year-old Ammy Hemmahov<0xC3><0xA1> was tortured to death by three women and two men - they poured petroleum on her and just set her on fire.
The incident was also reported by the BBC.
The perpetrators, however, claimed that the case was only a coincidence of unfortunate circumstances.
According to her version, oil is inflamed, which is used for ritual anointings.
That is, after the group had tried to "exorcise an evil spirit" from the woman.
The isolation of "witches" supports the people here regardless of their education.
“The Standard” quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso: “Eaters of human souls are a danger in the past as they are today,” he said.
While the government in Burkina Faso is at least trying to defuse the witch hunt, the Gambian president last year the president himself has been quite involved.
President Yahya Jammeh ignited a monstrous witch hunt after the death of his aunt, as they allegedly had a part in their deaths and would now try to kill the president himself by black magic.
“To this end, he called on the aid of shamans from nearby Guinea who, accompanied by police, soldiers and the President’s bodyguard, forcibly kidnapped women and men from Gambian villages and brought them to the President’s farm in Kanilai,” Amnesty International said in its report.
On the farm, the incarcerated people were forced to drink an infusion of plants with a hallucinogenic effect, which also caused intestinal and kidney problems.
Two of the arrested people did not survive the stay on the farm.
It was only due to international pressure that nearly a thousand prisoners were released.
A tenant of Bakala: He heats in the oven - nevertheless pays higher rent
An elderly squatter is just leaving the client centre of the company RPG Byty of the "coal baron" Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k Bakala, the largest private owner of rental apartments in the Czech Republic.
Under the arm a portfolio with three new leases to three apartments: for his own and the apartments of his daughters and his son, who is currently serving a prison sentence.
All three have just increased their rent as part of the so-called "deregulation".
Instead of 3500 kroner monthly rent, the son is to pay 4100 kroner next year for a 2-room apartment with kitchen of the second category.
"And there is not even running warm water in the apartment and you have to heat in a simple coal stove," he angrily taps his son's new lease, which he has a power of attorney to sign.
"But what - I signed," he explains half disgruntled and half resigned.
The Citizens' Association BytyOKD.cz, which described the new rental terms as "incorrect and immoral", advises tenants to simply not sign the new contracts and to wait until December 7, when it intends to publish instructions on how to proceed against such contracts.
But the man just waved off.
"One says this, the other says this," he makes a sinister face.
The Ostrava region thus becomes a large "deregulation laboratory".
After New Year, this deregulation is imminent for most rental apartments in the Czech Republic, whose tenants have so far not paid a market-based rent.
Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz therefore decided to visit this "laboratory" in person.
The RPG waiting room in Hav<0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0x99>ov is one of four in the Ostrava region and already nine o’clock in the morning this Tuesday is full.
Right next to the door are the bodyguards of a security agency and at her a call device.
"Rent 2011" is how a special touch panel lights up on the touchscreen.
Quickly tap and the device spits out a number card.
No sooner have we deciphered the number "157" than it beeps on the large display on the ceiling of the waiting room.
Half a second later, it's your turn.
A little later, an elderly couple enters the waiting room to ask for the rent, but the rush in the waiting room apparently does not apply to the new rent.
Most people are here to solve the usual problems - repair requests, insurance matters and the like.
From mid-November in the Ostrava region, the envelopes with the new leases flutter most of the tenants of the total of 44,000 apartments of the portfolio of RPG in the letterboxes.
The RPG Byty suggests in the letter a rent increase of about 15 to 38 percent.
The special counter for the new rentals in the client centre has been open since 18 November.
"The action is going on for a little over a week, that is, this is just the beginning," the ladies behind the counter respond after a moment of hesitation when the "client" turns out to be a journalist.
Deregulation and Bakala’s former miners’ homes are a hot topic.
Before the elections, Ostrava-born parliamentary vice-president Lubom<0xC3><0xAD>r Zaor<0xC3><0xA1>lek of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD had taken up this issue quite loudly, no wonder that today the newspapers are full of it.
“Twenty years I want a new floor from them.”
"They were not even able to change toilet glasses," the man mentioned at the beginning makes himself air.
So far, according to the employees, mainly pensioners are waiting at the counter to see if they really get the promised rent reduction, which RPG promises them if they sign the special offer in time.
The other tenants who sign the new lease by December 15 will also benefit from a half-reduced February rent.
So far, however, "deregulation switch" in Hav<0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0x99>ov is anything but overloaded with demands.
"Of yesterday's 360 clients, only about 40 to 50 of the rent in 2011 was because of here," the counter officials estimate.
RPG offers individual rental agreements on their websites as well as wall panels, where it seems necessary.
However, if the parties do not agree on the new rent, it will be determined by an independent court.
"This should not be a threat, but should be understood as information about the only possible and completely legitimate legal procedure," RPG explains on its websites.
"No one goes to court here," says one of the employees of RPG Byty and a man on the street in front of the client center at least partially agrees with her.
"I have 13,000 (crowns) pension, of which I have 5,000 left over for food, where should I get the money for a court dispute," he says.
Then the employee becomes insecure.
"Let's see."
"Mr. Zaor<0xC3><0xA1>lek tells them about the media not to sign and so people are still waiting," she says.
The regulated rent ends in most of the Czech Republic at New Year 2011 and according to RPG Byty, the rent increase is an economic necessity.
"The existing amount of rents is not even enough to maintain the housing fund," argues Pavel Klime<0xC5><0xA1>, the director of the housing portfolio of RPG Byty and - especially the neglect of the housing fund criticized by the angry tenants is the main reason for the rent increase in the opinion of the homeowners.
While between 2005 and 2010 RPG was able to invest four billion euros from the rents taken, in the four years from 2011 to 2014 it should be 5.2 billion euros.
On the large-format LCD display on the ceiling opposite the upholstered armchairs in the waiting room of Hav<0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0x99>ov, a few red glowing information appears in between.
"The rental increases in 2011 by 15% and less affect 31 200 apartments, that is, more than 90% of RPG's apartments."
"Always this means a maximum of 7.50 CZK per square meter per month", can be read on the LCD monitor.
Only 400 apartments in RPG’s portfolio will see rent increase by 38 percent.
"In these cases, it is about the increase of extremely low rental prices of CZK 19.66 per square meter," argues RPG.
With 2,600 apartments, the rent will remain the same for the next year.
RPG Byty promises that the deregulation will not drive rents skyrocketing, but will take place gradually within four and eight years.
What's more - the company imposes another obligation: All revenue from the rent increase (see diagram) the company wants to put back into the apartments, especially in heat savings - in new windows and in the thermal insulation.
But - primarily these should benefit those people who sign the agreements on the rent increase.
The architects saw a - the office also includes a kindergarten
The Avriopoint office building in Brno is the new headquarters of the company Arch.Design.
But who would expect a mini kindergarten here, with everything that goes with it: colorful walls, creative furniture, a lot of toys and even a mini playground on the outdoor terrace.
This kindergarten has been available to Arch.Design employees since last year.
The design and architecture office Arch.Design, whose studios are home to a number of well-known Brno buildings, counted on the premises for its company mini-kindergarten from the first designs for the new Avriopoint building.
Wisely foresighted, because most of its 90 employees (inside) are of the baby boom age and the company is committed to ensuring that the project planners and architects return to their jobs as quickly as possible.
Along with the opportunity to work shorter, the kindergarten is another bonus that Arch.Design has to offer its employees in the concept of their social program.
This makes it easier for civil engineers and architects to reconcile their demanding profession and child care.
The mini kindergarten is an original idea of the employees of Arch.Design and with the support of the management they managed to win funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs for their project.
The company’s mini-kindergarten is financed by the Operational Programme Human Resources and Employment Policy from the European Social Fund and from the state budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to this financing (grants of CZK 2.8 million) the necessary facilities and equipment were procured and qualified personnel and operations were provided for a period of 2 years.
After the exploitation of the funding (2 years), the company Arch.Design is obliged to continue to operate the mini kindergarten for another 3 years at its own expense.
The preparation of this project took an entire year, with the company Economy Rating providing active assistance in the processing of applications.
The children are taken care of all day by qualified staff - a nurse and a kindergarten teacher, the kindergarten can visit children without age restrictions, although most of them are over three years old.
And since this is a mini-kindergarten, only 5 children are allowed to be present at the same time, but the day is alternated by several children.
The kindergarten is flexibly adapted to the needs of the parents, the children of all employees have the same rights in terms of the use of the kindergarten - regardless of the company hierarchy and their respective position.
Although it concerns individual education and care, the program content in the mini kindergarten is nevertheless comparable to the framework program of pre-school education.
The children not only play here, but above all they are offered excellent lessons - from basic knowledge to pre-school lessons, while they also learn English.
The classroom is equipped not only with toys and creative games, but also with a computer that is available to the children.
What's more - the presence of young children in the company contributes to a friendly and positive company environment.
The parents can take a look at the children at any time and so the stress of picking up the children from a far away kindergarten is eliminated.
Therefore, parents use their working hours more productively.
No wonder that natural and loyal employer-employee relationships are also developing here.
Arch.Design was thus one of the Czech companies that offer significant benefits when recruiting new employees, are family-friendly and strengthen their personnel marketing through such programs.
A bone house still fascinates after 100 years. Take a look at the interiors of Gaudi
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric lizard, the stairs like the spine of a dinosaur and the balconies are torn open fish mouths.
This is the Casa Batll<0xC3><0xB3> by the Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona.
From the local inhabitants, the house with its organic forms got the nickname "bone house".
Organic shapes, wild colors, the unusual use of stone, tile shards and mosaics, the shed-like facades and ubiquitous soft lines, all these are typical features of the Art Nouveau style of Antonio Gaudi.
The fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade of the house plays with dreamlike lines, tender colors and textures reminiscent of nature and living beings.
It is only on closer inspection that one notices that everything is dominated by geometry, rhythm and well-thought-out order.
At night, the whole fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade looks even more plastic, more dramatic and the special illumination enhances the brilliance of the colors even more.
The same sweeping lines and intricate shapes also dominate the interior of the house.
Wave-shaped wood copies the window frames, railings, decorative elements of doors, even peepholes and ledges.
The Batll<0xC3><0xB3> house in the Eixample district on the lively shopping street Passeig de Gr<0xC3><0xA1>cia No. 43 was built by the architect Emilio Sala Cortese in 1877.
The reconstruction took two years and was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrialist Josep Batll<0xC3><0xB3>, originally insisted on the demolition of the old building and the construction of a completely new one, but ultimately he agreed to Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>’s idea of an unusual and also cheaper conversion.
However, the Casa Batll<0xC3><0xB3> was not designed by Antoni Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> alone.
He collaborated with the architect Josep Maria Jujol.
It was precisely on his drawing board that the decorations for the representative apartment of the reality owner were created and the use of mosaics on the facade was his idea.
However, numerous other sculptors and artists also participated in the design of the fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade.
The joint work on the designs for the Casa Batll<0xC3><0xB3> was the beginning of a fruitful collaboration between Jujola and Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>.
For example, Jujol also participated in the construction of Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>’s Casa Mil<0xC3><0xA1> in Park Güell, which also houses other works by Antoni Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>.
Shortly after its completion, the house received the nickname "bone house" from the local inhabitants of its organic forms.
Others, in turn, called it the "yawning house" because of the special window opening mechanism.
It is also said that at the top of the building is the sword of St. George, patron of Catalonia.
But other sculptural elements also symbolize hidden religious motifs.
Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> designed a central heating system for the house, unique for the time, with ventilation ducts and typical fireplaces.
Her 45-degree tilt seems a bit bizarre.
In his work, Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> consistently ignored all the building regulations of that time and did not let himself be distracted by them.
Before construction began, he obtained the corresponding building permit from the city, but the information he gave about the planned reconstruction was so vague that two years later the city fathers were so horrified at the completion of the project that they demanded a remedy.
Among other things, the councillors also came across the fact that the construction with its pillars even interfered with the public sidewalk.
However, there were no more changes, quite the contrary - only fifteen days after the request of the district in this regard, Josep Batll<0xC3><0xB3> submitted an application for permission to rent the two highest floors of the house - and it was promptly granted to him.
The homeowner himself moved into the lower floors.
In the gallery on the 2nd floor there was a parlor, on the third floor were the bedrooms and private rooms of the apartment.
The ground floor was leased to a jewelry store.
The entire six-storey building runs through a staircase up to the roof terrace.
The basic elements of the conversion eliminated all right angles and straight lines and replaced them with curved and curved walls.
However, Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> also worked with a modern concept for the mutual connection of spaces.
The social part can be completely connected by opening the salon doors and so a larger society could comfortably chat without having to forgo a certain intimacy during more confidential conversations.
In addition to a new fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade, Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>’s renovation also gave the house a rather unusual roof and two other floors.
Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>’s play with the light and the blue and white glazed tiles with which the courtyard is clad and the atriums are also impressive.
The play of these two colors gives a maximum of light to all floors of the house.
In doing so, he simply used the principle that white reflects the light better than dark colors, which, on the contrary, absorb sunlight.
Casa Batll<0xC3><0xB3>, which was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2005, can now be visited by anyone.
On the first floor is the most spacious and magnificent apartment open to the public.
The homeowners decided to take this step only in the year and this on the occasion of the 150th birthday of the famous creator.
When it was discovered that this was a quite profitable business, the visits were kept, yes, they were also extended to other common and the attic rooms, including the roof terrace.
However, the price to visit the monument is not a cardboard stick, it is 16.50 euros, students, pensioners, groups and holders of tourist cards get a 20 percent discount.
This amount exceeds the entrance fees to other Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> buildings in the city.
If you want to get to know the real atmosphere of the house with its dragon turrets, you should try to make friends with one of the residents and visit him at home.
The right mattress and the right bed frame? Women have different wishes than men
Not the best bed frame, but the quality of the lying surface - so mattress and rust make up the good bed.
However, these must complement each other harmoniously in order to meet the wishes of the specific user.
Many things play a role in the selection - the weight, the size, the state of health and not least the sex of the sleeper.
Equally important is the interior, in which mattress and rust have to subordinate themselves.
Typical example?
In a weekend house where there is no regular heating, latex mattresses are not well suited, as they take much longer to "get warm".
In addition, they are significantly heavier than conventional polyurethane mattresses.
And - they should be turned regularly.
If they do not have enough venting ducts in the core and lie on a solid plate, moisture accumulates: it is therefore not impossible that mold will form under them.
Of course, the choice also depends on what you are used to.
Those who have been abroad for a long time, where very high mattresses with a soft layer are common, will find it difficult to get used to a low mattress with a hard surface.
"Well, all the hockey players who came back from the NHL complained to me that they can't sleep here anymore."
"For their chapped shoulders, heels and hips, they simply need a soft layer of visco foam (memory foam - a shape memory polymer)."
"I recommend these, among other things, to sugar-sick people who suffer from a disorder of the nervous system, so that they can receive the "information" from the joints and the skin poorly," explains Sylva Hadamczikov<0xC3><0xA1>, who specializes in upholstered furniture.
That’s why years ago I bought many ice hockey players, but also other customers, these mattresses with visco foam (memory foam).
"Today, this is no longer a problem, because such mattresses offer, among others, the manufacturer Tempur, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico."
And you don’t necessarily have to be a famous hockey player to appreciate the benefits of visco foam.
This "miracle" actually works quite simply.
The foam optimizes its hardness and shape according to the absorbed heat, in other words, it really nestles on the warm body.
Nowhere is it pressing, at night you don’t roll around like after a hard fight.
You just sleep much better.
The viscoelastic foam also offers protection against pressure ulcers (wound burn).
When choosing the mattress size, you should still add to the body size the length of the soles of the feet, so about 21 to 34 cm.
Both men and women, who are about 180 cm tall, need such a 210 to 220 cm long bed.
Each of the sleepers should have at least 90 cm of lying width available, so together 180 cm.
For single beds, for example, for singles, 120 to 140 cm are attached.
For comfort and also for potential visitors.
Otherwise, the following rule of thumb applies to the ideal bed width: "If you lie on your back, there should still be enough space for the slightly angled arms," advises Ing. Helena Prokopov<0xC3><0xA1>, the guild master of upholsterers and interior designers, who has been dedicated to the problem of healthy sleep and ergonomics of furniture for years and who also talks about this topic at specialist schools.
With a double bed, everyone needs their own grate and mattress, but be careful when shopping so that the mattresses are the same height.
Otherwise, there is no choice but to mount the gratings at different heights and this is by no means possible with every bed frame.
Foam mattresses should be at least 14 cm high, mattresses with spring skeleton 15 cm, of which at least three centimeters should be accounted for by the molding layer and the fine padding.
"By hand or when sitting down, you should not feel the feathers under any circumstances," warns Helena Prokopov<0xC3><0xA1>.
Each mattress requires a special type of rust.
Fully upholstered beds with mattress and underlay like grown-up Siamese twins have nothing to do in the bedroom.
These mattresses cannot be ventilated and the cover cannot be washed, which is already common practice today.
And since you lose between 0.2 and 0.75 l of sweat in a single night, it is clear that after five to seven years, the mattress slowly becomes a huge (and clogged sieve).
This is another reason why professionals reject advertising slogans that promise a lifespan of up to 25 years, even a lifetime warranty, for mattresses.
Every thing has its ifs and buts.
And therefore a practical advice from the dealers: With mattresses of 120 or 140 cm width, you should not shy away from the hygiene of the washable, removable covers, but it is still recommended to use a mattress protector, which can be easily peeled off and washed.
Even though today, mattress covers are usually made with a wrap-around zipper, so that after opening you get two halves (immensely important for the washing process and the size of the washing machine!), the manipulation with larger mattresses, especially executed alone, often seems like the unequal struggle between David and Goliath.
Do they have a fixed plate in bed instead of a grate?
Get out of here!
Or at most for a bed for unloved guests and for a single night.
Even so, they should rather provide the plate with ventilation holes (if there are none in it) and mattresses with spring skeleton and 15 cm minimum height with so-called pocket spring core and fine padding.
Polyurethane mattresses do not belong on such a base.
For non-adjustable slatted frames with 14 to 18 slats (slats) latex or sandwich mattresses are suitable (possibly also combinations of latex and coconut), always slatted frames with a larger number of slats, i.e. 28 and more slats pay off, with lumbar support in the lumbar region and the possibility to regulate the slat hardness.
On adjustable slatted gratings do not include mattresses with spring skeleton, as they do not respond to the ergonomic adjustment.
In addition to adjusting the rigidity of the spring slats, special flexible shoulder modules are also offered.
This involves a special fastening of the spring slats, which makes it possible to press in the spring slats or even to angle them in such a way that they make it possible for the shoulder of the sleeper to sink at points.
Especially for men with wide shoulders an important thing.
There are even mattress manufacturers who have started to use soft zones for the shoulder area in "men's mattresses".
The ladies are also thought of - they are given these soft zones in the hip area.
For the most demanding customers, point-elastic leaf spring systems (Lattoflex) or grates with point-elastic contact pads with so-called multitorsion spring systems are intended.
The pressure is distributed over several points, which reduces the voltage.
But - if you use a bad (too large and full) pillow for the right mattress and proper grate, most of the benefits will be lost again.
Again, a rule of thumb: the pillow should support the head, its tips should only reach up to the shoulders, so that the shoulder muscles can relax.
Therefore, a 50 x 60 cm pillow, as the Scandinavians like it, seems ideal.
In the side position, the pillow (along with the shoulder relief zone in the grate or the soft zone in the mattress) should balance the shoulder height.
Our modern mattresses have something in common with the former straw bags (filled with hay).
Modern manufacturers are increasingly using natural materials or at least their admixtures.
Even with mattresses, the new magic word is "organic".
Instead of crude oil raw materials, natural oils are increasingly used for the production of polyurethane foams - for example castor oil and soybean oil.
Soy is probably used by all known manufacturers.
"Bio is the name given to mattresses, whose core consists of materials of purely natural origin," explains Petr Va<0xC5><0xA1><0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek of Tropico Plus.
However, natural materials are also used in the production of mattress covers - one of the first was aloe vera.
However, you can also treat yourself to microcapsules that spread fresh forest or lavender scents when you sleep.
Again, there is a difference between a man and a woman.
While in men, a "cooling" plant extract from birch leaves is used so that the mattress cover can absorb the heat and cool the body, for women, the covers have a "warming" effect.
Extracts of red peppers stimulate blood circulation, so the weaker sex becomes pleasantly warm when sleeping.
And today's favorites?
Mattress made of cold foam (it has larger pores with destroyed cell structure and is therefore more breathable than commercially available polyurethane and also much more flexible).
By combining the different stiffness (hardness) of cold foams and visco foams, multi-zone mattresses are created that know exactly where the head, hips and heels are located.
However, for a high-quality mattress you have to pay 7000 crowns and more.
However, health mattresses are usually subject to lower VAT, as they are considered medical aids.
Gumotex was the first Czech company to receive this advantage.
You see, saving on the mattress and on the rust is not so easy.
Every now and then there are special offers from manufacturers and dealers who offer two mattresses for the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex brand offers the Duofreeze mattress with a quilted visco-foam memory for 11,990 CZK.
You get the second one for free.
It was the material tempur that ushered in the era of viscoelastic foams with open cell structure and high density at near cosmic tempo.
No wonder, because they were developed for NASA, because the astronauts are exposed to enormous overloads during the launches.
Tempur becomes soft when warm, and solidifies in a cool environment.
So it adapts perfectly to the human body and distributes the body pressure in an optimal way.
It is therefore not only ideal for preventing pressure burn, but generally increases sleeping comfort.
However, viscoelastic foams are used not only in mattresses, but also in other health products, such as special foot pads, which are intended to provide relief to the legs and vessels.
Local manufacturers use, for example, the foams Eucatherm C, Twinsaver or similar products.
More and more parents want human surveillance devices to keep the kids under control
The fear for their own children is growing and so more and more parents are considering monitoring them via GPS.
The system, which was originally invented to search for cars, can locate people just as well, which would also be helpful in such cases, as in the recent disappearance of nine-year-old Ani<0xC4><0x8D>ka Janatkov<0xC3><0xA1>.
The device is currently about the size of a cigarette box but soon it should be no bigger than a wristwatch.
Many people have been frightened by the disappearance of Ani<0xC4><0x8D>ka and are looking for ways to better protect their children.
Also for the price of compromising their privacy.
"We are trying to tell everyone that this is not about spying around, but an effective means of reducing the likelihood of tragedy," says Petr Pilin of Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of GPS tracking devices on the Czech market.
"I admit that on a case-by-case basis, such devices can be misused, for example if you put them in someone's pocket without them knowing about it, but we have not had such a case so far."
“Most customers really buy it for security reasons,” Pilin adds.
In his opinion, however, the child should always know what purpose the "box" serves and how to use it in an emergency.
However, the child psychologist Dana Bo<0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1> points out that if a child does not like to wear such a thing, he simply gets rid of it.
“Even very young children show great creativity when it comes to intentionally losing certain things when they don’t want to be controlled.”
"The mobile phones had already raised great expectations with the parents in the beginning, but they can be switched off just as easily as these new monitoring devices," says Ms Bo<0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1>.
In their opinion, it is also controversial whether such an institution actually helps in the event of an attack.
"In the case of planned kidnappings, the kidnapper practically always checks whether the child has any electronics with which it could be located."
"Today it's the phone."
"If such surveillance devices were to be used more widely, they would also be looking for them, as their sale would certainly be accompanied by massive advertising."
“In these cases, the criminals are always one step ahead of the police,” says the psychologist.
However, she admits that similar devices can be quite helpful in a sudden attack by a pedophile.
According to Roberta <0xC4><0x8C>ech of the company RC Monitoring, which provides location services for both automobiles and people, the existence of such a device can help even if it is destroyed immediately after the attack.
"The device can be set so that it reports the respective position at certain intervals."
"Even if it would be destroyed immediately, at least the last position of the person concerned is available."
"In the case of more expensive devices, even an inclinometer is integrated, that is, if you fall down and remain motionless, the device immediately sends a warning stating the position," claims Mr. <0xC4><0x8C>ech.
In his opinion, similar services could also perform intelligent mobile phones with navigation, you only need to install special software.
The problem with current tracking devices is that they are either matchbox-sized devices, similar to trailers, or smaller phones.
There is always the risk of losing them.
According to Mr. Pilin from the Macro Weil, devices that look like normal digital watches are being tested in the present.
"This has the advantage that the possible attacker does not have to recognize at all that it is a monitoring or locating device.
"Or he doesn't notice that until after some time, which gives the police a time lead," he adds.
No matter in which direction the development is going - towards bracelets or pendants, always the same technology is used as in the vehicle location.
So to the combination of location function with the help of the GPS system (just like the navigation in the car) and the function of a mobile phone that reports the current position.
The army has so many fuses that you could wrap the whole Czech Republic but only last two years
The Czech army has bought 445 kilometers of fuses, to be detonated with explosives.
The previous year, the Ministry of Defense had already delivered 224 kilometers of ignition cord to the army camps.
It is reassuring to know that the armed forces have provided for 225 years.
The problem is only the durability of the fuses - two, but at most four years.
The army bought the fuses from the stock corporation STV Group, a. s. for lappish 40 million crowns.
In his justification for purchasing this huge amount of fuse, the General Staff MF DNES replied that the soldiers would consume 60 kilometers of fuse per year.
According to the research of army pyrotechnics, which MF DNES appealed to, it is clear from this statement that the entire army would have to undergo an extremely intensive pyrotechnic training every year - from all the generals and officers of the army command, to the secretaries and cleaning women.
Defense Minister Alexandr Vondra and Army General Vlastimil Picek are not exempt.
Only in this way could the considerable annual consumption of sixty kilometres of fuses be justified.
This is equivalent to 25,000 detonations.
But even so, these army stocks would last for more than ten years.
However, if the old rule of experts still applies that two meters of ignition cord are completely sufficient for the training of every new professional soldier, then the army has created a reassuring supply for the already mentioned 225 years through these new purchases - also from the point of view of the increased needs of the pioneer and special forces.
Soldiers of the Rapid Response Brigade recently complained to the Minister of Defense Vondra that they had almost no cartridges for small arms, so that shooting exercises are severely restricted due to the lack of funds.
Not to mention the lack of underwear.
"I also don't understand why they buy so many fuses from us."
But that’s ultimately their decision, they’ll already know what they need them for.”
"For us, the army is a good customer, which we as a dealer would like to meet as much as possible," says the sales manager of the STV Group Jan D<0xC4><0x9B>ck<0xC3><0xBD>.
Jan Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek, the spokesman for the Ministry of Defence, justified the purchase of hundreds of kilometers of fuse by saying that the army had been stockpiling this "ammunition" for at least ten years.
Jan D<0xC4><0x9B>ck<0xC3><0xBD> of the STV Group, however, speaks only of a four-year service life of the fuses and police and army pyrotechnics only of two years.
"With perfect storage, the four years mentioned are probably also possible," admits one of them, but who wants to remain unnamed so as not to be accused of criticism of the army as a soldier.
At the end of the service life, any ammunition must be thoroughly tested to determine whether it is still reliable and does not endanger the lives of soldiers.
These tests are not for free, but cost more money.
Another argument of the Ministry of Defense is the quantity discount for the 445 kilometer fuse.
"They cost us sixty percent less than last year's delivery of 244 kilometers," spokesman Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek tells us the point of view of the buyers of the Ministry of Defense.
By way of comparison, the annual consumption of fuses by police pyrotechnicians who liquidate World War II ammunition or the Soviet fraternal army has barely exceeded 1,500 metres for several years.
And the police always only order such quantities of this ammunition, which they can consume before the end of the service life.
Even for the safety of the pyrotechnicians, in addition, the possibility of flexible purchases of modern and therefore also reliable ignition cords is kept open.
The Ministry of Defence is already having huge problems in liquidating tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the Warsaw Pact, when the two hundred thousand-strong Czechoslovak People’s Army was preparing for its campaign on the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnicians addressed by MF DNES, in a few years the Czech Armed Forces expects the same problem in the liquidation of hundreds of kilometers of old fuses, which they have so "cheaply" bought today.
To this day, I still enjoy the contacts that I have gained thanks to the competition
The winning placement in the “Small Business Owner of the Year” competition helped Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun to sell his hotel’s franchise.
The winner of last year's competition "Small Entrepreneur of the Year" was Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun from Liberec.
The story of his success seems like a film scenario.
Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun liked to travel.
Only abroad did he realize that there was a lack of good accommodation in Liberec at reasonable prices.
From the savings of his holiday work abroad and with the help of a bank loan, he bought a dilapidated house with five apartments.
Considering that he was a university student in the sixth semester at the time, this was certainly a courageous undertaking.
"The price-quality ratio at that time annoyed me and so I tried to do something about it," says Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun.
He rented the first reconstructed apartment to foreign workers.
He immediately invested all the profit back into the house, which he then converted step by step to a pension with 54 beds.
Since then, in just seven years of entrepreneurial activity in Liberec, he has managed to open four guesthouses, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds of all accommodation categories.
The most comfortable of them was until recently the four-star hotel "Pytloun Design Hotel".
This year, another first-class hotel was added.
“We have just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tisé to which we have sold our franchise concept and other interested parties in the franchise of the Pytloun hotels have already come forward,” says the entrepreneur number one last year.
"A large share of this licensing sale for operating hotels just had the victory in the "Entrepreneur of the Year" competition," Mr. Pytloun adds acknowledgingly.
The victory brought him greater fame, even popularity in Liberec and the surrounding area.
"People recognized me on the street, often they even congratulated me afterwards and I have to say that did really well," he recalls.
I really recommend everyone who wants to create something to participate in this competition.
You don’t have to win right away, any visibility is good.
He says that he still benefits from contacts and acquaintances to this day, which otherwise would not have happened at all.
"With some people I met thanks to the competition, I still maintain regular business relationships to this day."
In his opinion, the fame associated with the success is also reflected a little on each of its employees.
And then there are the seventy.
"I notice greater loyalty and pride in them for being part of something that is universally recognized."
I really don’t see this as just a personal success, no, this is the result of the good work of all of us.”
"My name has only come to the fore," says Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun modestly.
I wish my successors a quieter year than we had in Farmet
The victory euphoria was quickly replaced by the consequences of the crisis.
Thanks to his determination, Farmet has had the worst of it.
Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F><0xC3><0xA1>rsk<0xC3><0xBD>, the company owner of Farmet, accepted the prize for the first place of the Vodafone Company of the Year competition last year.
At that time, the jury paid tribute to the efforts he made in the small tool making industry in <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xA1> Skalice, a company that generates hundreds of millions of sales.
“I can say that this recognition has encouraged not only myself, but also all my employees and strengthened our self-confidence in the fight with the competition,” says the previous year’s winner.
At the beginning of Farmet’s history was an effort to do something useful.
And then when the state offered his father Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F><0xC3><0xA1>rsk<0xC3><0xBD> a small workshop for rent as compensation for the property confiscated by the Communists, he did not hesitate for long, let his career in the company where he was employed until then whizz and founded his own company with a few of his father’s comrades for the production of plastic tubs.
A short time later, they began to focus on vegetable oil presses.
Within 18 years, they have become the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in the whole of Central Europe.
But it was only through the success in the aforementioned competition and its medialization that it also entered the consciousness of the non-specialist public.
“Not only do our customers now perceive the Farmet brand much more intensively, but our foreign partners also began to attach greater value to the fact that they were able to work with a company that achieved the greatest possible success in their country,” says Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F><0xC3><0xA1>rsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
The past year at Farmet, however, was not only marked by victory euphoria.
The assessment was based on the company’s economic results in 2008 and part of 2009.
And just 2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of toolmaking products.
The crisis, which at that time shook even less the citizens, but above all companies, just reached its peak - many companies were forced to stop their investment projects and restrict the purchase of new facilities and technologies.
"Of course, we could not escape this situation."
"Sales fell by 40 percent, we had to limit production and even resort to layoffs," explains Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F><0xC3><0xA1>rsk<0xC3><0xBD>
A viable company sometimes has to take such unpopular measures.
However, it managed to get the situation under control and keep the company in the black, even if with lower profits than before the crisis.
In one case, the company was not willing to make any concessions - in terms of investments in research and development.
"We built a research and training centre from the grant, strengthened our presentation at international trade fairs and won major prizes at domestic exhibitions," says <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F><0xC3><0xA1>rsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
All this shows that we have overcome the crisis.
Sales are growing again and with them the number of new employees.
"I wish the new winner a lot of joy in the victory - but in a quieter atmosphere," Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F><0xC3><0xA1>rsk<0xC3><0xBD> says.
An opinion poll that clears up nonsensical regulations
The opinion poll on the "absurdity of the year" is part of the entrepreneurial competition for the fourth time.
Some nonsensical regulations have already succeeded in getting out of the world.
The doubtful winner of the next year's opinion poll "Absurdity of the Year" advanced the obligation to create documents on authorities, which are available online.
Thus, more than a third of not quite four thousand voting entrepreneurs decided.
For example, the Social Security Administration requested a paper extract from the commercial register, even if the official could have retrieved it by two mouse clicks.
Thanks to the opinion poll, this is now changing.
"The Czech Social Security Administration will no longer require extracts from the commercial register for checks on social security payers in the future," <0xC4><0x8C>SSZ spokeswoman Jana Bura<0xC5><0x88>ov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
The purpose of the opinion poll "Absurdity of the Year" is to examine all regulations and regulations that entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic have to comply with and to repeal the nonsensical ones.
This is the fourth time this year that this is part of an entrepreneurial competition, which is organized by the Czech business newspaper (HN) and is enjoying increasing popularity among the public.
If the three thousand people took part in the vote last year, there were already four thousand this year.
No wonder, because there are still a lot of legal obligations that only serve to hinder the business activity.
"For example, as far as the number of income tax forms is concerned, we rank first in the world," notes Karel Havl<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Traders of the Czech Republic.
Simplification of entrepreneurial activity has been the declared goal of all governments in recent years.
Compared to the rest of the world, however, the situation in the Czech Republic has hardly improved.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic ranks 74th in terms of business conditions, an eight-place lower ranking compared to the previous year.
The competition Absurdity of the Year was first announced in the year and takes place every year according to the same scenario.
Anyone can report administrative and bureaucratic nonsense from April to the end of September.
The web address www.firmaroku.cz is used for registration, after which the organizer of the competition selects seven candidates for the "anti-prize" and has the public vote via the Internet on the websites www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
It wins the absurdity that gets the most votes.
More than a hundred, or more precisely 105, meaningless regulations and orders have already been registered for this year’s opinion poll.
The tips come not only from entrepreneurs, but also from professional associations and journalists.
Among the nominated "finalists" of the competition are, for example, provisions that maintenance vehicles for motorways and expressways have to pay tolls or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets have to provide every two years.
The list of this year's "Seven" is published on the pages of the competition.
The announcement of the competition in Prague’s Wenceslas Square at the beginning of November is part of a happening in which political and public figures regularly take part.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodov<0xC3><0xA1>, the director of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Traders of the Czech Republic, and Petr Ku<0xC5><0xBE>el, President of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic, took part in the competition.
"Where the state throws a club between the entrepreneurs, there can be no real economic recovery, so my goal is to cancel at least thirty paragraphs every year, which today still unnecessarily make their enterprises difficult," said Martin Kocourek, the Minister of Industry and Trade.
Efforts to eliminate nonsensical orders are having an effect.
In 2007, the people most disturbed the duty imposed on entrepreneurs to report to the trade office at the place of their permanent establishment three days in advance the intention to drive with an exhibition stand to an exhibition or fair.
This obligation was abolished by virtue of an amendment to the Trade Act.
The obligation, which received the second largest number of votes in 2007 - the obligation to report to the employment office business trips of employees in the scope of up to 30 days - was abolished by the law on them so-called "Green Card".
And - all good things are three:
For the absurdity of 2009, the regulation was chosen, which forced physiotherapists to have a mirror, a refrigerator and two personal scales in the consulting room.
This regulation was somewhat mitigated by the Ministry of Health this year - the refrigerator requirement fell away.
A new category recognizes socially responsible companies
Evaluation criteria are humanitarian, environmental, educational or sports projects
A novelty in this year's fifth edition of the competition of the business newspaper (HN) is the category "Responsible company of the year 2010".
The basic idea of this competition is to promote reasonable and fair undertakings.
“We want to support companies that are aware of the impact of their business activities on the environment and support socially responsible initiatives,” says Patrik Bartholdy, the regional manager of the mobile communications company Vodafone, who is the promoter and guarantor of this competition, as well as the “Rebell of the Year” competition.
For this year's first vintage of this special subcategory of the main competition Vodafone Company of the Year, companies registered for which success is not the only long-term goal.
The story of each of them is extremely inspirational and would provide enough material for an independent article.
Although they differ diametrically in terms of the subject matter of their activity, their efforts nevertheless have a common denominator - support and consideration.
This concerns, for example, people with disabilities, personal problems or the health of their own employees.
Among the fourteen finalists from all over the Czech Republic, for example, appeared the Prague-based software company Et Netera, which promotes the creation of non-formal sports teams among its employees, who then participate in numerous tournaments in various sports.
Another example of a responsible company from the Pardubice region is the company Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main sponsor of a foundation fund for disabled children for seventeen years.
A paper mill in Pod<0xC4><0x9B>brady is also exemplary in taking care of its health-disabled employees, who make up 70 percent of its workforce, for which it was awarded the title of "Responsible Company of the Central Bohemia Region"; in the Vodafone Company of the Year competition, it ranked third in the region.
In the Olomouc region, the accounting firm MiRyz Soft won, which introduced, among other things, a fluent working time reduced to an average of 35 hours per week and this without a proportionate wage reduction.
At the award ceremony, the jury also honored the fact that the company buys mainly from Czech manufacturers, supports citizens’ initiatives in their environment and works according to environmentally friendly principles.
"We strive to recycle as much as possible in order to minimize the impact of our business activities and administration on the environment," explains its managing director Milu<0xC5><0xA1>e Ryznarov<0xC3><0xA1>.
The responsible IT company Enlogit from the <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem region, on the other hand, is concerned with the health of its employees and that is why it has purchased ergonomic armchairs and keyboards for all notebooks, it also promotes home work for its employees and uses Cartering services provided by a domestic protected workshop for company actions.
“In addition, we support the People in Need Foundation, which provides concrete assistance to the local Roma community,” says Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Such<0xC3><0xBD>, the company’s representative.
Last but not least, the activity of the cleaning company "Pran<0xC3><0xAD> a <0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC4><0x9B>n<0xC3><0xAD>" from the Karlovy Vary region, which contributes to their pension insurance in the form of extra bonuses to their employees.
“We provide our employees with contributions for food, for work, to increase their qualifications and for holidays,” says Josef Strap<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D> of the construction company Czasch from Brunt<0xC3><0xA1>l, the winner in the Moravian-Silesian region.
For the Responsible Company of the Year category, all district finalists of the Vodafone Company of the Year competition were automatically registered, who answered the questions in the questionnaire enclosed with the application and sent it to the organiser by 15 August at the latest.
Incorrect or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were excluded from the evaluation by the organizer.
"If the representatives of the competing companies left the questions unanswered, they were excluded from the "Responsible Company of the Year" competition, but in the main competition Vodafone Company of the Year they were not disqualified."
"It is not possible to register separately for this competition only, as it is only a subcategory of the main competition Company of the Year," explains Karel Goldman of the organizing agency Bison & Rose.
Pilsner Bodenfonds - Arrests of the police in a public tender
In the building of the Soil Fund in Pilsen, the anti-corruption police made arrests in the last few days.
The local media entrepreneur and real estate dealer Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. was handcuffed by the detectives.
He had allegedly tried to manipulate a currently taking place public competition for the settlement of restitution claims in such a way that the land offered in the competition fell to a specific interested party.
He is said to have paid Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. half a million for this.
"At this point, I can only confirm that the police are pursuing a person for the crime of fraudulent machinations in a public competition," Antonie Zelen<0xC3><0xA1>, the head of the Pilsner public prosecutor's office of the Pr<0xC3><0xA1>vo newspaper, told reporters.
24 hours later, the 46-year-old entrepreneur was released from police custody.
How he could manipulate public competition can only be speculated on in the face of sparse official information.
The spokeswoman for the Soil Fund Lubom<0xC3><0xAD>r <0xC4><0x8C>ern<0xC3><0xA1> said on Pr<0xC3><0xA1>vo’s question that the police had indeed made arrests in the Pilsner branch of the Soil Fund during a public competition.
"It was about a client and not one of our employees," she said.
According to public competition, Ms <0xC4><0x8C>ern<0xC3><0xA1> had the correct name "invitation to tender for the transfer of land in accordance with the Land Act" and would take place in cases where several applicants show interest in the land offered.
"In the context of the call, these persons shall offer a higher value of their restitution claims to be settled by the transfer than the declared value of the land."
"According to the offered claims, the order of the potential acquirers is determined, then the land fund transfers the property to the person with the highest offer," explains the spokeswoman of the fund.
Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. obviously had information at his disposal as to who had registered at the invitation, and since he himself was a person entitled to restitution because he had bought a number of restitution claims, he offered to withdraw from the competition to a property interest.
Obviously against a fat severance pay.
That would also be a sufficient explanation for why he had such a large amount of money with him when he was arrested.
Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. already had too good contacts with the Pilsner Soil Fund in the past.
He also played a role in the causa of the former head of the Soil Fund V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Sankota, who was prosecuted for issuing land in replacement restitutions, on which site decisions on construction projects had already been made.
At that time Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. also acquired land from the Soil Fund, for example, which was intended for the construction of public roads, more precisely, at the place where the construction of the access road to the industrial estate Borské pole was planned.
Later, he exchanged these very cheaply with the magistrate for a house directly in the historic center of the city, which far exceeded the value of the land.
At that time, the town hall had to give in with a heavy heart in order not to jeopardize the construction project by blocking the land.
Household housing costs rise by several hundred per month
From January onwards, households will not only have to reckon with higher costs for all types of energy, but also with higher water and wastewater charges and for district heating and in some places, rents will also grow.
Families will have to withdraw several hundred crowns per month from their wallets as of January.
Electricity will be up to 4.6 percent more expensive, gas by 2 percent and more, in some cities you will have to pay up to a tenth more for water supplies and in some places district heating supplies will also become more expensive.
The cost of electricity alone will cost housing households several hundred crowns more each year.
Power prices have been lowered by all main suppliers, so the clear promotion of electricity generation from renewable sources, in particular from photovoltaic systems, is to blame.
Although gas is only moderately more expensive, this is exactly when people have to heat the most and have the highest consumption.
Here, too, a few hundred crowns more can be expected per year.
While electricity and gas are becoming more expensive throughout the Czech Republic, the prices for district heating vary from city to city.
Larger cities in particular are planning price increases.
For example, from January onwards, households in Pardubice and Hradec Kr<0xC3><0xA1>lové will have to pay up to 50 crowns more per month for district heating, and more than 1000 crowns more per year for families in Liberec.
The residents of Prague, on the other hand, face 9% higher water and sewage charges in the event that the city increases infrastructure rents.
If the rent does not change, it is only 6.8 percent.
However, the price in Prague is still among the lowest in comparison to the whole of the Czech Republic.
In northern Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and wastewater charges are expected to rise by 7.4 percent.
Enormous rental price increases are to be expected, for example, in 140,000 rental apartments, for which the so-called rental regulation will cease from January.
For example, the housing company CPI Byty, which owns 2,500 apartments in <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem, plans to increase rents by one hundred percent from January.
Anyone who does not agree with this rent increase, the company wants to prosecute.
The regulated rents, which are still paid today in approximately 300,000 apartments, are expected to increase by more than 10 percent next year.
Czech children get drunk with fernet and rum beer is out - it just seems too slow
Fernet, rum and vodka, for once a good whiskey, which was stolen from the father from the house bar.
These are the drinks after which drunk Czech teenagers under the age of fifteen need to be treated most often.
No exception are children who have to sleep their cat repeatedly in the hospital.
This is evident from the experience of doctors who are confronted with similar cases in the admission of children's departments of clinics.
“Beer or wine are completely out of fashion because it just takes too long to get drunk.”
"Today's trend is clearly hard alcohol," said Pr<0xC3><0xA1>vo Lud<0xC4><0x9B>k Pelik<0xC3><0xA1>n, the chief physician of the children's department at the Ho<0xC5><0x99>ovice clinic in central Bohemia.
"Whisky, if it succeeds in taking a bottle from the house bar from the father, and if not, then at least Fernet or vodka.
"Vodka has the advantage that you can mix it with juice, then it does not smell so strong," explains the chief doctor.
The spokeswoman for the Faculty Hospital Motol Eva Jurinov<0xC3><0xA1> agrees.
"Most often it's about fernet or rum."
"This is today's alcohol trend, especially in primary schools."
"Individually, it was also about Slibowitz, who you take with you from home," Ms Jurinov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
According to chief physician Pelik<0xC3><0xA1>n, thirteen- or fourteen-year-old drinkers are no exception in the hospital admission.
In front of the hospital in Ho<0xC5><0x99>ovice, where he has been working since that year, he worked for ten years in the pediatrics department of Motol Hospital, where the ambulances delivered drunken students from near and far.
"A girl had to be hospitalized four times."
"She started her career at the age of 12 when she was first injected with 3.5 per thousand alcohol in the blood and in combination with 'ecstasy'," the doctor described a particularly serious case.
"She was at the exhibition grounds in Hole<0xC5><0xA1>ovice at some dance party."
“The interesting thing about it was that it didn’t seem strange to her mother that her daughter didn’t come home for 48 hours,” he said.
It is precisely the lack of interest of parents or their incredible tolerance when toasting their own offspring that is considered one of the main causes of the growing alcoholism of children.
According to experts, children are not really dependent in the true sense of the word.
"Alcoholism is a long-term chronic dependence on alcohol and all related phenomena and this is not the case with these children."
For those who repeatedly enjoy alcohol, a negative family-social background is usually characteristic,” explains chief physician Pelik<0xC3><0xA1>n.
According to the spokeswoman of the Motol hospital, Mrs. Jurinov<0xC3><0xA1>, about forty drunk children were admitted to the local department of pediatric and adolescent medicine until mid-November.
However, only the cases of severe alcohol poisoning that required hospitalization are included in the statistics.
Drunken children who are brought home after outpatient treatment by their parents or, where appropriate, by the police, are not registered.
Apart from the cases in which children only drink a bottle of liquor in the school bench, according to Mr. Pelik<0xC3><0xA1>n, there are three seasonal amplitudes that are 100% reliable: Walpurgisnacht, New Year’s Eve and the end of the school year.
"The latter for two reasons - either out of sorrow for the bad testimony or out of joy for the holidays."
"On Walpurgis Night, I also saw seven drunk children in the photo at once," says Dr. Pelik<0xC3><0xA1>n.
A drunk child who spends the night under medical supervision is paradoxically better off than a child who only has to deal with an unpleasant hangover the next day.
The headaches in the morning, which are caused by dehydration and lack of glucose, can be eliminated in the hospital with a liquid infusion of glucose and nutrients that are missing from the organism.
"They are clearly better off, because after the "glorious" experience in the evening, they wake up in a good mood, without anything hurting anywhere."
"They're just a little confused about where they are," admits Dr. Pelik<0xC3><0xA1>n, sometimes spoiling the patient's good mood, at least by telling them the cost of the treatment.
Because the transport by ambulance and the night in an acute bed come well and gladly to a few tens of thousands of crowns.
"Once in a while I used this as an educational tool, when I directly calculated to the children during the visit, what their drunkenness cost and that it can happen that they sometimes have to work all the holidays to earn the money for a single such fete," added Doctor Pelik<0xC3><0xA1>n.
In his opinion, however, the health insurance companies do not resort to recourse procedures to demand the costs necessary to cure the drunk children from the parents.
Two training aircraft L-159 in foreign hands for the first time - in Spain
Two L-159 light combat aircraft out of a total of five, which the Czech Ministry of Defense has exchanged for the Casa C-295M transport aircraft, flew on Tuesday to the Spanish city of Seville, where the Spanish aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS is located.
It is the first time that machines of this type are in the possession of a foreign army.
Until now, they have only been seen abroad at manoeuvres or air shows.
The L-159T1 is an airworthy two-seater version, which was operated by the Czech Army.
The remaining three aircraft are single-seat L-159.
These are currently still preserved in the Aero Vodochody, the intermediary of this business - the company Omnipol - took over them last week.
Jan Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek, the spokesman for the Ministry of Defence, is not yet known when she will physically fly the planes out of Vodochody.
The L-159 single-seat fighter aircraft, on the other hand, were separated from long-term stored aircraft without further deposits and investments by the Ministry’s department.
"The double-seat L-159T1 was replaced in its current condition and appearance," Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek told the Pr<0xC3><0xA1>vo newspaper.
He added that the army would not have to do without two-seat fighter jets, as the Ministry of Defense signed a 200 million contract with Aero Vodochody in May 2009 for the conversion of four superfluous L-159 to a two-seat version.
A new aircraft has taken over the army in July, the second wants to take it by the end of this year.
According to Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek, EADS has committed to enforcing the combat aircraft into the equipment of one of the NATO countries.
"The contract clearly states that EADS is a customer of the L-159 aircraft and that they are intended to train pilots of the NATO countries.
"It is therefore up to the customer how he realizes the matter," Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek said.
The business paper (HN) had previously reported that the Spanish government has no interest in the L-159.
The barter of five L-159 against a transport aircraft Casa and the purchase of further aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns had been approved last year by the government of Mirek Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek.
At the time, the Ministry of Defence did not call for tenders for procurement, but addressed EADS directly.
The then Defense Office argued that this exchange would support the future export of the L-159 to foreign countries.
The Czech army bought Aero 72 aircraft, of which only 24 were used, the rest they wanted to sell.
Incidentally, the purchase of the aircraft Casa should also have a judicial aftermath.
The European Commission sued the Czech Ministry of Defence at the European Court of Justice for the reason that it should have chosen the aircraft on the basis of a pan-European tender and by no means by addressing a single manufacturer.
The army has already taken over three Casa aircraft, the last of which is to land at Kbely Airport within fourteen days.
Longer index finger than ring finger means lower risk of developing cancer
Men whose index fingers are longer than the ring finger are obviously at a lower risk of developing prostate cancer.
This is the surprising result of a study published Wednesday by the British Journal of Cancer.
This is said to be related to the level of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our results show that the relative length of the fingers can serve as a simple test for the risk of prostate cancer, especially in men up to sixty," said Ros Eeles, a co-author of the study, a professor at the Cancer Research Institute at the University of Warwick.
The finger could thus help determine which men should necessarily undergo a prostate cancer test, especially if genetic risks or other risk factors are present, such as family health burdens, added Ms. Eeles.
In the period 1994-2009, she and her colleagues in Britain followed more than 1,500 patients with prostate cancer, but at the same time 3,000 healthy men.
In more than half of the participants in the study, the index finger of the right hand was shorter than the ring finger.
For these men, the same probability of prostate cancer was considered, as for 19 percent of those men whose ring and index fingers were the same length.
However, in men whose index finger was longer than the ring finger, this risk decreased by 33 percent, in men up to sixty by 87 percent.
The ratio of the length of the two fingers mentioned, which are already formed at prenatal age, obviously reflects the different levels of sex hormones to which the child was exposed in the womb.
Less testosterone is equivalent to a longer index finger.
Previous research has shown that testosterone accelerates the growth of prostate cancer.
V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Pa<0xC4><0x8D>es, a leading Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, told <0xC4><0x8C>TK that he was aware of the study, but did not consider the relationship between finger length and cancer risk to be “fully proven”.
Czech Republic in the snow - D1 and D5 are closed
Like most of Europe, the Czech Republic is covered in snow on Thursday morning.
On the roads and sidewalks there is mostly stuck snow, the winter servicemen were in many places all night on the road.
The D5 motorway between kilometers 89 and 90 in the direction of Rozvadov is closed due to some accidents of trucks and cars and also the D1 near Brno in the direction of Prague "stands".
This is what Novinky.CZ told the dispatcher of the Central Auto-Moto Club (<0xC3><0x9A>AMK).
At kilometer 91 a truck crashed, at kilometer 93 two trucks collided, in this accident there are injured.
There are also a few cars in the ditch.
There are also problems at kilometer 185 of the highway D1 towards Prague.
Here, too, two trucks collided.
The drivers should leave immediately behind Brno at kilometre 190 or drive over Brno and drive up at kilometre 182 at the village of K<0xC3><0xBD>valka.
This is where miles of traffic jams form.
Also on the D11 an accident happened and that right at the entrance to Prague.
In Prague itself there is a snow cover several centimeters thick and the thermometer shows minus seven degrees Celsius.
Car columns are formed in Prosek, for example, and <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>rboholsk<0xC3><0xA1> street is also completely congested.
The safest means of transport is definitely the metro.
The trams run with delays, for example on the line between Karlsplatz and Friedensplatz.
At eight o’clock in the morning, the Prague Crisis Staff meets.
There are also problems with the railway and at the airfield.
The Czech State Railways had to cancel seven express train connections due to snow drifts.
There are problems, for example, on the route Prague - Kralupy or Prague - Beroun.
Travellers should inform themselves about the current situation.
Ruzyn<0xC4><0x9B> Airport has been closed from Wednesday 11 a.m. until 5 a.m.
Most roads in South Moravia are only passable with increased caution.
Around Vy<0xC5><0xA1>kov, three secondary roads are completely impassable, in the vicinity of Brno there are snow drifts in places and in the vicinity of Blansko one is forced to use snow blowers on some higher roads.
One of the most affected areas is V<0xC3><0xBD><0xC5><0xA1>kov.
There are still three roads completely closed: Rous<0xC3><0xAD>nov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Ku<0xC4><0x8D>erov and also <0xC5><0xA0>aratice - Mile<0xC5><0xA1>ovice.
Here, too, you will have to use snow blowers for snow removal.
It is not yet possible to estimate when they will become passable again.
In the Hodon<0xC3><0xAD>n region, caution should be exercised in the White Carpathians.
On the roads, which for nature conservation reasons may only be scattered with inert spreading agents, there is a snow cover up to five centimeters thick, <0xC4><0x8C>TK led.
In the Czech Republic, new snow fell from two to ten centimetres, mostly in northern Bohemia - in places up to 18 centimetres.
In the Moravian-Silesian region, up to 15 centimetres of fresh snow fell.
In the Czech Republic, however, it slowly stops snowing.
American soldiers have a new "intelligent weapon."
For the first time in Afghanistan, American troops have used a new "intelligent" weapon, which is so far only known under its code name XM-25.
The generals hope that this new automatic weapon will influence the conflict there with the Taliban and shift the balance of forces in their favor.
The new weapon is something like a super-accurate cannon.
Your projectiles are steered into the target by laser with an accuracy of only a few meters.
The special 25 mm calibre shells, designed for this rifle and containing high explosives, function practically like small grenades.
The projectiles can be programmed in such a way that they can explode not only on impact with the target, but at any point in their ballistic trajectory.
That is, you can use them against an enemy hiding behind an obstacle - a wall or in the trench.
It is usually not protected from above, so the murderous steel-splitting rain from above can easily incapacitate it.
According to Richard Audett, who helped develop the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon to use “smart” technologies.
"The soldier basically does this: he aims at the target and sends out a laser beam that determines the distance, so he gains an exact sighting point, after which he corrects the elevation angle, then he only needs to push off.
"Let's say you measured 543 meters."
"When you take off, the gun charges up and shoots the bullet at the distance of 543 meters plus minus one, two or three meters.
400 jobs will be relocated
The Fujitsu Group is moving its office in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July next year, 400 employees will move their workplace from the previous office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to the Astro Park.
The Japanese group Fujitsu is moving its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the industry giant specializing in computers and their maintenance announced on Wednesday, in July next year, 400 women and men will move their workplace from the previous office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to the Astro Park, which is a large office complex on Lyoner Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e in Frankfurt’s Niederrad district.
A Fujitsu spokeswoman explained that in the medium term, another 100 jobs of the group should be accommodated, which are so far distributed to the region.
The rental offer was extremely attractive, and the open-plan offices in the Astro Park would also be better suited to the way the employees work.
In Bad Homburg, too, Fujitsu had only been a tenant.
Bernd Wagner, Managing Director responsible, said, “With Frankfurt-Niederrad we have found a central location with excellent infrastructure.”
The excellent connection to the airport is particularly important for a global company such as Fujitsu.
The recent move of an important company within the region yesterday brought joy to the winners and disappointment to the losers.
Frankfurt-based economic affairs director Markus Frank (CDU) said that once again a "global player" had been won.
“This is a great location.”
Fujitsu fits the city, the settlement is an important impulse for Niederrad.
The mayor of Bad Homburg, Michael Korwisi (The Greens) regretted the decision of Fujitsu.
The city was informed early by the management of the intention.
"Of course, we offered the company our help," Korwisi said.
However, the friendly contacts could not have changed the difficulties of the computer manufacturer with the landlord of the property at Marienbader Platz.
Ultimately, economic reasons would have been the deciding factor.
Now it is a question of preventing a long vacancy in such a prominent place.
"I hope the owner and landlord of the building is showing up cooperatively."
The house at Rathausplatz, previously used by Fujitsu, and the neighbouring "Kleine Vertikale" (small vertical), together with the other buildings at Marienbader Platz, were among the most controversial construction projects in the spa town ten years ago.
As a joint project of the city and a private project developer, a new city entrance was created between the station and the town hall, which caused criticism both because of the massive construction of the previously partly used as a parking space and the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the investment consulting and rating company Feri, the software manufacturer for travel distribution systems, started Amadeus, as well as the computer manufacturer Fujitsu, which was still associated with Siemens at the time, moved into the houses.
The building used by Fujitsu was acquired in 2006 by the Frankfurt-based Deutsche Immobilien-Ochsen-Gruppe together with the Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund and sold a year later to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
The Tokyo-based Fujitsu Konuzer calls itself the third largest IT provider in the world.
It provides companies with computers and servers, for example, and also provides the necessary service.
The branch office in the Rhine-Main area is one of the largest in Germany, but Fujitsu has many more employees in Munich.
From Bad Homburg, the subsidiary Fujitsu Technology Solutions moves into Frankfurt-Niederrad, the other subsidiaries at this location will be Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
For this purpose, 7000 square meters were rented in the Astro Park office building.
In the twenty-year-old complex - the name alludes to its star-shaped floor plan - the central association of the electrical engineering and electronics industry has its headquarters.
Amazon shuts down its servers, threatening Assange
WikiLeaks is increasingly in trouble.
The Internet service provider Amazon has banned the disclosure platform from its servers.
There may be political pressure behind the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic cables.
WikiLeaks founder Assange is reportedly in England.
The WikiLeaks disclosure platform is under increasing attack in the United States.
The Internet activists lost access to their former American server and are now looking for an Internet homeland in Europe.
Prominent U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman has called on other countries and businesses to boycott WikiLeaks.
And WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who is on Interpol’s wanted lists, is said to be in the UK, according to a newspaper report.
"Wikileaks displaced by Amazon server."
"Free speech in the land of the free," the revealing activists announced via short message service Twitter on Wednesday (local time).
Recently, the internet company Amazon had banned the Wikileaks documents from its servers.
The Internet activists had used the Amazon Web Service (AWS) in the publication of the secret diplomatic cables in order to cope with the high numbers of access to the documents.
On Twitter, WikiLeaks tweeted: “Fine – our dollars are now being spent to keep people in Europe busy.”
If Amazon has such a problem with free speech, “they should stop selling books.”
Amazon has stopped using its servers by Wikileaks after employees of Senator Joe Lieberman did research, CNN reported, citing Lieberman's office.
The chairman of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security had threatened Amazon with a boycott, reported the British "Guardian".
“I would have liked Amazon to take this action earlier, given the previous releases of classified information by WikiLeaks,” he said.
Lieberman, meanwhile, called for the platform to be denied use to servers in other countries as well.
“WikiLeaks’ illegal, egregious, and reckless conduct puts our national security at risk and endangers lives around the globe,” the non-partisan senator said in a statement.
"No responsible company - whether American or foreign - should help Wikileaks in its efforts to distribute stolen material."
WikiLeaks founder Assange, who is wanted by authorities in Sweden on suspicion of rape, is on Interpol’s wanted list.
According to a report in the London newspaper The Independent, the 39-year-old Australian is in the UK, the exact location is known to Scotland Yard.
The internet activist has always described the investigation in Sweden as an intrigue of his opponents.
WikiLeaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson said there were threats in London.
"There were even calls for the assassination of Julian Assange."
Therefore, Assange rightly feared for his safety, said Hrafnsson.
The WikiLeaks founder will remain hidden.
Hrafnsson apparently responded to statements from North America.
In America, former Arkansas Republican governor Mike Huckabee had called for the person responsible for the Wikileaks revelations to be indicted and executed for treason.
In Canada, an adviser to Prime Minister Stephen Harper — obviously ironically — said on television that Assange should be “killed” and Obama could “use a drone.”
Meanwhile, a clash between the White House and Assange erupted.
US President Barack Obama’s spokesman, Robert Gibbs, called it “ridiculous and absurd” that Assange had called for Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s resignation if she was responsible for recent spying calls on diplomats.
"I'm not quite sure why we care about the opinion of a guy with a website," Gibbs said.
“Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than its one website.”
The U.S. government is now putting the protection of its databases to the test.
The White House said it had appointed Russell Travers, vice director of the Center for Counter-Terrorism, as its special envoy.
Travers was responsible for developing “necessary structural reforms” that had become necessary after the disclosure of the embassy reports by Wikileaks.
The White House also wants to have the ways the entire government exchanges and protects information.
The U.S. government also announced that it would seek to ensure the safety of dissidents and the most active if they were threatened by the Wikileaks publication.
"We have done everything possible to get in touch with them," said Philip Crowley, a spokesman for the foreign ministry.
"We stand ready to protect them if necessary."
The Eis-Universit<0xC3><0xA4>t
At Gelato University near Bologna, ice cream condiments are prepared for better seasons.
The three-day basic course for future gelatieri has the largest influx and visitors from all over the world.
Where did all the ice come from?
Of the Gelatiere and of the Gelataio.
The gelatine, in German somewhat ancient the ice cream confectioner, makes the cream according to all the rules of Italian ice cream making.
The Gelataio takes the ice cream from the fridge with a spatula, strokes it into the waffle and then sells it.
To know that, you do not have to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But if you want to know more about ice cream, you can't miss the "Gelato University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The University of Ice has set up the manufacturer of ice machines in 2003 so that the ice cream from its machines everywhere meets the high Italian ideals.
The three-day basic course for future gelatieri has the largest influx and visitors from all over the world.
However, there are also several-day special courses around chocolate ice cream and internships in the in-house ice cream shop.
Some dream of a new career in the midlife crisis, others simply dare to the smooth ice of their vague desires.
This time 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents - from Brazil to Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, an art teacher from California, loves the slow food movement and wants to offer a European quality product in the country of industrial ice cream in the future.
Anke from Berlin is a management consultant and after years in a nerve-wracking job wants to bag something of her own.
Two young Egyptian women dream of opening an ice cream shop in Cairo.
A man from Malta and one from Brazil want to improve the quality of the ice cream in their bars – and Canadian housewife Julia comes because her children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro-Gelatiere Luciano Ferrari first explains to the participants the ideal properties of the perfect ice cream.
The decisive factor is not only good taste, but also the silky suppleness and the good consistency.
Luciano does not forget the icing on the cake of the national and generally southern superstructure: "Italian gelato is simply the best - and then there is still a lot of romance."
The first step to making it seems simple.
Luciano flips the basic ingredients milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large blender that heats everything to 85 degrees with an electronic program and then immediately cools to four degrees.
Then he turns up a tap on the machine, and out comes a pasteurized white base cream, basis for all milk ice creams.
The lecturer is immediately bombarded with questions: Can ice cream only be made with natural substances without a stabilizer?
How can you let your own desire for experimentation run free?
Luciano warns against being misled by the zeitgeist.
Anyone who speaks of ice cream "only from natural ingredients" may still have used stabilizers - usually a natural product, such as guar gum from the guar bean.
Of course, you can also make ice cream without a stabilizer, but then it has to be sold within a day, otherwise it collapses in itself, and the customer bites on all kinds of ice grains.
Certain variations in the base mass are allowed.
It gets more exciting with the flavors.
For the taste in the ice cream, Maestro Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients that you buy in the fruit department or at the sweets of the supermarket.
There are also powders and pastes.
"The suppliers will all try to turn you dozens of flavored additives."
“You should just experiment.”
Either with the fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruits.
Or the ice cream from the white base, which turns into a yellow cream with eggs and cocoa powder as the basis for all kinds of chocolate seductions.
Now the students are allowed to use the ice machines.
Luciano has them each made four different types of vanilla, chocolate, mocha and hazelnut ice cream - with or without eggs in the base, with more or less vanilla flavor or other natural additives.
The same experiment is also carried out on the fruit ice cream varieties.
More flavours, more fruit puree - taste is not necessarily better.
Hazelnut ice cream doesn’t necessarily taste more nutty if it contains more hazelnuts.
The most popular kiwi ice cream is produced by the working group, which uses more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
Only a balanced mixture really highlights the taste of a gelato, Luciano says.
Ice cream production is a calculation task: If peach puree with a lot of sugar is used, the sugar content in the basic recipe must be reduced.
For lemon ice cream, an extra portion of sugar is needed.
Luciano pulls out a device with which he determines the sugar content of the fruit varieties (Winzers measure the Oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately, tables make computing easier.
Making ice cream no longer requires as much physical effort as before.
Not only the device for the automatic production of the basic mass helps.
There is also a device in which the finished ice mixture is simultaneously whipped creamy and cooled to minus temperatures.
Despite all the automation, small breakdowns do not fail.
The Brazilian Gustavo treats himself and his course colleagues from top to bottom with fruit puree when the oversized hand blender gets out of control.
“In every course,” says Maestro Luciano, “it’s only a matter of time before something like this happens.”
Controllers in twilight
The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has been infiltrated by the industry experimenting with GM plants.
This accusation is now formulated by the expert group Testbiotech, which sees itself as an independent institute for the impact assessment of biotechnology.
“It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we have documented it well,” said Testbiotech CEO Christoph Then in Munich on Wednesday.
The head of the Efsa expert group for genetically modified plants, Harry Kuiper, and another Efsa expert have also been under contract with the lobbyist association Ilsi for years.
This is paid for by corporations such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper had played a decisive role in the Efsa test regulations for gene plants and was thus in a clear conflict of interest, criticises Then.
The Efsa rules are word-for-word identical to the Ilsi’s position papers and thus bear the signature of the industry, which is actually to be controlled by the authority in Parma, Italy.
This is the second time that Testbiotech has criticized a conflict of interest.
For example, a high-ranking Efsa manager recently joined the Swiss agricultural company Syngenta without any conditions or transition period - and has thus changed sides.
The Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk (MDR) had also recently revealed personnel connections between the controlling EU authority and the industrial lobby, which made the Federal Environment Agency as well as EU parliamentarians clairvoyant.
However, the EFSA cannot identify a conflict of interest.
All serious data, including those of the industry, can be used, as long as they are of high professional quality, according to a statement.
The experts who work for Efsa are not required to have no contact with the industry.
You would have to disclose them.
Kuiper admits his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the USA.
This describes itself as a neutral forum for experts from science, industry and politics - among other things for risk assessment for biotechnology without a lobbying mandate.
In the matter, independent experts such as Then criticize that genetically modified plants are currently approved without any feeding experiments in animals and the reaction of gene plants to environmental influences is not tested.
“We want to know, for example, what genetically modified corn does in the field,” says Then.
Current practice is to test only isolated proteins, but not the whole gene plant, which provides no reliable results.
“If you don’t look for the risks, how are you supposed to find them?” Then asks accusingly.
Angelika Hilbeck sees it that way.
The scientist has been conducting research in genetic engineering since 1994 and is currently working at the Zurich University of Technology.
In this area, as in the USA, the industry is now increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists in Europe.
There are therefore hardly any researchers who are not intertwined with corporations.
As a rule, critical studies for companies would not be published.
“The industry controls security research,” Hilbeck claims.
The Trace of the Stones
Uli Gsell also got some, a total of about 400 kilos.
On Monday evening he stood in front of Stuttgart station, the tuba on his back.
It was a demo.
It's snowing.
The story is well known: in September, the excavators had moved in and had begun to break off a large piece of the north wing.
The Stuttgart world was no longer the same: tens of thousands demonstrated against S21, the billion-dollar lowering of the station.
When the construction was stopped, much of the wing was in ruins.
Broken into 6000, 7000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a soft coarse stone, built between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
He's secured some of the chunks.
"These stones are relics."
"You can't leave."
He enthuses: "A cheap and poor stone, simple and earthy."
When he saw one, he smelled of cigarette smoke.
What he will do with the chunks, he does not know yet.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell as well.
The trail of the Stuttgarter Steine leads into a forest near Tübingen to a former ammunition depot of the French army, where Manuel Rongen has built his Stein-Reich.
The 44-year-old is dealing with old stones.
He bought all those involved in the demolition in Stuttgart.
“It would be a shame if they were ground to gravel or disappeared in the landfill,” he says in his office, a wooden shed that used to be a guardhouse.
He was insulted and threatened, he says, when in September the newspapers said that he had bought the remains of the north wing from the demolition contractor.
But he's been talking to the S-21 opponents for days.
And he told them that he could not do anything for the demolition.
And if it happens, then it would be the most reasonable thing if the stones were reused.
About 200 S-21 opponents then took one of the on average 80 kilos of cuboids with them, unit price 6.50 to 14 euros.
As a souvenir, but also in the hope of being able to return it during a reconstruction.
Rongen had bought 500 tons, 25 large truckloads.
About half is still stored in the forest, the rest has long since been sold.
Garden owners, landscapers, house builders.
They had come from everywhere and had towed away what could carry luggage and trailers.
The Stuttgart Stones of Instigation have long since been transformed into "m<0xC3><0xA4>uerle" or into boundaries of herb beds.
"Actually, this stone is nothing special," says Rongen.
“It wouldn’t be the political component.”
He gets into his off-road vehicle, takes a tour through his 20-hectare kingdom.
He studied law and broke off, later biology, then he became interested in computers and eventually became a stone trader.
And stone lovers.
It stores 40,000 tons of stones.
He gathers his treasures from all over Germany.
He says he's the biggest stone dealer in the Republic.
He's braking.
In the snow there are artfully carved sandstones.
“They once belonged to the Dresden Marienbrücke,” he says.
Elbe sandstone, yellow, warm, he enthuses.
"My favorite stone."
It goes up the path through the forest.
It points to a pile of red sandstone, formerly part of the Karlsruhe railway station.
And on.
"Beautiful travertine."
The quadrangle once belonged to the grandstand of the Neckarstadion in Stuttgart.
Stones and stories everywhere in the snow, Cannstatter travertine from the Stuttgart police headquarters, reddish granite from the Dom Sankt Blasien, Tuff from the Heilbronn hospital.
What work, what effort, what sweat.
When Rongen thinks of how the stones used to be cut by hand and moved with simple pulleys and ox carts, he becomes quite reverent.
"It would be a scandal if you were to shred something like that."
He has not become rich, certainly not rich.
But 14 people are employed by the stone trader today, besides, stonemasons, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glassblower and a horticulturist have settled up in the forest.
"We're working hard, but it's satisfying," says the salvager.
Soon he will have to go to Cologne.
There are also stones to save.
Talent struggle for high potentials
There is a lot of excitement at the buffet.
16 students crowded around salmon rolls, tomato soup and sweets.
The Technische Universit<0xC3><0xA4>t Braunschweig and the car manufacturer Volkswagen have invited the mechanical engineering and design students to a workshop.
In a kind of ideas competition, they are to talk to VW developers about the car of the future - and get to know Volkswagen by the way.
In the competition for the brightest minds, many companies are now going into close combat and, like VW, rely on cooperation with the universities.
Their mission: To recruit the most talented graduates as early as possible in the lecture halls before they enter the job market and are courted by others.
And because the universities do not publish statements about the achievements of their students, they try to detect the exceptional talents in practical projects and to bind them to themselves.
On the second day of the workshop at the TU Braunschweig, the car group is advertising for the talents.
A young lady from the human resources department distributes ballpoint pens, gummy bears and wallets with VW logo.
She tells the hopeful young talents about internship programs and student jobs and shows them ways into the company.
Nico Selle from the TU Braunschweig supervises the project with VW.
He sees the benefits for both sides: "The students get in touch with the industry and gain experience."
"At the same time, VW can get to know students, take a closer look at interesting candidates and think about who would be considered as an employee."
Such collaborations, according to Selle, are not unusual.
What is new is that students are being bullied so aggressively.
“Otherwise, the focus was more on the technical project,” says Selle.
The battle for the newly graduated will probably be even harder.
In many industries, companies can no longer choose their employees from a large pool of applicants.
But they have to praise themselves and especially boast of highly qualified workers.
Especially graduates from the engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiating position.
According to the Association of German Engineers (VDI), more than 40,000 engineering positions remained vacant in October.
And the so-called engineering gap will become even larger, according to VDI forecasts.
For the auditing and consulting company KPMG, Roman Dykta goes on a talent hunt.
He organizes elaborate recruiting events such as the KPMG Race, a kind of modern scavenger hunt in which the participants have to find their way using GPS coordinates.
Eight promising students want to send the company across the USA next year.
By the way, the participants can visit KPMG branches and get to know the company.
Those who are allowed to participate will decide in advance in two selection rounds.
Only the cr<0xC3><0xA8>me de la cr<0xC3><0xA8>me of the many applicants flies to the USA.
According to Dykta, the guns are getting bigger and bigger when it comes to howling and stabbing around the high potentials at the universities.
"We want to stand out from the crowd with the race."
"Just a simple sailing trip was not enough for us."
For talent hunter Dykta, the bill seems to pay off.
"To this day, we have been in contact with all participants of a similar action last year."
“Some are about to graduate and want to apply to us soon,” he says.
In addition to the direct booing on campus, small and medium-sized companies in particular also go on the stalk in classic professional fairs.
"We are trying to reach graduates at trade fairs."
"About at Intersolar," reports Sitha Stübe, head of human resources at solar technology manufacturer Solarworld.
The Bonn-based company employs around 1500 people in Germany.
Stübe knows about the young people’s problems.
There are currently 35 vacancies on the company’s website.
"It's very difficult to fill vacant positions right now."
“It takes a lot of time and money,” she says.
Another way is to contact the university professors.
Solarworld cooperates with various universities, such as the University of Freiberg.
"The professors give indications that you can do internships with us or write your diploma thesis."
Expensive promotions are not announced at the solar specialist.
For this, the company tries to promote itself with other advantages: personal atmosphere, flat hierarchies and easy communication.
“A large corporation can often not offer this,” says HR manager Stübe.
Money no longer plays a major role in job search.
Flexible working hours, child care or good career opportunities are other decisive factors.
In a study by the Great Place to Work Institute, Solarworld was ranked 55th among the 100 best employers in Germany.
The institute compiles an annual list of the best German employers.
To this end, it asks employees how satisfied they are with their work and their job environment and looks at the framework conditions for the employees.
HR manager Stübe hopes that the placement will also be a plus for job seekers.
“I think applicants are especially looking at external reviews about a potential employer,” she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler from the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies that want to build a good reputation as an employer with a long-term strategy.
He advises his customers to be more authentic.
And that means, according to Kriegler, above all internal measures.
“The best way to make yourself attractive as an employer is through your own employees,” he says.
In industry jargon, this is called internal employer branding, i.e. employer branding within one’s own workforce.
"Satisfied employees are the best ambassadors."
If you treat your people well and they identify with the company, then they would advertise their employer to friends and acquaintances on their own.
“It’s like a game with gangs,” Kriegler says.
Obama to stop new oil drilling
There will be no new oil drilling off the coast of the US state of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico in the coming years.
The government in Washington has issued a corresponding ban - and thus definitively revoked its previous plans.
New drilling is also prohibited off the Atlantic coast for the time being.
Interior Minister Ken Salazar said on Wednesday.
The trigger for the strict ban, which is to apply for at least the next five years, is the explosion of the drilling platform "Deepwater Horizon" in April.
Ahead of the disaster, which cost the lives of 11 workers and led to the largest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama, under pressure from the opposition and industry, signalled his willingness to allow new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
The supporters want to reduce the dependence of the US on oil supplies from abroad.
Those who bear the responsibility for the devastating oil spill in the Gulf have not yet been conclusively clarified.
At the center of the criticism is the British energy company BP, which is confronted with billions of demands.
A commission of inquiry on behalf of Obama is scheduled to present its findings during December.
In October, Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar lifted the drilling stop imposed after the explosion.
Subsequently, various oil companies immediately submitted applications for new drilling projects.
With tighter controls and tighter security regulations, Obama and Salazar want to rule out another disaster.
At present, the competent supervisory authority, which has been discredited after numerous corruption allegations, is undergoing fundamental reform.
At the same time, Obama has announced to close lucrative tax loopholes for the oil and gas companies.
The industry is now publicly warning that the production volume in the Gulf would be significantly lower than before due to stricter regulation.
“The government’s plans are the biggest brake on the growth of the oil and gas industry,” according to a recent industry survey by consulting firm BDO, ahead of Wednesday’s drilling ban.
The American Energy Alliance also laments the uncertainty in the industry: “No one knows what exactly will change with regulation.”
Investments in new funding projects would be postponed until further notice - at the expense of growth.
Ogoniland is burned down.
The water in the rivers is oil-brown, it smells like a gas station: billions of liters of leaked crude oil have destroyed nature in Nigerian Ogoniland.
People are living from theft, corruption and illegal oil cooking.
Celestine Akpobari means well.
"Don't fret," the eco-activist reassured the journalists: "You will get enough oil sludge in front of the lens today."
The 37-year-old Nigerian has tried to photograph a boy wading to the chest in the water with the streaks surrounding him: In the rainbow-colored water gloss, the scene looks almost pretty.
It is not visible that brown swaths of crude oil are floating beneath the surface.
In the past, she used to collect shrimps here, Esther Badom says, on the banks of the Bodo Jetty River.
Meanwhile, the inert flowing water is completely dead.
Five years ago, huge amounts of crude oil poured into the huge wetland from a ruptured pipeline.
Fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo now have to row for six hours to get into fish-bearing waters: Ogoniland, located in the heart of the Niger Delta, is considered one of the world’s worst-polluted regions.
On the journey through the mangrove swamps crisscrossed by rivers, the full extent of the devastation becomes evident.
Instead of light water, the motorboat stirs up brown broth, who dips his hand in the water, pulls out oily fingers.
The roots of the mangrove trees protrude like black licorice sticks from the ground, sadly sporadically palm trees hang their fronds.
Swarms of birds, as they are otherwise common in wetlands, are searched in vain: as soon as the outboarder is silent, spooky peace spreads in the former paradise smelling like a gas station.
"What is happening here is ecological warfare," says Celestine Akpobari darkly: "We are living in constant danger to our health."
The war comparison is appropriate.
The settlement area of the Ogoni is a battleground that has been contested for decades: more than 60 years ago, the first explorers from Europe invaded here, the first resistance was organized here in the 1980s with the later executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, here the Shell Group had to stop its production in 1993, because it became too dangerous for its oil workers.
Even today, the company is still denied a return to Ogoniland: While more than two million barrels of black gold are pumped daily from the entire delta region of Switzerland’s three times the size of over 5000 wells and 7000 kilometers of pipelines, the oil fields in Ogoniland are broken, the situation is too unstable for the Group.
Every few hundred meters, steel frames protrude from the water like bizarre sculptures: "Christmas trees" are called the heads of the boreholes far too tender.
They are up to 50 years old, most of them corroded to the marrow.
Again and again such a drill head breaks apart, says Akpobari, then a constant stream of crude oil runs into the water.
Experts estimate that more than two billion litres of oil have entered the delta ecosystem in 50 years: year after year, the amount of oil that entered the sea off Alaska 21 years ago in the disaster of the supertanker "Exxon Valdez" - one of the largest environmental disasters in the history of mankind.
Who is to blame for the ongoing eco-GAU, is disputed.
While the Shell group blames sabotage and organized oil theft for more than 90 percent of pollution, environmentalists see bursting drill heads and leaking pipelines as the main culprits.
In 2008, the US scientist Richard Steiner accused the company of applying significantly lower safety standards in Nigeria than usual in the world: The rate of defects on the lines alone is "multiple times higher than elsewhere".
In a place that from a distance looks like an abandoned, oil-lubricated workshop under the open sky, figures emerge from the mangroves: they are completely naked and oil-lubricated to the neck.
Under one of the many barrels, which are partly connected to pipes, partly scattered arbitrarily on the site, flickers a fire: an illegal refinery.
In the barrel, the crude oil is heated over the fire for several hours, explains Michael, the head of the group.
First, gasoline penetrates through the pipes into the collecting pot, later, at the end of the line, kerosene drips out and finally diesel.
So Michael and four employees produce up to four barrels of diesel of 300 liters a day: "That brings us 34,000 Naira" - around 22 dollars.
The Delta residents are taking advantage of the chronic fuel shortage in the largest oil state in Black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
Illegal stoves can still undercut the ridiculously low diesel price of just under 40 euros cents per litre: because they get their raw material for free.
It comes from "bunkers" who tap the pipeline network across Ogoniland: according to experts, the country is losing at least 16 million litres of crude oil every day throughout the Niger Delta.
However, only a tiny fraction of the provisionally intermediate raw material is processed illegally: The lion’s share is filled by organized criminal networks, including politicians and high-ranking military personnel, into tankers and sold on the world market.
The debate as to whether the environmental catastrophe is more due to the activities of the population or the lax mode of production, the activist Akpobari considers purely academic.
"If the oil companies were not perceived as invaders and if they had not so thoroughly destroyed the livelihoods of the fishermen, there would be no sabotage, theft and illegal refineries."
In the meantime, however, Ogoni’s relationship with Shell in particular has been so destroyed that only a withdrawal of the company would be considered: “Perhaps other nationalities such as the Chinese turn out to be better.”
Michael is nervous.
“It’s about time you disappeared,” says the muscular oilman.
"Every minute the soldiers can come."
If the illegal oil refiners are caught by the special unit of the armed forces, they are not threatened with arrest, but a painful bribe.
The soldiers, who are mainly from the north of the country, want to profit from the raw material – like all Nigerians.
“This fucking stuff has got our country on the dog in every way,” Akpobari says.
Investigators discover dangerous construction flaws in A380 engines
The A380 seems to have a major safety issue.
Investigators have discovered a possible construction fault during the investigation of an emergency landing machine, which could lead to a "catastrophic engine failure".
The airline Qantas now wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
The passengers of the crash-landed Qantas-Airbus at the beginning of November were apparently much more lucky than previously known: The Australian aviation security authority has identified a major safety problem in the engines of some A380 aircraft in their investigations - and now warns of a possible construction error.
The potential defect would have serious consequences: In an oil hose connection, it could create fatigue cracks and leaks, it said in a statement published this Thursday by the authority ATSB.
This could have led to a “catastrophic engine failure”.
Rolls-Royce engines in 20 A380s were affected.
Among them is the Qantas-Airbus, which had to make an emergency landing in Singapore on November 4.
The Australian airline has now taken legal action against the British turbine manufacturer.
She filed a lawsuit in an Australian federal court in Sydney, allowing him to pursue further legal action against the company.
Qantas CEO Alan Joyce said his airline would seek compensation for the incident in early November.
In the fire of the engine, parts had come loose and the wings had been damaged.
Rolls-Royce had an oil fire as the cause of the damage.
After the incident, up to 40 engines have to be replaced worldwide.
The Australian investigators announced that they would conduct further safety tests on the superjumbos equipped with the affected engines.
The safety recommendation is the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, said ATSB spokesman Martin Dolan.
The security issue was deemed to be sufficiently important to inform all concerned.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas aircraft, the airline had kept its A380 fleet on the ground for weeks.
Singapore Airlines left about three of its eleven A380s temporarily on the ground.
Lufthansa replaced the engine on an A380 as a precautionary measure.
The double-decker aircraft is the largest passenger aircraft in the world.
State-wide snowfall triggers traffic chaos
Germany in white: Snow fell almost all over the country overnight.
There is chaos on many roads, trains and flights are cancelled.
At least three people were killed in car accidents.
Winter is freezing in Germany: With icy temperatures, almost the whole republic is snowing on Thursday at night - which leads to traffic chaos in many places.
In the north and east, there are 15 centimetres of thick snow cover.
On several highways and many roads, traffic is severely restricted.
On the A7 near Flensburg the winter service was in continuous use, but was not finished with the constantly new blowing snow.
In addition, heavy gusts swept over the Baltic coast.
The Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency (BSH) is expecting storm surges with water levels of 1.2 metres above normal on the Baltic coast of Schleswig-Holstein in the morning.
In Saxony, the snow drifts on the motorways and federal roads led to considerable problems.
According to the severe weather center Meteomedia, in Saxon Switzerland, therefore, alarm level violet was announced - the highest level at all.
Partly 30 centimetres of fresh snow fell there, fresh and strong winds caused drifts.
There were several trucks and cars stuck in the night.
In Saxony-Anhalt, too, the police authorities reported major disturbances on the streets.
On the A2, snow and wind led to stagnant traffic and traffic jams.
In Thuringia, the A4 and A9 were affected by the snowfalls.
According to Deutsche Bahn, there are significant disruptions in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
Snow on the tracks, fallen trees on the tracks or destroyed overhead lines and turnouts are the main problems.
In Saxony, long-distance traffic from Leipzig to Nuremberg had to be stopped.
In Saalfeld, Thuringia, an ICE had to stop its journey to Munich.
The 165 passengers were provided with blankets, food and drinks on the train by firefighters and rescue workers.
Snow winds swept across the streets.
At major German airports, the snow winds lead to numerous flight cancellations.
In Munich, according to a spokeswoman for the flight information center, some cancellations have already been reported.
According to a Fraport spokesperson, 40 flights have already been cancelled in Frankfurt am Main.
Winter service is in continuous operation.
Although there are only a few stranded passengers at the airport, there are still almost 400 cots available for them.
On many roads there were already on Wednesday evening accidents.
In the evening, a truck driver was killed in a collision with a train at a railway crossing in Ostholstein.
The driver was slightly injured.
A similar accident occurred near Nuremberg due to snow-covered roads: Here, too, a truck was caught on a level crossing because the vehicle remained stuck.
The driver died.
Four passengers were injured in the train - the line from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was therefore closed until the morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after she had rolled over with her car near Aschaffenburg on a smooth road.
But the meteorologists have good news: Although the snow will still be loose and powdery, it will start to swirl even in light gusts.
But the wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea is hit by fast and stormy winds.
However, it remains very cold - in places up to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to separate from its landmark: According to a newspaper report, the money house is looking for buyers for the two office towers at its Frankfurt headquarters.
The property could bring in up to 500 million euros.
Deutsche Bank has just made its headquarters attractive: the twin towers in Frankfurt’s banking district have been modernized; meanwhile, the bankers were allowed to return to their old jobs.
But now the financial group wants to get the costs for the renovation apparently again - and is looking for a buyer for the two high-rises, as the "Financial Times Germany" writes, citing a spokesman.
Reasons for the planned sale were not mentioned by the spokesman.
“We always check whether it makes more sense to own or sell real estate on our own and then rent it back,” he said.
This means that Germany’s largest credit institution will soon be relinquishing its headquarters.
The bank had only taken over the double towers in mid-2007 for 272 million euros from the investors of an in-house fund and then renovated them extensively.
The energy conversion consumed the data according to around 200 million euros.
A sale would probably bring a lot of money to the bank.
According to the newspaper, industry experts estimate the value of the towers, which have since been renamed “Greentowers”, at around 500 million euros.
Whether the buildings will be resold to a fund owned by the bank or to an independent investor is currently still open, the spokesman said.
Thousands mourn for dead mate
More than 10,000 people in New Zealand have thought of the buried miners who were declared dead after several explosions in a mine.
Still, the bodies could not be recovered, because the security situation in the accident shaft is still precarious.
Two weeks ago there was a violent explosion at the Pike River Mine near the town of Greymouth.
29 miners aged between 17 and 62 years were buried underground.
A probe had been dropped into the accident shaft, but no trace of survivors had been found.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and further subsequent explosions, no rescue workers were able to descend for safety reasons.
After the second violent detonation, the authorities and experts had assumed that there was no chance of survival for the buddies.
The bodies have not yet been recovered.
Now relatives and friends commemorated the dead with a memorial ceremony.
Tens of thousands of people had gathered in the bright sunshine in Greymouth on the South Island of New Zealand.
They remained silent for two minutes.
In honor of the buried miners, 29 tables were set up, on which helmets, lamps and the names of the buddies could be seen.
Pictures and personal items, including clothing and surfboards, also found their place here.
In front of the government buildings of the country the flags were waving at half-mast.
New Zealand had hoped that the miners would come back to the surface "from the depths of the earth", said New Zealand Prime Minister John Key to the participants of the commemoration.
"But they never came home."
"He can't finish with his son's death unless he's seen his body," said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the pit.
In addition to the Prime Minister and relatives of the victims, several foreign diplomats took part in the commemoration.
In the first explosion on 19 November, miners of British and South African origin were also buried.
Rescue workers began to put out a fire inside the coal mine on New Zealand’s South Island.
Once the explosive gases have been displaced, it will begin to cool down the glowing temperatures inside the mine, police chief Gary Knowles told reporters.
To hell with you, warriors!
Does splatter fit the art cinema?
The director Nicolas Winding Refn explores old genre boundaries with his fighter epic "Walhalla Rising".
What audience might Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have thought of when he shot "Walhalla Rising"?
A captured Viking warrior with only one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his tormentors and kills his opponents with almost superhuman powers - sounds ideal for young male spectators in search of bloody action, just because our hero likes to use rabid killing methods and his enemies already have the guts out of the living body when he has a bad mood.
On the other hand, Einauge, as he is actually called, does not say a word about the whole film, and even the other characters can be carried away at most once or two sentences or a few excruciating screams of death.
Otherwise, you will remain silent and revel in the creepy hilly landscape of Scotland, which offers the backdrop to the Viking world of about a thousand years ago.
Ideal rather for adult cineastes with an interest in existentialism and very quiet camera rides.
It’s nice when a film has several target groups, only a shame if they are mutually exclusive.
Director Winding Refn has been considered a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino since his wild and styled drug-dealer trilogy "Pusher", but stoically refuses to make his works accessible to the mainstream with a little more humor or a little less brutality.
Most art cinema friends are likely to be put off by the splashing brain mass and guts.
The action fans die of boredom at the latest when, for freely interpretable reasons, one-eyes with a troop of violent Christian missionaries departs via ship to Jerusalem and is stuck for an eternity in lull and fog, before the team apparently arrives in America and continues to remain silent there.
No wonder that "Walhalla Rising" has not found a cinema rental in Germany and has now only been released on DVD.
This is a pity, especially because of the magnificent pictures, but also because behind the pretentious to bloodthirsty fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade hides a sometimes exciting piece of cinema that deserves some attention.
This film is not about dialogue or a stringent plot, it’s all atmosphere, a fever dream turned into a film.
And there is no escape from it for the viewer.
Refn hardly gives him a moment of relaxation and slowly laces his throat with his icy images and the sinister trance-like soundtrack, but above all with the inconceivable hatred that strikes him from the hearts of the characters.
Only a little blond boy who stands by the side of one's eyes keeps something like innocence, everyone else is driven by anger.
Mostly the one-eyed hero whose motives are never explained, but who for enemies and temporary allies eventually becomes a warrior from hell, possibly an ambassador of the devil himself.
It means destruction, but perhaps only for the already depraved.
"Walhalla Rising" is an enigmatic film that you can hate and admire, to annoy, excite and marvel.
An experience.
Mysterious earthworks
The IAEA has new evidence of a secret nuclear program in Syria.
The country, however, refuses to take a position on this - it still allows controls.
At around midnight from 5 to 6 September 2007, at least four Israeli F-15I fighter jets attacked a mysterious cube-shaped building in Syria.
It stands on the banks of the Euphrates; the nearest major city, 30 kilometers away, is Dair as-Saur.
Their name appears in documents from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) when it comes to the reactor Syria allegedly built with help from North Korea in the cuboid, hidden in a valley that drains from the stream.
According to a briefing by the U.S. foreign intelligence agency CIA from late April 2008, the reactor, also known under the name of the nearby village of el-Kibar, would have been well suited to producing plutonium - from which nuclear weapons could be built.
For other purposes, on the other hand, the technology from the fifties is hardly suitable.
The CIA presented a video presentation with blurred satellite images.
By computer animation, she showed where which components of the reactor were supposed to have been before the destruction, which was a scaled-down copy of the North Korean model from the Yongbyon nuclear center.
In addition, she presented photos that show the building up close or even the interior.
The reactor was close to commissioning, it said, but had not yet been equipped with fuel rods.
Today, more than three years after the bombardment, little more is known than then, indeed the puzzles became rather larger with time.
Former U.S. President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that while the CIA was pretty sure before the attack that Syria was building a reactor in el-Kibar, it saw little evidence that there was “an active nuclear weapons program” in the country.
Some intelligence officials in Europe prefer to be even more cautious and speak only of a "alleged reactor", even if they think the CIA presentation is "plausible".
They lack hard evidence, as does the IAEA.
Asked how safe he was to have a reactor in front of him, a senior UN diplomat in the summer replied only succinctly that the IAEA had “enough material to ask questions.”
The rubble of the alleged "unused military building" was quickly removed by the Syrians and thoroughly leveled the site.
Nevertheless, in June 2008, an IAEA team under former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen found traces of human-made uranium in el-Kibar.
In addition, the IAEA received satellite images of commercial providers directly after the attack through a member state, which are likely to be more meaningful than those presented by the CIA.
However, these recordings are not available on the market because the unknown client – perhaps Israel – bought them exclusively.
Therefore, the IAEA cannot independently verify its authenticity.
Syria has always maintained that it has never run a secret nuclear program or built a reactor.
The uranium comes from Israeli weapons, Damascus said.
But the IAEA rejected this as unlikely after analyzing the particles.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss it – as well as the satellite images.
In addition, it denied the inspectors a second inspection in el-Kibar and access to the rubble of the bombed building.
But Israel is also silent.
"We will never comment on this," said Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, who was in office at the time of the attack.
The investigation of the case has been dragging on since June 2008 and is "increasingly developing into a serious credibility problem for the authority", as a senior Western diplomat at the headquarters of the IAEA in Vienna admits - after all, there is a serious violation of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, over which the IAEA watches.
The IAEA sees as key to progress in reconnaissance, apparently three other facilities that are to be "functionally connected" to the alleged reactor - and unlike it still exist.
So far, the inspectors have not disclosed which installations are involved, what function they have or what makes them appear suspicious.
According to information from the Süddeutsche Zeitung, they are internally referred to by the IAEA as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, in turn derived from nearby cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) has identified these locations and found a building complex near Masyaf on satellite images, which is most likely one of the suspicious objects.
It may be located in or right next to a military base – precisely on this reasoning, Syria denies the IAEA access to the three sites.
In Vienna, it is said that the Syrians feared a fishing expedition - that the IAEA would be sent by the US to spy on military installations.
Because the nuclear detectors had become aware of the facilities by a tip of the US intelligence services.
The IAEA has indications, including satellite photos, that material was being transported back and forth between the three locations and the cuboid on the Euphrates.
A senior Western diplomat in Vienna said at least one of the facilities could be “related to fuel production.”
However, there is “no evidence of sensitive activities”, i.e. uranium enrichment or reprocessing; processes that are necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The reactor type is operated with uranium, which is not enriched.
But where the uranium should have come from and where the plutonium for the bomb would later be separated from it, on these central questions there are at best plausible assumptions.
It is also unclear whether debris that could hold valuable traces was stored at the three locations.
As if the hundreds of truckloads had disappeared from the ground, no one wants to have information about where the rubble has gone.
The IAEA considers the al-Tibni salt mine, located just a few kilometres from el-Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates, to be unlikely.
Former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley had recently linked them to the reactor in an analysis of satellite images for the renowned magazine Jane's Intelligence Review.
Images from orbit, however, show that Syria was doing earthwork at the three suspicious locations and removing large containers after the IAEA requested access.
This may be a coincidence, but it has hardly helped to clear up the suspicion.
In addition, diplomatic circles say the IAEA spent several months developing a plan for inspections there that would allow Syria to keep any military secrets – only the effort shows how great the interest of the inspectors is.
However, Damascus also ironed out this proposal.
A year ago, Western diplomats in Vienna had appeased that the reactor was destroyed, so the matter does not have a high urgency, for example US Ambassador Glyn Davies has been bringing so-called special inspections into play for a few months, one of the strongest means that the Vienna Atomic Energy Agency has to enforce controls.
Yukiya Amano, the head of the IAEA, who would have to propose these inspections, has already spoken of “an option for which I will be open in the future”, but he is still hesitant.
There is a high risk in this path: firstly, it requires a majority in the IAEA Board of Governors, and several of the 35 countries represented there are far from eager for an escalation.
On the other hand, as a diplomat gives to consider: "What if in the end they find nothing at all?"
Love in times of war
Since Angelina Jolie started working on her still nameless directorial debut in the summer, there has been trouble.
She wrote the script herself, a love story between a Bosnian woman and a Serbian man.
You don’t know much more about it – but that’s enough for agitation.
The rumor persists that the woman, a Muslim, falls in love with her Serbian rapist during the Yugoslavian war.
Bosnian women’s associations immediately protested, after which some shooting days planned in Sarajevo were moved to Hungary at short notice.
Meanwhile, the film is shot in Hungary and in post-production, but it is still protested in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic from the organization of female war victims wrote to Jolie about the UN refugee agency UNHCR and demanded a meeting with the actress, a Bosnian newspaper has now reported - Jolie is herself an ambassador of the UN refugee agency.
She is not diplomatic - she offered the women a meeting in Hungary weeks ago, but they refused.
The meeting must take place in Bosnia, says Hasecic.
There were no love stories in rape camps, and Jolie’s attitude toward the victims told her enough about the script.
According to the UN refugee agency, her organisation has recommended that Jolie be dismissed as an ambassador, reports the Guardian.
But what exactly did Jolie write for scenes?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which got to read her script, has after some back and forth granted a shooting permit for Sarajevo - it is not quite clear why Jolie still did not come.
The young author herself asserts that she does not pursue any political intentions with her film, has worked hard to get involved in the Yugoslavian conflict, wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and give a voice to all sides involved.
In terms of content, however, it remains vague.
A second synopsis of the film circulates online, which sounds quite different: The lovers knew each other even before the outbreak of war and meet again when she, a Bosnian Muslim, is taken to a Serbian camp where he works as a guard.
Which sounds considerably different than the variant "rape victim crushes into torture servant".
That Jolie's film actually starts before the war - that's for sure.
The pressure on her, Jolie said, was “unfair and based on misinformation.”
Now only the hackers of Hollywood can get her peace: by illegally putting the script on the Internet, as so many before.
Nothing like getting out of here
This time it’s all over again for the Irish.
No sign of sadness.
For this, the home team dominates its guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA too much.
The fans shout for joy with loud music, they stomp with their feet.
The Bailey pub in Cork, southern Ireland, is shaking because players throw table tennis balls over a three-meter distance into beer cups - and hit.
"Beer pong" is the name of the bizarre spectacle, to win there are 500 euros victory prize plus airline tickets to Las Vegas for the beer pong world championships in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy; this shrill drinking game and the reserved computer scientist, that doesn't really fit together.
And yet, the 26-year-old tries to amuse himself by distracting himself from the drilling question of what the future will bring.
His plan is not to have fun in Las Vegas, he will have job interviews in New Zealand in January.
"I have a queasy feeling about it," he says.
"It's so far away from home and I still don't have a job there."
After all, his girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland - "she had jerk, zuck her desired job as an event manager, maybe a good sign," says the young man and smiles.
Due to poor prospects at home, two of Tanner’s three siblings have already sought their fortune abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a job as an IT consultant in London.
The boys leave: as with the Tanners, it looks on the island in many families.
100,000 Irish are likely to leave the country in the near future, experts from the economic and social research institute ESRI in Dublin predict.
By 2015, they are expecting 200,000 emigrants.
For the small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants a heavy loss.
If the forecasts are true, there is a wave of emigration comparable to that suffered by Ireland in the 1980s.
After a decade of upswing, which brought great prosperity for the Irish, Tristesse is once again spreading.
The economic crisis is especially unsettling the young, well-educated Irish, for whom it has so far only gone uphill.
Job loss and social decline seemed absurd in the boom years.
Everyone was needed, there was money in abundance.
Meanwhile, three out of ten women and men under thirty are out of work.
In the Irish Times, there are plenty of letters from young emigrants who complain: "Everything goes down the drain in Ireland."
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers - but who can, goes away and our country loses an entire generation."
"The last one, please turn off the light."
Law student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish Student Union, sees a bleak future as the government is only doing eye-witnesses and no longer offers young people prospects for the future.
“They’re reducing minimum wages, but they don’t have a strategy on how to create new jobs,” the 20-year-old says.
She observes her fellow students squirming from one unpaid internship to the next.
Her biggest concern, she says, is having to emigrate on her own in four years.
"This thought is sad and depressing."
Men such as Stephen McLarnon are trying to occupy the topic positively.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo", a trade fair that offers an all-round service on the subject of working abroad.
“For young professionals, working abroad is a great opportunity to take the first steps on the career ladder,” says the manager.
On his website photos show surfers in Australia and snowboarders in Canada.
The message is clear: working abroad is not a galley service, but also brings freedom and fun.
Se<0xC3><0xA1>n O’Donovan has known what it feels like to build something elsewhere for six months.
Because there was nothing to do for the 29-year-old engineer in Ireland, he now works with 15 Irish colleagues on the construction in Germany.
In Gelsenkirchen they are currently raising a fashion house.
In January we will continue to Hannover or Berlin, to the next project.
O'Donovan rarely sees his home, because he makes extra shifts to pay off the loan for his house at home.
“The situation is already a bit crazy,” he says as he steps over the threshold of his house for the first time after a long time.
"I make money in Germany for a house in Ireland where I am almost never again."
He laughs a little embarrassed and goes through cold rooms.
The small house stands in a fine residential area with well-kept front gardens, in the entrances park large, expensive cars.
Together with a sister, O'Donovan bought the house for four years ago for 380,000 euros - 100 percent credit-financed.
“It was crazy times, there was easy money without a lot of questions,” he says.
Is he afraid that the loan could go wrong?
O'Donovan ponders for a while, pouring hot tea after and says, "I don't have any children to feed through and I'm young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start over."
The civil engineer does not like the wailing that he often hears at the moment.
"No one has to go hungry - our situation is far from as dramatic as it was in earlier times here on the island," he says.
"Working abroad for a while is not the worst thing that can happen - maybe it makes us feel Irish."
He laughs and then talks about his father, who went to England in the last great economic crisis.
"After seven years he was back and life went on in Ireland, quite simply."
Cian Tanner likes this idea.
Leave the future open and just look at how life is going elsewhere.
He’s already had a few years of work in London and why shouldn’t things be going well for him and his girlfriend in New Zealand?
But there is one thing that worries him these days: the celebration of his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
He fears it could turn into a goodbye party.
“Just don’t have too many emotions,” he says, sipping a big sip of his beer.
“Goodbye, that sounds scary.”
“Let’s call it a going away party, easy going, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games.”
The Democratic Routine
The democracy movement in Latin America is growing stronger, as is the support of private companies.
Crime is a bigger problem than unemployment.
In many parts of the region, Brazil’s influence is greater than that of the United States.
These were the results of the Latinobar<0xC3><0xB3>metro survey conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively in The Economist.
This survey has been conducted regularly since 1995 and thus shows the change of opinion in this region.
Two facts are particularly striking in this year’s September and October survey.
First, the good mood in Latin America
and secondly, the growing interest in democracy and its main institutions.
In many countries on the South American Pacific coast, the democratic movement has increased strongly (see Table 1).
In Peru, for example, where the economy has been growing at an annual rate of about 6% since 2002, the number of pro-democracy voters has risen from 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
This trend is also evident in Mexico, where the economy has recovered since the sharp slump last year.
However, only half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the most populous countries in the region, are convinced Democrats, which lowers the regional average (see Chart 2).
About 44% of respondents said they were satisfied with their country’s democratic practices, as many as last year, but 25% more than in 2001 (Diagram 3).
Some 34% trust their country’s Congress and 45% trust their government, both of which are the same as last year, but show a significant increase over 2003 (17% and 24% respectively).
A decade ago, Latin America’s economic crises undermined efforts for more democracy.
The fact that this continued during the Great Depression may be due to the fact that Latin American countries experienced only a brief period of recession and recovered quickly.
In addition, the poor were caught by a stronger social network.
(According to reports by the UN Economic Commission for Latin America this week, the poverty rate in Latin America rose only marginally in 2009 and fell by 32% again this year.)
However, there are strong differences in mood from country to country (see diagram 4).
Brazil’s strong economy and the popularity of outgoing President Luiz In<0xC3><0xA1>cio Lula da Silva is reflected in a widespread sense of progress.
In Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more perceptible and violent crimes have increased, this is less the case.
For the second time since the start of the survey, many respondents in Latin America see crime in their country as a bigger problem than unemployment (see diagram 5).
About 31% say that either they or a family member was the victim of a crime last year, but down from 38% last year, the figures are at their lowest level since 1995.
The increase in economic output is reflected in the stronger support for the private and market economies: around 71% of respondents nationwide indicated that the private sector is indispensable for development, compared with 56% in 2007 (see Chart 6).
About 58% stated that only the market economy can bring their country progress, compared to 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela have maintained this view (and 80% are for a private economy), even though their left-wing president, Hugo Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez, nationalizes many private companies.
Brazil has the largest weight in the region, according to 19% of respondents (18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9% compared to 11% last year).
Respondents in Mexico and most Central American countries, on the other hand, see the US as the most influential country, with Venezuela assuming this role in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
An election slump
No one expected the November 28 elections in Haiti to be perfect.
But the facts far exceeded the fears of the electoral workers who rushed to the aid of the battered country.
Overcrowded ballot boxes, multiple votes cast, ballot papers in the gutter, destroyed polling stations and intimidation were only part of the problems.
Polling stations opened with hours of delay.
Many Haitians, many of whom had been left homeless by the earthquake in January, roamed around in search of an option.
Some eventually gave up completely.
A dozen presidential candidates, including some suspected frontrunners, called for the annulment of the election results due to an alleged fraud.
There have been some violent protests across the country.
Nevertheless, Edmond Mulet, the head of the UN mission in Haiti, described the election as "quite good in many respects."
According to a cautious statement by observers of the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community, "these irregularities, however serious they may be, do not necessarily invalidate the process."
In other words, the show goes on.
The electoral authority, which is allegedly committed to the unpopular outgoing president René Préval and his candidate, Jude Célestin, will announce the preliminary results on December 7.
The expected run-off election is scheduled for January.
There is still hope in the election.
The two leading opposition candidates, rap musician Michel Martelly and former first lady Mirlande Manigat, have withdrawn their initial invalidation lawsuit.
If Jude Célestin, who has little or no vote in the electorate, is declared the winner of the run-off election by the Electoral Commission, this could lead to problems.
Due to the cholera epidemic and the fact that more than 1 million earthquake victims still live in tents, low voter turnout was feared.
On election day, many Haitians were prevented from voting due to lack of organization.
Shortly before the start of the election, about 250,000 ID cards, which are needed for the election, were not yet distributed.
There's a lot at stake.
Donor countries see a legitimate, recognized government as an important step in rebuilding Haiti.
The Haitians themselves share the same opinion.
Secretly in the middle
In the weeks following your husband’s sudden death, Argentina’s president, Cristina Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez, experienced a wave of sympathy that boosted her popularity rate by 20 points to over 50%, the highest since her election in 2007.
Whether this will help her re-election next year, however, depends on whether the visibly grieving Cristina Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez is more willing to compromise than her late husband, her predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner.
The signs of this are not clear.
Néstor Kirchner, who also steered economic policy after his wife’s election, often drew up budgets that did not take full account of tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the presidential couple to spend the extra income at their own discretion.
On paper, the Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez government lost a majority in Congress last year.
However, the opposition is divided and Kirchner's death after a heart attack on October 27 led to further rifts.
Some critics of the regime from the ranks of the ruling Peronists stood behind Cristina Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez.
However, after chaotic meetings (where one MP slapped another in the face and others accused the government of bribery), Congress failed to pass the 2011 budget.
“I’m not going to discuss it,” the president said.
The 2010 budget now also applies to next year, giving the President even more opportunity to spend money at her own discretion.
The economy is running hot: it is likely to grow by up to 9% this year.
The official rate of inflation is currently 11.1%, but numerous private estimates - and wage demands by the trade unions - drive the value to almost 30%.
Kirchner, who took office in 2003 when Argentina was shaken by economic crises, declared growth and poverty reduction to be his main goals, not inflation reduction.
He refused to cooperate with the IMF, harassed the private sector, and cleaned up the National Institute of Statistics and Census INDEC, which then embellished the official inflation statistics.
Can Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez now take a more moderate path?
It has called on the private sector and trade union leaders to hold talks.
And according to official statements, wage increases are to be limited to 18% next year.
The high world market prices for Argentina’s agricultural products have given the economy a strong boost.
But inflation undermined the growth spurt by a major devaluation in 2002.
For this reason, Cristina Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez may want to reconnect Argentina financially with the rest of the world.
Earlier this year, the government reached an agreement with security holders who had rejected the country’s previous debt restructuring in 2001.
Now Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez seems to be pushing for an agreement with the donors from the Paris Club, to which she owes about $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners had always refused a review by the IMF, as is customary elsewhere.
But last month, Economy Minister Amado Boudou announced that the fund will provide "technical support" to the creation of a new national consumer price index, which looks like the first step towards cleaning up the INDEC.
It is not known whether Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez will be politically active after the end of her term without the support of her husband.
If so, it needs the support of the middle class, which largely has had enough of Kirchnerism.
When the Argentines return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy that has been shown to them will have subsided.
If she wants to win another election, she has to decide whether she will quietly cancel out many of her husband’s political decisions.
Weak applause for China
Taiwan’s voters are slowly approaching closer ties to the mainland.
What does Taiwan think of its big brother on the other side of the strait?
On November 27, more than 7.5 million voters, or 70% of all eligible voters, went to vote for mayors and city councillors in the five boroughs, which is seen as a broad assessment by President Ma Ying-jeou.
Through the establishment of ground-breaking business relationships, including a partial free trade agreement, Ma himself is a symbolic figure for relations with the mainland. His policies have changed the relationship with the Chinese mother country for the first time since 1949.
Ma passed the exam, but barely.
Although his Kuomintang Party (KMT) appoints three of the five mayors, it did not receive a majority of votes.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which advocates greater Taiwan independence, received nearly 50% of the vote, while the KMT received 45%.
In a presidential election, this would have been a problem for Ma.
Since his election two years ago, his party’s share of the vote has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP even moved into the city councils together with the KMT.
During the election there were the usual occurrences in Taiwan such as truck convoys with rioters, flag-swinging mass parades and scantily clad dancers.
There was even the obligatory, mysterious murder attempt.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan and honorary chairman of the KMT, gave a speech to a KMT candidate on the eve of the election.
When a man from the crowd shot him in the face, Lien was wounded and a nearby spectator was killed.
More bizarrely, it's not clear if the shooter wanted to kill Lien or settle a dispute with the candidate.
Regardless, according to Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the DPP, the attack affected the election and put the DPP in a bad light, giving the KMT more votes.
Perhaps China was the biggest winner of the campaign.
Remarkably, relations with the mainland were not discussed.
Instead, candidates debated plans for social housing and job creation.
The Taiwanese love their de facto independence and reject China’s military threat.
For this reason, the KMT does not like to put its relations with the government in Beijing in the foreground.
But this time, the DPP also avoided fomenting anti-Chinese sentiments too much.
She reacted to the new awareness that Taiwan’s economy cannot survive without China.
Ma, for his part, would like to be confirmed that the majority of Taiwanese are in favour of his China policy.
The Beijing government will continue to pursue its strategy of attracting Taiwan back to the Community with economic incentives.
China immediately sent a negotiator to Taipei to prepare a summit on investment security and medical cooperation.
It certainly wants political integration, but the most important thing first.
It is best to wait until after the 2012 presidential election.
The DPP has reinvented itself.
Two years ago, it was severely weakened: former party leader Chen Shui-bian was imprisoned for corruption.
During his presidency from 2000 to 2008, he vehemently advocated absolute independence.
But under Tai’s reign, a new generation of moderate politicians developed and the DPP fights for the voices of the working class and youth.
Tsai found great approval as a presidential candidate of the DPP, such as Su Tseng-chang under Chen.
Her party is now doing everything to show that she too is able to build close relations with Beijing.
Tsai is planning a think tank as a point of contact between the DPP and China, but this requires unbiased discussions.
Tsai publicly stated that her party offers a “trustworthy alternative” to Mas’s hasty approach to China.
Chen seems very upset about this change.
From his cell, he stated that the DPP candidates had done better to insist on Taiwan’s independence.
He even asked the pragmatist Su to renounce the presidential candidacy.
Even without Chen’s interference, the DPP finds it difficult to choose its possible candidate.
KMT will have to undergo its own self-analysis.
Ma’s values are bad, despite rapid economic growth; the KMT candidates wanted to run their election campaign without him.
The main reasons for his unpopularity seem to be unemployment and the ever-increasing gap between rich and poor.
According to a KMT spokesperson, he will redesign his cabinet and local facilities.
The strong presence of the DPP suggests that Taiwan has limited support for a re-approach.
At the same time, most Taiwanese see economic cooperation with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, “there is no going back.”
Grammy nominations: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding was surprisingly awarded in the Newcomer of the Year category
If you perform at the request of a president, people will notice.
President Obama himself asked Esperanza Spalding to perform at the 2009 Nobel Prize ceremony, and the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer has now been nominated for this year’s Grammy in the Newcomer of the Year category.
Given that Spalding has been a celebrated star in the jazz scene since her 2008 album "Esperanza", the nomination seems a bit unusual, but it is in line with the Grammy rules, according to which an artist may have released no more than three albums before the release of the album with which he became known to the general public.
Her ambitious 2010 album, Chamber Music Society, is certainly a step forward, and with her energetic voice and a good sense of pop, funk and Latin music, Spalding can be compared to Norah Jones in 2003, whose great success as a jazz performer in this category comes closest to Spalding's nomination.
Furthermore, the Vijay Iyer Trio's album "Historicity" was nominated in the category of instrumental albums. This favorite of the critics experienced a huge success.
Iyers' competitors include "Moody 4B" by experienced saxophonist James Moody and "Positootly" by keyboardist John Beasley.
Trombone Shorty, a rough-and-tumble New Orleans favorite and a frequent guest on HBO’s “Treme,” was awarded in the Contemporary Jazz category, where albums by Stanley Clarke, John McLoughlin, and Jeff Lorber are more likely to be found.
The Secret Societ of the wild steampunk musician Darcy James Argue received well-deserved attention in the large group category. He competes against the Billy Childs ensemble with his chamber jazz and the adventurous Dave Holland and his octet, whose life alum "Pathways" is a good example of a bassist as a democratic bandleader.
Grammy nominations: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey lead in the classic categories
The classic nominations for the 53rd Grammy Award include a colorful mix of musicians and composers from all over the world.
The list is led by Michael Daugherty's "Deux Ex Machina" for piano and orchestra with five voices, and Steve Mackey's "Dreamhouse", an eclectic orchestral work, with three voices.
Among the nominees with connections to Southern California is the Estonian composer Arvo P<0xC3><0xA4>rt with his Symphony No. 4 "Los Angeles", commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and premiered at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
L.A.-based composer Avner Dorman was also nominated for his Mandolin Concerto.
Classical nominations are divided into 13 categories, from orchestra, opera, choir to solo recordings.
In the category of classical music producers, five artists were nominated this year – Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Among the nominated classical albums are Bruckner's Symphonies Nos. 3 and 4 by the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty's "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" performed by the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey's "Dreamhouse" by the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati" performed by various artists; and Verstrati Orchestra performed by various artists.
In the opera category Berg's "Lulu from the orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasses' "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" from Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho's "L'Amour de Loin" from the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin's "The Enchanted Wanderer" from the orchestra and choir of the Mariinsky Theater; and Arthur Sullivan's "Ivan National Orchestra".
P<0xC3><0xA4>rt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Apppassionatamente Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer" were nominated for a Grammy.
P<0xC3><0xA4>rt’s Symphony No. 4 was premiered and recorded at Disney Hall on January 4 by the L.A. Philharmonic under the direction of Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The approximately 30-minute piece is entitled "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the former oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is in prison in Russia.
Dorman's "Mondolin Concerto" received a nomination in the category of instrumental solo with orchestra.
The composer from L.A. stated that he had written the 15-minute piece specifically for the mandolin artist Avi Avital, who performed the concert with the New York Metropolis Ensemble.
"I have used sounds from the Middle East and numerous North African sounds and rhythms," Dorman said in a telephone interview.
Conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the orchestral performance category for a recording of Stravinsky’s works with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under his direction.
The pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin, the organist Paul Jacobs, the violinist Julia Fischer and the harpsichordist Sarah Schuster Ericsson were nominated as instrumental soloists.
This year, only women were nominated as vocal soloists, including Anne Sofie von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonov<0xC3><0xA1>, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classical crossover category, soprano Jessye Norman was nominated for her recording "Roots - My Life, My Song".
Mosque in Temecula wins approval of Planning Committee
The construction of a mosque in Temecula was unanimously approved by the local planning committee after a five-hour, often heated public hearing.
Critics accused the project of promoting both terrorism and traffic congestion.
However, according to a statement by the Commission on Wednesday evening, the new religious centre will comply with local regulations and will become an aesthetic eye-catcher.
"The project is supported by many good people - Christians, Jews, Bahais, and many others," said Hadi Nael, chairman of the Islamic Center of Temecula Valley.
“As an American, that makes me proud.”
"It shows that justice prevails."
“There are only a few opponents,” he added.
"They're just very loud."
"There are wonderful people in this valley."
The meeting began at 6 p.m. and discussions for and against the construction of the center lasted almost until midnight, with votes on both sides being fairly evenly distributed, according to Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper’s website.
“There is no America anymore,” he said.
"It's another Planet of the Apes, and the Statue of Liberty is lying dead in the sand."
“America is at an end.”
Planned Islamic centers have also led to protests in other parts of the country, such as near Ground Zero, the scene of the terrorist attacks on New York City on September 11, 2001.
In Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush has called for nonviolence.
His community of about 135 families has lived peacefully in Riverside County for years, but they wanted a bigger and better place than the camp they rented together with a manufacturer of water filtration equipment.
The new 2,300 m2 mosque in the Mediterranean style will have two minarets and will be about 13 m high.
It is to be built on the approximately 17,500 m2 plot on Nicolas Road near Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still appeal the project to the city council.
Arsenic-resistant microbe could enable new life forms on Earth or elsewhere
The discovery of a foreign species of bacteria that can live on arsenic, among other things, opens up new possibilities for new forms of life on Earth and elsewhere.
Although scientists have discovered this unusual bacterium here on Earth, they believe it is a sign that life is possible even without the elements that were previously considered vital.
"This organism has two possibilities."
"He needs either phosphorus or arsenic to grow."
“This makes it something very special, even though it’s almost a kind of ‘foreign’ life form,” said Paul C.W. Davies of Arizona State University and co-author of the report, which appears Thursday in the online edition of the journal Science.
So far, six main elements have been considered vital - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur.
But as the scientists found out, the bacterium in California’s Mono Lake continues to grow even if it replaces phosphorus with arsenic.
“You wonder what else is possible,” said Ariel D. Anbar, co-author of the report.
The discovery is an important step in the search for extraterrestrial life, as scientists must recognize life and its forms, according to Anbar.
The study looks at microbes found on Earth.
The announcement of a press conference, in which no details of the discovery were announced, gave rise to widespread speculation on the Internet that the report could be about the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
This is not the case.
The discovery "shows that in other planetary systems, organisms can set biochemical processes in motion with the help of other elements, and that the 'standard elements' that we believe are absolutely vital are not necessarily firmly established," explained Charles Cockell, a professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute at the Open University of Milton Keynes in the United Kingdom.
Cockel was not part of the research team.
"This work is a novelty, because it shows that in basic biochemical processes and structures one element can be replaced by another," Cockell added.
This discovery was not accidental.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon from NASA’s Astrobiology Institute, who led the study, chose Mono Lake because of its high arsenic content.
Since arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar, she assumed that microbes exposed to both may be able to replace one element with the other.
"The toxicity of arsenic is mainly due to its chemical behavior similar to that of phosphorus."
"This makes it difficult for organisms to distinguish one element from another."
"But the difference is so great that arsenic works differently than phosphorus, and it gets into our biochemical system, where it smudges almost everything," Anbar explains.
The researchers exposed the bacterium GFAJ-1 to an increasing concentration of arsenic, which adapted and grew.
Although the microbe grows better in phosphorus, the fact that it can survive in arsenic also shows that an arsenic-based life form can occur naturally, either on Earth or on another planet or moon, where arsenic is more common.
According to Jamie S. Foster, a lecturer in microbiology at the University of Florida, the idea that phosphorus can be replaced by arsenic is not new, but there hasn’t been a working example yet.
Arsenic was more common in the early Earth years, she says, which is why science has assumed that early life forms used it.
"This gives reason to believe that life may have evolved differently than it did in the early Earth age," said Forster, who was not a member of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Health Authorities.
Other stolen exhibition dogs found in Compton
The remaining two of the four exhibit dogs stolen outside a Bellflower motel were found, according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Office on Thursday.
The four exhibit dogs—two Akitas and two Pembroke Welsh Corgis—disappeared on Tuesday when unknown people stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express van that housed the animals in front of a Bellflower Motel 6 at night, authorities said.
Two of the dogs were discovered Wednesday afternoon, and the last two on Wednesday evening, explains Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
"The good news is, the dogs are fine," Whitmore said.
"They are in good condition."
"They were returned to their rightful owners."
Whitmore did not specify the location of the dogs or the circumstances that led to their discovery.
“The investigation is still ongoing.”
"We don't want to say more about that," Whitmore explains.
"We're tracking some tracks."
The dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not available for information on Thursday.
They received their two dogs on Wednesday afternoon at a district animal shelter in Downey.
Representatives of the sheriff found the van and the two dogs at different locations in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a 3-year-old male, and Didi, a 10-month-old female - were unharmed, according to the authorities statement.
But the Corgis Bunny and Peter, who wanted to introduce Rickard and Peek at the competition this week on behalf of their Japanese owners, remained missing until Wednesday evening.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were in town this weekend because of the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship in Long Beach, because Trace was supposed to participate in the competition.
As Peek told the Times on Wednesday, the other dogs should take part in other competitions on the days before the AKC/Eukanuba show.
Southern California is a stop on the couple’s nearly one-month tour from dog show to dog show.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked into the motel.
They often stay in motels and park their van in front of their room window.
They took three more dogs — a boxer puppy, a Parson Russell Terrier, and a Brittany — into their motel room.
The thick-skinned Akitas and Corgis stayed in the van because it was cooler there.
They left the window a gap wide open so that the dogs had fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported their car stolen at 6:00 a.m. on Tuesday.
Peek promised anyone who could give a clue to the corgis a finder's fee, and microchips were implanted in the animals for identification.
On Thursday, it was not yet clear whether a finder's wage would be paid.
The lion roars again after court approval of MGM restructuring
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM finally got the green light for a new start.
A New York bankruptcy judge on Thursday officiated the "preparatory" bailout plan to pay off $5 billion in debt and pave the way for the 86-year-old entertainment company's new films and television shows.
According to Thursday’s statements, the plan meets the requirements of U.S. bankruptcy law, so there is nothing standing in the way of MGM’s restart under the direction of Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, the founders of Spyglass Entertainment. Barber and Birnbaum will lead the somewhat slimmed-down studio as CEOs.
The number of employees will be reduced from over 400 to about 320.
For MGM, Chapter 11 does not actually enter into force until JPMorgan Chase has completed a planned $500 million bond to finance the new MGM productions.
At the moment, a consortium of the investment bank, which itself generates $75 million, is leading the company. The financing is expected to be by mid-December.
The reorganization of the studio began in May 2009 with an order from the investment bank Moelis & Co, the management of the company, which struggled with interest payments amounting to $300 million/year, to help solve its financial problems.
In August, Managing Director Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO at Enron and restructuring expert who became known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis & Cooper’s efforts to resolve MGM’s financial concerns and pay off the studio’s more than 140 creditors took longer than expected.
After months of discussions, the parties decided at the end of 2009 to offer the company for sale.
But the auction attracted only a few bidders and no one wanted to pay the $2 billion demanded by the creditors.
In the spring of this year, everything started all over again when the MGM team began the restructuring plan, which was finally signed by the creditors at the end of October after months of debate and internal disputes.
If MGM has officially survived bankruptcy in the next few weeks, Moelis and Cooper will receive a bonus of several million dollars for their work.
The share for Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, amounts to $9.5 million.
Cooper, who was paid $375,000 a month to run the company, will receive a “success bonus” of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM. This year, the studio released only one film and made an annual schedule of seven or eight films, which are expected to hit theaters in early 2012.
In addition, they are planning two films after "The Little Hobbit" in co-production with Warner Bros.
The studio needs a separate bond of $265 million to $275 million for its financial stake in these two films, which will be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who funded about 18% of the MGM loan, attempted to merge the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, of which he is the largest shareholder.
However, the last negotiations between the two companies did not lead to any results.
Tech Toys keeps your gift budget in balance
This year’s favorite gift is the iPad, possibly followed by a Microsoft Kinect video console, both of which can make a sizable hole in your gift budget.
An iPad costs as much as five BMX wheels for $99, while the price for a Kinect game is about 10 classic jump ropes or about 48 cans of Play-Doh.
But you can save your gift budget.
Recently, looking for three electronic toys under $80, I visited three national toy retailers - a Wal-Mart, a Toys "R" Us, and a BJ's Wholesale Club.
I immediately realized that Moore’s law had come into force. This year the technology toys are more powerful and at the same time cost a little less than last year.
And although fewer new toys appear with their own website, the best-known of this kind, Webkinz and Club Penguin, has a wider range.
More and more button-cell-powered toys are coming to market, and many contain rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(Unless otherwise stated, all prices are from Toys "R" Us.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, for children from 3 years) are plush figures, the size of guinea pigs that sing a note when you press on their stomachs.
Pressing once corresponds to a note, by pressing several times you can play a song.
Several sing-a-ma-jigs sing in harmony.
Attention: Once you have started pressing, you can no longer stop.
For a combination of text and dance, the Dance Star Mickey (Fisher price $60, for children from 2) is the best choice.
Based on the Elmo Live technology developed last year, the animatronic doll offers interplays like 'Simon Says', and thanks to its novel wheel-locked hinged feet, it masters the Moon Walk.
Kids who tested the device use Mickey as a dance instructor, but their parents complained about the lack of volume control.
If you’re an 80s kid, you certainly remember Alfie, one of the first computerized learning toys.
Now he's back (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for children from 3), with a bunch of question cards that can turn a car ride into a lesson, with a know-it-all with autocorrect function as a teacher.
If you don’t want to entrust your smartphone to your child, here are three independent alternatives.
VTech’s MobiGo ($60 for kids ages 3 to 8) is the cheapest and most user-friendly solution, equipped with a qwerty keyboard, but the games on it aren’t as educational as those on the Leapster Explorer ($70, for kids ages 3 to 12), which features a new, brighter screen after Leapfrog’s first major overhaul of the Leapster series.
None of the versions is compatible with older cassettes.
Fisher-Price’s iXL ($90 for kids ages 3 to 7) uses a system similar to iTunes for the games and eBooks, and thanks to the SD card drive, family photos can also be viewed on it.
Last but not least, there is Scrabble Flash ($30 from Hasbro, for children from 8). The five blocks are no bigger than a matchbox and have their own LED screen.
The game is all about collapsing the blocks into words before time runs out and is great for an improvised spelling contest.
More and more toys have some kind of online connection.
If you go to the toy stores alone after the offer, Webkinz and Club Penguin are the most important.
For example, to give your child an online animal at Club Penguin, you can buy a Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Pack ($5 for children from 6 to 12) that contains a coin with a secret code.
If you enter the code online, your child will receive enough credits for two more parts in the Club Penguin Store.
These can be roller skates or a Puffle stuffed animal.
The latest head-cell-powered microrobot, Hexbug Nano ($10 for kids 5+) is no bigger than the head of your toothbrush.
The beetle moves quickly on 12 vibrating silicone legs in any direction.
It's fun to send him through a maze of blocks.
And he holds out a lot.
Ours fell off the kitchen table and even survived for some time in the mouth of our dog.
Police operations in China are getting softer
Like a training officer, Tang Shenbin stepped over an urban square, checking his nervous subordinates, issuing orders with military authority and muted voice.
He wanted his female members of the Chengguan—China’s robust guardians of the urban order, feared and despised for their arbitrary raids and their propensity for violence—to impress viewers.
"Stand straight!"
"Look straight ahead!"
"Show them," he whispered to them, "how pretty girls are like that!"
Four girls, barely outgrown their teenage years, with white gloves and identical olive green jackets and pants, stood tight.
Four pairs of black pumps stood in a straight line.
Four neat hats sat perfectly on the hair held with blue and white striped bows.
"To me, they look average," Mr. Tang remarks contemptuously.
"Models are beautiful."
Several governments have already tried to polish up the image of China’s city inspectors.
In a city, all new applicants must have a university degree.
Guangdong Province introduced a bright blue uniform instead of the grey-green one.
Wuhan in central China replaced violence with stares: In 2009, 50 officials reportedly circled an improperly set-up food truck and stared at the operator until he packed up after half an hour and left the place.
Xindu, a city district in Chengdu with 680,000 inhabitants, wants to fundamentally change the image.
Since 2003, 13 women have reinforced the urban police patrols and have been specially selected for their appearance, their good figure and their youth.
They are meant to give the rough-and-tumble police a softer, feminine aspect.
Unfortunately, Scarlett Johansson would not be able to improve the bad image the Chinese have of these city commands.
And rightly so, the critics.
Unlike the police, these officers are only allowed to enforce city laws through fines or other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese media routinely shows a different picture.
In January 2008, officials in Hubei province beat a spectator to death when he filmed them using his mobile phone as they crushed a protest against a garbage dump.
Last year, a training manual of Beijing officials was stolen and published on the Internet, describing how offenders can be beaten without bloodshed.
This year, a Shanghai watermelon trader suffered brain injuries after a scuffle with five officials.
A violent video game that can be downloaded from the Internet shows officials trained in China in an attack on street vendors.
"Chengguan scares the government," the national newspaper China Daily lamented last year, after further controversy over the tactics.
The newspaper called for a “really thorough clean-up.”
Skeptics consider the current approach to be significantly inadequate.
When the district searched for eight female recruits via ad in October, an editorial in the Beijing Evening News asked whether the women had real tasks or should only serve as an optical distraction.
Probably both.
According to the job advertisement, women aged 18 to 22 with a good figure and "harmonious facial features" were sought.
They should be above average in size - about 1.5m or 5 feet, 2 1/2 inches.
The employment relationship ends at the age of 26.
According to the officials, the activity is too strenuous for women over 25.
"The most important thing is their image," said an unnamed district official at the quasi-government website Rednet.com.
"Whether the candidates get the job depends first on their outward appearance, such as height, weight, facial features, etc."
Then comes temperament and “inner qualities.”
“Female Chengguan are like flower vases,” he said, adding, “but beyond that, they have other duties.”
Zheng Lihua, deputy head of the district’s municipal administration, does not agree with this description,
But admitted that in China, size limits in job ads for both genders are not uncommon.
The same applies to uniform facial features.
Whether this can be equated with good looks is controversial in China.
But people with disabilities or physical deformities do not need to apply.
"Unfortunately, we can't use lame or humpbacks here," Mr. Zheng said.
"Your image would not be good."
Liu Yi, who patrols Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22, has apple pies and a well-shaped mouth.
She didn’t feel sexist that she was so attached to her appearance.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asks with an ironic look.
Her colleague with the dimples, 21-year-old Xu Yang, comments, "We have the task to represent the image of the city."
According to them, they do not regret the short attitude, as they have more ambitious career plans than just scare traders through the alleys to prevent them from doing business.
Every morning, the patrol deals with about twelve street vendors who try to sell as many rolls and tofu dishes as possible on foot or by bicycle before they are chased away.
"Mr. Wang, please get out of here."
"We've told you this so many times!" explains Frl. Xu to a merchant who had fled on foot and had temporarily abandoned his pasta kitchen, which was attached to a bicycle cart.
According to the officials, the activity is monotonous rather than exhausting.
“It’s almost the same every day,” explains Huang Jing, 20, who studies sales in the leisure industry.
"Everything routine."
One reason for this is that the female officials are not allowed to confiscate the traders’ goods, like their male counterparts.
They can only threaten offenders by reporting them to their male superiors.
This is to protect them from public hostility, which officials in China are often exposed to.
This year, hundreds of residents of Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, rioted after rumors circulated that Chengguan officials had killed a trader.
More than a dozen police officers and Chenguan officials were injured in the nighttime incident, 14 government vehicles were overturned or set on fire.
Xindu has been spared such violence so far.
But unrest cannot be ruled out.
Just two blocks away from the quiet Baonguang Square where female officers patrolled that morning, over 50 people gathered at a street corner.
Officials had confiscated a motorcycle, which was repaired on the sidewalk instead of in a workshop, contrary to the regulations.
The owner shouted Zeter and Mordio.
After 15 minutes of hesitation, the officers made their way to their vehicles with a grim face and continued with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a male patrol coordinator, stayed behind, flipping his white name tag to remain anonymous.
Like her colleagues, the coordinators - men over 40 - play a purely supportive role.
But they were not trained to present a clean image.
“Sometimes we go verbal.”
"Sometimes, but also physically," Mr. Li explains soberly.
“Most of the time, people start fighting.”
Prosecutors will not indict Senator Ensign
Attorneys at the Department of Justice have acquitted Senator John Ensign of the charges made against him after his affair with a former election worker and his attempt to get her husband to lobby, the senator’s lawyers announced Wednesday.
This decision ends the most serious lawsuit against Senator Ensign, the Republican from Nevada. Until the scandal, which made national headlines and put a damper on his career, he was considered a possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012.
As Senator Ensign’s office announced, he was “highly pleased” with the verdict after the one-year investigation.
However, the Senate Ethics Committee could still impose a disciplinary penalty.
According to Ensign’s attorneys, they were informed by the Department of Justice that the investigation into Senator Ensign had been terminated and that there were no further charges on the matter.
The Justice Department did not comment on the case.
The ruling came as a surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Department of Justice, who believe there was sufficient evidence that Ensign violated the lobbying ban.
Interviews, e-mails, and other documents first disclosed in the New York Times in October 2009 gave rise to the suspicion that Ensign helped Douglas Hampton, one of his election aides, to lucrative contracts to buy his silence over an affair with Hampton’s wife Cynthia.
Cynthia Hampton served as treasurer during an Ensigns election campaign.
Ensign contacted some political friends to get Hampton to work, and according to the records and interrogations, he took over Hampton's lobbying for them after the hiring.
Since Hampton was recently on Ensign’s election team, he was not allowed to lobby for his former employer or the entire Senate for a year.
According to ethics experts, the unusual agreement between Ensign and Hampton, who were close friends before the affair, violated the so-called ban on the revolving-door lobbyocracy.
According to the published evidence, “it appears to be an arrangement and violation of the revolving door statutes,” said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients targeted by the government.
While the Department of Justice officially declined to disclose the reasons for the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said the Department appears to be very cautious in taking political charges after a variety of defeats pursued by the media with great interest, including last year’s decision to drop the charges against former Senator Ted Stevens for misconduct on the part of the prosecutor.
Prosecutors “are obviously horrifying,” said Melanie Sloan, the chairman of the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington association (an organization whose goal is to fight corruption in U.S. parliamentary and government circles), a group of lawyers who have brought various charges against Mr. Ensign to court.
“This basically means that high-ranking government officials can now assume that the laws don’t apply to them,” she added.
Paul Coggins, chief defense attorney for Mr. Ensign, said in an interview that he had received a phone call from a prosecutor on Monday and another the next day informing him that the ministry would not bring any lawsuits against his client.
Mr. Ensign's defense attorneys had cooperated with prosecutors to convince them that the senator, as his office reiterated in a statement on Wednesday, had "acted in accordance with the law."
Mr. Coggins refused to explain in more detail the legal arguments he had made to the prosecutors.
"I'm not comfortable going into the details of the conversation between the Department of Justice and me, just to be clear, we think we've made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Electoral Commission decided to close the investigation into a separate lawsuit by the ethics group, according to which a $96,000 payment from Mr. Ensign’s parents to the Hamptons violated federal electoral law.
The election commission said there was not enough evidence that the money was anything other than a gift.
NV Energy, a large company in Nevada that long supported the Senator, was one of the companies where Mr. Hampton found lobbyist work thanks to the help of Mr. Ensign.
An e-mail from December 2008 shows that after the company moved Mr. Hampton forward as lobbyist, Mr. Ensing's chief of staff, John Lopez, had a conversation with Mr. Hampton in which he told him that he was "knocking" at the Home Office about a case.
Mr. Ensign also met with Mr. Hampton and another Nevada customer, Allegiant Air, for lunch, and asked the Secretary of Transportation to arrange a meeting on behalf of the airline after Mr. Hampton had hired Mr. Hampton to lobby.
When information about this affair first surfaced last year, Mr. Ensign apologized to his constituents and gave up his position in the Senate, where he ranked fourth among Republicans.
After many months of noticing, Mr. Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he was seeking a third term in the Senate.
In announcing that Mr. Ensign is no longer the target of police investigation, his press secretary, Jennifer Cooper, said the senator hopes the ethics committee will very quickly follow the example of the Department of Justice and stop its investigation.
“Senator Ensign looks forward to continuing his hard work in the service of the people of Nevada,” she said.
Cheshire appeal draws attention to Twitter
Half a dozen of them tipped away in the riots in the courtroom.
Every minute, they sent their reports of gruesome witness statements via Twitter.
In the end, according to the defense, there were more than 140,000 Twitter messages about the process of rape and children chained to beds in a house that went up in flames.
On Thursday, the closely watched trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was accused of killing three members of a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, will find an official end when the verdict on the death sentence pronounced by the jury falls.
However, Mr. Hayes’ lawyers have already filed motions in court that state the reasons for an appeal and that will keep the courts busy for years to come.
One of the most provocative reasons is that the intense coverage of the process – including the extensive use of Twitter by average reporters – has resulted in a “circus atmosphere” and such widespread, immediate penetration of seditious details that the jury has been unduly influenced by public outrage.
This objection could lead the appellate courts to consider whether the new technologies make new rules necessary in the courtroom.
"Just as I experienced it during this trial, I believe that it is really a danger if the entry of new technologies into the courtroom affects the right of every individual to a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Hayes' chief defense attorney.
The presiding judge, Jon C. Blue of the Supreme Court of Appeal, succinctly rejected the motions by decision last week when he said the New Media would be “carefully controlled” and that there was no evidence that the jury was driven by passions.
But that was certainly not the last word on the matter.
For decades, court filings have found that reporting on infamous cases casts doubt on the fairness of a trial.
In its historic 1966 decision, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the ruling against Dr. Sam Sheppard, an osteopath from Cleveland who is said to have killed his wife, saying in his decision that there had been a “carnival atmosphere in the courtroom” because of the New Media.
Some believe that the television series and the feature film "Auf der Flucht" is based on this crime.
Some lawyers say court appeals, which Mr. Hayes' conviction looks at half a century later, could follow the argument that new rules have become necessary to regulate the lines of communication from the courtroom that were unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard's case.
“There’s a good reason to be concerned about the influence of the new media in trials being pursued by a broad public,” said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School who investigated the death penalty in Connecticut.
Professor Donohue said some appellate courts may be intrigued by the idea that restricting immediate communication out of the courtroom could make the processes fairer.
The Twitter matter is just one of many that Mr. Hayes’ lawyers set out to discuss for years, thus delaying a conviction.
Defendants also claim, for example, that Mr. Hayes may have already been convicted when Judge Blue did not allow them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them gruesome crime scene photos during the jury selection.
Some of the jurors have said photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48 years old, and her suitor, Hayley, 17 years old, and Michaela, 11 years old, had filled them with disgust.
Defendants say they also question the constitutionality of the death penalty constitution, arguing that the judge mistakenly exchanged a juror who had been a critic of the prosecution, and that he unduly put pressure on the verdict when he made the unusual decision to release the jury over the weekend.
The jurors were not isolated.
But their arguments about the influence of detailed reporting on the process may attract the greatest interest.
In a judgment challenge they filed last month, they found that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and was being debated by candidates during the campaign for governor and for the U.S. Senate.
They argued that the New Media had continuously rekindled the flames of emotion about the case.
“Such a daily influx of media pimps, cameras and reporters outside the courtroom,” the lawyers wrote, “has not been experienced before in New Haven and perhaps even nationwide.”
Her focus on Twitter reporting is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists said that the claim that these direct messages are more inflammatory than reports that are being relayed more slowly is a technology-haunting look that impoverishes reporting on future processes.
But some lawyers said appellate courts would often face the argument that societal and technical changes required adaptation by the courts.
Mr. Hayer's lawyers reinforce this claim.
In their objection, they referred to the Supreme Court decision of 1966, in which Dr. Sheppard’s conviction was overturned on the basis of reporting, and made it clear that the New Media required new rules.
“This case,” they wrote, “represents Sheppard against Maxwell of the 21st century.”
Can courtesy connect the divider?
After a campaign of rants and negativity, little courtesy has broken out in Washington this week.
Is it the omen of genuine two-party cooperation or a moment of illusion before quickly returning to the struggle of the parties in the capital?
Tuesday’s meeting between President Obama and congressional leaders did not bring a breakthrough in the big questions that were addressed during the so-called “lame duck session,” the session at the end of a government period in which no more decisions are made.
After all that one hears, it was neither a polite discussion between two different sides nor a consideration of their shared responsibility to govern, but rather an empty episode of partisan scoring.
The public meeting of the president’s deficit commission on Wednesday was also civilized, despite the political differences that continue to exist between the members.
It seems clear that close interaction over a period of months creates a mutual respect that obscures the ideological divide that continues to divide members.
This is hardly enough to say that a new era of cooperation has begun.
Both sides are now in a testing phase - in which one demands from the other sign of cooperation and willingness to compromise, while one tries to weigh the limits of public opinion and the patience of the voters after a new party warfare.
Therefore, the meeting on Tuesday itself and its assessment by the participants were limited to a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too great and too deep to expect a rapid change in the atmosphere that has prevailed over the past two years.
Whether it is about taxes, donations, health or entitlements, the two sides are miles apart.
Last but not least, Washington’s November election has been mild for at least a short time.
“No question, the tone of voice has changed,” said Pete Wehner, an official representative of the Bush administration who now works for the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
“This is inevitable after the election.
Elections awaken partisan passions that are dying off again.
And that's a good thing."
On some issues, especially those on the Lame Duck Session agenda, Republicans and Democrats have little choice but to find a solution.
Bush’s tax cuts end at the end of the year, and no one is advocating that.
Both sides want to find a way to get some or even all of them, whether temporary or permanent.
Likewise, a compromise on the increased unemployment benefits is to be expected, if only because Republicans cannot afford to believe that the favored tax cuts for the rich are being made while they deny support to unemployed workers.
After the meeting on Tuesday in the White House, the optimism has risen that one can agree on these issues during the "lame duck session" and at the same time ratify the New START Treaty.
But William Glaston of the Brookings Institution warns that successful cooperation on urgent issues of the lame duck session "does not necessarily lead to lasting cooperation between the parties when the new 112th Congress is convened in January.
Instead, he says, a phase of disagreement is more likely, perhaps even inevitable.
“After the things that need to be done are done, this short-term psychology will turn into confrontation,” he said.
Wehner is also skeptical—and this skepticism is shared by many—that courtesy leads to true cooperation.
"I see a lot of what is happening from now until 2012 as pre-fight, or shadow boxing, for the main event of 2012," he said.
The reasons for this have much to do with the appearance of the new Republican majority in the White House and with the tea party voters who served their formation.
No matter how concerned Republican leaders may be about poker being too high, they know they must try to keep their promises to cut government spending and override health care reform.
These party lines are already evident in the initial reactions to the recommendations of the Deficit Commission, which include tax reform and the raising of some taxes, as well as the raising of the retirement age and the lowering of government spending.
Vice Chairs Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken on one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, in their own assessment, have pushed so hard to put the deficit issue on the public agenda that it can no longer be ignored.
But they need 14 of the 18 votes within the Commission to make their plan the official recommendation and they are struggling very hard to get even close to that number.
The greatest resistance is found in the elected representatives of the panel, since in financial matters, at least today, there is little room for manoeuvre or sympathy for compromise.
Galston predicts two phases in the fight between the White House and the Republicans in Congress.
The first battle will take place next year in the form of party clashes when Republicans challenge Obama regarding the state budget, taxes, and health care system, followed later by a phase of greater two-party cooperation.
What will lead to this change?
The public opinion.
It is proven that, despite the partisanship of the current election, the majority of Americans still want the two parties to work together.
If confrontation leads to a dead end, as happened in 1995, then both parties must pay careful attention to the public response.
Whoever is condemned to lose will have to change course and seek compromise.
This may indeed be an optimistic view.
Partisanism and polarization are greater today than they were in the mid-1990s, and they seem to be a greater ideological divide between Obama and the Congressional Republicans than they were between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans at the time.
At the same time, the activists of both parties see 2010 as a mere prelude to a much wider election in 2012.
Seen in this light, the courtesy displayed this week may be welcomed by many Americans.
But it will take much more effort on both sides to find a common denominator in the questions that still separate the two.
Leaked US document portrays Moscow as a port of corruption
The control of the city is in the hands of the “Kleptocracy” and it passes on some of the bribes and protection money it collects to the Kremlin, the American Embassy in Russia reported in a memo in February.
Both the police and the State Security Service are extorting high protection funds so that they can maintain their expensive standard of living in Moscow, it is said.
They collect money not only from legitimate businesses, but also from organized criminal gangs.
Every layer of the bureaucracy – what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called the “vertical of authority” – takes its share of the money that moves the ladder upwards.
The memo, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was posted on his homepage by WikiLeaks on Tuesday.
The memo is based on sources whose names have been edited.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still Moscow’s mayor, and it accuses him of corruption.
He was fired by President Dmitry Medvedev in October, but there is little evidence that has since been cleared up.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a well-known construction company, have repeatedly denied allegations of corruption for years, and he has won numerous libel suits against such accusations.
In September, he told a Russian television station when asked about a documentary that suggested he was corrupt: “It’s crazy, it’s dirty, it’s dirty.”
> An incredibly large number of Russians believe that their society is corrupt, according to polls.
But it is unusual that, as happened in the ambassador's report, individuals are called, and it is unheard of that this is done by a diplomat of a foreign country.
"The direct link between the Moscow government and crime has led some to call it 'disturbed' and conclude that the government is acting more like a kleptocrat than a government," the memo said.
“Criminal elements enjoy a ‘kryshna’ (a term from the world of criminals/mafia, which literally means ‘roof’ or protection) that extends across the police, State Security (FSB), Service Supervision Authority (MVD) and Prosecutor’s Office as well as the entire Moscow government bureaucracy.
Experts have discovered a three-layered structure within the criminal world of Moscow.
"Luchkov is at the top."
"FSB, MVD and the militia are on the second stage."
"Finally, the ordinary criminals and the criminal inspectors follow at the lowest level."
“This is an incompetent system in which criminal groups fill a gap in some areas because the city does not offer any help.”
The report goes on to say that the FSB is collecting money from the largest companies and that the police are arresting small businessmen.
A source, it is said, “explained that Moscow’s business owners understand that it is best to get protection from the MVD and FSB (and not from organized crime), because they not only have more weapons, resources and power than the criminals, but also because they are protected by the law.”
"For this reason, protection by criminal gangs is no longer as in demand as it used to be."
The memo notes that while collecting funds is comprehensive, the protection itself may not be very modest; even those who pay are sometimes arrested.
Those who do not pay find their business closed very quickly - due to one or the other pretext.
Medvedev has spoken several times about fighting corruption, but at the same time has noted that he has made little progress.
The memo of the embassy contains descriptions of men who go to the Kremlin with suitcases that were probably full of money.
“In his fight against corruption, Medvedev must rely on the bureaucrats,” Georgy Satarov, director of Indem, a Moscow commission of experts, said in a recent interview.
"But he's part of that bureaucracy."
"It is not part of the political class, because a political class no longer exists in Russia."
Without politicians, without an opposition, without a separation of powers, he says, corruption is inevitable.
Nationwide, Indem estimates, corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
The country is ranked 154th in a recent survey of global perceptions of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (countries are listed from “least corrupt” to “most corrupt”).
The unveiling of the memo of the American embassy, which happened late at night after Moscow’s time, will certainly cause displeasure within the Russian government, although, since Luzhkov can be accused of Moscow’s mistakes, it can also be a way for the Kremlin to claim that one solves the problems.
In an interview with Larry King for CNN, Putin claimed that the WikiLeaks documents could be a fake and reacted furiously to the revelation that American diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
“The truth is that it’s about our interaction, which is an important factor of domestic politics in this country,” he said.
"But to be honest, we didn't expect this to happen with such arrogance, with such pressure, and in such a unethical way, you know."
Khmer Rouge veterans forced to confront the past
In a dimly lit, concrete classroom with dirty and peeling walls, the director of Anlong Veng High School remembers the man who built it, the future Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader and he took care of his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42 years old.
Because of his brutality during the Khmer Rouge rule known as "the butcher", the commander remains popular in this remote former Khmer Rouge stronghold in northwestern Cambodia, where he built hospitals and bridges, developed infrastructure and where thousands of former soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge capitulation to the government, longtime supporters in Anlong Veng are being challenged.
In April, a local Truth and Reconciliation Forum allowed victims to publicly confront the people who once supported the regime.
In June, the government distributed a textbook that tells the story of the Khmer Rouge to children of former soldiers for the first time.
And in July, a UN and Cambodian community tribunal first sentenced a former member of the Khmer Rouge when it sentenced former head of the notorious Tuol Sleng torture chamber, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, to 35 years in prison.
With each of these developments, fear grew among Khmer Rouge veterans Alnlong Vengs, hampering their efforts at reconciliation and reintegration into Cambodian society.
“There is still rejection and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything,” said Chhang Youk, head of Cambodia’s documentation center, an independent organization that researches the regime.
"For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
“It divides families.”
During the Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or died of disease, overwork or starvation.
When the Vietnamese invaded and the Pol Pot-Id government collapsed in 1979, the remnants of the regime and its military fled to the Cambodian border with Thailand.
Here they spread unrest until December 1998, when the last movement capitulated.
When Pol Pot, Nuon Chea, and Ieng Sary waged guerrilla warfare from their base in the west of the mountains and jungles of Cambodia, Ta Mok drew up the next generation in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, when a UN-sponsored peace agreement led to the country’s first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began defecting to the government, leading to the capitulations of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died a natural death in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had not given in, was arrested by government forces at the Dangrek Mountains in 1999.
He died in Phnom Penh prison in 2006, awaiting trial.
When their patrons no longer protected them, most former Khmer Rouge fighters fled into the grueling poverty of rural Cambodia and many kept the movement in nostalgic memory.
Even though a few elite Khmer Rouge officials kept their local government posts because they laid down their weapons, the ordinary soldiers remained poor, uneducated peasants.
"These people have benefited very little from the surrender," said Sok Leang of the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which holds public forums throughout Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
"They are anchored in the regime's utopian agrarian ideology."
"They grew up without any professional knowledge."
Sor Lim, 55, who joined the Rhmer Rouge in 1974 as a teenager, fought in the jungle for Anlang Veng before settling down in 1998 to live a life as a poor rice farmer.
“Life under the Khmer Rouge was good,” he said.
"Ta Mok gave everyone something to eat."
“But now life is hard because we have to take care of ourselves.”
The ongoing Khmer Rouge Tribunal has also raised concerns here.
Early next year, the court will try to bring to justice Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, as well as Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister.
The order of the court is to condemn the old leaders and those mainly responsible for the atrocities, but it is not said whether it will pursue further acts beyond these four cases.
This has done little to alleviate fears in Anlong Veng.
Current media speculation has focused on Im Chaem, 64, who had been district chief in Manteay Meanchey Province during the Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told the Cambodian Documentation Centre that she was in charge of the construction of the Trapeang Thma Dam, a project in which thousands of forced labourers are believed to have died.
One hot evening, Im Chaem returned from working in the fields to her wooden house on a dirty street outside Anlong Veng.
When the sun cast long shadows on the withered grass, Im Chaem refused to discuss her past at the Khmer Rouge.
Should the court summon her, she would refuse to leave, she said.
“Cambodia lives in peace and stability,” she said.
"If there were no more persecutions, there would be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who fled the Khmer Rouge in 1878, has also repeatedly warned that if the situation became uncertain, the court would indict more suspects, although experts and historians discuss this.
“Cambodia needs to dig a hole and bury the past,” he said.
But confronting the past is what Cambodia needs to do in order to move forward, said Chhang Youk of the Documentation Centre.
"Reconciliation with the Khmer times means gathering the broken pieces," he said.
"It is our duty to put these broken parts together so that as everything can understand."
The center created the first government-approved textbook on the Khmer Rouge, the 75-page "History of Democratic Cambodia."
It distributed the book in June in Anlong Veng as an appendix to the Ministry of Education's High School History Book, which contains fewer than four pages about the Khmer Rouge.
As is often the case in Cambodia, young people in Anlong Veng know little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city’s ties to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said the new textbook helps students understand an important part of their story.
But his parents were skeptical when he brought the book home to read.
"My family rejects many parts of the book and the court," he said.
"They are suspicious because they are not sure how many people will be convicted by the court."
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process complex and complicated, Sok Leang said.
But the public forums, the textbook and the court gradually gain influence," he said.
The Khmer Rouge still has a powerful attraction here.
At the top of the Dangrek Mountains, a path overgrown with shrubs and polluted with plastic waste leads to a rectangle of black soot, covered with a rusty sheet metal roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned on a pile of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31 years old, a mobile phone saleswoman on the side of the road, said she didn’t know much about the man who had been burned here.
“But he has a strong spirit and many people here go to him to pray,” she said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday and later in the day she wanted to go to Pol Pot's final resting place, where she will put down a bush of ripe bananas - hoping that he will bring her luck.
Belarus agrees to collect no more weapons-grade uranium
In a surprise victory for President Obama’s campaign to safeguard nuclear materials worldwide, the government of Belarus announced on Wednesday that it will no longer collect highly enriched uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was announced in a joint statement following a meeting between Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov in an additional article at the Security Summit.
The U.S. government had spent years trying to convince Belarus to stop collecting high-enriched uranium and seemed to have hit a hurdle last spring.
But U.S. officials told the Washington Post that two secret agreements have been made with Belarus in the past two months to remove 187 pounds of weapons-grade uranium from a Belarusian research facility.
That set the stage for Wednesday’s agreement to remove the rest of the material — about <0xC2><0xA3>500, according to an official employee who remains anonymous due to the topic’s sensitivity.
The agreement appears to be one of the key outcomes of Obama’s “47 Nations Nuclear Security Summit” of April, which excluded Belarus.
And it was obviously good enough to secure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next summit in 2012.
"I was really excited about the fact that they want a seat in the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit."
“This proves to me that it works,” said Ken Luongo, president of the Global Security Partnership, a group promoting nuclear safety.
Clinton called the deal “a very significant, important step” by Belarus.
Obama promised in April 2009 in Prague to secure all precarious nuclear material within four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A dozen countries did so under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama’s Nuclear Security Summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko declared that the nation will never give up its uranium.
“How do we keep highly enriched uranium — hundreds of kilos, which is fundamentally weapons-grade, and less enriched uranium,” Lukashenko said at the time.
"This is our raw material... We're not going to make dirty bombs out of it and we're not going to sell it to anyone."
"We use it exclusively for research purposes, that's all".
Belarus, however, approached the US a few months ago when it indicated interest in reaching an agreement.
The first attempt to remove the uranium from Belarus in October was particularly complicated because the material was slightly irradiated, officials say.
It was loaded into a special train that ran more than 1,300 miles to a Russian factory for storage and disposal, officials say.
The second attempt was decided on Monday and was carried out by plane, according to the officials.
The U.S. government pays $14 million for these efforts, with much of the money flowing into Belarusian research with low-enriched uranium, which cannot be used for nuclear weapons.
“This was extremely carefully coordinated and coordinated to build trust,” which led to the deal being signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, an energy ministry representative working on global risk reduction.
The James Martin Center for Non-Disclosure Studies estimates that Belarus had at least 88 pounds of weapons-grade uranium this year, as well as hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
According to the joint agreement, Belarus wants to dissolve its camp by 2012.
Relations between Belarus and the US have been strained for years, primarily because of Lukashenko’s harsh disregard for human rights.
But Wednesday’s statement suggests a possible rapprochement.
“Welcoming the progress of these global security issues, the United States of America and Belarus announce that increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central issue in the improvement of bilateral relations and it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens,” she explains.
No objections from the Spanish government to CIA flights
The Spanish government had no objection to CIA flights with Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners over Spanish territory to Guant<0xC3><0xA1>namo, according to a telegram from the U.S. ambassador in Madrid.
This is reflected in the documents leaked by Wikileaks and forwarded to the daily newspaper "El Pa<0xC3><0xAD>s" (by cable). It is added that the former deputy head of government Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Teresa Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez de la Vega demanded that the Spanish government be informed "to prove that foreign aircraft flying over Spain are adequately monitored."
In June 2006, following the publication of a report by the Council of Europe accusing a dozen countries, including Spain, of aiding and abetting human rights abuses, former North American Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez de la Vega met.
The deputy head of government admitted that the Council's report "hit Zapatero offside" and reiterated that Spain has nothing to hide in this matter.
De la Vega said: “Spain has no objection to intelligence flights over Spanish territory.
"You just want to be informed" so as not to be "unpreparedly surprised," Aguirre reports via cable.
The former foreign minister, Miguel <0xC3><0x81>ngel Moratinos, also pointed out to the ambassador that the Spanish government “does not want to pay much attention to this matter, although the government has little influence, as it is in the hands of the judges.”
Prosecutor Vicente Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez, for his part, told the embassy in January 2007 that he would not block the judicial initiative to request the declassification of the documents of the Spanish Intelligence Agency (CNI) and the Minister of Defense via CIA flights.
"These reports do not contain any incriminating or sensitive information," the ambassador said after an interview with the prosecutor.
Nevertheless, the US was more concerned about the "apparent coordination between the Spanish prosecutor and the German prosecutors" than about the declassified information provided by the CNI and the Ministry of Defense.
"This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to discreetly handle between governments," laments Aguirre.
At a luncheon in March 2007, attended by the U.S. Ambassador and Spanish Interior Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, the latter commented that "although the Spanish judges are insanely concerned about their independence and are doing what they deem appropriate," he had instructed his staff to "avoid inflated rhetorical comments to ease the tension."
The ambassador also expressed his concern about the PP’s approach in this matter.
“Despite their generally pro-American stance, our experience teaches us that the PP will not doubt capitalizing on an indication that the government has tolerated or willfully ignored Zapatero’s actions that could be interpreted as potential human rights violations, even if these revelations could have a negative impact on the government of the United States,” he said.
The child killer confesses that she has complained on the Internet about the "mourning" of motherhood.
The young woman spoke of the child when this was already dead and she had a blog: "Terror in a Galician way"
M<0xC3><0xB3>nica Juanatey Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez is on the Internet "Muki".
Under this epithet, which she carries from an early age, she keeps in touch with a cousin and at least one friend, both from Noia, a village in the province of La Coru<0xC3><0xB1>a, where she was born.
The announcements are from 2008.
To understand this, one must know their love life, which the daily ABC reconstructs on the basis of testimonies of their family members.
The 30-year-old Galician woman began a relationship with industrialist Iv<0xC3><0xA1>n T<0xC3><0xBA><0xC3><0xB1>ez in 1998.
She lasted a year.
Shortly after she dissolved her relationship, it was revealed that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his, but his ex never let him do a DNA analysis.
Shortly thereafter, she entered into a different relationship.
The chosen one was Alberto, a young man from Lousame, a neighboring community.
She lived with him for a long time.
César lived with them.
When the young woman went to the Balearic Islands to look around on the job market, the little one stayed with her partner, who even accompanied her to Palma for a week.
But from the content of their messages, it can be concluded that their love relationship broke down and they parted ways.
In March 2008 she is alone in Menorca and writes: "Alberto is very strange and angry because I came here to work."
"When I told him that, he liked it, but now of course he realizes what it means to be alone with the boy all day long and not be free to do and leave what he wants."
She later mentions a message she just received on her phone: “I want you to come back this month or send me an address to send the boy to.”
She complains, "If he doesn't like me leaving the boy with my mother, I'll pick him up when I get back."
In May, she talks about returning to her village: "This week I'm going there, but I'm only going to stay there until the 19th because I have to introduce myself to a job on the 20th if I don't want to lose it."
She explains that she will take her firstborn with her if all goes well.
"He will be with the one he has to be with, that is, with me. Never in life will I leave him with anyone but my mother," a dubious intention, considering their bad relationship.
There will be another email in July.
When she writes this, it is assumed that the boy who came to the island on the 1st of the month and was allegedly murdered on the 10th is dead.
"On the one hand, César is satisfied, on the other hand, he is not."
"On the one hand, he's with me and he likes the place a little bit, but on the other hand, he has to go to school every day."
She is talking about a move to Mallorca.
"There he (the boy) will attend a summer course, so I have less expenses for the nanny."
On the 17th: Memories and complaints.
"A giant kiss from César asking me when you're coming."
"Alberto says he sent me some videos on the e-mail. You see, if he wants to, he'll find me, such a mess."
On the 30th: "The boy is fine. He goes to a summer course to learn Catalan."
From V<0xC3><0xAD>ctor, her current partner, there is one: "He's shooting money at me."
On the Internet, in anime and manga blogs, there are messages from her.
She even had her own blog in MySpace, which is now blocked, in which she called herself “Muki, the prison release girl.”
"Terror a la gallega (Headline) ".
The last man to live with her, a sworn huntsman, declares to have remorse because he feels guilty.
He can’t believe it all happened because she hadn’t told him she was a single mother.
M<0xC3><0xB3>nica was transferred yesterday from the Centre for Prisoners of Justice in Menorca to the Provincial Prison of Palma.
The defense attorney, Carlos Maceda, said she could not remember the course of the case, “and she had no intention of harming the little one.”
She had previously confessed to drowning César in the bathtub and stowing his body in a suitcase.
The defense and prosecutors requested a psychiatric report.
Partido Popular won 4 seats in Congress and PSC lost 9
With the results of 28 November, PP could play a decisive role in the cities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona
After the significant increase in votes and MPs in the last regional elections, the PP is already turning its attention to the parliamentary elections - preferred or not. Their expectations are more than positive, because the number of votes this party achieves in these elections is usually twice as high as in the elections in Catalonia.
The Catalan People's Party received 610,473 votes in the 2008 parliamentary elections, while this figure was only 316,222 in the 2006 regional elections.
Last Sunday, the PPC received 384,091 votes.
If this upward trend - the result of the diversion of the vote share of the PSC and the binding of the electorate of the PP - should continue, the analysts of the PP predict that in the parliamentary elections the PPC could rise from 8 to 12 congressmen, while CiU would also win four (it now has 10) and the PSC would lose at least 9 deputies (out of 25).
These calculations prove the fundamental importance of Catalonia for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the People’s Party, the ERC would lose one MP – currently it has three – while ICV could keep its MPs or win one.
However, if the electoral calendar is retained, the next date for the municipal elections will be May 2011, when the People’s Party (PP) can be the tongue in cheek to put an end to socialist domination in four provincial capitals and with its majority in the city council of Barcelona, one of the city councils with the largest budget: 661 million euros for 2011.
Both the nationalists and the People’s Party agree that the PSC will lose the cities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the socialists can neither gain a majority nor resort to their traditional allies (ERC and ICV).
After the Republican debacle, it is not out of the question that this party will lose its representation on the municipal council of Barcelona, where it would have to win 5% of the vote.
The PP, on the other hand, saw an increase in its share of votes in the four provincial capitals and could become the decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that they can play the leading role in Tarragona’s transformation, where they had ruled in front of the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros, together with the PP.
En Lérida, the PP is only 500 votes behind the PSC. The mayor, <0xC3><0x80>ngel Ros, maintains good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during the last election campaign they met several times.
In other important places, such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus, the People’s Party also saw significant growth.
Currently, the PP is represented in 34 municipalities of Catalonia and aims to create lists in as many places as possible.
The Catalan cell got Al Qaeda thousands of passports
In addition to the seven arrests in Barcelona, there were three more in Thailand.
The seven Pakistanis and Nigerians who were arrested by the police of the Barcelona police intelligence station formed the jihadist cell controlled from Thailand, the various Al Qaeda groups, including the "Movement for the Liberation of Tamil Eelam" (LTTE) and "Lashkar e-Taiba" (Let) - the latter was the author of the attacks in Bombay, which claimed 106 lives in 2008.
The Spanish interior minister assigns great importance to these investigations, which he goes so far as to assure that with the "Operation Kampai" the counterfeiting apparatus of Al Qaida has been "weakened" worldwide and "with its ability to act".
The researchers believe that during the two years that the cell was active in Catalonia, thousands of passports were sent to Thailand, where they were falsified and then sent to the groups that make up the criminal galaxy Al Qaeda, so that their “fighters” could cross the borders of European and other Western countries without punishment.
The uncovered cell is not the only one of the jihadist network that has been active in Europe, which is why, in addition to the Thai investigative bodies, other European police units have been involved in the investigation. It cannot be ruled out that in the next few days there will be attacks similar to those carried out in Barcelona on the territory of the EU.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistanis Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were arrested) another was carried out in Thailand, during which the Pakistanis Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butungaya as well as the Thais were arrested.
They had led the cell based in Spain and other European countries from Bangkok.
The Catalan network - part of which had been destroyed in 2009 - stole in particular tourist passports according to the guidelines of the so-called "International Islamic Front".
This means that the documents were issued in the name of men between the ages of 25 and 45 and had to be valid for several more years; they were not allowed to have visa stamps.
It is underlined in investigative circles that so far no links have been found between those arrested in Catalonia and the Bombay attack, although the author of this attack, "Laschkar e-Taiba", was one of the groups of recipients of passports stolen in Spain and subsequently forged in Thailand.
Nevertheless, it should be remembered that a few days before the attack from Catalonia, several thousand dollars had been sent by means of a money transfer company, which were "invested" in the purchase of prepaid cards for mobile phones, which were later used by the members of the "command", which ended the lives of 106 people.
The police have confiscated a large amount of documentation.
PP calls on Mas to postpone tax agreement
The chairman of the PPC, Alicia S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez-Camacho, took the opportunity yesterday to personally present her terms to Artur Mas in support of his taking office as Prime Minister of the Generalitat. These do not differ from those already posed during the election campaign and can be summed up with the priority of the economic recovery and the failure of his regionalist independence adventures, such as a financial balancing agreement, the culmination of regionalist independence.
The leader of the Catalan People’s Party certainly appealed to Artur Mas, who gave her the 18 deputies she won last Sunday – a figure that is more than enough to make her feel indispensable, because the candidate from the bourgeois-regionalist party CiU is dependent on at least one of the opposition parties abstaining from voting when he took office.
The future alliances that the regionalists want to make in the upcoming parliamentary elections in Congress depend on a possible entente with the PP, but the talks that Mas is currently holding with the other party leaders are about Catalonia.
As far as the PPC party leaders are concerned, the PPC demands that in support of the inauguration "all discourses concerning the sovereignty and independence of Catalonia" as well as an agreement on the financial compensation between the state and the autonomous region - similar to the Basque country - and which the party leader of CiU even wants to submit to a referendum, be employed in the back.
What both leaders have in common is that they want to make the inflated political apparatus of the regional administration leaner and abolish the inheritance and gift tax.
The details of the negotiations for Mas’s accession to office are being discussed by the PPC Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who announced a tough opposition - and Joan Herrera (ICV), and today he will meet with Joan Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
Elderly Care Home Reaffirms Deaths Not attributable to ‘Lack of Measures’
The owners of the retirement home in Olot do not rule out that their carer killed over eleven elderly people.
The officials of the nursing home La Caritat in Olot (Gerona) yesterday gave a press conference in which they pointed out the damage that the criminal actions of Joan Vila Dilmé - the nurse who had killed at least eleven elderly people for whom he was responsible during his work - had done to the facility.
The head of the nursing home, Joan Sala, appeared in court accompanied by his lawyer, Joan Ca<0xC3><0xB1>ada, announcing that "La Caritat wants to sue the person responsible (for the deaths), but "the law and our liability force us to accept the process and civil liability".
The institution must not only accept a loss of social standing because it had not detected the criminal acts of the caregiver in time, but now also pay a large sum of compensation, which is calculated by the legal representatives of the family members of the victims.
Joan Vila Dilmé confessed that the first crime dates back to August 2009 and that he has continued to murder ever since.
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the nursing home - as he suspected that no doctor had personally examined the deceased, but the formalities were handled by telephone due to their age and illnesses.
The head of La Caritat flatly denied this point, stating that “absence of action could not have been the cause of the incidents at any time.”
The lawyer of La Caritat added that "there is no evidence in the litigation of negligent acts of any person other than the accused."
The one who was already baptized as a "death angel" confessed to eleven murders the day before yesterday and declared that the first crime was committed on 29 August 2009 and that one and a half months later the second old lady was murdered.
In this case, he killed with an overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime in which he had administered a mixture of various sedatives.
The head of La Caritat said staff access to the drugs was difficult to control.
The nurse used the insulin syringes and the sedative cocktail in six out of nine crimes committed to free the patients from their suffering with death.
But the results of the lab tests will reveal whether Vila was lying and actually chose a less cruel death for his first victims, or whether he burned them out from the inside by administering bleach to them, as he confessed to three women he murdered between October 12 and 17.
In La Caritat, one does not believe the nurse’s statements, not even in terms of the number of confessed murders, which could well be more. This attitude is justified by the fact that Vila had made very different statements in court and that it makes no sense to suddenly change his approach after eight successful murders.
They say they put them at the disposal of the judiciary for this reason and to clarify the scope of these incidents.
Threats of the European Central Bank (ECB)
Investors reacted sharply yesterday to the threat posed by ECB President Trichet, who warned that “the markets should not underestimate our responsiveness.”
The risk premiums of the euro-peripheral countries have risen dramatically and the shares of European banks have risen by more than 5%.
Nevertheless, we should not underestimate the possibility that the ECB may be mistaken and that the euro has hardly increased in points, which causes concern.
Yesterday’s events are typical of an illiquid market that is recovering to the extent that it collapses, but as a result of the closure of short and highly speculative positions.
The institutional investor will not lose his fear.
Today, a month ago, the European Central Bank called on us to reverse our liquidity measures, according to which the ECB will have to backtrack for the fourth time in two years tomorrow, and probably several times in the future.
The Bundesbank called for the termination of the plan to purchase sovereign debt, as these were ineffective, as well as the cancellation of all extraordinary temporary liquidity measures.
Following the Ireland crisis, we expect the current liquidity measures to be extended "at least until March" and to maintain quarterly calls for tenders with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity until at least June.
We also expect the bond purchase program to continue and give a strengthening signal.
If the expectations created are not met, the excellent response of yesterday’s markets will be thrown back, and if we are stubbornly insistent that we take back our liquidity measures, only God can help us!
Just as at the ECB meeting in May, where the bank reiterated that it would not consider buying government bonds and that markets would collapse, this story could be repeated tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May, she showed her teeth and on Wednesday, she said she had already bought a lot, provoking a new market collapse.
Yesterday, the auction of one-year state titles in Portugal was quite weak.
Government asset management spent only 500 million at 5.28%, compared to 750 million at 4.81% in the previous auction.
Nevertheless, interest rates in Portugal fell by 30 basis points throughout the curve, reflecting a change in perception of the markets according to Trichet.
In Ireland, the figures of the debt hole were published by Allied and Bank of Ireland.
The sum is estimated at around 10 000 million in the short term and a possible further 15 000. There is time until February to raise private capital or these banks will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has completely lost its credibility after not realizing the problem with the stress tests in July, the figures under the bailout plan are acceptable and help to reduce uncertainty.
However, the government will have to get parliamentary approval of its new budget next Tuesday, and as it still does not have sufficient support, Ireland continues to be a source of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel moderated her discourse on the summit of heads of state and government on 14 December, calling for political unity to show that we are playing the same score together.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the other countries want to play Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony.
The President of the Spanish Government presented yesterday the plan of action, which is to be adopted by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous regions such as financial institutions, reduction of the state deficit, liberalisation, privatisation and job creation measures that sound to the ears of investors like Vivaldi’s Four Seasons.
The double effect of Zapatero and Trichet explains why the Spanish stock market grew by 4.5 percent, twice as much as the rest of the European exchanges.
Compared to February, the response from the government and the Spanish central bank was quick and convincing, and we benefit from the surprise effect.
Today there is a major auction of a three-year government bond that will benefit from the Trichet effect, so we are relying on strong demand that will remove all doubts about our ability to reschedule.
For Spain, applying for an aid plan would be a self-sacrifice.
We would receive liquidity that we do not need. The Treasury has 40 billion euros at its disposal, three times as much as in March. Interest rates are extremely expensive and access to the markets would be closed without notice.
Nevertheless, our strategy should correspond to Caesar’s wife’s motto: “Now not only being, but also appearance, counts.”
Only courage, we can do that!
At the request of his children, the CEO of Owls challenges the general meeting of Vega Sicilia
The storm in the open conflict of the <0xC3><0x81>lvarez family, owners of the Eulen and El Enebro companies, is not going away.
David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez, founder of the company belt, will challenge the shareholders' meeting of El Enebro, which will take place on the 16th at the request of five of his seven children, considering them "absolutely void", his children will try to obtain a majority to control the administrative bodies of the company - owner of the winery Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez and his children Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s David and Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a José are preparing the legal measures for a new judicial chapter in their dispute over the control of part of the group of companies.
The founder of the largest holding company for business services does not seem willing to give in in his legal dispute over the control of the institutions of El Enebro.
He was expelled from the Board of Directors by five of his seven children, who became members of the Board of Directors at the shareholders’ meeting held on 18 January this year, which is already listed in the Commercial Register as being contested.
The shareholders’ meeting of El Enebro, convened by the judge of the Commercial Court No. 2 of Madrid for the 16th, has triggered a new thunderbolt in the lap of the <0xC3><0x81>lvarez family.
Invoking the judge to convene the meeting is the only legal way to ensure the convening of the general meeting.
The final strategy of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta y Elvira <0xC3><0x81>lvarez Mezquiriz is interpreted by David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez as a "desperate means of the applicants - his five children - to use legal sophistry, fraudulent machinations and abuse of rights to have the Assembly of 18 January annulled" as official speakers explain.
This argumentation is the basis for the subsequent challenge of the assembly to declare it "absolutely void".
The same protagonists, who are shrouded in discreet silence, already tried unsuccessfully in June to convene a meeting by judicial means.
At El Enebro – asset company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets – David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez’s seven children control 100 percent of the capital.
On the other hand, according to family protocols, the founder of the service group demands the right to use more than 51% of the capital.
That is the real background of the matter on which the judge has to decide in the hearing on the action for challenge, for which no date has yet been set.
Red Bull wins in F1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
The cars are improved with real-time software.
Ever since Red Bull entered the world of Formula One in 2004, its history in this exquisite universe of speed has been marked by surprises and successes.
In the beginning, nobody paid attention to the newcomer and despite his steeply rising career during the last seasons, in the final sprint last November, everyone was counting on the victory of the Ferrari of Fernando Alonso.
Without degrading the skills of the German driver and world champion Sebastian Vettel or the power of the Renault engine, the "secret weapon" that the Multi Siemens Red Bull put in its hands, and thus created a winning team, has become a legend.
In reality, it is a powerful process simulation software that the German company launched in 2007 for non-auto racing purposes.
This computer program, known as PLM, was used for the development of assembly chains in factories around the world, energy plants and high-precision instruments.
The aim is a faithful reproduction or simulation of a product or process before it is actually built in order to avoid errors and unnecessary costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon’s cameras, Sukhoi’s aircraft and Nissan’s most famous commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of the industry department at Siemens, explains that with the use of this software in the Formula 1 factory Red Bull "in a few hours, almost in real time" can design and execute the changes and improvements that are detected on the races and in the tests.
Russwurm states that in 1992, an average of ten technicians worked in the race stables, who could introduce a maximum of three or four improvements in a season.
Today, Red Bull’s team employs 180 highly qualified young people, who carry out analyses and make all kinds of changes to the race car with high-performance IT systems.
The Siemens manager explained that the PLM software is capable of analyzing and improving all components of Red Bull’s racing cars, with the exception of the engine for which Renault is solely responsible.
The materials, the fuel, the aerodynamics and the safety elements are changed.
Thanks to advanced production facilities and high-tech autoclaves, the changes can be transferred from the virtual reality of the simulator into reality within less than 24 hours.
The only limit set to this crazy technical perfectionism is the $40 million a Formula 1 team is allowed to spend on its races in a season.
Red Bull has built its high-tech factory for the development and manufacture of its racing cars in a location 50 kilometres from London.
These are two buildings in which visits - especially by journalists - are strongly restricted.
Everything that happens there is top secret.
The crew consists of 580 people, including the two pilots, the world champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
But Red Bull’s true Formula 1 hero is undoubtedly the newest world champion Sebastian Vetell.
Behind the enormous technological resources that the energy drink manufacturer places in the service of its participation on the race tracks, there are other protagonists, whose support is invaluable and whose fame equals zero.
The plant’s technologist, Steve Nevey, points out that five years ago, it was still possible to say that the progress in R&D for racing cars contributed with 50 percent to the victory and the pilots were responsible for the rest.

HP to Open 20 Own Stores with Local Distributors in Two Years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) inaugurated its first exclusive store in Barcelona yesterday in collaboration with its partner Ront Reyes.
It is the first of a sales network consisting of twenty stores, each with 80 to 100 square meters, which the Multi intends to open in Spain over the next two years.
The company agreed to this initiative with the existing 16 multi-brand sales areas, such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
H.P. Espa<0xC3><0xB1>a’s vice president, Helena Herrero, cited as an example the converted store on the Gran V<0xC3><0xAD>a in Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with which H.P. has been working for thirty years.
The North American group of companies intends to establish 200 points of sale in Europe by 2010, including 20 branches in Spain.
The first ones were inaugurated last week in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia). Barcelona is the third store.
Herrera did not want to reveal the upcoming new openings, but did not rule out that Madrid could be the next destination.
The vice chairman, who is also the head of HP Personal Systems, said that the philosophy of opening a store is always the same, relying on a local distributor with experience and industry knowledge.
The North American group of companies advises them and takes over the exclusive shop equipment (with interactive products to touch). In Europe, all shops will look the same.
HP is also responsible for training shop staff.
Helena Herrero said it is not a franchising system and emphasized that with the exclusive network of points of sale, it is intended to “optimize customer service and advice to small and micro-enterprises in purchasing and beyond, even packaging.”
The store in Barcelona has a pioneering pilot program that solves the technical problems of HP devices with warranty.
An online service establishes a connection to the technical headquarters in Maastricht (Holland).
“In this way, we can solve problems in ten minutes, sometimes taking up to two days.”
"This system was developed especially for small and micro enterprises as well as private customers, because the large companies already have their service contracts for technical customer service," Helena Herroro said yesterday.
Sabadell wants to 'steal' one million customers from its rival in three years
Banco Sabadell’s Executive Board member, Jaime Guardiola, is more optimistic than other managers, believing that 2001 will be a tough year for the banks, but initially dismisses a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the debt war.
Nevertheless, he foresees a slump in interest rates, which banks are trying to offset with increases in fees and loan prices.
Sabadell expects to capture one million private customers in three years - a subject that is still too existing.
Sabadell has found the way to make the most of the next three years, and thus to survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The bank will introduce a new three-year guidance plan in 2011.
The aim is not only to survive without taking advantage of public aid from the FROB, but also to increase the market share by one million private customers - 700,000 if one withdraws the customers that the bank will lose - this is the great challenge facing this bank, because until now it has paid more attention to its business customers than to its private customers.
This year it has attracted 250,000 private customers and 50,000 businesses.
Their market share among private customers is 3.5 percent, while business customers account for more than 10 percent.
Another principle of the business plan 2011-2013 is the increase in productivity, i.e. austerity, cost reduction. The challenges that the bank will face with this, it will present together with the annual financial statements report.
Few banks dare to set and publish targets in these difficult times, because the financial crisis has confused all the banks’ plans worldwide.
Sabadell will complete its four-year Optima roadmap this year, which was initially designed for three years, but has been extended for a fiscal year as a result of market conditions.
The customers who will leave the savings banks are the main goal of the bank.
At a breakfast organized by the APIE, Guardiola stressed that 2011 would be a "difficult" year "with a long reach".
The manager assumes that Spain will only "slowly" get out of the crisis.
In addition, it would be "very difficult" to "create work" in two or three years - fundamental to the survival of the banks.
Even if he assumes that the war on liabilities - which will punish interest margins - will fade, the risk premiums that banks and savings banks have to pay for their emissions to maintain liquidity will already be passed on to the price of loans as compensation for dwindling profit margins.
"The issues of liquidity and financing are structural in nature and they will put pressure on the loans."
"We didn't turn the faucet off, but the interest rate differentials are very high," Guardiola said.
Banesto already issued an order to its branch network on Thursday to restrict the allocation of long-term loans and to increase the interest rate differentials (see Cinco D<0xC3><0xAD>as of 22 and 27 November).
The manager also admitted that the banks were currently pursuing a policy of "increasing fees", but "within a competitive framework".
Sabadell’s roadmap is based on organic growth, even though the group, as always, does not exclude corporate businesses.
It is not without reason that he assures that in Spain "larger companies are necessary."
“In the coming year, everything will change,” he said.
He stresses that the demand for capital is currently “increasing enormously” and does not rule out the possibility that some Spanish financial institutions will slide into red.
He believes that the FROB can replace the money market in capital stockpiles.
After asserting that Sabadell could also survive a temporary closure of the markets, he refutes the argument of some bankers who are already predicting a new liquidity crisis.
He emphasizes that nothing can be circulated, but unlike the incidents in June, short-term financing via repo transactions can be achieved and thus the crisis can be mitigated.
CECA excludes a second wave of mergers between savings banks
The Director General of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday rejected the possibility of a wave of mergers between the savings banks and stressed the speed with which the industry is being restructured.
When the concentration process of the Spanish savings banks began, several savings banks insisted not to participate in the first phase, and they reserved the second round.
On the other hand, José Antonio Olavarrieta, Director General of the Spanish Savings Bank Association (CECA), assured that this second round would not take place.
"I believe that most of the mergers have been completed. The inclusion of Cajasol in the Banca C<0xC3><0xAD>vica group cannot be considered a second round, it was rather adjustments."
"Most of it is completed. We may have thirteen or fourteen instead of seven-toes, but all the important processes are already completed. They were controlled by Banco de Espa<0xC3><0xB1>a, which has strongly supported all the processes."
At a breakfast organized by the Association of Managing Directors and Managers of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarrieta stated that the concentration process was carried out "as quickly as possible and that we must be satisfied with the timely procedure that was established in former times, not now, within the framework of the business plans with Banco de Espa<0xC3><0xB1>a," he stressed.
"The transition from 45 savings banks with an average of 28 000 million assets to 17 with 75 500 million each is a historically incomparable process. The number of financial institutions has been reduced by 62 percent and they are now much larger, with which we have fulfilled the Basel Agreement," he stressed.
Olavarrieta explained that "there are a number of unsavory opinions about the slowness of the process, which revealed unsavoryness and nonsense", because "Banco de Espa<0xC3><0xB1>a exhorts us to conclude in due time before the end of the year."
The Director General of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured yesterday that Spain has one of the most rigorous financing systems in Europe and “perhaps” the whole world, adding that those who doubted it would do so “without deeper knowledge”.
The manager noted that in the current economic situation, we do not have to worry about the situation of financial institutions and savings banks, which have undergone a "very significant" concentration process, which will be carried out "as soon as possible".
He also recalled that Spanish banks had passed the stress tests the ECB conducted in July very well.
Zapatero and the Red Line of Germany
Berlin decided to keep the euro, but at the same time set conditions for the entire European Union.
Tensions in the markets have triggered a double response from the government.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Zapatero has presented new adjustment measures, starting with tax reductions for small and micro enterprises, the regulation of temporary employment companies or the cancellation of the €426 support for unemployed people who do not receive unemployment benefits, up to the privatization of 49 percent of AENA, the administration of Barajas and El Prat airports and 30 percent of the state lottery.
On the other hand, Deputy Prime Minister Elena Salgado, with the help of former President Felipe Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez, supports the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel as the person responsible for the current crisis.
How are these processes to be understood?
It should be assumed that Merkel’s position is not a mistake in her public relations work.
On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of redefining the euro.
In doing so, Germany takes a fundamentally new perspective on shaping our future, which collides with the maintenance of the traditional traditions of a large part of its partners.
In view of the resistance in Europe, people in Germany are beginning to speculate about three possible ways out of the crisis.
The first: A strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the South would have to leave the euro area.
The second: The reintroduction of the Deutsche Mark - although this currently sounds more like science fiction -, supported by a large part of the public opinion, about 50 percent of the population.
The third: a reshaping of the euro according to German proposals, which means more macroeconomic control; strict budgetary management; punishment of countries that exceed the requirements; possibly the suspension of payments of some countries, as well as the extension of the costs of potential adaptation measures to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been emerging for some time, so there are no excuses now.
First in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission created incentives for deficits and the German government pulled out of its sleeve a constitutional reform to prevent this from 2016.
This was the first sign of the divergence between what Germany considered necessary (strict tax plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France.
The second sign was set by the Central European country, as Merkel painfully pushed out the decision to rescue Greece.
But the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public opinion and the public opinion were absolutely opposed to a rescue of Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October, Merkel again comes out with a clear position, calling for a reform of the agreements of the European Union to enable the rescue of a country and at the same time to oblige private lenders to bear part of the costs.
This position was interpreted as anti-European, as it pushed forward the Irish crisis and everything else.
In the coming months, we will take part in the reform of the European Union, which will make these measures possible from 2013 onwards.
Germany has drawn a red line that it does not intend to cross.
It tells everyone that - even if unpopular measures now have to be taken - from this date the old functioning of the euro will no longer exist.
2013 will be the year of birth of a new currency area in which the infringing countries can be severely punished, forced to declare themselves insolvent, and in this case the private sector has to bear part of the costs.
Germany shows us that we have to pursue a hard growth course, with high savings and investment rates, moderation of consumption, improvement of productivity and competitiveness as well as positive external economic balances.
The other alternative, which is based on debt and construction with huge holes in the balance of payments, as it was led by Spain in boom times, will simply not be accepted.
The offer is clear.
And we would do badly not to understand it.
It is not just a question of reducing the state deficit to three percent by 2013.
The demands are much tougher.
And the worst thing we could do under these conditions is cheat ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will pass more calmly.
And that we will take advantage of the opportunities we are offered by spring 2013.
Zapatero seems to have understood this, and his double announcement (the promised reforms after the meeting with the big companies last Saturday and the announcement of new measures from yesterday) indicates that despite the criticism of Merkel, the hypothesis of creating order in her own home has prepared its way.
But the red line drawn by Germany is there, and it doesn’t look like it would change anything.
Among the possibilities under consideration, we cannot rule out the fact that we would have to leave the euro area, which is full of less serious countries.
In this case, Germany could still tell us that it had warned us.
Sport and rule circumvention
Tricks like those of Alonso and Ramos in the game against the Ajax show inventiveness, but not the will to circumvent a sanction.
The expulsion of two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the match against Ajax in the Champions League on 23 November resulted in a lot of ink being shed over whether it was an unsportsmanlike act or not and whether both players should possibly be sanctioned by UEFA.
As is well known, the two players lost time a few minutes before the end of the game (their team had already clearly won) and played several fouls so that the referee showed them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since the Real Madrid would lead his group, the two players will meet the prescribed sanction at the next league game against the Auxerre and thus enter the next phase of the game without cards.
Finally, the UEFA disciplinary committee punished the club's coach, José Mourinho, with two games and the players involved with different amounts of money.
The provocation of a yellow card under such or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is rather common in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos – the unwritten rules followed in this sport.
Part of the debate surrounding the case that emerged stems from the fact that a team from the Real Madrid football club (who pretended to be noble and honored in his anthem and on other occasions punished his players for similar incidents) played the lead role, and the dramatization by Mourinho, who added an episode more to his long history as a theatrical and provocative technician.
In any case, the debate is about whether this behaviour, which is expressly prohibited by the statutes, does not contradict the principles of sport, that is, whether these actions constitute a rule circumvention.
In this matter, the damage caused to the sports spirit should be investigated.
The sportsmanship defends the physical integrity of the opponents, an aspect that was not endangered by these actions, because it was not an aggressive game.
Another aspect of a clean game is to prevent the offending players from drawing an unjustified benefit from the opposing team, which did not happen either.
The paradox of the action of the players of Real Madrid is that it does not correspond to what we usually mean by foul play or rule circumvention, because the circumvention of the rule was not carried out secretly to avoid a sanction, but it should be as conspicuous as possible so that it is punished by the referee.
The players waited and happily accepted the sanction.
Another question is what kind of advantage the offenders drew from the intentional fouls.
It should be emphasized here that the rival was neither placed in a more unfavorable position nor required advantages for the game played, because the obvious result of this action was that the own team had to continue to play with fewer players.
It is also not a useful strategy for the next game, because the club then does not have these players.
The advantage is obviously that players start the next phase of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future game.
But it’s a long-term, up to a certain degree uncertain advantage, as the team could eventually drop out, as well as giving players a sanction and moving into the second card cycle, where they drop out less than in the first cycle due to card aggregation.
It is not clear whether this is really an advantage.
Ultimately, such practices are not directed against the spirit of sport, which also includes strategic decisions in order to derive the greatest possible benefit from the regulations.
In this case, the players did not want to circumvent a sanction (that would actually be a clear case of rule circumvention), they wanted to rather choose when to submit to it.
They made a strategic decision without resorting to punishment or fleeing it.
Although the boundary between inventiveness and control environment is blurred, I believe that this matter is a clear case of inventiveness.
I have the impression that the polemic arose as a result of two factors: because it was about two self-exclusions and because of the nature of the provoked rule transmission.
The damage done to the principles of sport by these acts is less ethical than aesthetic.
Offer offensive to catch customers for group Christmas dinner in Barcelona
The dictatorship of the calendar this year drops an avalanche of reservations to days 16 and 17 December.
The celebrations paid for by employees themselves spread. They do not want to spend more than 20 to 30 euros.
Like the Turr<0xC3><0xB3>n and the Christmas lottery, there are also group dinners during the pre-Christmas period that provide oxygen to the restaurant and leisure industry in Barcelona. But as a result of the economic crisis, they trigger a price offensive to capture the customer segment, which is the large mass: almost all want to spend between 20 and 30 euros for a lunch or dinner, according to the surveyed entrepreneurs and associations.
To make accounting even more complicated, the calendar (New Year’s Eve falls on a Friday) dropped all orders in the week of December 13, resulting in an avalanche of reservations of dinners on two peak days (the 16th and 17th) and almost no orders the week before.
Since 2008, when the bad times began, many companies have discontinued group dinners for household reasons.
In order not to have to give up this tradition, many employees pay for it out of their own pocket.
Whatever the economic situation, low prices are being demanded, says Gaiet<0xC3><0xA0> Farr<0xC3><0xA0>s, chairman of the Barcelona restaurant board.
The representative of the umbrella organization does not dare to predict what the holidays will look like this month.
“People think about it a hundred times before they make a reservation.”
“They want to go out, but they pay a lot of attention to prices,” he emphasizes.
The business will go well for those who "offer quality at good prices with good service," he adds, reminding us that customers save in times of crisis, which is why prices around 25 euros are the most in demand.
In a survey in various centrally located restaurants, it turns out that the evening of December 17 leads the providers to collapse.
The group Soteras says the demand for this Friday, with the intention of spending less than 30 euros, would boom. The group has adapted its menus with complete offers between 25 and 35 euros to the economic situation.
At another leading group, Andilana, which maintains 16 restaurants in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar has led to early reservations, even from the beginning of November.
"We have made the impossible possible to maintain the previous year's prices with menus for every taste from 19.95 to 30 euros," he explains.
At AN Grup, which manages El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 restaurants, one does not lose the optimism, since since the second quarter the revenues are again flourishing and good, albeit on a few days concentrated prospects for the Christmas business is expected.
The Group’s sources point out that the 18th will also be an overactive day with groups of friends celebrating Christmas.
In addition to the six group menus, a Christmas menu has been added for 30 euros or more as a price hit, giving the impression that customers are willing to spend 10 percent more than in the previous year and in return want more details, such as cava.
Also in some companies you can see green sprouts sprouting, which is why the employees are invited again. This gives the impression that the group dinners are on the upswing again.
From the side of the umbrella association Fecasarm (with associations such as the Bar, Restaurant and Leisure Association of Barcelona), the vice-chairman, Enric Gom<0xC3><0xA0>, trusts to see the end of the tunnel and notes that the reservations overall are quite "vivid", although the customers "beat out a maximum".
However, the fun of celebrating has not diminished, no matter who pays.
Pakistan’s nuclear program raises major concerns in the US
Islamabad is producing nuclear weapons “faster than any other country.”
WikiLeaks revelations confirm ties between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the North American Embassy in Pakistan and the US State Department, revealed by the Wikileaks internet portal, confirms the enormous concern of the Pakistani nuclear program Washington.
On the sidelines of the clarifying and juicy details offered by the documents on the content of the talks and the mindset of accredited North American diplomats in Islamabad, they reveal that cooperation between the two countries on nuclear security is not being strengthened, but on the contrary is “declining,” and that the unstable Asian country is producing more nuclear weapons “to a faster rhythm than any other country.”
In particular, the peculiarity of Pakistan’s nuclear program – that the weapons are not assembled, but their individual parts are stored in order to make their destruction more difficult in a possible attack – prepare Washington sleepless nights.
The following risks include the Ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, in a report prior to the visit of former head of the National Security Council, James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear facilities to the area attacked by the Taliban, the suspected dispersion of nuclear material and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear material".
The large number of people implicated in the nuclear arsenals and missile programs is no longer seen by the US only, but also by Russia as an exuberant and reason to exercise caution.
“Pakistan needs to hire strictly religious personnel to guard the nuclear facilities; because of the low educational and cultural level, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who are involved in nuclear or missile programs,” said Yuri Korolev, a Russian foreign ministry expert, in a meeting with his North American counterparts.
New to the documentary revealed by Julian Assange’s internet portal is that US-Pakistan cooperation on nuclear proliferation is waning and Pakistan’s increased pace of nuclear weapons manufacturing.
In May, an embassy office describing communication with Pakistan as “frosting” said: “There is often no transparency; we don’t get answers to offers of assistance or they are rejected.”
In another communication, Peter Lavoy, a state intelligence official for South Asia, confirms that “despite the economic catastrophe, Pakistan is producing nuclear weapons faster than any other country.”
Ambassador Patterson asks Washington, during a visit by the Chief of Army Staff, General Ashfaq Kayani, to “clarify” to the person in charge that “Pakistan’s army has to cease its tacit support of terrorist groups.”
On the hunt for WikiLeaks boss
Obama appoints a high-ranking official for the anti-terrorism campaign to prevent new revelations.
Interpol issued a red alert to the persecution and discovery of Assange.
Everything related to WikiLeaks and its founder, Julian Assange, forms a complicated labyrinth in which the facts are difficult to clarify.
Yesterday, Interpol issued a "red warning" about the "finding and persecution" of Assange.
However, this is not a traditional arrest warrant.
It’s not new, it’s dated November 20.
It also has nothing to do with the latest revelation of over four million diplomatic documents from the US, but with the allegations of sexual abuse that the Australian has to face in Sweden.
The WikiLeaks founder’s lawyer, Mark Stephens, said the police “know where and how to contact Mr. Assange.”
Already on the 20th, the international police authority based in Lyon (France) issued the order at the request of Sweden, but it was not announced until yesterday after receiving the authority by the Swedish authorities.
The 188 Interpol countries are instructed to identify and locate Assange "in order to provisionally arrest and extradite him."
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red alert, according to the organization, many member states consider the red alert to be a carte blanche for an arrest — which must be carried out by the national police — especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case of Sweden and England, where Assange is believed to be present.
The move outraged Assange’s lawyers, who yesterday published a letter informing them that the 39-year-old founder of Wikileaks is ready to answer Swedish authorities’ questions via video conference.
They also remind that Assange applied for leave from Sweden and received the appropriate approval from the prosecutor, who is compared to the fabled Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, Stalin’s security chief.
“This is like a hunt, not a legal prosecution,” the letter said.
While the world is looking for him – and his mother from Australia asserts her son’s innocence – Assange is in an unknown place, but not in silence.
On Monday, he gave an interview to Time magazine’s head via Skype from an unspecified location, requesting the resignation of US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
“If it can be proven that she was responsible for ordering North American diplomats to spy on the UN and thus violate international agreements signed by the US, she would have to resign,” he said.
His opinion was condemned yesterday by White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, who described the request for resignation as "ridiculous and absurd."
“I’m not sure why we should value the opinion of a guy with a website,” he told CNN.
Obama himself has tasked a senior anti-terrorism campaigner, Rusell Travers, with preventing new document disclosures.
President Barack Obama’s attempt to pay less attention to Assange contrasts with the views expressed by conservative politicians and commentators these days.
Congressman Peter King, who will chair the National Security Committee of the House of Representatives from January, has called on the State Department to investigate the possibility of putting Wikileaks on the list of terrorist organizations "to confiscate their funds and prosecute anyone who supports them or makes a contribution."
Tom Flanagan, adviser to Canadian President Stephen Harper, had gone even further, and he had to retract his statement that Assange must be “murdered.”
"Obama would have to turn it into a target and use an unmanned plane or something."
Those who did not apologize were Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas, and possible presidential candidate.
“Whoever leaked information to the government is guilty of treason and anything that is not an execution is a lenient punishment,” he told Fox.
Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s looks for peace in the ERC with a wink to the Carod
The Republican leader allows the party a secret vote on its continued existence in office.
Huguet proposes a more pluralistic government and the end of the Assembly principle.
Joan Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s seems to have found a recipe to avoid, for the 10th time, an internal turmoil in the ranks of the ERC, which has lost 11 MEPs and half of the vote.
The party leader is aware that his threat of resignation is not enough for those close to former party leader Josep Llu<0xC3><0xAD>s Carod-Rovira, but he also knows that the influence of this sector today is as weakened as her mentor himself and will not give him the same headaches as other former currents.
Therefore, the leader of Esquerra tries with a wink to win over the new critics, which would secure his position until the next local elections.
For starters, yesterday announced that the more than 200 regional council members of ERC could secretly comment on his remaining in office.
With ballot papers, not with an upscale hand.
If the Carodists wanted to give the President a ticket, they could do so without fear of reprisals.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid both the impression of division and that of submission to his person.
In several interviews, he affirmed that he would feel unconfirmed by half the votes plus one, and he added without specifying percentages, a result "in the Bulgarian style" would not be good either.
Carod’s supporters are demanding more from the president than just putting his office at the disposal of the party, an inadequate gesture, as Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s controls the supreme organ of the congresses.
But since they do not have a sufficient majority to force resignations, they will agree with the board a plan of action from now until May.
To this end, they expect to be able to participate in the preparation of the document on strategic reorientation, which the management will put to the Council for a vote on 18.
Their intention is to vouch for Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s, who, in return, promises to bring the Congress forward to the autumn of 2011, which the party leadership already considers to be a fact.
The party leader of the ERC believes that "polyphony" is detrimental to stability and once and for all strives to enable the organization to wash its dirty laundry behind closed doors.
In this sense, the article signed by acting Conseller Josep Huguet in his blog is symptomatic.
Given that Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s is an ideologue, the owner of Innovaci<0xC3><0xB3> considered it a fact that the party leader was supported "in exchange for different goals".
He counted five, two of which are in the foreground.
First, the "restructuring" of the board so that it represents at least 90 percent of the party members, that is, the inclusion of new faces from Carod's environment.
The second could be the big news.
Huguet suggests that ERC should finally abandon the assembly principle as a way of functioning.
In doing so, he advocates a reform of the statutes, which should make it possible to hold congresses with elected delegates.
Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s' team, who fought for it at the last two congresses, is obsessed with ending the Plenary Assembly model - an exception in the Spanish party system.
In fact, at the trembling assembly of 2008, the leadership of the party was tasked with reviewing the general assembly principle at a congress that was to deal with the reform of the statutes.
This date is still pending, as infogle's approach to this matter was not advisable due to the internal turmoil of recent years.
Now, without critical sectors lurking, the time may have come to take up this issue again and conclude it forever.
23 Killed in November, 290 in 2010
According to the MILENIO census, four fewer cases were recorded in México than in 2010.
In November, 23 people were murdered in México, according to MILENIO México, four fewer than in the previous month.
Among the murdered are three women and the discovery of two amputated bodies in the Valley of Mexico.
In the penultimate month of the year, we come to a total of 390 deaths, which are probably related to organized crime.
Among the cases, one stands out in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitl<0xC3><0xA1>n, a town in Toluca.
The subject had at least three shots fired by firearms, the Grace shot was delivered to his head, and feet and hands were tied with a cable.
The next day, the body of a person was found in the trunk of a vehicle parked on the Mixtecas street in the Santa Cruz Acatl<0xC3><0xA1>n settlement of the municipality of Naucalpan.
On Thursday, the 4th, early in the morning, agricultural workers found a body with traces of torture and at least three fatal injuries in the chest on the Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal highway on the section that crosses the village of Villa Guerrero.
In addition to the body, a message, presumably signed by the criminal organization La Familia Michoacana, was found.
A day later, a 50-year-old man was murdered with eight shots after leaving his house to do his job as a garbage driver.
On November 7th, two 30-year-olds died as a result of shootings in the head in the San Pedro Xaloxtoc settlement of the village of Ecatepec.
In Chalcro, the body of a man with the gunshot wound in his forehead was found on a lonely road in the settlement of El Naranjo and under the body a shell shell shelled with a firearm of the caliber.
In Ecatepec, parts of a human body were discovered in the sewer of the settlement of Playa Golondrina.
The emergency services searched for the rest of the body parts, but did not find them.
Residents of Tepotzotl<0xC3><0xA1>n reported the discovery of a body they had discovered in the area of Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Colorada. The hands were tied backwards and the head was tied.
The man had a wound that came from the shot of a firearm in the neck.
In the middle of the month, reports were made of the murder of two men, wrapped in blankets and discovered in the trunk of a vehicle parked on the streets of Villas de la Hacienda in the municipality of Tizap<0xC3><0xA1>n de Zaragoza.
A day later, a human head was found in a cardboard box in the Valle de los Reyes settlement in Los Reyes La Paz.
In a nearby settlement, the remaining body was found in a black plastic bag with a message signed by El Incorregible.
On the 17th, two women were found dead in the Zoquiapan settlement of the municipality of Ixtapaluca, and the next morning, in Huixquilucan, the body of a man wrapped in a yellow-blue blanket, who, according to the news that his killers left next to him, was probably named Mario R<0xC3><0xAD>os.
In the settlement of San Francisco Acuautla of Ixtapaluca, the lifeless body of a woman was found with shots of firearms in the neck.
On the skin of the woman, tattoos of Santa Muerte as well as chains with corresponding illustrations were discovered.
In the last half of the month, in the municipality of Zinacantepec, in addition to a vehicle, the body of a man with at least three shots and a message signed by a criminal group was found.
Two days later, the bodies of two men whose heads were covered with tape and a message were discovered in the municipality of Puente de Piedra in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
Opposite the body was a message, presumably signed by a criminal organization, that said, "This happens to those who don't participate."
In Ecatepec, two bodies tied to hands and feet were found with traces of torture inside a taxi parked behind the judicial center of the settlement of San Agust<0xC3><0xAD>n.
On the last day of the month, the bodies of two men were discovered in the communities of Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualc<0xC3><0xB3>yotl.
The first had been beheaded in the village of Cuchilla Anc<0xC3><0xB3>n and had been tied up in black plastic bags, and the second had been tortured and found in a plastic bag in the streets of the village of Ju<0xC3><0xA1>rez.
Next to him, the police found a cardboard with a message.
China maintains its targets to reduce greenhouse gases
The representative of China said at COP16 that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce carbon footprints and it would maintain its offer to reduce 40 to 45 percent of its greenhouse gases by 2020.
China keeps its offer to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, Su Wei, the country’s representative at COP16, assures.
At his first public appearance at the 16th United Nations Climate Change Summit (COP16), Su Wei assured that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce carbon footprints and transform its industry.
He said his country has invested $245 million over the last four years to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
On the other hand, he stated that China would not change its goals, but would work together with the international community on this matter.
He explained that the Chinese strategy on climate change is divided into four aspects: dialogue, capacity building, institution building and support for pilot programmes.
Progress has been made in all aspects, including the adoption of a new energy law last year that includes the goals of reducing gas emissions, he said.
On the other hand, he pointed out that in China, the state authorities had worked with those of the central state and the municipalities to achieve the goals of energy saving, an effective use of energy and the reduction of emissions.
In addition, he said, several multi-year plans have already been initiated or completed, both those funded by the Chinese government and those receiving funds from other countries.
For example, he referred to the Effective Use of Energy programme, which was introduced over the last five years and had received investment from the United Nations (UN), government and private hands.
It is also running a provincial-level project on climate change, another on replacing traditional light bulbs with energy-saving bulbs, and another on mitigation and adaptation, he explained.
Martin Krol, a scientific adviser on climate change in this country, confirmed that China’s efforts were far greater than was commonly assumed.
He showed that the per capita emissions of greenhouse gases in China are six tons per person, while in the United States it is 100 tons. China is responsible for a nine percent total contribution to pollution.
Energy efficiency has increased by 20 percent in the last five years, and another is expected to be achieved by 2020, he said.
Legal exclusion Espinos: César Nava
The national leader of the PAN stated that the former Panist Party leader had the right to turn to the National Order Commission and demand what the right granted him.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava V<0xC3><0xA1>zquez, assured that the exclusion of Manuel Espino Barriento was right and that the former party leader of the PAN had the right to turn to the National Order Commission and demand what the right would grant him.
In an interview that took place prior to Gabino Cué Monteagudo’s filing as governor of the state, he stated that the exclusion of Espino was a decision taken at the local level.
"It is an independent decision of the Ordnungskommission in Sonora."
"Mr. Espino has the right in his case to appeal to the Comisi<0xC3><0xB3>n de Orden del Consejo Nacional, so that a decision is taken by a competent body," he added.
On the other hand, he said, it was not the time to think about 2012 and that an alliance with the presidential candidates had never been at the negotiating table.
Nava V<0xC3><0xA1>zquez was convinced that Acci<0xC3><0xB3>n Nacional would emerge stronger from the internal vote next December 4 and 5, at which his successor will be elected.
"That (an alliance in 2012) is a topic that was never on the negotiating table, at least not until now. It was a proposal for the municipal election, it was successful and fulfilled its purpose," he said.
The Panist leader explained that the PAN looks back on 71 years of dialogue, so "internal competition does not scare us; on the contrary, "we enjoy it and it strengthens us," he commented.
He said that the Council would undoubtedly choose the best chairperson that Acci<0xC3><0xB3>n Nacional needs for the next three years, so he would hand over the relays "to whoever the Council would decide."
"I am very unconcerned and open and I would be proud to give each of the five the office of party chairman."
He predicted that the party’s upswing recorded in the last elections of July 4 would be reflected in the next elections, though “it’s not time to think about 2012.”
"Now it's a matter of supporting Governor Gabino Cué in his task."
In this regard, he stressed that the three governments that emerged from alliances between Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa would carry the flag and be observed throughout the country, which is why "many hopes and aspirations are placed in them and I am sure Gabino is up to the mark."
When asked about the PRI’s criticism of President Felipe Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n for his disc course during his four-year reign, César Nava called on supporters of the PRI to reflect on the six-year period of former Presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI believes that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n, they should start defending them should they finally come out of the closet," he said.
He is of the opinion that the owner of the federal government can make expressions like those in his discourse in the Auditorio Nacional, because in this country there is no oral ban and even less censorship.
Obama pushes for undocumented students on Twitter
“If you’re in favor of passing the Dream Act, call your senators and push for this bill to be passed,” tweeted the president of the United States on the popular social network.
President Barack Obama today supported the nationwide mobilization in support of the Dream Act - Law to legalize undocumented students with a message on his personal blog on the social network Twitter.
"If you're in favor of passing the Dream Act, call your senators and push for the passing of this law," Obama tweeted.
His brief contains a cyberlink to a more extensive document that calls on the public to engage with their senators, subtly, as the bill’s vote is imminent.
"With your voice we are waiting for, the time has come to listen to you," he emphasizes.
The news was spread after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block all vote for any law except the extension of Bush-era tax cuts and government funding.
Such a blockade, announced on a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote on the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START agreement with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Asked about the Republicans’ blockade of the Dream Act and other projects, presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs said he trusts that once the tax issue is resolved, a timetable can be drawn up for the remaining projects.
"I think we still have a lot of time..."
"We all agree that the tax issue must be settled before the end of the year..."
"I believe that we can make an agreement on this at any time and then we can plan the rest of the process," he said.
Senate Democratic Majority Leader Harry Reid announced Tuesday that he would request the vote at the end of the debate so that the Dream Act, which would allow the initiative to legalize undocumented students to be voted on in the Senate as of next Thursday, although the next week would be more likely.
The version of the Dream Act, or the law of the American Dream, would legalize about 800,000 young people who immigrated to the United States when they were under sixteen years old, have lived in that country for the past five years and are enrolled in a higher education institution or in the army.
But the advocates of the bill need sixty votes to pass the initiative, which is why they are dependent on the votes of a handful of Republicans. Currently, the organizations of the advocates of this project are organizing an intensive influence on the passing of the law.
The Democrats, the majority of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, one of them, Nebraska Senator Ben Nelson, said he would vote against it, and only one Republican, Richard Lugar of Indiana, has announced his support for the law.
That’s why the defenders of the Dream Act need to get several Republicans on their side if other Democrats decide to turn their backs on the initiative.
Among the most wooed Republicans are those from Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as Senator George Lemieux from Florida, who took over the mandate of Senator Mel Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez.
Other Republicans who have supported the Dream Act in the past include Orrin Hatch of Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson of Texas, but they said they would no longer support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who voted for the bill, John McCain, has not yet established his stance.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the Dream Act faces the biggest obstacles in the Senate.
Put your finger in the wound with literature
The second round of 'The Lust for Language' was a walk in which the participants campaigned for the narrative
"I understand that with sex in the language, but... the finger in the wound? What is expected of me?" asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela, who was to open the second round of 'Los placeres de la lengua', a cycle that celebrated Spanish-language literature and on this occasion used the subtitle of her question (at another event, the round table was dedicated to sex in the language, she explained).
The finger in the wound... "brings us into trouble", the Argentinean writer sweetly spat out to the audience, which was mainly composed of young people who came together at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara (FIL) to attend this round table moderated by Marisol Shultz, at which Valenzuela, Sergio Ram<0xC3><0xAD>rez, Mayra Montero and Luis Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a took part.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio and then characterized Shultz as a great story. Luisa tells in the first person and is the protagonist, who is looking to learn what a "wound" is, and goes from doctor to doctor, from which she receives no answer, but hints for the guide of her story.
She leaves the infectologist convinced: "Patience is not my strength, maybe that is my wound."
Finally, after a frustrating approach to the traumatologist, who took her breath away in the middle of the walk, but who explains to her that wound is not a scientific term, the psychoanalyst reveals the secret: "the wound is the really open, the symbolic is the scar."
The main character of the story sighs with relief and concludes that she "only learned from the wound that it is really open and does not exist", but she is convinced that the pleasure of language and its traps mix.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both of them.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ram<0xC3><0xAD>rez also presented a delightful tale, which he called 'Praise of Invention', in which the finger in the wound is not mentioned, but is discovered.
With allusions to magical realism, he tells of a famous sorceress who touched the clouds, brought back men who had travelled far, or restored the virtue lost to a girl. The story took a turn and told of America, the great novel that from the beginning was not lacking in its own chroniclers, and he quoted Bernal D<0xC3><0xAD>az del Castillo, who criticized the abundance of the conquerors.
"Cervantes, who invited us all (the writers), mocked the pretended witnesses who appeared in the stories portrayed as true, but otherwise the story of America would never have been told - with imagination that even the sense of shame was lost."
However, he emphasizes, "it is the mad and liars who imagine things best", and there reality and lie approach each other, where one no longer knows to which side the narrative belongs, where fictional literature reaches the summit.
This is called the Cervantes tradition.
"From him we have inherited to be what is told."
When it was Mayra Montero’s turn, the writer commented on and praised the variety of interpretations that the FIL’s invitation to the Round Table ‘The Finger in the Wound’ had contributed to.
The Cuban and Puerto Rican woman dedicated her contribution to the great wound of social violence that afflicts her country - like all of Latin America - as a result of the struggles over the drug trade.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a tacit, not deliberately planned commitment," she explained after highlighting that literature is communication and commitment that builds up between the author and the readers as in a "chemical reaction."
The evening was decided by the Spanish poet Luis Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a Montero, whose contribution was also "that finger of the committed writer in the wound of the writer".
He noted that in a fast-paced world, intellectual habits and the control of consciousness also result in dogmatisms, forgetting that “behind every affirmation there is a small ‘no’ and behind every denial there is a small ‘yes.’”
"To be in possession of our thoughts and reality, we must nuance: And nuance often means putting a finger in the wound and harassing those who feel much more comfortable when they think in the form of caricatures, in black and white, in prefabricated ideas without nuances, and also to harass the powerful, who prefer to lure the world into black and make sense of it.
Romano fights for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in finals, he has experienced ups and downs in his career, but he played decisive games three times.
In the duel between Santos Laguna and Monterrey at the final, two different styles are also set by their respective coaches, and their encounter, characterized by contrasts, is reflected in the results.
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in finals, he has experienced ups and downs in his career, but he has had decisive games three times, and so far he has held well, which is why this opportunity is of particular importance to him.
The Argentinian became the second champion with the medal, he was one step behind the winners and amazingly, he played consecutive finals with the same team.
The santist strategist reached the first final as coach at the 'Torneo Apertura 2002', when del Morelia had the reins in his hand, with which he suffered a big defeat against Toluca with 4-2; later, at the 'Clausura 2003' he reached the decisive duel, which he also lost 3-1 against Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna on the 'Torneo Bicentenario 2010', where they played against Los Diablos, Rubén had to take a setback again, because the game with 2-2 against Los Choriceros went out in a draw after 210 minutes of play, but in the penalty, he came forward with 3-1 and got two ways to take his title, but ultimately missed three of his players to a game of eleven.
Rubén had already lost two finals with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his great rival, so he does not want to be chased by misfortune again and free himself from the evil spell to celebrate a title for the first time, although he affirms that for him the most important thing is the game itself.
"I want to be a champion, I don't want to break statistics, that's for a club, for my affection, that's why the title will come to me, but what happens before that is the most important thing," commented the helmsman when asked about the lost finals.
"The only lesson we can learn from it is that until the referee doesn't whistle the end, we can't celebrate, we're on the line prepared, the players too, because the last time we were prepared with two penalties, we were ready to leave, and I think that's one lesson, until the game is not over, there's no celebration."
Knowing that this series could be decided by penalty shootout, does not worry him, because he trusts his players: "You never want to arrive at the penalty shootout, you want to finish in the regular season, but sometimes there is no alternative and you have to be prepared for it, in the previous tour we were prepared, but unfortunately, behind us it was a bad game, sometimes as a result of nervousness and hope we will come to the end, something in the title already in the game.
It’s in Romanso’s power to no longer be only second champion and to taste the glory that the titles bring with them for the first time.
The U.S. Changes the Rules for Obtaining a Visa
Before their meeting with the consulate, the persons must present themselves to the service points for visa application; costs will be reduced in this way.
As of January 10, 2011, the procedures for applying for a visa at the United States Embassy and Consulates will change.
Under the new procedure, most applicants have to present themselves to the Visa Application Services (ASC) before speaking at the consulate.
The personnel of the ASC shall record the biometric data of the applicant, which shall be verified by the consulate prior to the interview.
The new procedure has certain advantages for the aspirants, including:
The total cost of processing the visa is reduced because it is no longer necessary to pay separately for the appointment, processing of the visa application and the transport service with which the document is handed out.
The applicant shall make only one payment covering the three services.
The current price remains unchanged: the counter-value to 140 dollars for a tourist visa, 150 dollars for visas with application (including visas for temporary workers) and 390 dollars for hands and investors.
Those who just want to extend their visa do not need to have a conversation in the consulate, they just need to introduce themselves to the nearest ASC, where they will present their documents and their fingerprints will be taken.
As the biometric data is obtained in the ASC, applicants who need a second appointment to speak at the consulate stay there less time than before.
Those who apply for the visa in the consulates of Ciudad Ju<0xC3><0xA1>rez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo no longer have to pay the service surcharge of 26 dollars.
Additional information on the new visa application process can be found on the following website: http://mexico.usembassy.gov/boletines/sp101201_Visas-FAQs.html
NASA Announces Discovery of Extraterrestrial Life
The North American space agency called a press conference to present a find tomorrow that will have an impact on the search for living things in space.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) of the United States announces tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery that could confirm the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The find will be presented tomorrow at 1 p.m. at a press conference at NASA headquarters in Washington, D.C., by astrobiology experts, a science that examines the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the universe.
In convening the press conference, NASA assured that it would present “a supervisory finding for the search for extraterrestrial life,” sparking speculation among experts from other countries.
The discovery could prove the theory that human-like creatures could exist in hostile environments that were previously thought to be uninhabitable, and it has been hypothesized that they could transform into intelligent living beings – just like humans – if their living conditions improved.
It appears to be a microbe found at the bottom of Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, where it lives in an environment that was considered too toxic for all life forms because the lake is highly arsenic.
In some way, the microbie uses arsenic as a survival resource, and taking this ability into account, it increases the chances that there could be similar life on other planets that do not have our protective atmosphere.
When these organisms metabolize arsenic, according to astrobiologists, it is proven that “there is actually another life form, a second life form, which is different from what we know.”
The space agency will announce the actual reach of its find at the press conference tomorrow, Thursday.
The conference will be attended by geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars, and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who studies Titan (Saturn’s largest moon) to see if its chemical composition is similar to that of Earth.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergencia and Patr<0xC3><0xB3>n form an opposition bloc
With the reform of the organ law on the Congress, the two-party system will be introduced, they complain.
The 60th legislature had just begun, and an opposition bloc, led by the deputies of the PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s Manuel Patr<0xC3><0xB3>n Montalvo, who presented himself as an independent, was already in place. The four questioned the entry of the 'two-party system' into the chamber.
Before the start of the introductory session in the 60th legislative period, Felipe Manzanarez Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez of Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo of the PRD and Patr<0xC3><0xB3>n Montalvo protested against the reform of the Organic Law, as this would exclude them.
With this reform, they repeated, a “two-party system” would be introduced, because now it would be two people, the same number as parties that controlled Congress.
These four deputies, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones to vote against the presidium headed by the panist Salvador L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Brito and Luis Antonio C<0xC3><0xA1>rdenas Fonseca in his capacity as vice-chairman.
Corvera Quevedo explained that the PRI and PAN parties had institutionally introduced their political fringes with these reforms.
He said that in the next few days they would speak with the representatives of PAN and PRI to change the scheme, based on their political will and if they did not have it, they would be subjugated by both parties, putting an end to the opposition coalition.
"Up to this point I (the opposition coalition) come, that is what I see, because we are excluded from all decisions, they do not even consider to take into account the opinion of the rest."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez of Convergencia declared that there were similarities with PRD, PT and Patr<0xC3><0xB3>n and that therefore a pluralistic group would be formed.
It cannot be allowed, he went on to say, that Congress, after being monopolistic, is now to be “duo-polistic.”
"It is not the spirit of law reform that an eternal two-party system should prevail in Congress."
"For starters, this group starts with five MEPs and they talk to other colleagues so that they become more," Convergencia said in a statement.
PT’s Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, alluding to PAN and PRI, said that Congress had now turned into a “prey” for two.
"Before it was only one party, now they split it up into two."
Patr<0xC3><0xB3>n Montalvo asked that the deputies be respected and assigned their place at the negotiating tables.
"It must not be left out due to top decisions five, which will probably be nine MEPs. The five, which are currently seen as split into different factions, have decided to unite to take our place at the negotiating table, because due to him reform, which has been carried out and agreed by the others, we have stayed outside and we do not agree with this reform."
200 000 pesos more for "the supplier"
The Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n City Council is paying another check to the controversial owner of the company for electrical equipment.
Another check for just over 200,000 pesos in favour of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the city administration.
This means that the sum paid in the second half of the year to the owner of the company for electrical material amounts to 1 200 000 pesos.
According to the page for more transparency of the city administration, this check was issued last November 16 with the purpose of "billing open invoices" issued to an amount of 200,144.56 peso with the number 9258447.
The treasurer, Luis Miguel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Moreno, had already said that more money would go from the municipality to this supplier, who is being watched by the Auditor<0xC3><0xAD>a Superior del Estado for selling it at inflated prices.
What has not been mentioned is the total amount still owed to her and, as a result, the number of checks still issued in favour of Camacho Palazuelos.
“Nothing was bought from her, they just pay the debt, just like the other suppliers,” he said in an interview.
The last checks "appeared" in the last quarter of the year: 24 September, two from 15 October, 19 October, 29 October and the last from 16 November.
Although the supplier has not yet been published in the Official Journal, as required by law when a company is challenged by ASE to avoid other administrations requesting its services, the Treasurer assured that its services would not be used again.
After the Noroeste newspaper published on 25 July the verification of checks issued by the city administration to its suppliers, it became known that, from March 2008 to 9 July 2010, during the three-year term of Mayor Jorge Abel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez, the municipality had already paid Camacho Palazuelos more than 10 million pesos with 42 checks.
There were also transactions with Jumapam, where she collected checks worth over 3 million pesos.
Touristic places need to be improved urgently
Tourist companies regret the accident of the foreign tourist due to the poor condition of the Glorieta S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Taboada in Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in the collapse of the Glorieta S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Taboada, the tourism industry of Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n asked the authorities to pay special attention to the areas that are in poor condition and have a bad image of the port city.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, Chairman of the Trade Association of the Zona Dorada, recalled that on different occasions it was called upon to maintain the destination and to transform the bad conditions that tourists find into new employment opportunities or routes.
He said the poor condition of the roads and sidewalks had had a negative effect, as tourists came to stroll and saw the disorder, after which they would turn their backs on the nearby shops.
"The politicians don't know what it means to have to close a company one day and they don't worry about how much money you lose, because otherwise they wouldn't be doing the construction slowly and without a plan."
Hotel owner José Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Manguart S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez said the fall of the tourist had drawn attention to the lack of prevention and lack of maintenance work on the part of the city.
"The community has to take its responsibility and avoid something like this happening again. How should it do that? Well, by preventive maintenance instead of repairing everything in retrospect," he explained.
"We are eagerly waiting to have a clean city. Because not only because it is a tourist area, it must be maintained, we residents also have a right to a clean habitat. The city administration must change its strategy to keep the city in good condition."
"There are other places that also look unkempt and unfinished," he said, "for example, el Escudo y el Venadito of Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n."
"Today, we need more than just advertising to attract tourists, we need to offer a good product, a city that keeps its beaches and streets clean, and tourist attractions constantly in line," he added.
"These precautions have not been given enough attention and these kinds of incidents expose what is obvious to all: maintenance is urgently needed."
Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Llera Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez, Undersecretary of Promoci<0xC3><0xB3>n Tur<0xC3><0xAD>stica, expressed the importance of saving the tourist places of Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n, because they were not used properly and created a bad image.
He mentioned a number of places that would need to be brought up to speed together with the city. Making the city clean, tidy and attractive for tourism should be a priority.
"Fortunately, Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n offers many historical and cultural sites that would first need to be cleaned up and cleaned to make them attractive for tourism and to add them to the inventory we use to promote this destination.
IP calls for results from Congress
Eduardo D<0xC3><0xA1>valos, chairman of the CCE, suggested that MEPs should take on the great responsibility of setting an example for a better Sinaloa, which faces many challenges.
Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n’s corporate sector is demanding a dignified parliament, free from any collusion between the parties and the government, because Sinaloa is troubled and faces major problems.
Yesterday, the 60th Parliament was inaugurated. It is composed of seven political forces, 19 deputies of the PRI, 13 of PAN, three of Partido Nueva Alianza, two of PRD, one of PT, one of Convergencia and another of PVEM. This makes a total of 40 representatives of the people.
New members of the State Congress are expected to do a clean job, to feel committed to society and to the diverse social groups that rely on responsible parliamentary work, and not to repeat the same patterns of partisanship and paternalism.
Eduardo D<0xC3><0xA1>valos, chairman of the CCE Business Coordination Council, suggested that the new MEPs should take on the great responsibility of setting an example for a better Sinaloa, which faces many challenges.
"We hope that MPs really exercise their right to act free of collusion between the parties, because it is customary for them to make agreements with which they represent their own interests, thereby turning them into carnival comparators of the rulers and the leaders of the parliamentary factions."
He said that they should demonstrate their commitment to building the necessary bridges to support the current government.
"We want them to do a trustworthy job and above all work for society and its groups, because it was the people of Sinaloa who expressed their trust in them in the last elections."
José Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Manguart S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez, chairman of the Tres Islas Hotel Association, said that one of the major challenges faced by the 40 people’s representatives was to drive and work together for the economic growth of the state, because today the economic situation is extremely complicated.
“The most important thing is that they drive economic growth, create investment incentives and infrastructure measures, which will in some way promote job creation.”
With regard to the tourism sector, he called on the new MEPs to give the Ministry of Tourism the necessary status in the state budget in order to promote it.
"I have understood that it is the Ministry with the second least resources. This is incompatible with an important economic activity that brings foreign exchange and investment into the country and is in direct competition with the agri-industry."
Funds must be allocated to tourism projects, state security must be supported, and the alcohol law, which has not been redrafted in previous legislative periods, must be updated.
The Holy King is sought
Dolls, cars, bicycles and other toys are the wish of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family.
It will be difficult for the parents to fulfill these wishes on the next Epiphany Day, because the household consists of no more and no less than twelve people and a goat.
Nevertheless, Adelaida, Isabel, Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s, José Alfredo, Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Guadalupe, Isa<0xC3><0xAD>as, José Juan and Miguel do not give up hope that Melchior, Caspar and Balthasar will give them the toys and clothing they so long for.
The family lives in a modest house in the settlement of Salvador Allende. They live from hand to mouth, because the father has no fixed work.
"Sometimes hard times are called because my husband has no job. But we sell mandarins and potatoes... Already in the afternoon I go to the streets with the goats to sell," said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
Four-year-old Adelaida would like a doll or a bicycle, while her three-year-old sister Isabel wants a Barbie doll.
The ten-year-old José Alfredo has been wanting to have a 'monster car' for some time and for his eight-month-old brother Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s Cayetana suggests clothes in the size for one-year-olds.
" (José Alfredo) said to me, 'I would so much like to have this monster,' but I replied, 'Let's wait, boy,' because it was very expensive," Cayetana recalled sadly.
For the older children who were in school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
Eleven-year-old Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Guadalupe is 12; ten-year-old Isa<0xC3><0xAD>as is 10, while eight-year-old Miguel is 8.
14-year-old José Juan lacks tennis shoes. A pair in size 5 1/2 or 6 would be very helpful.
If you want to help make the dreams of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family come true, you can participate in the 'Holy King is sought' campaign by donating a toy or cash in the reception hall of the Noroeste newspaper.
14 suspected drug dealers arrested
On Wednesday, as part of the dismantling of a production and sales network of cannabis, the ten house searches were carried out in the administrative region of Estrie.
Fourteen people have been arrested and will face various charges.
The house searches took place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, where they are said to have served primarily in drug manufacturing.
"Approximately 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, cash and equipment that have served the production have been confiscated," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesman for the Quebec security police.
A total of eleven men and three women were arrested, two of the men considered to be the main wire handlers of the drug ring were from Sherbrooke.
The arrested persons are said to have appeared outside the Sherbrooke courthouse hours after their arrest.
They could be accused of, among other things, the production of cannabis, its possession for sale, the plot and the service of crime.
These house searches had taken place as a result of a protracted investigation that had been going on for over a year.
"The information obtained from public authorities has allowed us to carry out these arrests," M. Ruel said.
Around 70 police officers from the Estrien Regional Investigation Unit of the Quebec Security Police, the Sherbrooke Police Department and the Memphrémagog Police Department took part in this police operation.
Secret immigration could easily be traced
The Conservatives’ bill, which the government says will address the problem of ships laden with clandestine immigrants, is likely to be stalled after the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they cannot endorse the proposal.
"I strongly oppose this charter."
"I am with a party that has put shackles on your feet," Michael Ignatieff, the leader of the Liberals, said at the end of the weekly caucus session in front of the assembled MPs.
The Liberals claimed that the bill, which allows any person identified as a seagoing vessel for transporting illegal immigrants to Canada, to be detained for up to a year, was in violation of the Canadian Constitution of Law and Freedom.
Gilles Duceppe, head of the Bloc Québécois, also hinted that he would not be able to support the bill, as it opposes the wrong target group.
“We’re against it and it seems that all opposition parties are against it, so we’ll see what the government does,” Duceppe said.
Criticism of Olivia Chow’s immigration issue, NDP, has dismissed critics who claim her party did not behave steadfastly enough toward the clandestine immigrants.
“The neo-Democrats agree to take action against the blind passengers, and this is what we are trying to enforce through another bill, the C-35,” Chow said.
“We do not support the Conservative bill because it seeks to blame the refugees and keeps children captive for at least a year,” Chow said.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney accused the opposition parties of playing with politics and ignoring the will of Canadians.
"Canadians are telling MPs urgently that they will not tolerate this kind of clandestine immigration, these criminal acts that affect Canada and that treat the country like a footstep."
"They expect Canada to take tough action," Kenney said.
"The government has not announced any vote of confidence regarding its bill that could have led the country to elections that the government would have rejected.
However, a Conservative told QMI that the government would convene a vote so that any opposing MP would immediately declare himself to his constituents.
The new unity finds no unanimity
Despite Jean Charest’s announcement of the creation of a new standing unit to combat corruption and collusion, many observers continue to call for the formation of a public inquiry committee on the subject.
Robert Dutil, Minister of Public Security, claims that this idea did not originate from yesterday: Quebec had already consulted the New York Department of Investigation on this issue last January.
The metropolis has had a standing unit against corruption since 1870.
Nevertheless, Wednesday’s announcement surprised more than one.
It must be said that this measure was not in the least discussed at the meeting of the Quebec Police Department Standing Committee on 29 October last year, despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
Nor was it lacking that Stéphane Bergeron, critic and member of the Parti Québécois, qualified this announcement in terms of public safety as a "rabbit conjured from the hat" as well as "a solution prepared at the end of a table".
Minister Dutil, for his part, had turned to those who fear that political power would have too much influence on the future unity in question.
"You will see the result when we announce it," he said.
“You are aware of this problem.”
According to Réjean Parent, the president of CSQ, nothing can replace the conduct of a public survey.
"The more Mr. Charest insists on trying to prevent the formation of this committee of inquiry, the more people like you and I will think he has something to hide," he explained.
"The only way to form a committee of inquiry is to resign from Jean Charest," said Yves Boisvert, lecturer in ethics and policy systems at ENA.
In order to get out of this impasse, he suggests that Quebec should give a special mandate to auditors to investigate corruption and secret collusion.
"One should be able to extend the mandate of the audit control," he decided.
He also believes that Quebec could give scrutiny the same authority as commissioners, which would also allow it to oblige people to testify.
The formation of a standing unit is not the only project in the drawers of the Charest government.
Quebec will also require Ottawa to amend the penal code to better prepare for this type of crime.
This demand comes from the Chief Prosecutor of Operation Marteau, who informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the case law in this type of prosecution is not clear.
Vic Toews, Minister of State for Public Security, for his part, confirmed that his colleague from the judiciary, Rob Nicholson, is currently dealing with certain amendments relating to this dossier.
During Operation Printemps 2001, which involved the groups of motorcycle police, 131 people had been arrested, although the Criminal Code had not been amended.
As a result, Ottawa has enforced the law against gangsterism.
Rivers under strict surveillance
Several rivers remain under strict surveillance due to the high rainfall that has been pouring in some regions of the province since Tuesday.
In Shawinigan, in the Mauricie administrative region, there was a landslide on Wednesday afternoon.
Two houses were evacuated.
In the evening, another landslide occurred in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in the administrative region of Lanaudiere.
A road has sunk into itself.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, heavy rains of 40 to 70 milliliters of rainfall have spilled over several regions.
Between 20 and 40 additional millimeters of precipitation were expected here according to the regions until Thursday evening.
The areas north of the river and the valley of the Outaouais region were the most affected.
A total of up to 100 millimetres of rain had fallen here.
Since snow melt, which has already accumulated in certain sub-areas, is to be added to these precipitations, the crossing of several watercourses is feared.
On Wednesday evening, the Quebec security service issued warnings about the flood alert regarding the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in the Lanaudiere region.
The rivers in the north, in Saint-Jér<0xC3><0xB4>me, in the Laurentian Mountains and the Ch<0xC3><0xAA>ne in Lotbini<0xC3><0xA8>re become the subject of flood control and remain under observation.
In the Lanaudi<0xC3><0xA8>re region, heavy rainfall has led to the overflowing of some lakes in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, an evasive bridge was torn away due to heavy rainfall.
Ten residences had to be evacuated as a preventive measure.
In Outaouais, the crossing of certain lakes has caused the closure of several roads, especially in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The security service remains on alert and closely monitors the situation, according to Security Councillor Annik Bouchard.
For its part, the Quebec state flood center issued warnings on Wednesday of the sharp rise of several rivers, in particular of Maskinongé, Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont partially reprimanded
Quebec radio host Stéphane Dupont has suffered a partial setback before the Canadian Board of Broadcasting Standards (CCNR) for his controversial statements on social welfare and Haitians as well as for his abusive speech on radio.
The CCNR believes that while M. Dupont and his CHOI 98.1 FM team have the right to express their own views, certain statements contain "inaccurate information about social care and unwarranted negative portrayals of Haitians, as well as such uncouth speech that is inappropriate for daytime broadcasts."
The Supervisory Board had also concluded that a discussion of suicide involving the distribution of the names of two people who committed suicide was contrary to the code of broadcasting.
The CCNR had received several complaints regarding the comments made during the broadcasts broadcast in 2008 and 2010.
The first order was issued following a complaint by the Front commun des personnes assistées sociales du Québec.
The activist organization had complained that the amounts mentioned in the broadcast were inaccurate.
Rather, moderators should provide solid and misleading information.
On the subject of suicide, moderator Stéphane Dupont had expressed the opinion that suicide was an expression of cowardice.
The majority of the Supervisory Board members had concluded that the conveyed message was that suicide should not be regarded as a solution to life crises.
"The majority of the Supervisory Board takes into account that the consequences of the "Dupont le midi" broadcast in question would have addressed a sensitive issue in a family-friendly and appropriate manner."
Therefore, he was not reproached at all towards his person.
The last point of dispute concerned the statements that had related to the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had engaged in a media-effective dispute in this regard, which had provoked a lot of reactions.
The CHOI moderator had stated that he did not donate to Haiti because he did not know for sure whether the needy would actually receive the money donations.
The Supervisory Board is of the opinion that these comments were not of an abusive nature, but that their cumulative effect presents an unjustifiably negative representation of the Haitians.
"I have already waived my three-day suspension sentence on this matter."
"My file has been virgin for a year and a half," the moderator explained.
In all resolutions, the Supervisory Board denounces the dissemination of unplanned language.
In all cases, the CHOI-FM broadcast announcer acted "beyond his obligations".
The consequences for the broadcaster, which, among other things, had to communicate its decisions once during the main broadcasting period within a period of three days, are minor.
A King of Kung Fu in Montreal
Nacereddine Zemmal, of Montreal Algerian origin, has taken a very special course.
The athlete, who excels in "Sanda" (full contact Kung-Fu), in kickboxing and in Thai boxing, now climbs on the tatami and in the boxing rings of the world in search of new challenges.
“I started in Algeria 12 years ago with martial arts such as kung fu and kickboxing,” said Zemmal, who has been based in the metropolis since 2008, to further develop among the professionals.
I personally look for the fight everywhere, because for those who don't like the ground fight as the mixed martial arts present it, competitions in North America are rare."
Recently, working as a security officer and employed by UPS, he had given his rival bad news, in which he won two gold medals from the World Karate and the Kickboxing Association (WKA) at the World Amateur Championship held between 23 and 30 October in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I won in the categories of full contact kickboxing and Thai boxing," he said.
"I am currently preparing for the World Cup at San Shou in China."
"Those fighters from each category had been invited who had placed in the top four at the last World Cup."
"I got a bronze in Toronto in 2009."
"In 2005 I turned eight in Vietnam."
"In 2007 I finished the tournament in fifth place in China, while in 2009 I finished third in Toronto," he added.
"It's worth noting that I've made progress in every competition."
"With this rhythm I will be first this time or next year!"
"San Shou" or "Sanda" are disciplines originating from China, in which punches and kicks as well as floor throws are permitted.
The duels usually take place on a platform, less often in a boxing ring.
The most renowned boxer who emerged from this type of martial arts is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, who is well known in the world of martial arts.
If Nacer Zemmal were to retain only one event in his career, he would certainly call his presence at the Super Tournament "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl of Kung-Fu.
"This competition is the highest-ranking and most respected in China," said the sympathetic Pfunds guy.
"It's a bit like the equivalent of Lumpinee Stadium (the largest stadium in Thailand)."
“It was a super experience.”
Zemmal had won his first fight in the semi-finals of his category (80kg) before losing in the final.
“The one who beat me was a real professional,” he said.
"There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 95 kg)."
"The winners of the semi-finals meet in the final of their category."
"Then the winners of each category will face off to crown a single champion, the King of Kung-Fu."
450 million in contracts without tender
Hydro-Québec has mutually approved $450 million in contracts for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydropower project.
In the middle of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts is a consortium consisting of the companies BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which has received the most important share, namely that of the project management, to the sum of 295 million dollars without tender.
This consortium, called "<0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance", was formed in 2004 to accompany Hydro-Québec's decision to hand over its responsibility to the private sector for this important hydroelectric project in the amount of 5 billion dollars.
At the beginning of 2005, the consortium "<0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance" obtained the lucrative contract without a public tender.
For the Parti Québécois, resorting to corporate consortia is a serious ethical problem, which raises the risk of a reduction in competition and an increase in prices.
“This is a new way of playing a card game, and it’s debilitating the competition.”
“This means that instead of playing games in a secret way, instead of playing them in an open format,” PQ MP Sylvain Simard said at the press conference.
In the early morning Simard had raised the question before the National Assembly, because it seems difficult for him to understand how the public interest can be served in this way.
Resources Minister Nathalie Normandeau had responded to this in the afternoon by vehemently denying that this contract was a bogus game.
"I remain true to my line," she lamented, reiterating that the PQ had acted "unreasonably" and that "she lacked rigor."
She said it was "the least" that the PQ apologized.
The model of the consortium is common practice worldwide.
It is usually a temporary alliance that allows two or more companies to pool their expertise in a bid on a tender for a complex project.
The project "Eastmain" has a high level of complexity with regard to its working extent.
The construction process is underway and is scheduled to be completed by 2012.
Nevertheless, the contract was awarded without any competition taking place; there had already been negotiations.
In addition, the model of the consortium in Quebec is no longer an exception, even for relatively simple projects.
As the newspaper "Le Devoir" noted last week, the consortium's model applied in the field of civil engineering and consulting is the subject of government investigations.
A brief skimming of the Quebec Business Register allows to name more than 200 consortia, some of which seem to be of permanent duration.
In this way, for example, Dessau works in partnership with the majority of its core competitors, including CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin or Roche and Tecsult.
Any link, of which there are several dozen, leads back to one and the same legal entity, namely to Dessau.
As for the <0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance consortium, Minister Normandeau stressed that "the territory of the Baie James is subject to a special manpower dynamic and that Hydro-Québec has been paying particular attention to this fact since the 1970s".
Réal Laporte, the major employer of the Société d'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has made a statement that has rumoured the fact that the project management contract has been approved by agreement.
"If you make a bid and there are only a few applicants, your prices will skyrocket."
"So you have two options: either you take the people who are on this mart and you tell yourself that a satisfactory agreement will be negotiated at a good price."
“The idea, however, is that it is not the price that is decisive, but the expertise of the people,” Laporte said.
This contract, which was awarded to the “<0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance” consortium, is part of a long list of contracts for more than 50,000 dollars received from the Parti Québécois.
The contracts were approved by either Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After review, the newspaper "Le Devoir" counted more than 100 engineering and consulting contracts, which were approved by companies or their branches, in particular resource laboratories, between 2002 and March 2010.
SNC-Lavalin had collected 22 contracts, Génivar had received 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without counting their participation in "<0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance".
All of these contracts have been negotiated.
They totaled $449,783,344, including a $295,131,564 contract with <0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance.
Sylvain Simard had announced that the four companies forming the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) of the "Parti libéral du Québec are well known".
Minister Normandeau had hinted that the PQ was equally linked to the companies it “financed” before she clarified that it was rather their executives.
Barometer of responsible consumption - The "green" label is not confidence-inspiring
Greener, but unapologetically skeptical.
The Quebec consumer has little confidence in the key players in sustainable growth, but also little confidence in the brands or eco-labels that should govern his choice.
Too bad, though it bathes in a media-rich universe where information abounds only so much in favor of more responsible consumption: the barometer of responsible consumption has a lack of credible information to complain about, an inadequacy that manifests itself as a brake on its commitment, as the first reading held yesterday showed.
Although they promoted the consumption of so-called socially acceptable products in 2010, Quebecers still seem to pay little credit to those who try to sell them.
Two-thirds of Quebec's population admits that they do not believe in companies' environmental commitment as much as they do in green corporate advertising, according to the measuring instrument elaborated by the Sherbrooke University Consumer Center.
Another finding: half of consumers doubt the trustworthiness of the official certificates attached to the supposedly fair products, but also the credibility of the products and brands that declare themselves environmentally conscious, according to the barometer.
Following the same pattern, politicians’ discourse on this issue is taken seriously by only 14.6% of Quebec’s population.
However, information on responsible consumption seems to be important for stimulating this segment of consumption, which is currently invigorated by nearly a third of Quebec’s consumers.
Indeed, the emptiness and dubious nature of the information dampened the zeal of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the barometer after the higher price of the products.
In addition, one third of Quebecers are suspicious of the stated performance of the green products and services they are trying to provide.
According to another report, more than half of consumers had already changed their habits in 2010 and mainly changed the brand of one or more products to express their conviction.
According to the barometer, 61% of them also preferred purchases from merchants in their neighbourhood and favored the purchase of food grown in their region.
Greener and more responsible - the index of environmentally conscious consumption had reached a 64 of the maximum value of 100 this year - the Homo consumus of Quebec loves to present itself as the king of recycling, trying to reduce its traces left in the environment by taking care of animal welfare.
But the social and ecological consciousness seems to stop in front of his car, according to the barometer: only 28% of Quebecers have indicated that in 2010 they used public transport or preferred the car-sharing center to demonstrate their ecological interest.
Walking and cycling were also supported by 39.1% of the participants in this comprehensive behavioural survey, which feeds the stereotypes.
Government bond for the acquisition of eXcentris
The Quebec government, which has been invited by Société Angus and Parall<0xC3><0xA8>le to participate financially in the acquisition of the eXcentris cinema complex, agrees to cooperate, but only in the form of a competitive bond.
The developer company Angus and the company Parall<0xC3><0xA8>le, who had hoped to make a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to take over the Daniel Langlois-owned cinema complex eXcentris on Boulevard Saint-Laurent, in order to hand it back to its actual cinematic function, apparently did not receive what they demanded.
The government has accepted to be involved in this matter, but on its own terms.
Instead of the expected donation, the Quebec government offers a bond lower than the initially hoped-for amount, which could create a viable solution on advantageous terms, at least according to sources drawn from the state rumor mill.
A first action plan and a request for 12.8 million had already been rejected by Quebec last spring, and the petition has been revised down summarily since then.
A proposal along with an action plan has already been sent to Minister St-Pierre by the President of the Société de développement des entreprises culturelles (SODEC), Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Macerola, who is in charge of the eXcentris file.
Several days ago he sent her a final factual report.
However, the Cabinet’s counter-proposal was sent to SODEC on Wednesday.
Parall<0xC3><0xA8>le and Angus now have until December 31 to respond to this.
In any case, the premise of the state donation really seems to have been pushed aside.
Let us recall that the Quebec cinema and cinema complex ownership community had opposed a direct state investment in support of the acquisition of eXcentris, arguing that the Minister of Culture did not have to provide financial aid for real estate projects there that he did not also provide to other cinemas.
However, several other market participants in the segment, in contrast, sued for substantial economic assistance.
After the self-financed construction of the cinema, cinema director Daniel Langlois had presented the auteur cinema in the premises of his cinema complex under great difficulties for more than ten years, which could justify the exceptional position on the part of the state treasury.
The lack of cinemas showing independent films is more than obvious in Montreal, and eXcentris managed to keep its clientele on the line.
Société Angus and Parall<0xC3><0xA8>le, led by Christian Yaccarini, are launching a privately funded campaign to raise $700,000 to boost the acquisition.
Since the spring of 2009, only a single screen continues to show films in eXcentris, namely Le Parall<0xC3><0xA8>le.
The aim of the future purchasers is to reopen the three cinemas on 27 February next year with the screening of the very successful film by Xavier Beauvois "Des hommes et des dieux".
Christian Yaccarini, however, has not recalled the newspaper "Le Devoir" and one ignores what he and his group think of the downward-corrected proposals that have been made to them.
Secret of complex-shaken Canada revealed
The new U.S. diplomatic leadership, disseminated through WikiLeaks, reveals the secret of what the United Nations considers to be the inferiority complex of Canadians over Americans, but at the same time exposes the latter’s sense of superiority over Canada.
As a result, American diplomats are amazed that the Canadian voter does not have Canadian-American relations in mind when voting, and they believe that President Obama’s visit would have helped the Conservative government enforce its 2009 budget!
The four new communications between the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington that were publicly circulated yesterday offer even more piquant details than the mere substantial content one has to nibble on.
A link dating from 22 September 2008, i.e. the period during which the federal electoral campaign was in full swing, reports on the point at which the United Nations no longer participates in the operations discussed by its political leaders.
To the great astonishment of David Wilkins, the American ambassador deployed in Ottawa.
Mr Wilkins offers various explanations of this situation.
“A complex of near-inhabitant inferiority, conditioned on Canadians, may cause Canadian political leaders to speak much more about the internal issues of everyday life than to push the black Peter to the United States in this election (as in the 1988 campaign on free trade),” he describes.
The United Nations, he concludes, is thus “the proverbial goliath of this election: omnipresent, but potentially too threatening to speak of.”
The ambassador understands this "stunning silence" all the less, as the two countries have intensive political and economic relations.
"Logically," he said, "it should be the ability of a candidate, a party, and much more of a party leader to lead such an essential relationship that the voter has in mind as a key factor in the ballot."
The other expression of this sense of importance is read in the message sent on January 22, 2009 by Ottawa business executive Terry Breese, to prepare President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
“Your trip will help ensure the continued existence of the government in the confidence vote on the federal budget in early February, when Canada will announce its first deficit in more than a decade due to a $30 to $40 billion revival program,” Breese said in a statement.
Nowhere did he mention that the government had had to postpone the parliamentary session before Christmas to prevent parliament from being overthrown by the coalition and that the continued existence of the opposition parties would affect the quality of the proposed stimulus program.
Another communication, dated January 2008 and written by Ambassador Wilkins, informs Washington of the increasingly negative image that the dramatic series broadcast via CBC is spreading from the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about broadcasts such as Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which one can observe little subtle allusion to Maher Arar, the "no-fly list" or even diversions for the purpose of interrogations carried out by muscle spasms of the CIA.
Another report detailed how Hillary Clintten asked her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner at their first bilateral meeting whether Europe was willing to accept certain prisoners from Guantanamo.
Mr Kouchner is said to have answered yes to the question, but on the basis of an individual "case to case" decision.
At the end of the meeting, as described, "he handed the Secretary of State a paper on Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The Secretary of State has promised to review the file again".
Finally, let’s note that sentiments are heating up regarding the WikiLeaks website.
Tom Flanagan, an old and Stephen Harper very close adviser, had stated via CBC that those responsible for this massive leak should be “killed.”
He had referred to Mike Huckabee from the United States here.
Global lighting renewal plan
In Cancun, the UN proposed a plan to renew the lighting of households, trade and industry in 100 countries with a view to achieving a greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction, which is almost one-third of the additional reduction that needs to be achieved in order to stabilise the Earth’s climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan takes its position in the steps of the concrete major projects that the UN hopes to implement in Cancun in order to compensate for the absence of mandatory reduction commitments by the industrialized countries.
According to the plan put forward yesterday, the main problem in the form of the 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of CFCs released to the earth due to lighting would be avoided if the white-hot bulbs, which so far still represent a monopoly of 50 to 70% on the market, were replaced by fluorescent or better still, light-emitting diodes (LEDs).
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This corresponds to an equivalent of 70% of the exhaust gases of the global fleet.
In Copenhagen last year, major emissions emitters such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed to voluntary reduction plans to reduce global CFC emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, one would have to subtract 5 Gt from this balance to stabilize the climate increase by 2 degrees Celsius from today until 2020 in order to prevent it from getting out of control.
In the white-hot bulbs, 95% of the energy escapes in the form of heat, and the remaining 5% produce the light.
With the compact fluorescent bulbs, energy consumption is reduced by 75%, with the new LED light bulbs this energy requirement is reduced by twofold.
The compact fluorescent bulbs last between 6,000 and 10,000 hours on average.
The new LED light bulbs, such as those launched by Philips this week – this company, by the way, participated in the UN study – have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a white-hot bulb, suggesting the potential savings of the replacement plan to be applied in 100 countries.
In addition to the fact that completely new incandescent bulbs emit very little heat, they can also work with a control resistor.
They do not contain any mercury.
Several specialists have shown that compact fluorescent bulbs have reserves because they contain mercury and that they must therefore be disposed of as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless producers provide a collection point.
However, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet, according to the report, is not the compact fluorescent bulb, but rather the coal-fired power plants, which emit significantly more mercury to produce the electricity wasted by the white-hot bulbs.
In the United States alone, these coal-fired power plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury annually.
The report details the profits that each country would generate thanks to this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would save a billion dollars a year in electricity purchases and eight million tons of CO2, the equivalent of 3.5 coal-fired power plants, the construction of which would cost Indonesia 2.5 billion.
Ivory Coast Excitedly Expects to Announce Election Results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called for the "immediate" publication of the results of the Ivory Coast presidential election immediately after its deadline.
"The Secretary-General underlines the need for the independent electoral commission to maintain its work and to announce the preliminary results without further delay," a UN chief press secretary said.
"It asks all parties and institutions of C<0xC3><0xB4>te d'Ivoire to demonstrate their responsibility and to refrain from any initiative until the provisional results are announced."
Despite the pressure exerted by certain foreign governments, the electoral commission had allowed the deadline, set at midnight on Wednesday, to elapse three days after the election on Sunday, without publication of the results.
About forty minutes before the deadline, the President of the CEI had confirmed on television that the Commission would “continue working” to announce the results.
On Wednesday, multiple calls from all over the world have been made, the CEI may finally proclaim the name of the winner of the second round of the election under the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and his opponent Alassane Ouattara.
However, the Gbagbo camp expects the Constitutional Council to cancel "fraudulent" votes in the north, achieved by the ex-rebel camp of the Forces nouvelles (FN) during the failed coup in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N’Guessan, head of Ivory Coast’s presidential campaign, had confirmed that the FN’s manoeuvre to intimidate voters in the north of the country had deterred the president’s supporters from going to the polls.
The entire election could be annulled if Gbagbo’s actions were taken into account by the Constitutional Council.
However, the Gbagbo opponents are now more of the opinion that the country’s Supreme Court is not neutral, as it is headed by Paul Yao N’Dré, a politically closely allied with Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the north who denies any connection to the ex-rebels, has judged the delay in announcing the election results to be "unacceptable" and asked Gbagbo to respect them, even if he has not gone so far as to claim victory.
His alliance partners reiterate that Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results, knowing that he has lost; and filing a complaint in the Constitutional Court after preventing the electoral commission from publishing the results is illegal.
The second round of Sunday’s presidential election was thought to be the culmination of the unification and reconciliation process of a country that had been split in two for years.
The United Nations warned C<0xC3><0xB4>te d’Ivoire politicians on Wednesday that it could be held responsible in the event of possible riots.
Laurent Gbagbo had the first round of voting on October 31 with 38% of the vote against the 32% for Alassane Ouattara, who enjoyed the public support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round), as the top candidate.
Unemployment rate in France remained stable in the third quarter
According to the International Labour Office (IAA), the unemployment rate in France is stable at 9.3% in the metropolis (including the overseas departments at 9.7%), according to the provisional, seasonally adjusted data published by the Federal Statistical Office Insee on Thursday.
The unemployment rate in the metropolis is established at 2.631 million.
The figures for the second quarter were 9.3% of the working population in the metropolis and 9.7%, including the overseas departments.
Over the year, the unemployment rate increased by 0.1 percentage points.
More broadly, 3.4 million workers in the French metropolis were not employed in the third quarter but wished to find work, including whether or not they were operational every two weeks or whether or not they were job-seekers.
The situation of young people in the labour market continued to deteriorate with an increase in the unemployment rate of 24.2% in the metropolis (+0.9 percentage points in three months, +0.5 percentage points seen over the year) and 25% involving the overseas regions.
In the third quarter, 637,000 of the young people between the ages of 15 and 24 were unemployed, according to the IAA.
Seniors, for their part, have seen a slight increase in the unemployment rate of 6.4% in the metropolis (+0.2 percentage points over three months and over the year), i.e. 482,000 of those over 50 years of age, 6.6% involving overseas departments.
Only the 25-49 year-olds had benefited from the stability of unemployment in the third quarter; 8.3% in the metropolis (-0.1 percentage point over three months, +0.1 percentage points over a year) and 8.8% in France as a whole.
After an argument about its calculation methods, the Federal Statistical Office Insee has not published the monthly unemployment figures since 2006.
Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union, however, continues in this method and announced on Tuesday a rate of 9.8% in France for October (including the overseas departments) compared to 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini charged and arrested
Alexandre Guérini, 53, head of a waste disposal company and brother of the President of the General Council of the Bouches-du-Rh<0xC3><0xB4>ne Region (PS), was tried and taken to prison in Luynes, near Aix-en-Provence, as part of an investigation into the public and suspected markets.
Alexandre Guérini was charged with embezzlement of company assets, misappropriation of common property, theft, complicity in corruption, illicit bribery and possession of weapons, according to his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini is ready to fight and intends to comment on all the questions that the prosecutor's office will ask him, instead of spreading fantasies."
“It’s easy to accuse him of a number of criminal charges, but another thing is to prove them,” Florence Rault, his lawyer, told the AFP (Agence France Presse) ahead of his client’s hearing.
Mr. Guérini, brother of Jean-No<0xC3><0xAB>l Guérini, the first man in the PS (Parti socialiste) department, had made it a point to send a memorandum to the judge through his lawyers before his hearing.
A member of Guérini’s family, Philippe Rapezzi, was also charged and imprisoned on Wednesday evening.
According to lawyer Lucien Simon, her client had never done anything but keep his landfill, which he had to manage, running.
According to Simon, he would never have been aware of the area of business competence or the destination of the associated funds.
In this affair, Daniel Pinna, former Director General of the Aubagne Public Service, was also charged on Wednesday with embezzlement and complicity, but then under the condition to stay away from the protagonists of these legal acts under judicial supervision, was released.
"My client was able to provide explanations of the facts he was accused of."
"The senior prosecutor has taken into account not to deprive him of his freedom," said his lawyer Yann Arnoux.
Four other people had been charged and released from custody during the night from Tuesday to Wednesday, including two of them under legal supervision, according to Deputy Chief Prosecutor Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy managing director of the Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM) waste disposal company, is being prosecuted for “illegal influence and passive bribery”.
Two civil servants from the Aubagne agglomeration, Mich<0xC3><0xA8>le Duval and Christophe Bringuier, were also arrested, one on the basis of the title "Hoccupation and misappropriation of public property by a public official", the other on "complicity in misappropriation of public funds".
Alexandre Guérini's partner, Jeannie Peretti, was also accused of "healing and embezzlement of social assets".
Among the people facing Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently imprisoned for a similar affair of fraudulent government machinations that had affected Corsica.
The investigators suspect his society has helped to launder money originating from "high" criminal circles.
The investigation against X for alleged fraud in the award of public contracts, in particular in the waste disposal sector, was carried out in April 2009 as a result of anonymous letters in the files of several open investigations.
Close sources of investigation indicate that the investigation is particularly focused on the conditions of the contract and the operation of a landfill in La Ciotat, which also relates to waste from the Aubagne area as well as from certain cities in the Marseille urban catchment area (MPM).
Affaire Clotilde Reiss: the Elysée Palace is exaggerating its role as a mediator for Syria
Within more than six months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher detained in Iran for “espionage,” kept the French public on alert, and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All this under the watchful eye of the diplomats of the United States.
The American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and reviewed by the newspaper "Le Monde" reveal some of the background to this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée had explained its strategy to the Americans, who went so far as to give this advice on how to deal with their own crisis of “hostages” in Iran (a small group of wanderers).
They show how French officials have tried to convince Washington that the liberation of the young French woman did not result in the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian imprisoned in France and sought by the American judiciary for trade in material in favor of Iran’s nuclear program.
Finally, they cast a glaring light on the way in which the French Bureau tried to manipulate the media to make it credible that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad had played a central role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss.
In truth, he had done nothing in this regard.
A diplomatic telegram edited in Paris on August 12, 2009 is entitled "Iran: French Comments on the Way of Dealing with Hostages".
Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Richier, Elysée consultant on strategic issues, was accompanied by Patrice Paoli, director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, and the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explained the French method to her.
They advised the Americans to do everything possible to return their own nationals who would be forcibly detained in Iran.
“Make noise,” they said, “articulates loud and clear and incessantly” the words “fundamental human rights,” “innocentness,” “immediate release” in the media.
This is necessary to embarrass the Iranian regime, which is very sensitive to its image.
“Do this all the more, especially as the Iranians ask you not to do it.”
Because "silence solves nothing", past the attempts of discussion on the inconspicuous way, the Iranians are "masters in evasive maneuvers".
Mr Richier adds that the arrest of foreigners is a "common Iranian tactic": "hostage for the purpose of political blackmail."
He announces that the release of Clotilde Reiss from prison (which was due to take place on August 16, the day she fled to the French embassy) "demands the payment of a large sum of money to the Iranians" (230,000 euros bail).
And he makes it clear that Elysée is anticipating further hostage-taking, a phenomenon that "will intensify".
The Iranians could “arrest another of the approximately 1,800 French citizens living in Iran in the near future,” he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss was released from prison 12 days ago, but is still being held in Iran.
One piece of information has been circulated: the Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition the United States is demanding because of illegal trade in sensitive electronic material to Iran, has been released from prison after a decision by a judge in Paris.
The American Embassy, like many other observers, is asking itself questions about this troubling coincidence.
The release of Majid Khakavand is bad news for Washington, which is tracking Iran’s illegal networks of acquisition of the material intended for the nuclear program.
Has France accepted a cow trade?
The liberation of the Iranian against that of the French?
On the occasion of another interview with Kathleen Allegrone on 4 September, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Richier assures that this is not the case.
The Elysée, he says, was not only "completely surprised by the judge's decision", but also tried to rebel against it.
"There has been a lively exchange between the French Bureau and the French Minister of Justice" (currently Mich<0xC3><0xA8>le Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot change the judicial decision," he explains.
Mr Richier would also like to point out that Majid Kakavand continues to be under “strict” supervision of the French secret service.
The Elysée adviser dials a phone number, puts it back on, then informs the American diplomat that the Iranian "is currently in the buildings run by the Iranian embassy in Paris."
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysée does not spare its efforts to make it believe that Syrian President Bachar al-Assad is playing an "important" and "influential media role".
The Americans do not observe this activity without irony and state that the manipulation bears fruit, as several press articles reflect the official French version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 conjures up "the flash of the French authorities".
What is the basis of so much "thank you" to Mr. Assad, the Paris embassy wonders.
"Despite their statements of praise, the French authorities secretly admit that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians actually did."
The document then deals with the reasons that led the Elysée to fall into this fiction.
“The intensive communication efforts are aimed at confirming Sarkozy’s policy of opening up to Syria,” he said.
A policy was launched in 2008, which at the time "was perceived by numerous critics in France and abroad as premature and undeserved".
"Syrian role building" tries to remind Paris "Syria what praise can be achieved by playing a constructive role in the region".
The goal is also to “sow discord between Syria and Iran.”
The American Embassy knows this from a good source.
On 11 August, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Richier confided to her: “Of course we don’t know if the Syrians did anything.”
"But we thanked them in spite of everything."
"This should at least cause confusion among the Iranians".
Clotilde Reiss will return to France on May 16, 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy welcomes them to the Elysée.
In a communiqué, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their “active role in favor of the release of our countryman.”
No online games for young Koreans after midnight
The South Korean government will pass a law called "the Cinderella," which will prohibit young people from playing online games after midnight by blocking access to them, government officials indicated.
A bill calling on online gaming operators to deny access to these games to young people under the age of 16 after midnight will be presented to parliament in December, representatives of ministries of culture and family said.
"Many children play these games all night long and then have difficulty learning at school and also living a normal life during the day."
“We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep,” said Jo Rin, the French press agency’s Ministerial Representative in charge of this draft law.
The online games will be available again from 6 a.m.
The manufacturing companies would have a year to prepare for the application of the law, he specified.
The government is also considering asking manufacturers to reduce the daily time limit for access to these games for those young people whose parents ask for it, the person in charge added.
It will also provide free programs to those who wish to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "networked" countries, and the newspapers regularly report on various events related to intensive Internet use.
The country is also the undisputed champion in worldwide online game competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals in the World Cyber Games against 58 other nations.
World Cup 2018-2022: FIFA appoints host country
On Thursday, the FIFA Executive Committee, in light of suspicion of corruption, will appoint the host countries of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, a highly political election in which the wrangling for influence and lobbying threaten to push technical criteria into the background.
One thing is certain, however: the 2018 edition of FIFA’s supreme discipline will take place in Europe, its traditional stronghold (the 4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 edition will then be somewhat more exotic; the International Football Federation hopes to win over new territories (Qatar, Australia) after its premiere on the African continent in 2010, or to pursue its establishment in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities who belong to the delegation (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch heads of government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) sets out the measure of the economic and political commitment of a World Cup.
So the machinations behind the scenes threaten to stop until the last minute.
It is difficult to establish a hierarchy of candidates.
According to FIFA’s evaluation report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) acts offer better arguments than their competitors.
But these considerations will not be so weighty for the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of the election.
The Sunday Times, which was at the beginning of the revelations with the suspension of two members of the Executive Committee (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could just as well have ruined the chances for their own country, the cradle of football, which was only allowed to host the World Cup once, namely 1966.
The BBC had given it fresh ground on Monday by airing a documentary report that calls into question three influential members of the committee, namely Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Reason enough to embarrass FIFA and embarrass the English leaders who had engaged in intense lobbying with David Cameron in recent weeks.
The head of government hopes for a new edition of the chess move by his predecessor Tony Blair, which had achieved the organisation of the 2012 Olympic Games for London in 2005.
Would this intensive effort be sufficient to enhance England’s image before the Committee?
Nothing is less certain, because the duo Spain-Portugal do not lack trump cards with its already finished stadiums, its expertise (World Cup 82 in Spain, Olympic Games 92 in Barcelona, Euro 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
But the economic and financial downsides of the two countries could dampen their ambitions.
The possible reprisals against the English, as well as the doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal, increase the chances of Russia, which despite its gaps in the dossier (stadiums, hotels, transport) has become a weighty outsider.
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, however, has decided to denounce the undisguised insinuation of the accusations of the English press "an unfair competition in the preparation of the vote" on the part of committee members.
“You throw dirt on them, you try to compromise them,” Putin said.
For 2022, the United States, strengthened by the experience of 1994, seem to be the logical favorites.
First world economic power, seat of the FIFA main sponsors, the country seems to have a long list of advantages over Japan and South Korea, which have separately drawn up a very nice project.
But these new candidacies seem premature for two countries that had co-organized the competitions in 2002.
Another threat: FIFA’s eagerly awaited approval of the 2026 World Cup for China, which will put an end to Asian opportunities for 2022.
With Australia and Qatar, which had pulled all the stops with the maintenance of futuristic stadiums, FIFA is pursuing its expansion into new territories, but these two countries pose a greater risk than certainty.
Australia, like Japan and South Korea, may suffer from the weakness of television rights (due to the time difference) acknowledged by European countries, the sensitive nerve of FIFA.
Second mandate: the obvious
De Gaulle had really cut.
Mitterrand had made him believe that he was stuttering.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac showed not the slightest hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than this.
A mandate in the Elysée summons the next.
The current head of state will be ergo candidate in 2012.
But the obvious side of the mystery attached to the presidential function is not well-seen.
So you have to pretend that the doubt exists from now on.
On the one hand, as well as in the other.
In 2006, Jacques Chirac's supporters claimed that a third mandate could not be ruled out without believing it.
On 15 November, Nicolas Sarkozy solemnly assured that he would make his decision "sometime in the autumn of 2011".
The fact that he would echo the perspective of "two mandates" on Tuesday evening in the Elysée in front of the UMP parliamentarians, had therefore spread a little feverishness.
Was this the official announcement of his candidacy?
Far from it.
The president merely recalled that the 2008 constitutional amendment limited the number of five-year terms to just two.
He made a statement, not an announcement.
It is not the first time that he mentions the presidential election in a humorous tone on the occasion of such meetings.
“At worst, you have seven and a half years with me, or at best,” he told them in July 2009.
On a new one in May 2010: "Don't think I'm not thinking about the phase after that."
His words of the day before yesterday make him no more a candidate than he did the day before; but also no less.
If they cause comments, it is for two reasons.
The acceleration of the race for the candidacy with the horsepower on one side.
However, it is not the inclusion of the competition with Ségol<0xC3><0xA8>ne Royal that drives Nicolas Sarkozy to reveal himself.
On the contrary, it is his obvious candidacy in 2012, which many members of the PS are urging to challenge earlier than expected.
The bad polls on the other hand.
For the first time, the voters of the right would prefer a candidacy of Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Fillon to that of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against 44%, according to the BVA-L'Express survey).
"We have a candidate, and there is no discussion with the UMP about it," the Prime Minister's environment reacted immediately and cautiously.
“If he were to find a defeat as possible, he would not be a candidate,” said Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will always believe that he can win," corrected Alain Juppé, who agreed with the obvious.
Euro: ECB forced to maintain its purchases of government securities
The last meeting of the ECB’s Governing Council last year should provide an opportunity to show how to get out of the crisis, or at least announce the order of a large number of unconventional monetary policy measures to be finalised by the end of the year.
The crisis of European sovereign debt obliges the central bank in Frankfurt to no doubt not afford to forfeit the current, more than tense situation on the European bond markets, in order not to provoke their aggravation.
The political costs would be far too high.
French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde welcomed yesterday at a press conference the active role taken by the ECB in solving Europe’s national budget debt.
It has not dared to say whether it believes that the central bank can do more, for example by boosting its programme of purchases of government bonds.
"I reserve my considerations for my European trading partners (...) ".
Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB, had not been very eloquent about his plans the day before in Brussels at his hearing by the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee of the European Parliament, but was content to point out that the programme of purchases of government securities on the secondary market would "continue to operate" and that we "will see how the decisions turn out" at the meeting on Thursday.
The only certainty is that the ECB will keep its key interest rate unchanged at 1%, the historically lowest level since May 2009.
In practice, the Treasury’s bond purchases were doubled by the ECB last week to approximately €1.35 billion.
And according to the indiscretions of some traders, it is said that yesterday it made new purchases on Irish and Portuguese government securities.
In total, the Eurosystem central banks have made purchases of EUR 67 billion since May 2010.
There is no doubt among traders that they expect the purchase price to be followed up (see page 29).
Economists no longer expect a remarkable change of course.
If the bond operations of more than three months have already disappeared from the ECB’s arsenal, the latter will still have to deal with the unrestricted reserves of money in a generous way, over a period of one week to three months.
Economists are already preparing for this measure to be extended by a few months.
"I can't imagine that the ECB will change its programme in a substantial way."
“Otherwise, it would run the risk of provoking new tensions in the short term,” says Michael Schubert, economist at Commerzbank.
"A progressive exit planned for the course of the first quarter of 2011 seems to me more likely," anticipates Norbert Br<0xC3><0xA4>ms, economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In the area of its interventions in the sovereign debt market, “the ECB should maintain such a volume of purchases of bonds that revives the sluggish market,” adds Norbert Br<0xC3><0xA4>ms.
Given the relevance of the exposed position of European banks in the eurozone sovereign debt markets, the central bank has no choice but to maintain its presence in the market.
“It needs to step up to the plate of the lack of investors in the market at any price and act in such a way to prevent the hasty enthusiasm about the returns paid to the weakest states,” a major bondholder testified yesterday.
If interest rates were to rise, states would be even more prevented from reducing or even stabilizing their debt.
This is the price to protect the euro.
Berlusconi government takes cover in Italy
After a worrying start to the week for Italy, the situation has calmed down a bit yesterday with the decline in corner interest rates to 10 years.
A return to deceptive silence.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister of Economy, regional leaders Giulio Tremonti had qualified the situation as "indecipherable" and had heard him expect an "unpredictable" weekend, which the person immediately denied.
In any case, on Tuesday, the scissors with the German interest rates would have reached its record of 210 basis points, and the prices of the contracts to cover the risk of bankruptcy had risen to 263 points, which had caused a certain headlessness in Rome.
Silvio Berlusconi had pointed out at his Council of Ministers that Spain’s discrepancy with German interest rates is 400 basis points.
However, his right hand, Gianni Letta, had expressed "severe concern" about the "market turbulence" and a possible contagion from Ireland.
“The good news is that Italy, the third largest economy in the eurozone, is not like Greece or Ireland.”
“The bad news is that Italy is like Portugal,” explains Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
In plain language, this means that its problem is the absence of economic growth and the dwindling tax revenues that come with it, which put the state at risk of being unable to meet its financing needs.
The last Brussels forecasts were a cold shower for the government.
In the future, Italy is expected to grow by 1.1% in 2011 and by 1.4% in 2012... although the budget under consideration at the Senate is forecast to grow by 1.3% and 2%, respectively.
Under these conditions, the EU Commission calculates, the budget deficit will still account for 4.3% of GDP next year (compared to the 3.9% predicted by governments) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
That is why the riot over a new household collective, which could be used after the holidays to the sum of 7 billion euros.
“If necessary, new austerity measures must be taken,” says auditor Olli Rehn.
Italy is currently receiving support from international institutions.
"The foundations of Italy's economy are in order and its accounts are regulated, we have been repeating this for a long time," said Arrigo Sadun, the International Monetary Fund's Italian fiduciary, who is in charge of Italy at the IMF.
"At the moment, there are no problems, either in the short term or in the long term, as Italy, despite its high debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, A. d. R.), is required to make less stabilization progress than other countries," observes Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist of the OECD.
The question remains of political instability.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censure by the Chamber of Deputies, as a result of which the early elections could be organized as early as the end of March.
There is therefore a period that is not very favorable for decision-making in the face of a serious crisis.
Europeans think about expanding anti-crisis measures
Speaking at a press conference in Paris yesterday, Christine Lagarde said: “I think it has been proven on Sunday afternoon and in the evening: Europeans are clearly united, ready and committed to defend their currency and their currency area.”
Although completely relative - the deduction recorded yesterday on the interest feet of European government bonds was water on the mills of governments as well as the ECB.
However, we cannot yet speak of a normalization beginning.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's had announced that it could lower the debt rating of Portugal, probably the most effective target of speculators today.
"As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political perceptibility, which weighs particularly on the banking systems," said the economists of the Exane BNP Paribas.
Especially since “the political time passes much more slowly than that of the markets”.
The European countries, well aware of both this gap and the danger it poses, are intensifying discussions to reinforce the anti-crisis measures already in place.
The informal discussions between the finance ministers most directly concerned and, in a broader sense, with their counterparts in the G20 are progressing well.
This is also the case with regard to the meetings of Eurogroupe and Ecofin at the beginning of next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
On the plan is the lot of unconventional measures to strengthen the backs of the eurozone countries in the crosshairs of the markets (see below).
As far as the EU Stability Fund is concerned, its Executive Director Klaus Regling has already started his Asia tour in Singapore on Tuesday to inform investors in the Far East about developments regarding the crisis in Europe.
If the goal of his visit is not explicit fundraising, he certainly prepares the terrain for it.
The first EU stability fund spending is scheduled for next month.
Yesterday, an official U.S. representative told Reuters that the United States supported a possible increase in funds mobilised by the IMF’s additional direct engagement.
For their part, Portugal and Spain, the countries in the first place, are preparing to undertake structural reforms, particularly in the area of labour market organisation.
Reforms that are added to the austerity measures, but are expected to have effects in the near future.
Lisbon and Madrid take a different path than Greece and Ireland did.
Both the one and the other must at all costs avoid having to ask for international assistance before they have set up their own budget correctives and have decided on unavoidable structural reforms that will bring them back in confidence in the long run.
European investors, on the other hand, are conversing on the options available to speed up the normalisation process of government bond markets.
Axel Weber, who was in transit in Paris on 24 November, had first given rise to the idea that if the 750 billion euros mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to reach into its own pocket again.
The economists of Barclays Capital, a major player in the European sovereign debt market, believe that an extension of around 100 billion euros would be sufficient, "preferably" in the form of a direct injection of liquidity.
This means exists: the European mechanism of doped financial stabilisation, which currently amounts to 60 billion euros.
An advisory board that has every chance of being closely examined in the European capitals.
Especially if the market conditions are worsening.
Snow and ice: 24 departments in Orange alert level
The snow episodes are still causing traffic problems, especially in Brittany’s secondary transport networks, and threaten to affect various economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now on Orange alert due to the threat of snow and ice.
The Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-S<0xC3><0xA8>vres and Vienne regions have been added to the 20 departments already on Orange alert; 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, then later in the night.
According to Météo France, the intense snow showers affect the north of the Gironde as well as the Charentes, it snows easily on the et Ile-de-France.
In the affected departments, snow cover is expected from 2 to 5 cm, in places from 7 to 10 cm, as well as 1 to 3 cm, even up to 5 cm in the Paris region.
Affected are the regions of Charente, Charente-Maritime, C<0xC3><0xB4>tes d'Armor, Finist<0xC3><0xA8>re, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and the regions of Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin.
The snowfalls are considerable enough to cause traffic disruptions and affect certain economic activities, Météo France predicts.
In the C<0xC3><0xB4>tes d'Armor region, several regional roads are closed to heavy traffic of more than 7.5 tonnes, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac axes.
The traffic situation of the secondary transport networks in Brittany is very difficult, according to the traffic police, who advise against using their own vehicles only in an emergency, and the use of some TER coaches has been cancelled throughout the day.
In Picardy, school traffic was suspended for Thursday.
No specific restrictive measures were envisaged for heavy goods transport on Wednesday evening.
The prefecture "calls on drivers to exercise extreme caution on the roads and to adapt their driving behaviour accordingly."
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) called on airlines on Thursday to cancel 25% of their flights from Paris’ Roissy Airport and 10% of flights departing from Orly due to the expected heavy snowfall.
DGAB recommends that air passengers contact their airline.
Gatwick Airport in south London and Edinburgh Airport in Scotland are closed until Thursday morning.
Métro Grand Paris: first financial sketches
Since the debate on the modernisation of the transport industry on the Ile-de-France is in full swing, it has rained billions.
At least in the discussions.
It is worth remembering in particular the 23 billion for the Metro Grand Paris, which is to be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
In order to initiate the start of construction of the SGP, the state has declared a capital endowment of 4 billion euros.
In the theoretical scheme, this is the sum which would then enable the SGP to lend a part of the financial sum twice as much in the markets.
Today, the first projections have finally been made.
The 2010 supplementary budget, reviewed this morning by the Finance Commission of the National Assembly, contains the measures envisaged to raise the first part of these funds.
These measures are twofold: the creation of a special tax for the development and higher taxation of offices in Ile-de-France.
The former, according to Article 15 of the bill, "goes in favor of the public-law institution Société du Grand Paris".
This is stated: "The product of this tax amounts to 117 million euros per year".
The second is a reorganization of the already existing corporate taxation: "to modernize it, to increase the resulting product and to hand over this increase to the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would that contribute?
A mystery.
This amount is not stated in the text.
Of the 4 billion, we are far away.
"It is stated that the tax resources will be added to the 4 billion euros of capital endowment raised by the state and will be gradually provided to the Société du Grand Paris for the project," the explanatory statement reads.
At the SGP, this system is not offensive at all.
"From the moment you book revenue (the two taxes, i.e.), you can cover the project planning for three years and then only draw from the 4 billion," it explains.
"This will be noted in the budget and gradually subtracted".
The SGP estimates that 2013 will begin to list the 4 billion for the 2014 budget.
This measure, of which 4 billion promised will be available for a long time, runs the risk of triggering quite a lively parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will be held on 7 December.
vengeful hackers and busy spies
WikiLeaks has two meanings.
On the one hand, it has turned out to be an obvious scandal, a scandal that is merely a scandal in the sense of hypocrisy that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes on an international level, and gives a foretaste of the future dominated by regression.
But let's go one by one.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that every file created by an intelligence agency (an x-any nation) is made up entirely of newspaper clippings.
Berlusconi’s “extraordinary” American revelations about Berlusconi’s sexual habits throw in nothing more than what you’ve been reading for months anyway in any of his journals (except for those owned by Berlusconi), and the horrifyingly caricatured profile of Gaddafi has provided cabaret artists with material for their sketches for a long time.
The rule according to which the secret dossiers may consist only of already known news is essential for the dynamism of the intelligence services, and not only this century.
If you go to a library devoted to esoteric publications, you will realize that each work (about the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, the Templars or the Rosicrucians) repeats exactly what has already been written in previous works.
This is not only because the author of occult texts does not want to publish research (nor because he does not know where to find news about the non-existent), but because those who devote themselves to occultism do not believe in anything other than what they already know and confirm what they have already learned.
This is also Dan Brown’s mechanism of success.
As well as the secret files.
The informant is lazy, and lazy (or limited mind) is also the head of the secret service (otherwise, he could be whatever, for example, editor at Libération), who considers only what he acknowledges to be true.
The top secret information about Berlusconi that the American Embassy in Rome sent to the State Department was the same as the one that Newsweek had published the week before.
Why, then, was such a fuss made about the disclosures of these dossiers?
On one side, these say what every educated person already knows, namely that the embassies – at least since the end of World War II and since then also the heads of government can call each other or take a plane to meet for dinner – have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of a few small representational tasks, have turned into espionage centers.
Any observer of investigative films knows this very well, and it is not out of hypocrisy that one pretends to ignore it.
Nevertheless, the fact of repeating it publicly violates the task of hypocrisy and serves to put American diplomacy in a bad light.
Second, the idea that any hacker can tap into the most secret secrets of the most powerful country in the world is a significant blow to the prestige of the State Department.
In addition, the scandal brings not so much the victims, but rather the "sharpeners" in distress.
But let’s focus on the profound nature of what happened.
Formerly, in Orwell’s day, all power could be pooled like a Big Brother controlling every gesture of his subjects.
Orwell’s prophecy could have since turned out to be perfectly correct, where one can control every movement thanks to the telephone, every transaction made, the hotel visited, the highway chosen, and so on; the citizen would become the total victim of the eye of power.
But if one considers what is going on today, that even the secret crypts of power can no longer escape the control of a hacker, the control ceases to be one-sided and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker -- chosen as the citizen's avenger -- can learn the secrets of power.
But how can a power that is no longer able to keep its own secrets hold on?
True, Georg Simmel already said that a real secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that any knowledge of Berlusconi’s or Merkel’s character is basically a secret free of secrecy, as it reveals the public sphere; but to disclose in the style of WikiLeaks that Hillary Clinton’s secrets were empty power secrets means to rob them of all.
WikiLeaks has done no injustice to Sarkozy or Merkel, but to Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this insult inflicted on such a vast power?
It is obvious that in the future, the states will no longer put any reserved information online - this would be like a notice glued to the street corner.
But it is just as obvious that with the current technologies it is in vain to hope to be able to keep confidential reports over the phone secret.
Nothing is easier than figuring out if and when a head of state moved on a plane and contacted one of his colleagues.
How could private and ear-only relationships be maintained in the future?
I know very well that my prediction at the moment sounds like science fiction and romance, but I am compelled to imagine the government agents, moving in a secret way busily on uncontrollable routes, carrying their messages nowhere but in mere memory, and, moreover, hiding the little written information they have received, in the heel of their shoes.
The information would be stored in a single copy in locked drawers: basically, Watergate’s spying attempt was less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is progressing like a cancer these days, namely backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communication, the Internet reconstructed a telegraph with (telephone) wire.
The (analogous) videocassettes had enabled the film researchers to explore a film band by band, by winding from back to front and revealing all the secrets of the montage, while the (numerical) CDs nowadays allow nothing but to jump from chapter to chapter, i.e. in macro portions.
The high-speed trains run from Rome to Milan within three hours, while this takes three and a half hours by plane, including changing trains.
It is therefore not unusual for politics and communication technology to return to cars and horses.
One last observation.
In earlier times, the press tried to understand what secrets were being forged between the messages.
At present, it is the messages that demand confidential information from the press.
Climate: how France makes good on its financial promises
One year after the Copenhagen Treaty, it is time to examine the compliance of developing countries with the fast-fixed financing promises (also called "fast start" or premature financing).
And now the rough French fair speeches have been revealed.
Under the Copenhagen Treaty, developing countries pledged to provide $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The EU has promised 7.2 billion euros over three years, France 1.26 billion euros (i.e. 420 million per year).
On the occasion of the opening of COP16, the EU has drawn up all the registers to convince its partners of the fact of its commitment to fast-start funding: detailed progress report of its Member States, press conference, major side events, brochure distribution.
The transparency operation is remarkable and just appreciated for its intrinsic value: developing countries and civil society would like all developed countries to do the same on the same level of precision.
The EU announced that it had released 2.2 billion euros in 2010, setting it on the right track to paying respect to its commitment of 7.2 billion euros in 2012.
But when you look into the details, things are a little more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen Treaty, this money should be "new and additional" to ensure that an additional commitment was made without being detrimental to public development aid.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what "new and additional" means.
While the EU Commission had proposed harmonisation, certain member states, including France, blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the guideline that they consider to be the best.
The European Commission, for example, has chosen to set a benchmark for 2009: international funding will be maintained, and it will add 150 million to the "Fast Start" funding over three years.
Other countries have adopted similar benchmarks, either in terms of year or conditions at the level of official development assistance.
In return, France said that the financing of “all new projects” in 2010 was “new and additional.”
In other words, there are no benchmarks for expenditure in the previous year or at the global level of official development assistance.
In concrete terms, the total amount of French support to developing countries can remain stable (or even decrease) - France claims to comply with its commitment to "new and additional" financing.
Another crucial element is the breakdown into donations and loans.
There is no rule on this yet, and everyone chooses their calculation mode.
Some, such as France, find 1 borrowed € as the equivalent of 1 donated €.
Obviously, this is difficult to justify: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans for certain profitable investments (often mitigation-related projects based on the most effective technology) can be justified, it is deceptive to present the euro that is collected as the equivalent of a donated euro... In addition, only the cost of the loan to the investor country should be counted as commitment (i.e. the equivalent of an interest rate).
But France has nothing else in mind than the following consideration: it "respects" its commitment of 420 million euros by borrowing 91.5% (389.8 million euros) and donating 8.5% (36.1 million euros) - see also the EU document to convince itself of this.
France is the only country in the EU that uses loans on a large scale.
Germany is demanding 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (among others) are making 100% of their commitments with donations.
In other words, if the vast majority of the European Union spends 1€ to fulfil its obligations, France gives only 10 cents and understands a comparable commitment.
Beautiful hocus-pocus!
All in all, France operates in its fast-start financing with a double swindle: in part with a further development of the action over time and in part with the reality of financial commitment.
France manages to make it believe that it has spent 420 million "new and additional" million in line with its promises, saving 36.1 million euros.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (since it seems that it was Bercy who carried out the arbitrage) could have a doubly negative effect; once in the EU (why do the other member states continue to donate, if it is enough to borrow?) and then in the negotiations, since the developing countries are not completely fooled...
The chapter of premature financing is only a small question for a relatively short period of time compared to the entirety of discussions on climate.
But it could be the drop too much in the immense machinery of the UNFCCC.
Let us hope that this will not be the case.
However, it is essential to learn his lesson from this first year of early funding.
In the first place, France could announce a change in its accounting method for 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect for its obligations and rebalancing justice with the other countries of the European Union.
Above all, France could bring forward the discussions on the subject of long-term financing (another crucial issue that is currently under discussion): one cannot escape the question of "calculability" or the accounting method of its loans.
France could change its position to be as progressive on the issues as it is on other issues.
The hope is therefore based on the new environment minister Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprising announcement about France’s fast-start and its vision of “calculability” as well as the use of loans would inherently raise the international trust base necessary for further discussions.
Alarm - Pesticides ingested by children
A 10-year-old child consumes 81 different chemical substances over the course of the day, according to a study published this Wednesday by the Générations Futures Association (former movement to protect the rights and respect of future generations).
The association, which states that its results "given the small number of samples analysed, do not represent a statistically significant value, but rather illustrate the problem addressed", had bought between July and September the food usually consumed within four meals by a ten-year-old child, plus an intermediate meal in the supermarkets in Oise and Paris.
These typical meals – including the official recommendations of five fresh fruit and vegetables, three dairy products, and 1.5 liters of water per day – have been studied as well as lab-based snacks in search of chemical substances, pesticides, heavy metals, and other contaminants.
The plate balance is devastating: 81 chemical substances, including 42 classified as potentially or likely carcinogenic and five classified as safe carcinogens, as well as 37 substances with endocrine disruptor, according to studies from several institutions such as the International Cancer Research Center.
"Even if the legal limits for each chemical, individually taken substance are not exceeded in the approximate totality of the cases, it is very clear from this survey that the reality in which the consumer may be exposed to carcinogenic substances or substances with endocrine disruptor is worrying," notes the association.
At breakfast alone, the butter and tea with milk already contain more than ten of the potentially carcinogenic residues and three that have been safely proven to be carcinogenic, as well as more than twenty residues that can affect the hormonal system.
The apple imported from Brazil, intended as a snack for the study, has traces of six chemical substances, including a fungicide banned in France.
The same applies to the green beans from Kenya, including lunch, where the study found traces of an insecticide strictly prohibited in the EU.
In addition, the minced steak, the tuna from the can, even the baguette and the chewing gum were peppered with pesticides and other chemical substances.
In the case of tap water, the analyses revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
At dinner, the salmon steak was the "richest" with 34 identified, chemical residues, and even the plastic plate used to warm up the meal in the microwave was not unencumbered.
The ultimate risk of this “pollutant cocktail” for the consumer “is likely to be undervalued,” according to the study.
For its part, the Alliance Europe Ecology-Les Verts (EE-LV) has proposed “in view of the urgency of the situation” to introduce a moratorium on the use of pesticides to stop the “increase in civilization diseases”.
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) identified 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
