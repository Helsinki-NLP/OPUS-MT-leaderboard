Barack Obama becomes the fourth US president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
US President Barack Obama arrives in Oslo, Norway for 26 hours to accept the Nobel Peace Prize as the fourth US President in history.
In addition, he receives the diploma, the medal and a check for $1.4 million for his extraordinary efforts to intensify world diplomacy and cooperation among peoples.
The head of the White House arrives tomorrow with his wife Michelle in the northern metropolis and will be busy all the time.
First, he pays a visit to the Nobel Institute, where he meets for the first time with the five committee members who elected him in October from 172 people and 33 organizations.
The couple have scheduled a meeting with the Norwegian King Harald V and Queen Sonja.
In the afternoon, the visit reaches its climax with the ceremony at which Obama takes over the prestige prize.
He is the fourth President of the United States, but only the third to receive the award directly in office.
The White House has already warned that Obama will talk about the Afghanistan war when he takes over the award.
The president does not want to dodge this issue because he knows that he is taking the prize as a president who is currently waging war in two countries.
He stepped up the war effort a few days ago by sending more troops to Afghanistan, which none of his critics forget to highlight.
At the ceremony, Obama also received the gold medal, diploma and cheque for ten million Swedish crowns (about 24 million Czech crowns).
He intends to donate the money to charity, but he has not yet decided on a specific charitable work.
The program of events will include a banquet with the President and his wife, at which, in addition to Norway’s King and Queen, the Prime Minister and another 250 invited guests will be present.
Obama has been very cautious about the price from the start.
He said, for example, that he felt that he did not quite deserve the prize.
He also repeated several times that the price is not just for him, but for all those who aspire to the same values as him.
Immediately after the announcement, he stated that for him this is "invitation to action".
Conservationists accused of extortion
The Leitmeritz police accused the chairman of the citizens' association "Naturschutzgemeinschaft Leitmeritz" for blackmail.
In several cases, he filed appeals last year against some construction procedures, for the withdrawal of his appeals he demanded from investors money in his favor, said theLeitmeritz police spokeswoman, Alena Romova.
Chairman of the Leitmeritz Nature Conservation Community, Lubomir Studnicka.
Now he is in prison and faces a prison sentence of up to three years.
The sorting waste containers in Brno do not smell well
In Prague people can sort the beverage packaging, in the South Moravian villages you can find the sorting waste containers at every step.
And in Brno?
There you would have to reserve a few minutes to find the appropriate garbage cans.
I am not saying that the waste separation in Brno would not work at all.
But it seems to me that the Councillors do not care enough about this problem, even though we are the second largest city in the Republic.
Brno is in the waste separation in the jungle league, not only because we as citizens are always allowed to dispose of only paper, glass and plastics in the sorting containers here, but above all because of the number of garbage cans for such waste.
Have they ever tried in the center, for example, to dispose of the PET bottles in a collection basket?
This is art, above all it takes time and strong nerves.
The only place I've found by chance so far is the Moravian Square opposite the Affected Goose.
Mr Onderka should not annoy his colleagues, but that seems far too little to me.
Apart from the fact that the waste separation is also in other parts not a honey lick.
Whole rows of my friends therefore prefer not to sort the waste at all.
From laziness.
It is too far to the garbage cans.
I'm not surprised.
Even after the party, I offered to dispose of a few glass and plastic bottles.
But on the Konicova road I did not see any paint waste bins in sight.
Fortunately, I came to the right place while driving the tram.
The garbage almost ran out.
This is still the centre of Brno, which represents the whole city, isn’t it?!
However, ecology and some kind of aesthetics probably leaves the Brno socialists cold.
They’d rather buy the city an ice hockey league that shames us throughout the Republic, instead of buying a few more garbage cans and offering the sorting of more raw materials for a cleaner Brno.
I am glad that I was able to confirm my acceptance with official statistics as well, after searching the internet for a while.
According to the data of the company EKO-KOM, Brno is really the worst in the whole district of South Moravia.
The 'Paroubek' budget has withdrawn the money for pensions and sick pay
After the Left Party, despite the government’s view, gave more money to farmers and officials, there is no money left in the budget for pensions, sick pay and building savings.
But also not for the national debt interest or for the international court disputes.
This causes even more problems for those who will be in the government in the second half of next year, says the Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists pushed through the salary increase for some groups, they expected the government to borrow the money for the sensitive expenses, old-age pensions or for the sick pay. "This is just a postponement of the problems into the future, mine laying," says Janota.
Of the loans, namely, ever higher interest rates are paid, and you have to repay the money at some point.
Too much to choose from, where to take, the treasury is empty.
If the social benefits or costs for state-owned enterprises are not reduced, the tax must be increased.
For all those to whom the Left Party now gave more money: the fire brigade, the teachers, the farmers.
And later for their children.
To get the pensions or the sick pay, from whose account 1.8 billion have disappeared, people do not have to be afraid, they get this money.
But at the price that the state is indebted even more - next year, not only 163 billion will be missing in the state treasury, but far more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, the debt will rise ever faster and together with this also the costs and interest.
The state will need the money for the compensation, then it will no longer be enough to increase the VAT only slightly or to reduce the maternity allowance, as the government did in its counter-fiscal package.
Because of the transfer of money in favour of some electoral groups, five billion euros will also be missing next year for the expansion of motorways and railways.
It is mainly the sections won in the competition, which can no longer be re-projected and possibly discounted.
At the very least, which is also not free.
This means a delay or discontinuation of thirty large buildings, and Europe’s money creation is also at risk, warns the spokesman for the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka.
The CSSD has suggested that it solves the outflow of money Solomonically - it attacks the CEZ stock dividends, in which the state owns the majority, and from which the money is then distributed to the transport fund.
The problem is that the amount of the dividend is never safe and it is by no means an infinite source.
Last year, CEZ contributed 18 billion euros to the budget.
Every year, the dividends are used to pay the environmental damage liquidations, to replenish the pension account and this money also serves as a reserve for the planned pension reform.
With this trick, according to EU rules, the actual budget deficit rises to the level of 5.7 percent GDP.
But this does not end the carnival of upheavals.
Nearly three billion euros was cut in the budget for various compensations for victims of communism and crimes or for expenses for court disputes, even for building savings.
Whether the state can cope without this money is not certain.
This is pure gambling.
If we lose an international court battle, then we have to pay for it anyway, Janota clarifies.
The minister must then save the money internally or, in the worst case, attack the government budget reserve.
One hundred million euros are also missing for the already started two billion project "State Treasury", which is supposed to allow to monitor on-line what the individual authorities spend the money on.
The first stage starts in January.
If the finance minister does not find the money elsewhere, the project would have to be stopped and in this case there will be sanctions, warned Janota.
Your next smartphone will have two operating systems
The Americans expect for the future with a mobile phone on which the user can switch between different operating systems by pressing a single button.
The plans presented look promising.
It is enough to press only one button, and Windows Mobile will turn into Android within a few seconds of switching.
It is precisely this opportunity that the American company VMware wants to present, which focuses primarily on the development of virtual software for the computers.
We enable you to run two user profiles at the same time on your mobile phone.
You can switch between them, you can separate them into two home and work profiles.
Both will work in parallel, according to Srinivas Krishnamurti of VMware during an interview for Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November last year and presented for the first time a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
The virtualization of smart phones is not a fiction.
VMware successfully demonstrated the smartphone test pattern with two operating systems to the journalists.
One was a modified Nokia N800 with a RAM memory of 128 MB, on which the mentioned systems Windows Mobile and Android were running simultaneously.
The development of the new technology for mobile phones is in full swing.
Now the company VMware is working together with the European and American operators on the smartphone virtualization and the devices are to come to the customer within the year 2012.
Lack of snow on the mountains torments hotel owners
Snowless pistes do not only worry the Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e-inhabitants.
The lack of snow also deters people from ordering ski stays in hotels and guesthouses.
That is why in Giant Mountains you can still get free rooms for all winter dates including Christmas and New Year's Eve.
Our pages are visited frequently.
People go through the offers, set the prices, but now they are afraid to order bindingly.
And when they call us, they immediately ask if in our opinion this year's Christmas will be on snow or "on mud", the operator of the information portal Spindl.Info, Martin Jandura, said.
If you want to spend New Year's Eve in the spindle mill exactly according to your ideas, you should not hesitate to order.
Those who prefer saving and in which the quality of the stay comes only in second place, can try to wait a few more days.
The Spindelmühle hotel owners now offer mostly only weekly stays for New Year's Eve.
I think that they will try for a while to sell them, but then they too will have to give in, and respond to shorter times.
And then the free rooms will quickly dwindle, Jandura estimated.
The travel agency Ingtours in Vrchlabi always offers free beds on all winter dates.
Now we are most interested in the Christmas week, which is not yet sold out.
In our offer, about half of the seats are still free.
That is why we have already prepared some cheaper Christmas stays for the last moment, said the director of the travel agency Ingtours, Petr Schiefert.
The Vrchlabi travel agency can also offer New Year’s Eve in the Giant Mountains, but there are fewer free places here.
Good sales also find the first fourteen days in February, the remaining winter dates are sold on average.
This year, the interest in winter stays is also negatively influenced by the fact that there is always no snow in the Giant Mountains.
People are waiting for snow to fall.
Nobody wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
If the slopes are snow-covered within a week, Christmas will be sold out, says Schiefert.
Conversely and somewhat better than last year, the rooms at the Hotel Horizont in Pecpod Snezkou are occupied.
We are about five percent better than last year.
On New Year's Eve and Christmas we only have a few free rooms.
There is great interest in the Polish holidays in Janua, and in February the business will also run well, informed the director of the best Pec hotel, Karel Rada.
80 percent for New Year's Eve stays, the Hotel Omnia is also occupied at the central parking lot in Janske Lazne.
On the other hand, half of the beds at the newest hotel in Janske Lazne remain free for Christmas.
We were pleasantly surprised this year by January, for which we are already about 60 percent occupied.
February is a bit weaker now, but when the snow comes, interest in staying in the Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e Mountains will surely increase, said the director of the Omnia Hotel, Erik Sporysch.
The Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e hotel owners are now waiting for a bigger snow cover.
On Thursday it should cool down and if it rains, it should be snow on the mountains.
But after that, a warming should come again, informed Jiri Jakubsky from the location of the Czech Weather Office in Hradec Kralove.
USA: Repetition is Mother of Wisdom
It is almost comical with which student aspiration Barack Obama, the president with his call of the wisest, repeats the strategy of his predecessor in the Afghanistan question, which he himself considered to be the stupidest.
When he finally sweated out his much-anticipated Afghanistan doctrine, it turned out that he copied it from the copy paper from the Bush-Iraq scenario three years ago.
Not only did he use the phrase "as in Iraq" several times in the text itself, he even used the name of the January 2007 Bush Declaration as the name of his own declaration: "New Forward" without hesitation.
Three years ago, he himself criticized the Bush idea of sending fresh contingents of troops to Iraq, which was plagued by the civil war, as an “irresponsible and, in its consequences, karastrophic decision.”
The following months showed, however, that the Bush strategy, which was based on recommendations from the military, was the only possible and very successful strategy in that it is no longer talked about in the news about Iraq at all.
This did not improve Bush’s reputation, because objectively he left his successor with a much more grateful initial situation than could be expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes the miracle will repeat itself.
The military once again asked him to increase the troop contingent, especially the commander-in-chief of the Afghanistan operation General Stanley McCristal, who even despite the subordination habits harshly criticized the raging gunmen in the White House.
He called for 40,000 soldiers to be able to reverse the situation for the better.
The president hesitated for three months, but did not come up with a better idea, and so he cheated the general around 10,000 soldiers.
From Europe, he has pressed the commitment for another 5,000, even if he originally expected at least 10,000.
Most problematic of the entire Obama strategy is his plan to withdraw troops from Afghanistan in 18 months, and to complete this process within three years. The entire Obama Doctrine leaves more questions than answers.
Some doubt that the halved increase will have the same effect as the measure in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal war of recent years, Iraq society is relatively well structured, its leaders honor the values.
The Afghan situation is marked by the contraindication - no one can be relied on and no agreements are kept.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces, who are used to changing their minds every day.
The political institutions, even if they were formally established correctly, remain only sham buildings, behind which patriarchal tribal relations will continue to proliferate.
The balancing of interests between the different ethnic groups is unusually complicated, especially because of the ambiguity of the circumstances, which complicate the Pakistan and Iran influences even further.
Also, the building of a "capable state of action", which is the minimalist goal of the whole operation, is very unrealistic.
Time horizon of Obama strategy alienated by his voluntarism
Over the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only worsened and now it is on the verge of explosion.
Believing that the little soldiers who have broken out into the war cry about the "early homecoming" create a miracle here can only a truly romantic soul, which is not impressed by facts.
From a political point of view, the date for the withdrawal of troops is pure irresponsibility, because the Taliban will take this as the indirect confession of the American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that the willingness of Europeans to participate in the fighting in Afghanistan is running low.
Europe’s politicians cannot and do not want to explain to their voters how the security of Germany or Italy is related to the war in the Hindu Kush foothills.
Another possible factor that can radically influence the situation is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the increased sanctions do not affect the Iranians, a very serious question arises for the United States as to whether the problem cannot be solved with troops.
This question must be answered in the period when America is moving to the winner’s exit from Afghanistan after Obama.
Any solution, however, will also mean a dramatic turn in the Afghan situation.
The only consolation for Barack Obama is the fact that there are still three years left until the presidential election, and thus there is still enough time for him to resort to a different strategy if it turns out to be a total failure.
Goldman Sachs executives no longer receive cash bonuses
The senior executives of the American bank Goldman Sachs will no longer receive premium bonuses in cash this year.
This has been announced by the company, which is reacting to the sharp criticism of its wage practices.
A group of 30 top managers receive shares instead of the money, which can only be sold in five years.
In addition, the shares can be withdrawn from the managers in the case if they act excessively risky.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs is at the forefront of efforts to combine Wall Street’s premium bonuses with long-term performance.
I believe that Wall Street is aware of the further direction in which it has to go, led by the former banker of the society JPMorgan, Douglas Elliott.
The problem is in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs faced criticism after setting aside nearly $17 billion in premium bonuses for the first three quarters of this year.
The total amount of premium bonuses over the course of this yeara, according to the agency Reuters, is likely to exceed 20 billion dollars despite the measure announced today.
The high premium bonuses in the banking sector have become the hottest political issue in a number of countries since the start of the financial crisis.
Britain reported on Wednesday that it intends to tax the bankers’ bonuses, which exceed <0xC2><0xA3>25,000, once with a 50 percent tax.
France is also taking similar steps.
This year, women have won the Nobel Prizes in all disciplines, except in physics.
Five record women today in Stockholm from the hands of the King of Sweden Carl XVI Gustaf have taken over this year’s Nobel Prizes in the specialist categories and for literature.
In addition to the four scientists, among them was the German writer of Romanian origin, Herta Müller.
Two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, together with their compatriot Jack Szostak, have received the Nobel Prize in Medicine for research in the field of chromosomes.
The prize for chemistry was awarded to Ada Jonath, together with the Americans, Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz, for elucidating the ribosome structure and function.
The last Laureate was awarded the Nobel Prize for Economics, which the American Elinor Ostrom and her compatriot Oliver Williamson received for analyses of the economic report.
The only category in which no woman received a Nobel Prize this year was physics.
Today, scientists Charles Kao for fiber research and George Smith together with Willard Boyl for the CCD chip invention, which is the basis of all digital cameras, fax machines or astronomical telescopes, have won this prize.
Each of these laureates has received the diploma, the Nobel Medal and the certificate of acquisition of the cash prize.
That amounts to ten million Swedish kronor in each category.
If there are several prize winners in each category, the cash prize will be divided among them.
Traditionally, the American President, Barak Obama, has already received the most anticipated Nobel Peace Prize this afternoon in Oslo.
He acknowledged in his speech the controversy of his appointment, because he is only at the beginning of his path, and moreover stands at the head of the country that is waging two wars - in Iraq and in Afghanistan.
In keeping with his policy, however, he added that wars are necessary in certain situations for the achievement of world peace, even if the price for it is high.
Minister Janota is considering his resignation. Klaus invited him to the castle
President Vaclav Klaus receives the Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota, on Friday morning, who is considering his stay in the government, because he does not agree with the execution of the state budget for the next year in the form as it was released by the Assembly of Deputies on Wednesday.
It is assumed that Janota’s budget, and perhaps also Janota’s remaining in the cabinet, will be the subjects of Friday’s meeting.
The budget is also criticized by Klaus.
According to him, the budget deficit is too high, which also deepens the crisis of public finances.
The meeting was informed by the presidential spokesman, Radim Ochvat.
Janota wants to negotiate with the Prime Minister, Jan Fischer, on Monday about his continued stay in his function.
Under the budget law, which is now signed by Klaus, the Czech Republic should run a deficit of 163 billion kroner.
In parliament, however, on Wednesday, votes were taken on the Left Party’s proposals for the transfer of money and the money for state employees’ salaries, for the maintenance of social benefits and direct wages of farmers increased.
The government has countered the proposals of Social Democracy that they covertly increase the budget deficit.
Therefore, between the Left Party on the one hand and the government, Klaus and the Right Party, on the other hand, a sharp domestic political dispute has arisen, which raises the question mark about the further work of the Fischer Cabinet of Officials, on the design of which the ODS, CSSD and Green Party agreed in the spring.
Critics claim that the budget, as adopted by Parliament, virtually liquidates the package of austerity measures enforced by the Fischer government in the autumn, and that it is understood that it is intended to end the national debt.
Klaus, who can but does not have to sign the law on the state budget, explained today at the discussion breakfast with the entrepreneurs that the politicians have neglected the "serious problem" that represents "the unsustainable deficit" of public finances for a long time.
In his opinion, there is no good solution today.
An improvement could only bring a strong government that could build on a broader consensus of political parties.
The ODS chairman, Mirek Topolanek, pointed out that the budget is horrendous, and the government should weigh its continued existence.
The ODS deputy chairman, Petr Necas, told the CTK that the concept of the civil service cabinet, with the support of the CSSD, ODS and Green Party, obviously no longer works.
Prime Minister Fischer described similar words in the editorial as "strong sayings".
The CSSD boss, Jiri Paroubek, responded to the Topolanek words that the budget deficit was horrendous, that the former government of Topolanek had prepared for this year, and that exceeds 200 billion kroner.
As early as Wednesday, the CSSD assessed the approval of the state budget for the next year as a success.
The People’s Party was also pleased.
Mandela was played by Morgan Freeman in Clint Eastwood's new film
The South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film "Invictus: The Unbeaten" shows the world much of the country, of its struggle and victories despite some criticisms that the leading role was occupied by an American actor.
The story tells about sport, race and Nelson Mandela.
The indefatigable fighter against the racist apartheid government system in the South African Republic, as well as its first black president, Nelson Mandela, represents in his life story the American Oscar actor, Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said he was asked by ninety-one-year-old Mandela if he could portray him in the Eastwood film.
Another important role is played by Matt Damon.
I told him, "If I'm going to play you, I have to meet you.
The seventy-two-year-old actor, who received the award for his role in the Eastwood drama "Million Dollar Baby", was already the leader of the movement for the abolition of slavery, from which at the end has become the slave owner, a fictitious US president, and also God in "Evan Almighty", but rarely someone who is still alive and as important to many people as Mandela.
The former South African statesman spent 27 years in prison for his active work in ending apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was set free in 1990 and for four years he became president of the country.
In 1993, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
"Invictus" is the Latin word for "unbeaten", and at the same time is the name of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The requirement was how to talk to him.
The film depicts a true story in which Nelson Mandela joined forces with the captain of the South African rugby team, Francois Pienaar, to unite the country. The new President Mandela knows that his people still remain racially and economically divided even after apartheid.
He believes that he can unite his people through sport, so he decides to unite the rugby players who belong to the outsiders worldwide.
Finally, the South African team progresses to the 1995 World Cup.
Freeman worked for several years to bring the Mandela story to the cinema screen.
He had no other goal than to play this role in order to bring it as close as possible to reality, Freeman said.
The biggest challenge, of course, was to talk like him.
The actor said if he and the world politician were in the same country, he would try to meet with Mandela, have dinner with him, and be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to shake Mandela’s hand.
“I’ve found that when I shake your hand, I take over your energy, it gets transferred, and I felt like I know what you’re feeling,” he said.
It’s important for me to become a different person.
In the film, Matt Damon portrays Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Pienaar, captain of the national rugby team where the white players have prevailed.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for the role in the tough rugby world.
It was a big surprise for him when he met Pienaar for the first time in his house.
I remember when I rang the doorbell that it opened and the first thing I said to Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Pienaar in my life was, 'I look much bigger in the movie.'
Despite the obvious differences in the stature of the actors compared to their actual role models, he has received positive reviews under the direction of director Eastwood "Invictus: Unbeaten" and one speaks also of prospects for an Oscar.
The Daily Variety's film critic Todd McCarthy summed up his evaluation in the following words: "That was very good story, very well-executed film."
In the movie reviews on the web pages rottentomatoes.com, Invictus has received 76 percent positive evaluations.
Light secret over Norway dissolved: the Russians have tested a rocket
A special light effect of unknown origin was observed over Norway.
The Russian Ministry of Defense has just yesterday acknowledged that an intercontinental ballistic missile has been tested near the Norwegian border.
However, the launch was again unsuccessful and the missile, called the "Bulava" type, which was originally supposed to be the pride of the Russian army, will slowly become the nightmare of the Russian general and the prime minister, Vladimir Putin.
His repeated presence on site during the missile test had no positive effect on the success of the test flights.
Bulava has mostly not been launched at all or has been damaged in the air.
In the Russian newspapers one already writes about "Bulava" as about a "missile that does not fly".
A rocket that does not fly but shines
This already 13th attempt, went normal at the beginning.
It was only at the end of the flight that technical damage to the rocket occurred again.
The engine probably exploded in the third rocket stage.
This time "Bulava" took off from the nuclear submarine Dmitriy Donsky, which sailed under the waters of the White Sea.
This type of missile allows the launch from the submarine.
Therefore, it is likely that the mysterious light caused by an indeterminate flying object over northern roads was actually the damaged "bulava".
In addition, the Norwegians have not since the first moment doubted that it is a Russian missile.
This time, the generality has defended itself against it, claiming that one cannot clearly speak of a failure.
The first two stages of the rocket did not fail and the accident only affected the third stage.
In the previous cases, the engines were damaged in the first stage.
Even if no test launch was made without errors, the leadership of the Ministry of Defense considers only six out of thirteen to be unsuccessful.
The almost fifty percent success therefore fills the generality with optimism and so it is still claimed that the "Bulava" will fly without any problems and will even carry up to ten hypersonic nuclear warheads with a total weight of up to 1.15 tons.
The legendary Fetisov signed an annual contract with CSKA Moscow at the age of 51
The legendary defender Vjaceslav Fetisov introduces himself at the age of 51 in a professional ice hockey game.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup owner helps his team CSKA Moscow out in trouble, and will probably play against Petersburg in the Friday match KHL.
Fetisov, who finished his career at the age of forty, in 1998, is currently president of the CSKA.
After Denis Kuljas was injured, we urgently need another defender.
Fetisov has regularly trained and agreed that he will support the team.
We only need to clarify a few remaining formalities, the AP agency quoted the coach of the Moscow club of Sergei Nemcinov.
Meanwhile, it is not clear whether the comeback of the famous hockey player will only affect one game.
I think that Fetisov is one of those who can raise the morale of other players, Nemcinov pointed out.
If Fetisov gets back on the ice, he will be the oldest Russian professional ice hockey game, according to AP.
In the NHL, legendary forward Gordie Howe played an entire season for Hartford at the age of fifty-one, scoring 15 goals and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous five, Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful ice hockey players in history.
In the dress of the Soviet Union he has won two Olympic gold medals, seven world championship titles and he has also triumphed in the Canada Cup as well as in the Junior World Cup.
In the second part of his career, he also gained success in the NHL, where he twice overtook the Stanley Cup in the Detroit Dress.
Since 2001 he has been a member of the ice hockey star room.
Hyundai gave in to the unions. All overtime will be cancelled
The management of Nosovice’s Hyundai automobile factory agreed with the union to cancel all overtime.
Due to frequently ordered overtime, the union announced its readiness to strike on Monday.
This was confirmed by the spokesman of the Hyundai car factory, Petr Vanek.
However, the management wants to reach an agreement with the trade unionists about a Saturday shift this week.
We must not give up our production plan, which is a principle, so on Saturday, December 19, voluntary overtime was proposed for the reason that two work shifts would be worked, Vanek said.
The website Sedmicka.cz wrote that the company offered the employees who would work the Saturday shift a bonus of 400 CZK.
Employees will also receive it in retrospect for the Saturday shift of 28 November.
According to Vanek, the company has decided to change the type of employee motivation for the proposed overtime hours.
Either they get paid the overtime surcharge or they can take replacement leave on December 28 and thus extend the Christmas holidays, Vanek stated.
In addition, all employees of the Saturday shift are paid the fare and lunch.
In view of the fact that overtime was the most pressing and burning point regarding demands and complaints of the trade unionists who stopped production last week, the management decided yesterday afternoon with immediate effect on the cancellation of all overtime for the month of December, Van<0xC4><0x9B>k pointed out.
Until last week, the employees of the automobile factory had been forced to work 2 overtime hours practically every day after the eight-hour shift.
As of the signing of the agreement, the willingness of the trade unions to strike is revoked.
Further negotiations between the management of the automobile factory and the trade unionists are to take place on Friday afternoon.
The union leader, Petr Kuchar, said on Wednesday that if they can agree to meet the demands and sign a joint document, they would be ready to lift the strike readiness.
The situation in the automobile factory escalated last week, on Wednesday, when about 400 employees spontaneously went on strike because of constant overtime.
They also protested against poor payment terms and alleged harassment.
On the other hand, the management held that the employees had to work overtime to meet the automotive supply requirements.
The trade unionists also demanded in their Monday strike readiness declaration that the employees who had interrupted production last Wednesday are not subject to sanctions.
In the area of overtime, the trade unions are calling for the reduction of overtime to a minimum.
In addition, this year they demand the payment of 5000 crowns.
The Nosovice automobile factory Hyundai now employs 2,000 people.
Serial production was started at the company in November last year.
By this September, about 80,000 vehicles had been produced here, and the current production capacity is 200,000 vehicles per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that also works on ‘steeled’ HIV viruses
The team of Czech and German scientists is testing new compounds that are intended to prevent the spread of HIV viruses in the organism.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also works in viruses that are already resistant to drugs.
This fact outweighs the disadvantage that the compound does not act as strongly on common virus variants as one of the already existing drugs.
AIDS cannot yet be cured.
However, the patient's medication composition can prolong life and prevent the proliferation of HIV viruses in the body.
However, their use is accompanied by a whole series of side effects.
Incomplete suppression of virus proliferation also results in the development of so-called resistant viruses, against which drugs are no longer effective.
The work of the experts from three institutes of the Academy of Sciences CR, from the VSCHT (Chemical-Technological University) Prague and from the University of Heidelberg opens the way to dealing with virus resistance.
They have shown that the substances called metalocarboranes act on the protein responsible for the reproduction of the HIV virus.
The metalocarboranes are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block virus proliferation in a different way than all drugs used today, so they can overcome the resistance problem.
In their work, the scientists arrive at new <0xCC><0x81>improved <0xCC><0x81> compounds, which have been prepared on the basis of the knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding to the viral protein.
The metalocarboranes have a unique three-dimensional structure: two polyvalent cages consisting of boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms and coupled by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
Insidious and persistent virus
HIV protease is a protein of the HIV virus, which is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without the HIV virus cleavage caused by the HIV protease, no mature infectious virus particles would be formed.
When we turn off the HIV protease, we also turn off the proliferation of the virus in the patient’s body, the scientists explain in the press report published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences CR.
In the work, published in the scientific journal Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, the scientists describe whole series of compounds in which two pairs of cages (see table) are coupled by a short organic chain, which is then systematically further altered.
Slightly weaker, but more reliable
The effect of this series of substances against HIV protease was tested in test tubes, also against their resistant (resistant) variants obtained from HIV-infected patients.
The effect of the metalocarboranes on the usual enzyme variant is not as strong as in the clinically used drugs, but it does not lose its effect on the resistant variants, against which the drugs used are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of action and its other properties, such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of further chemical formation, make the metalocarborans interesting compounds for further research aimed at the development of effective anti-HIV drugs, says Pavlina Rezacova, head of the Structural Biology Laboratory of the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
Dispute over budget. ODS went to Fischer, who resists
The chairman of the ODS, Mirek Topolanek, described the approved budget for next year as "horrible" and the government of Prime Minister of Jan Fischer should, in his opinion, consider its continued existence.
The Prime Minister described the ODS statement as "strong statements".
There is supposed to be time for analysis.
Deputy ODS Chairman Petr Necas said that the concept of the Cabinet of Officials, with the support of the CSSD, ODS and Green Party, obviously no longer works.
According to Necas, the prime minister must decide whether he intends to rely on the minority in parliament when it comes to fighting the rising deficit, or whether he wants to remain in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
The approach of the ODS and the Social Democrats to the problem of public deficits is diametrically divergent, Necas has pointed out.
On Wednesday, Parliament adopted the 2010 budget, albeit with Left Party amendments over more than CZK 12 billion.
Parliament has increased the money for civil servants' salaries, for the maintenance of social benefits and for direct payments to farmers.
The government has countered the proposals of the Social Democracy that they covertly increase the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic is expected to have a deficit of 163 billion kroner.
The ODS has left the room before the vote, so it has complied with the desire of the government, because even the modified budget is only a less bad variant of the budget provisional.
Disappointment and futility
The Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota, has spoken about his disappointment and a sense of futility, whereas Prime Minister Jan Fischer has argued that the government is still assessing the current situation.
Necas is convinced that if Janota had seriously threatened to resign in the event that the amendments were accepted, the situation would be different.
According to Czech television, Janota has registered with the Premier for Monday after the government deal.
He has indicated that he is considering remaining in office.
The reason for this is his disappointment at the negotiation of the budget.
The extent to which Fischer supports the further struggle with the budget deficit, according to Necas, has nothing to do with the nominees of the Social Democracy (CSSD), who had enforced the changes in the budget, in the government.
The prime minister should also say clearly that he will resign if Parliament continues to adopt deficit-increasing laws, such as those affecting sick pay and pensions or the Service Act Amendment.
Topolanek: The ministers nominated by ODS were not wrong
That is up to the Prime Minister Fischer and the entire government.
The ministers nominated by the ODS have made no mistakes, Topolanek emphasized in a text message from the US.
It has mentioned that in some ministries there are people in deputy function who are committed to TOP 09, who voted against the budget.
Necas stressed that if Fischer decides to renounce the fight against the deficit level of public finances, "it is perfectly logical and correct that he relies on the left-wing majority that is currently in Parliament".
Then he allegedly cannot count on the support and tolerance of the bourgeois democrats.
I have not thought about it, and if that is the case, then I will deal with it, said Martin Bartak, the defence minister nominated by the civil democrats, to journalists in parliament.
Prime Minister Fischer flew to Brussels in the afternoon for the European Council.
The ODS resigned at the Prime Minister's request
At the same time, Necas stressed that the ODS would likely vote against the amended budget in parliament on Wednesday if the prime minister explicitly asked the deputies of the Citizens Democrats to allow the adoption of the budget.
We do not appear to be orphans, we are not small children, so he then responded to the question of whether the ODS was not pushed back in the political negotiation on the budget by the absence of the party leader in Parliament and in the Czech Republic.
I didn’t realize my voice was missing.
Even when I renounced the mandate, I knew that in the coming months it would be mainly about Bolshevization of the parliament and destruction of everything positive, Topolanek himself reacted.
According to the new timetable of the CD (Czech Railways), fewer trains will run for about the same fare.
From 13 December, the Czech Railways will terminate or limit some less busy express and local trains, while other connections will be strengthened.
The total volume of traffic will be reduced by two percent from the date of validity of the new timetable compared to today.
Most fares including basic and customer fare will not be changed.
For example, the residents of the Ostrava region will have several connections to the capital, and the railway will use Pendolino trains for this route.
The express train will no longer run to Bratislava (Pressburg).
Fewer express trains will also run on the Prague - Pisek - Budweis route, in principle the direct connections from Prague to Letohrad will be reduced.
The biggest reduction is planned by the railway in the district of Hradec Kralove (King's Graz), a total of eight percent, while Prague and the surrounding area can look forward to an increase.
Two night trains on the Prague - Tabor - Budweis route will also be lifted and the operation of some express trains on the Prague - Pisek - Budweis route will be reduced to a few days a week.
Among the biggest changes is the introduction of the new direct transport route from Milovice to Prague, currently the residents of Milovice have to change to Lysa nad Labem.
This is the fifteenth route of the Esko suburban transport system, which can be opened thanks to the railway electrification from Lysa nad Labem to Milovice.
The long-distance routes to the capital will end at the destination station Prague - Central Station.
The CD introduces more connecting lines SC Pendolino between Prague and Ostrava and the trains to Sumperk/Jesenik will run at a time interval of two hours.
Passengers can no longer travel to Bratislava with the Pendolino since 13 December.
This year's bill for regional railways: increase by 200 million
The high-speed trains are ordered and paid for by the Ministry of Transport, the railway receives a total of four billion kroner in the next year to settle the so-called loss of liquidity, exactly as this year. The local trains supply the districts, they pay a total of eight billion kroner in the next year, with the state contributing three billion kroner.
This year, the regional trains are 200 million Czech crowns more expensive.
For local trains and express trains, the railway has re-signed a ten-year contract, until now the contract has only been concluded for one year.
The railways praise the system, perhaps that is why they have not used to increase the price of the large majority of tickets.
There are only changes for one-day network tickets CD Net and for cheap internet tickets eLiska.
For passengers without the customer card, the price of CD Net will be increased from 450 crowns to 600 crowns.
The price eLiska will then depend on the driven plug, until now it was uniform for the journey between any district cities and cost 160 crowns.
Philippine millitantes arrested more than 50 people, the children were released.
Millitantes today abducted 75 people in the south of the Philippines, including some elementary school students and their teachers.
The agency AFP, which initially informed only about 65 abductees.
All 17 children detained were released after eight hours, including one teacher.
The kidnapping took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
About 19 militants allegedly used the hostages as a living shield in the escape from the police.
The local negotiators are now trying to hand over the remaining hostages.
According to the agency AFP, the militants belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is the armed faction of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AP, the police persecuted the kidnappers for the violence that demanded revenge between the two local family clans.
In the south of the Philippines, in the province of Maguindanao, the right to stand was imposed because of the recent massacre, in which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the November 23 massacre, which was linked to the election to the governorship, were 30 journalists.
Suspected of participating in the massacre, the governor of this southern Philippine province and his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of the influential Ampatuan clan, were arrested.
Muslim separatists are also active on the island of Mindanao.
But on Tuesday, the peace negotiations with the Philippine government resumed.
The history of South Africa affects everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Nelson Mandela
In the next few days, Clint Eastwood’s new Hollywood film will be released in the American cinemas “Invictus: the Unbeaten”, which includes part of the life story of the former President of the Republic of South Africa, Nelsona Mandela.
The role of the world-famous anti-apartheid fighter has been given to Morgan Freeman, who was allegedly chosen by Mandela himself a few years ago.
The supporting role of the legendary South African champion in rugby, Francois Pienaar, has received Matt Damon.
With the release of the film, reactions from critics and the public are also heard.
Nelson Mandela
His full name is Nelson Rolihlaha Mandela, born on July 18, 1918 in South African Mvez.
He was awarded the Sachar Prize in 1988 and the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993, together with de Klerk.
He was elected President of the Republic of South Africa in 1994-1999.
Great expectations are set in the film because it comes at a time when, on the one hand, the preparations for the World Cup culminate in South Africa, but at the same time the media shake the world public with frightening news about the rising racial hatred and discrimination of the inhabitants by the black ruling majority.
According to the news agency AP, the reactions to the new film in South Africa are for the time being consistently positive, despite numerous reservations against the cast of the leading roles with American Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman is proud of the new film.
I have dreamed of this role for many years and have prepared myself well for it.
Several times I also met Nelson Mandela personally, so that I can receive his energy, as they say, he performed in the interview after the festival premiere of the film in Los Angeles.
I think it’s good that with this film we can remember Mandela’s personality and his message.
This is a history of South Africa, but it affects every person, he added.
In the dress of the rugby national team
The film is based on the book template of the British writer John Carlin, freely translated “In the role of the enemy”: Nelson Mandela and the game that united the people portrays the South African human rights defender within his first presidential election period.
Morgan Freeman, in the course of the film, strives to bring together two racially and for years and days mutually demarcated populations and like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he also enters the World Cup field, which South Africa won in his role in the South African National Rugby Dressage.
For entering the lawn in the dress, which is considered almost a sacred act in South Africa, Mandela harvested large ovations fourteen years ago, predominantly from the white public, and has thus won the recognition of the white population.
The Rugby Championship may succeed in uniting people into a single people, led by rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" in the national team in 1995.
Whether the tense situation in South Africa will improve, that will only show.
The white South Africans, however, are skeptical, as, for example, in a recent interview for LN revealed the rugby fan, Christopher Dawson, who fled the country to the UK.
The championship begins on June 11, 2010.
In the Louny area, transformers burn for several 10 million crowns
The fire broke out in the morning at the Ceps transformer in the switchgear at the municipality of Vyskov in the Louny area.
According to the spokesman of the district fire brigade Usti nad Labem, Lukas Marvan, six units intervened in the fire.
Originally, the fire department wanted to burn out the transformers, but later it changed the view and now the fire is extinguished with a mixture of water - foam and special extinguishing agents.
The cause was a technical defect, a transformer internal short circuit.
No one was injured, the accident did not endanger the safety operation of the line system, according to company spokeswoman Pavla Mandatova.
The damage was estimated at several 10 million crowns, more precisely the damage will only be quantified after the fire.
The destroyed transformer must be replaced by a new one according to Mandatova.
For over 10 years, nothing similar has happened at the company Ceps, mistakes of this kind are rare, she added.
The power supply was not interrupted according to the spokesperson of the company CEZ for northern Bohemia, Sona Holingerova, and the functioning of households, authorities and companies was not affected by the fire of the transformer station.
A.G. Ceps operates in the Czech Republic as the sole operator of the line system, the 400 kV and 220 kV electric lines.
It maintains, renovates and develops 39 switchgears with 67 transformers, with which the electrical energy is transferred into the distribution system and line section with a length of 4339 kilometers.
Jancura filed a criminal complaint for defamation against three leaders of the CSSD.
The owner of the Student Agency, Radim Jancura, is filing a criminal complaint today for defamation against three social democratic leaders.
Against Michal Hasek from the district of South Moravia, Radko Martinek from the district of Pardubice and the head of the district of Olomouc, Martin Tesarik.
Jancura said this in a twenty-minute interview in the radio journal.
The lawsuit is related to the company's effort to operate regional train traffic in some districts.
However, all regions have signed the long-term contracts with the Czech Railways.
All three ladders attack us and say that we are taking out the raisins, but we have only made the offer on the scope as it was agreed with them.
They claim that we are expensive than the Czech Railways because we would know the prices of the Czech Railways, which were closed last week.
We have no choice but to defend ourselves.
Because of this defamation of the society Student Agency, Jancura told the radio journal.
At the same time, he claimed that he has evidence from all districts that they have taken their steps in accordance with European law.
That is why we are preparing an indictment for the European Commission.
Hasek considers the criminal complaint to be the continuation of the Jancura media show, which serves him as a free advertisement for his company as well as for his own person.
I am, of course, ready to defend my good name and the good reputation of my district, and I call on other leaders to do the same.
I assume that it will also become clear on this matter that it is Jancura who manipulates the public in the matter of regional rail transport and uses lying and untrue arguments, Hasek said.
Jancura already reported last week that he has invested several million crowns in advertising, which will point to the adverse move of the districts.
He told the radio journal that he is interrupting the campaign after Christmas and wants to continue it after New Year.
He stated that he will lead the campaign against corruption as such.
The campaign was launched by Jancura after the districts agreed to operate regional railway services with the Czech Railways and did not tender for the contract in a high of 150 billion kroner.
According to Vancura, such conduct is unlawful and contrary to the requirements of the European Court of Justice.
Because of the criticism of the train traffic in the districts, he also threatened, according to Jancura, already a deputy of the CSSD.
The only threat was if we didn’t give up on the fact that we could lose the bus licenses.
He introduced himself as a member of the CSSD, I know who it is, I do not say his name, said Jancura today the radio journal.
Vaccination against pneumococcal disease free and voluntary
Imfung against pneumococcal changes from January the usual.
It should be the first for the families free and voluntary.
But voices are already reporting that mandatory vaccination would be more effective.
The preparations for the introduction of the free vaccination against pneumococcal disease culminate.
The Institute of Medicine already sets the maximum prices of vaccines that health insurance companies have to pay.
The experts are also clear about the vaccination procedure.
New vaccination
Vaccines free for August children
Starting in January, children can be vaccinated free of charge against pneumococcus who were born on August 2 last year and later.
The condition st that they have not yet received a vaccine dose.
If you have already started the vaccination last year or earlier, you must also pay for further re-vaccination yourself.
The first dose of vaccination must be given between the 3rd and 5th month of the child’s life.
Last year, a quarter of the families had their children vaccinated against pneumococcal disease.
The parents paid 1,600 crowns and more for one dose.
Four doses are required to vaccinate the youngest children.
On the whole, the experts estimate that health insurance for the vaccine doses spends 300,000 to 450,000 crowns per year.
However, they save on the treatment that the children would need without vaccination.
So far, the state has spent about 500,000 per year on all area vaccinations for children.
The mandatory vaccination was introduced with the so-called Janota package.
Pneumococcal causes middle ear inflammation, but also severe infections including brain inflammation and blood poisoning.
As a result of pneumococcal infections, up to 28 children up to the age of 10 years die per year after examination in hospitals.
Outside the Czech Republic, the mandatory vaccination of children against pneumococcal disease was introduced in about 40 countries.
Will vaccination be mandatory?
At the same time, it is said that this vaccination could be mandatory in the future.
From January, it will be paid for by the insurance companies and voluntary.
The fact that compulsory vaccination would be better was mentioned, for example, by the head of the citizens' association Nahlas, Rudolf Kalovsky.
His association has been promoting the pneumococcal vaccination in the long term.
The experts at the international conference in which our association was involved were not very satisfied with the fact that we have voluntary vaccination.
That's not ideal.
On the other hand, we are glad that we managed to enforce at least that.
“I think that’s the way we have to go now,” Kalovsky said.
However, the Ministry of Health does not want to change the vaccination procedure against pneumococcal disease.
At this moment, we are not considering that at all, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sesen.
Voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks, doctors claim.
The chairman of the Society of Practical Pediatricians, Hana Cabrnochova, admits that a voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages.
“In a situation where the vaccine is so expensive, we understand the political decision that this vaccine was started as a voluntary one,” says Cabrnochova.
Experts expect more than 80 percent of parents to vaccinate their infants against pneumococcal disease from next year.
The vaccination against pneumococcal disease is also groundbreaking in that it is the first area vaccination paid for by the health insurance companies and not by the state.
The insurance companies should spend the money on prevention, thus saving them for further treatment, explains Cabrnochova.
The doctors have to buy the vaccines themselves.
However, this is a concern of the practical pediatricians, which concerns the purchase of vaccines.
According to the original plan, the vaccines should be purchased by the insurance companies and the doctors should receive them in the same way as other vaccines issued to them by the state.
However, some MPs feared that the insurance companies would be able to "execute the money from the health insurance".
Therefore, doctors will have to buy the vaccines themselves and wait for the insurance companies to pay them.
According to the estimates, the individual practical doctors will have to invest 40,000 crowns per month, which is a significant sum.
This will not be easy, says Cabrnochova.
US artist's son involved in 'museum theft'
The son of famed American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta was accused of attempting to steal $20 million worth of paintings from his father’s museum.
According to the Pennsylvania police, Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught while loading 90 paintings into his trailer vehicle.
It is said that Frank Frazetta junior and another man used an excavator to enter the museum in the Pocono Mountains.
81-year-old Frank Frazetta Senior is famous for his portrayal of figures such as Conan the Barbarian and Tarzan.
As reported by the Associated Press news agency, the artist was in Florida at the time of the incident.
AP quoted an unnamed police officer as saying Frank Frazetta Junior may have been motivated by a family feud.
The agency reported that, according to a police affidavit, Frazetta Junior claimed he was instructed by his father “to enter the museum by any means necessary to bring all the paintings to a warehouse.”
The agency said Frank Frazetta Senior denied any permission.
Labour defends budget and tax increases
Ministers have defended the tax increases and spending freezes announced in the pre-tax report against criticism from the opposition, the economy and the trade unions.
Conservatives said Alistair Darling had "lost" an opportunity to show that he was serious about reducing the deficit by pushing the decisions out until after the election.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer also came under fire for targeting low- and middle-income workers.
His main proposals include a 0.5 percent increase in social security and a 1 percent cap on public wage settlements for 2011.
Social security annoyances
The unions have protested that low-wage workers are being punished for a recession they didn’t cause and warned of impending “problems.”
The increase in social security – to around <0xC2><0xA3>3 billion a year – has angered the private sector, which says this is a tax on jobs, although the focus should be on economic recovery.
The increase, limited to those earning more than <0xC2><0xA3>20,000 a year, will affect about 10 million workers.
HEAVY POINTS OF THE TEMPERATURE ETA REPORT
Increase in social security by a further 0.5% from April 2011
This year, the economy is shrinking by more than the expected 4.75%
New 50% tax on banker bonuses
1 percent increase in corporate tax for small businesses rejected
Tax breaks for electric vehicles and wind turbines
Increase in state pensions by 2.5%
According to estimates by the Treasury, someone with an annual income of <0xC2><0xA3>30,000 will be poorer by <0xC2><0xA3>90 per year, and someone with <0xC2><0xA3>40,000 per year will be poorer by <0xC2><0xA3>190, while a person with <0xC2><0xA3>10,000 annual income will be richer by <0xC2><0xA3>110.
Ministers said their goal of deficit halving by 2013 meant “difficult decisions,” but they also said that 60% of the burden of additional taxes would be on the 5% of top earners.
Finance Minister Stephen Timms denied that the outlined tax increases and spending stops compared to the necessary measures would be "a drop in the ocean."
"These are big numbers, they will bring us the deficit halving and this is absolutely necessary over the next four years," he told the BBC.
Timms said he was confident the economy would return to growth by the end of the year.
Labour’s predictions of future economic growth – affecting the scale of new debt and the speed of deficit amortization – were questioned after the Chancellor of the Exchequer was forced to revise earlier figures.
He said in his statement that the economy is likely to shrink by 4.75% this year – far more than the 3.5% decline predicted in April – while debt would be <0xC2><0xA3>3 billion higher than previously estimated.
"Missed opportunity"
The Conservatives, who want to launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday to warn of Labour’s “debt crisis,” said the planned <0xC2><0xA3>789 billion debt over the next six years is unsustainable.
They added that ministers have failed to present a credible plan on how they will pay it back and are “cynically” squeezing out of difficult decisions until after the election – which must take place by June 2010 at the latest.
"They didn't say anything significant about what they're going to do," shadow finance minister Philip Hammond said. "They had their opportunity to do this, and they let them pass."
"The significant announcements will only be made after the election, whoever wins them."
Roger Bootle and Deloitte
Labour insists that schools, hospitals and the police will be saved from future cuts, unlike in the Conservatives’ proposals, which see the deficit cut coming faster and sooner.
But the Liberal Democrats said the money won by the tax increases and spending stops will be used to cover next year’s spending, not to reduce the deficit, and therefore argue that the plans are “built on sand.”
The BBC’s political editor, Nick Robinson, said that at the time of the announcements – such as the above inflation adjustment on some disability pensions next April – some things would expose the Chancellor of the Exchequer to allegations of vote capture, as the money could simply be recovered next year.
Labour insists on providing the extra help when people need it most and that the situation will be re-examined in September 2010.
"Hohler budget"
Although ministers have not disclosed any budget details beyond 2011, economists say that pressure on public spending will only come to fruition in the medium term.
The acknowledged Institute for Tax Investigations said the Chancellor’s figures would mean strong cutbacks in many areas, possibly also in the areas of transportation, higher education, science and defense in the future.
“It only shifts the pain to later,” said its leader Robert Chote.
“The significant announcements will only be made after the election, whoever wins them,” added Roger Bootle, a business consultant at the accounting firm Deloitte.
"This was just the hollow preliminary budget report. The markets recognize that."
FBI investigates 'arrests of U.S. citizens in Pakistan'
The FBI is investigating the arrest of five reported U.S. citizens on suspicion of extremist ties in Pakistan.
The men were arrested in a raid on a house in Sarghoda, in the eastern Punjab province, the American embassy in Pakistan told the BBC.
The FBI said it is investigating whether these are the same men who were reported missing last month in the U.S. state of Virginia.
The U.S. State Department said they are also looking for information about the men.
Three of them are believed to be of Pakistani descent, one is of Egyptian origin and the other has a Yemeni background.
"Of course, if they are American citizens, we are very interested in the charges they are being charged with and the circumstances under which they are being held," Kelly said.
FBI spokeswoman Katherine Schweit said the agency had been informed of the arrests and was in touch with the families of the missing students.
"We are working with the Pakistani authorities to find out their identities and the purpose of their stay there, if it is indeed the missing students," she said.
The Pakistani embassy in Washington announced that the men were arrested in a house belonging to the uncle of one of the students.
He said the local police had been interested in the house before and that no charges had yet been filed against the arrested men.
The Reuters news agency reported that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton declined to comment on the arrests, but she said the U.S. must “cooperate more closely with Afghanistan and Pakistan in eradicating the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people.”
The five students were reported missing by their families in northern Virginia at the end of November.
Amnesty condemns 'abuses' in Iran
According to a report by the human rights organization Amnesty International, human rights in Iran are still as bad as they have been in the past 20 years.
The report detailed "abuse patterns" by the regime, both before and after the contested presidential elections in June.
One man, quoted in the report, said he was beaten and burned with cigarettes. Another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran rejected earlier criticism of its human rights record.
Officials said such criticism was politically motivated.
After the contested election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, thousands of people were arrested and dozens killed in Iran, leading to the largest street protests since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Dozens received prison sentences and prosecutors said at least five people were sentenced to death.
BBC Tehran correspondent Jon Leyne, who is now in London, said that at the beginning of the protests, the top leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, acknowledged some of the abuse allegations and ordered the closure of the Kahrizak prison.
But since then, there has been no tolerance on the part of the authorities for criticism, our correspondent said.
"False confession"
Amnesty International cited the report of 26-year-old computer science student Ebrahim Mehtari, who said he was indicted for “working with Facebook networks” and for protesting the election results.
"They hit me in the face often," he was quoted as saying.
"I was burned with cigarettes under my eyes, in my neck, on my head ... they threatened me with death and they humiliated me".
After five days, he signed a false confession and was released on the street, still bleeding and half unconscious, Amnesty said.
Defeated presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said some protesters arrested after the election were tortured to death in prison in August and others raped.
The Iranian authorities denied the rape allegations, but admitted that abuses have taken place.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former inmate who said he had been detained with 75 others for more than eight weeks in a container at a detention centre in Kahrizak.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian parliament and judicial authorities had set up a committee to investigate the post-election unrest and the government’s reactions to it, but said Amnesty, the mandates and power of these bodies were unclear and the results obtained by the parliamentary committees had not been published.
The group said at least 90 people had been arrested in the last three weeks to prevent further demonstrations.
Ski slope was set up in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow were used to turn a Bristol landmark into a competitive track.
The ski slope of this park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders who fought for cash prizes.
At the top of the slope in Brandon Hill Park, there was a short ski jump at the beginning of a 100-meter-long slope.
Student John Hickman, a fourth-year medical student, said there was a beautiful view from the top of the slope, but it was also pretty intimidating.
It's a great view with all the lights of the city glistening below.
He added: “It’s some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the country here – some real talent.”
Prizes were awarded for the best tricks performed on the slope.
After the event on Thursday evening, the snow is left to melt.
Still she and we
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and Pragmatism in a Secular State.
At a time when Swiss voters have voted for a building ban on minarets and concerns about the alleged Islamization of Europe are widespread, John Bowen, an American academic, has written a well-founded and thoughtful report on whether Muslims can be integrated into one of Europe’s most secularized societies — and will be integrated.
Some readers will read this new book out of admiration for the author's last work: "Why the French Don't Like Headscarves" (2006), an elegant and densely argumentative study of a dispute that divided and occupied the country over a decade and a half and whose effects can still be felt today.
Bowen’s latest book offers a broader and bolder spectrum.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and the media are saying about Islam in France, but what is really happening in the field.
He has spent months in mosques, schools and institutes that now provide “Islamic freedom” to the 5 to 6 million Muslims in France, as Bowen calls it.
He is a good listener, he replays debates between teachers and students about the questions that worry them most.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or a town hall (or both)?
Should young Muslims be taught about the evolution and rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it permissible for a Muslim to use an interest-based banking system to get a mortgage?
It is these seemingly profane matters, he claims, that make up daily life, in contrast to the political dramas that occupy the media.
The author recognizes a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, none of them with a known name, possibly with the exception of Tarik Ramadan, a Swiss-born Arab-Muslim scholar and academic.
This new generation is trying to open the debate about how it is possible to be a good Muslim on the one hand and a good citizen on the other in a modern secular society.
They don’t have all the arguments on their side.
The conservatives are suspicious of the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists Bowen interviewed are mostly at odds with their Salafi counterparts—supporters of purist Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia—who today show a small but influential presence among Europe’s Muslims.
Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But an agreement requires a give and take on both sides.
He questions the extent to which French political decision-makers (and the intellectual elite, who so passionately guard the separation of church and state) are truly committed to pluralism.
He suggests that Muslims may experience harsher treatment than Catholics, Protestants, and Jews, who, in turn, have had to make their historic compromise with secular republicanism.
He recognises a "tightening of the value screws" rather than a growing pragmatism.
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, one is inclined to say "Yes, but not yet".
The most bleak view in the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other environmental region on Earth.
The ice that marks them melts at an alarming rate, taking life with it that can’t survive anywhere else.
Oil, gas, shipping and fishing interests have moved into the recently open water, with diplomats, lawyers and now authors in their wake.
Richard Ellis, an author and illustrator, draws in "On Thin Ice" (original title: "On Thin Ice") a natural history of the icon of the North, the polar bear.
Involved in the complicated history and politics of whaling, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers who have proven themselves in the hunt for polar bears.
Admiral Nelson’s encounter with a polar bear as a brave 14-year-old ensign at sea who fought only with the butt of his musket is certainly a legend, but others are true.
Young bears caught swimming behind the bodies of their recently killed mothers were taken to zoos and circuses.
A circus performance at the beginning of the 20th century featured 75 polar bears at a performance.
Even today, zoos still typically have a millionth of the habitat of an old wild animal. The climate is rarely suitable: The polar bear in Singapore became completely green from the algae that grow in the hollow hairs of its fur.

Ellis refers to the accounts of other authors and historians and often returns to the threat that hunters pose to the species’ survival.
Although banned in Norway, America and Russia, the killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where hunters in helicopters and snowmobile-riding Inuit use powerful assault rifles to hunt down their prey.
Ironically, the ice will last the longest in the waters to the north of these two hunting nations.
In his new book, After the Ice, Alun Anderson, a former editor of the science magazine New Scientist, offers a clear and disturbing description of the science of the Arctic and a gripping insight into how the future might unfold.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can adequately explain the speed of change.
However, this is not due to a lack of explanation.
The pioneering journeys of Fridtjof Nansen at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century hinted for the first time at the turbulence of the pack ice.
In the Cold War, submarines measure the shifting ridges as they go under.
A useful addition are satellite surveys and the large-scale application of measuring probes on icebergs, but still much is achieved by intrepid people camping outside in the cold.
Anderson takes a look at the peculiar, tiny world of the inflow system within the Arctic ice, which is formed by saltwater mandrels compressed during freezing.
But, from the bear on the ice to the microscopic marvels in the ice, all are at risk once the summer ice passes, which is expected in the period between 2013 and 2050.
"In a few months... this could be us"
Marines were among the 6,000 who laid wreaths at Arlington.
De'Angello Robinson travelled by bus for seven hours to lay a single wreath on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who made the journey from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina, to the National Cemetery in Arlington to decorate graves, the day was a tribute to the men and women in whose footsteps they have followed.
“In a few months, wherever we’re brought back from, that could be us,” Robinson said of the fallen soldiers.
If we were, I would wish someone would do the same for me, so I try to show my respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who had gathered on Saturday morning to lay wreaths on the graves of veterans in several sections of the Arlington Cemetery.
Morrill Worcester, owner of the Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, founded this tradition in 1992 when he and several others decided to decorate several hundred graves in the Arlington cemetery.
It is now an 18-year-old tradition and Morrill and his wife Karen, who take this trip every year, stop in different cities along the way to hold events dedicated to people in the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit organization, Wreaths Across America, which expanded the event to other states.
This year, volunteers laid more than 16,000 wreaths on the graves at Arlington Cemetery, in areas at the Pentagon, at graves at Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, at Battery Park in New York, and at the memorial for United Airlines Flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second time, the Walmart Foundation donated more than $150,000 to purchase and transport the wreaths.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster, said she made the trip to Arlington in memory of her husband, a deceased professional soldier.
Although her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said, this is her way of giving back to those who made sacrifices.
She said this is a small contribution to how we civilians can support our soldiers.
It’s like visiting a family cemetery.
Wrapped in layers of warm clothing, the volunteers wandered across the extensive lawns and hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers targeted older graves from World War I and World War II and the Vietnam War, as these are not visited as often as the newer graves, according to the organizers.
The mood was cheerful, children were playing and couples were holding hands as they carried the fresh pine branches to the graying gravestones.
Each round wreath was dark green with a small red ribbon attached to the upper part.
Section 60, which is located nearby and where mainly veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, remained almost calm.
The United Service Organizations donated 1,000 wreaths to adorn this section, but the gloomy mood of the current wars filled this area.
Individuals wept openly, others prayed, and families and friends held on to each other in the icy air.
Some read aloud the names carved in stone, while others leaned down to small black and white place cards that had been put in the damp mud for those whose tombstones had not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who shed bitter tears in front of her son’s grave.
She traveled 8 hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the burial place of Marine Infranty Sergeant David Shane Spicer, who fell in combat in July.
No one should ever forget why we are free..., my son paid for it, she said.
“When I’m gone for a long time, I want someone to remember him.”
US government contractors arrested by Cuban authorities
The Cuban government has arrested a U.S. government contractor who sold mobile phones and notebook computers in the country, State Department officials said Saturday.
The contractor, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc., based in Bethesda.
The company works on projects for clients such as USAID, the US Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officials at the U.S. representation of interests in Havana are trying to gain access to the prisoner who was arrested on December 5.
The special charges have not yet been released, although under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be arrested for almost anything, under the accusation of "threat."
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, which include light protests and critical writings, pose a risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and statements are considered a serious crime.
Cuba has a growing blogging community led by popular reporter Yoani S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez, who often describes how she and her husband are being persecuted and attacked by government officials.
S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez has repeatedly asked for permission to leave the country to accept prices, but this has always been rejected.
The arrest of an American contractor is likely to heighten tensions between the Castro brother’s communist government in Cuba and the Obama administration, which had sought a “slow” rapprochement to improve relations with the island.
The news of the arrest was first reported Friday night by the New York Times.
The new U.S. policy emphasizes that the United States will pay in return if the Cuban government takes concrete steps in this direction, such as releasing political prisoners and creating more room for opposition.
Mobile phones and notebooks are legal in Cuba, although they are new and sought-after products in a country where the average earnings of a government employee is $15 per month.
The Cuban government has only allowed ordinary citizens to buy a mobile phone since this year, they are mainly used for sending text messages, since a 15-minute phone call would cost a day’s pay.
Internet use on the island is extremely limited.
It is accessible in expensive hotels and there for foreign visitors and at some government offices, such as universities.
Cubans who want to log in often have to report their names to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
In Cuba, the arrest of an American is rare.
Most of the few U.S. citizens who are in prison in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug smuggling, said Gloria Berbena, the press secretary for the U.S. representation of interests in Havana.
Berbena said she could not provide any further information on the arrest.
The arrest and detention are clearly wrong.
An activity that would be legal in any other free society - the giving of free mobile phones - is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, head of the American section of the group "Human Rights Watch", which recently released a hard report on freedom in Cuba entitled "New Castro, same Cuba", a nod to the inauguration of Raul Castro as leader of the country, replacing the sick older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said the defendants were very often arrested, convicted and imprisoned within a day.
He said that probably any solution would be political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, just at the time when both countries are moving toward more willingness to dialogue with each other.
Pakistani government officials reveal plan to send men to Afghanistan
Pakistani authorities discovered on Saturday a purportedly leading head of a conspiracy aimed at sending five men from northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill U.S. soldiers, saying they hope this case could help uncover an extensive network of terrorist recruiters scouring the Internet for radicalized young men.
Investigators said they were looking for an opaque insurgent, known as Saifullah, who invited the men to Pakistan after he tracked them down because one of them made approving comments about terrorist attacks on the internet video site YouTube.
Saifullah became the leader of these men after their arrival in Pakistan, trying to help them reach the remote area in Pakistan’s tribal belt that is home to Al Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence official who was briefed on the matter said on Saturday Saifullah could not convince al-Qaeda leaders that the men were not part of a CIA plot to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they were held for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the inhospitable mountains in the northwest that have become a terrorist refuge.
They were seen as part of a covert operation.
Therefore, they were rejected, said the government official, who wanted to remain anonymous due to the sensitivity of the matter.
The government official said the men were by no means discouraged and continued to try to get the right recommendations to gain access to the Al Qaeda camps when they were arrested by Pakistani correctional authorities.
The case of the five men - who remain in Pakistan and are being questioned by the FBI - underscores the crucial role of recruiters in identifying future terrorists and, perhaps more importantly, in deciding who is trustworthy.
Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, U.S. intelligence has made it a matter of the utmost urgency to house human assets within Al Qaeda.
The recruiters of the organization act as gatekeepers, not letting in those whose commitment to the Holy War is not serious enough and those who could be spies.
American would-be recruits are subjected to a special audit by A Qaeda, analysts said.
However, due to their potential access to U.S. goals and propaganda value, they are also considered tremendously attractive to the group.
Evan Kohlmann, senior analyst at the US-based NEFA Foundation, said terrorist groups have also become much more cautious in recent years about who they allow access to, as US intelligence agencies have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you are trying to inject someone into these groups, what better way to go than to follow the recruitment model that so many have already followed?, Kohlmann said.
The model is now much more based on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of demonstrators in Copenhagen call for climate "action"
Tens of thousands of demonstrators marched through the streets here on Saturday, demanding that negotiators in the city’s Bella Congress Centre take bolder action on climate protection.
Protesters said 100,000 people had joined the event, while police estimates were more likely to be around 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists detonated small explosive devices near some government buildings in the downtown area.
On a day when little happened in the UN-sponsored climate negotiations, thousands of activists marched through the city with banners that read “There is no Planet B” in English and one in Spanish that declared “The Earth says “enough.”
Some stars joined the protest, for example the Danish model, photographer Helena Christensen, who said the trips to Peru, her mother’s country of birth, made her aware of the heartbreaking problems the country is facing due to the already perceptible effects of climate change.
That’s part of the motivation for why I decided to take part in the big demonstration – to spread the word and appeal to world leaders to come up with a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it must be done now and there is no way around it.
Police stopped protesters from getting too close to Bella Center, saying they had arrested 19 people, mainly due to the fact that they were either masked or carrying pocket knives.
According to Danish law, these actions are prohibited during demonstrations.
According to a spectator who did not want to be named because he is involved in the climate negotiations, masked demonstrators in black clothing detonated several explosive devices near the Copenhagen main canal, near which there are several ministries.
They threw them near the buildings, he said, adding that they started as flares but were then followed by “a few big explosions.”
Inside the convention center, people gathered in front of television screens to watch the demonstration all afternoon.
But the protest has apparently not reached the consciousness of key officials, such as Su Wie, China’s chief climate negotiator.
When asked if he thought the demonstration would have a constructive effect on international considerations, he replied in English: “That’s something I wasn’t even aware of.”
He then continued in Mandarin, saying, “Because the venue is big, I can’t hear what’s happening outside.”
He noted that it depends on the perspective of the individual whether the demonstration would harm or help.
It shows the focus of the general public and different sectors on the issue of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "you can also say that they disturb the negotiations or the freedom of other people".
Test data show persistent racial divide
The math performance testimonials were welcome good news for Washington D.C. public schools last week.
Although the Washington district is still far behind the country’s top-performing schools, the evidence shows that fourth- and eighth-graders have made faster progress over the past two years than cities that include Atlanta, Chicago, and New York.
But what is included in the latest figures from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) is the persistent achievement gap between African-American and white students, both at the local and national levels.
The average score of white fourth-graders from Washington D.C. rose from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500) in the last two years, but that of their African-American peers only rose by three points from 209 to 212.
The performance gap actually increased from 53 to 58 points between 2007 and 2009.
The progress of the African-American eighth graders remained basically the same, dropping by a statistically negligible point from 245 to 244.
The average score of white students was not included in the test data as the sample size was not large enough.
The picture over a six-year period is also not more encouraging.
The gap that separated white and black fourth graders in 2003 when the first NAEP was recorded in that district was 60 scale points (262 to 202).
And although the score achieved by children of both groups has increased in this time span, the difference has hardly decreased by 58 points now.
Some education advocates of the district expressed concern last week that the results, celebrated by school chancellor Michelle A. Rhee and Democratic mayor Adrian M. Fenty, were largely driven by white students who are already high-performing children anyway.
This suggests that we have raised the overall rating by treating those at the top of the scale, which is problematic and difficult, said Jeff Smith, board member of D.C. Voice, a nonprofit group advocating for educational equality in Washington, D.C.
“I’m not jumping up and down for a span of two or three points,” said Democratic Washington City Councilman Kwame R. Brown, who has a daughter in the fourth grade of Eaton Elementary School.
Brown, a frequent critic of Rhee’s management style, said the message of exam scores is that the city’s middle schools need urgent attention.
Of course, you always want to see the positive signs, I respect that.
What scares me, however, is that we don’t spend nearly the time and energy we would have to devote to our middle school.
Rhee said the district must continue to find better ways to meet the needs of low-achieving students.
This fall, for example, some teachers are being trained to use a new reading curriculum, the Wilson Reading System, which targets students in the upper grades of elementary and middle school who have not mastered basic reading skills at the beginning of their school career and who are significantly behind their peers.
Everyday mathematics, a curriculum that focuses from kindergarten to sixth grade games and lifelike experiences, was brought to Washington under former Principal School Inspector Clifford Janey, and this curriculum is credited with some of the NAEP advances reported last week.
I think we need to keep working to ensure that the best measures benefit students who are below grade level, Rhee said.
Others say the NAEP results highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to improve the overall performance of the system while continuing to provide the additional money and resources to the low-performing schools that are needed to reduce the gap.
This is a serious dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a professor of education at the University of California at Berkeley who studies urban exam results.
The conventional remedy is to direct its resources and management reforms to the schools located in the poorest areas of Washington, D.C.
The objective could produce political repercussions that work against this important item on the agenda.
The weak point, of course, as with other city school inspectors, is that they are trying to keep the white and black middle class.
Our focus is to make sure we build a system of great schools.
We need to strengthen our schools in the neighborhoods so that all families, regardless of where they live, can be sure that their children can receive excellent public education.
Janey, who is now a school inspector in Newark, said in an interview this week that one of the most significant elements in closing the achievement gap is extending the traditional public school year, which is currently 180 days in Washington, to compete with charter schools.
One has to increase the school year to approximately 200 days in order to have the strength to change, said Janey, who came to an agreement with his teachers’ union last year for 185 days a year, which he sees as “a milestone” on the way to a greater increase in the next contract.
Higher education for more people as a future prospect
The coach reaches Gettysburg College with a loud whistle.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, steps out and blinks for a moment at the sight of the white columns, the brick facades and the emerald green lawn.
Graciela’s parents barely graduated from high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela, who was recovered in Silver Spring and now lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a college campus.
Their attitude, and that of the group’s other eighth-graders exploring Gettysburg, where tuition costs $38,690 a year, was that of an awe-inspiring visitor rather than that of an enthusiastic future student.
"Yes, I'll be here soon!" cried Graciela, who would like to study medicine, when the Fuehrer announced that they had now entered the Natural Sciences building.
"Wow, really?" she said thoughtfully when she was told the low professor-to-student ratio of the school.
College in Pennsylvania was the 7th the children visited on their three-day tour and now they have fully embraced the intended message: the question is not whether to go to college.
The question is where.
On the one hand, there is growing concern about the large number of Hispanic immigrant children born in the U.S. who do not finish high school or become pregnant as a teenager, but on the other hand, there are hundreds of thousands who receive the college education needed to advance to the middle class.
In fact, one in five of these “second generation” Hispanics graduate from college — which is a remarkable achievement as many of their immigrant parents, mostly from Mexico or Central America, came to the U.S. without graduating high school.
Their success stories are important, researchers say, because they show the way forward for a generation that will play a huge role in the country’s workforce.
Those who study high-performing children say they often have a natural affinity for school and an inherent drive for success.
Many of them also have parents who set high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But counseling programs also play a big role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her get into college, especially if those efforts persist over a longer period of time.
If you look at low-income children whose parents don’t have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, then a single measure at some point won’t solve the problem either, said Patricia G<0xC3><0xA1>ndara, a researcher at the University of California at Davis who studied Hispanic American students.
We need to think about providing a supportive network for these children from preschool through high school.
The federal program that funded Graciela’s college tour is a useful example.
It’s known as GEAR UP—turning up a gear—and provides more than $300 million a year for local school systems to launch college preparatory programs that start when low-income students are in middle school and continue to run until they graduate from high school.
According to the U.S. Department of Education, the program has helped more than 10 million students since 1999, more than 60% of whom have gone to college.
Iraqi oil ministry signs contracts with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has been able to get major oil companies to rebuild its damaged infrastructure at two auctions closed on Saturday.
The 10 contracts signed with foreign oil companies by the Iraqi Oil Ministry suggest that China, Russia and European oil companies are ready to play an important role in renovating Iraq’s oil industry, which has been paralyzed by war and economic sanctions for decades.
American companies were only able to book shares in two of the 10 auctioned fields for themselves.
Seven American companies had paid to participate in the second auction, which began on Friday.
The only company that has made a bid has pulled the short end of the stick.
Two American companies were able to conclude contracts for fields auctioned in June.
The thinly-seeded representatives of American oil multinationals at the opening of the Iraqi oil industry surprised the analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors after 6 years of war and instead of U.S. companies Asian and European are leading the way, said Ruba Husari, the editor of Iraq Oil Forum, an online news service.
There will be no more offers in Iraq for a long time.
Security concerns highlighted by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday and the political instability caused by the withdrawal of the U.S. military have likely deterred U.S. oil companies, analysts said, from getting more involved in Iraq, which holds the world’s third-largest proven crude reserves.
U.S. companies have been at a disadvantage in some cases because competitors, especially the Chinese and other state-controlled energy companies, have significantly lower labor costs and are more likely to take risks because they do not have to answer to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only U.S. companies to enter into contracts with the Department.
Larger U.S. companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which maintain close ties with the Iraqi oil ministry and have been assisting with technical advice in recent years, have run out of steam.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main players in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation has bid for more contracts than any other company and was able to go home with large packages of contracts for two larger fields.
We all know, said the spokesman for the oil ministry, Assam Jihad, that China is on its way to becoming one of the greats of the world economy as well as a technology power.
We are convinced that the Chinese company will be able to compete with its competitors and meet its obligations to Iraq.
Businesses preselected to bid placed bids, which were then compared to the fee per barrel of oil the ministry was willing to pay to increase each field’s output beyond its current level.
Al Qaeda's top planner killed in Pakistan
An apparent US missile attack along Pakistan’s border with Afghanistan is believed to have killed a top al Qaeda operative this week, U.S. counterterrorism officials reported Friday.
This, if confirmed, would be the second deadly attack on a high-ranking leader of the terrorist organization this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arabs who, according to US sources and Pakistani officials in the region, were killed by a number of rockets that hit their vehicle near the town of Miran Shah in North Waziristan province on Tuesday.
Local authorities reported that the missiles were fired by a drone type deployed by the CIA in Pakistan’s lawless tribal belt.
They were driving in a white vehicle towards the Afghan border when the car was hit, a Pakistani civilian intelligence official from Miran Shah said by phone.
Locals suspected of belonging to the militants ran to the spot and quickly took everything from the "completely destroyed bodies".
Local authorities were unable to confirm the identity of the victims, but two U.S. counterterrorism officials cited indeterminate evidence that Somali was among the dead.
Somali has been described as a leading Al Qaeda military planner who led operations of terrorist groups outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He was involved in conspiracies around the world, a senior official who wanted to remain anonymous noted, pointing to the delicate nature of the U.S. airstrikes on Pakistani soil.
Assuming its central role as given, this also included planning attacks against the US and Europe.
He took strategic instructions from al Qaeda’s top leaders and implemented them in operational planning for possible terrorist attacks.
The second U.S. official said that Somali had quickly risen in the Al Qaeda hierarchy and maintained best connections to other extremist groups in the region.
He may not be known to some Americans, the second official said, but this in no way reduces the danger he posed to us and our allies.
If confirmed, Somali would be the second leading al Qaeda or Taliban leader to be killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant faction in the tribal area and three other top activists.
The pace of attacks by CIA drones has dropped from an average of six operations per month to two since the summer, according to a summary of the Long War Journal, a website maintained by a non-profit organization.
The decline may be due to improved tactics by terrorist groups that have taken steps to reduce their vulnerability while brutally killing suspected informants, the site reported.
U.N. High Representative in Kabul to Resign
The UN’s leading envoy to Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would step down from his post in March, ending a stormy term clouded by allegations of widespread corruption in the UN-backed Afghan presidential election.
The Obama administration decided to send another 30,000 U.S. troops to Afghanistan.
The U.N. envoy said he supports the troop increase, but he also expressed his concerns that the U.S. military withdrawal schedule, scheduled to begin in 18 months, could prompt other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to speed up the build-up of Afghan security forces and thereby send the right signal to Afghans that they can trust the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civilian aides to help in Afghanistan’s political transition.
The increase in troops on the military side must correspond to an increase on the civilian side, he said.
Eide said that he was not resigning, but only fulfilling an agreement made in March 2008 to his family to stay in Kabul for only two years.
He said he wanted to send a message to the UN.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon is now passing on so that he has time to provide for a replacement.
What I said is that he better start looking for a successor, Eide said.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between my predecessor’s departure and my arrival.
Ban has begun the search for a replacement, according to UN officials.
UN officials say he has considered Swedish-Italian-born Staffan di Mistura, who recently led the UN mission in Baghdad, and Frenchman Jean-Marie Guéhenno, who previously led UN peacekeeping operations.
Eid’s position in Afghanistan was put to the test after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, accused him in September of favoring President Hamid Karzai in the country’s presidential election and covering up evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide has denied all accusations, but he also said that the accusations of Galbraith – who was fired – “doubtlessly harmed the mission because there was already a great deal of skepticism about international interference in the election.”
Eide said he recommended the appointment of a senior civilian representative to coordinate U.S.-led forces relief efforts in Afghanistan.
He also urged the UN leadership to allow his successor to hire more staff from the United States and other Western countries to donate to the Afghan mission, saying that this would strengthen their confidence in their money being used properly.
Eide expressed disappointment at the curtailment of his forces in Afghanistan, saying that the cumbersome UN hiring regulations have undermined his ability to bring in capable people.
The UN rules are designed in such a way that since May, he said, I could only hire one person.
This is catastrophic and must not go on like this.
US Secretary of Defense Gates: Iran must expect additional sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said Friday that world powers will soon impose “significant additional sanctions” on Iran for not participating in talks about its nuclear plans.
Gates spoke to a group of about 300 U.S. soldiers in northern Iraq during a 7-day tour of the war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, downplaying the prospect of a military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran.
There are no good options to choose from in Iran, he said in response to a soldier’s question about the likelihood of such a development.
“One of the things that is on my mind, if we have learned anything from Iraq in the last six years, is the unpredictability of war.”
The Obama administration is considering a sanctions package targeting Iran’s military and political elite, but Gates has announced that some sanctions could also affect the average Iranian.
He said a “package of positive and negative incentives” is needed “to convince the Iranian government that it is in fact less protected with nuclear weapons” because “its people will suffer tremendously” from the sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement from White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the U.S. government joined European leaders in warning that Iran will face “credible” consequences if its nuclear program fails to meet the demands of the U.N. Security Council and its nuclear monitoring organization, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran continues to claim that knowledge of nuclear technology is to be gained only for peaceful purposes.
At talks in Geneva on October 1, Iran said it would resume talks to limit its nuclear program and forgo a substantial portion of its stockpile of enriched uranium in exchange for much-needed nuclear fuel for its medical research reactor.
The U.S. government has pushed for this type of agreement to build trust between the two parties and gain time for negotiations.
But Iran seems to have left negotiations on the preliminary agreements since then -- in part, experts say, because the Iranian leadership is at odds over whether they should commit to the United States.
That Iran simply left the international community standing on some proposals they had already agreed to in early October has, frankly, brought the international community, including the Russians and Chinese, together in ways they never were in conjunction with major additional sanctions on Iran, Gates said.
President Obama has set Dec. 31 as a deadline for Iran to respond to these proposals before pursuing other options, including what Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called “impressive sanctions.”
In a statement issued in New York, Iran’s representation at the United Nations condemned what it called “unfounded and unsubstantiated allegations” by some Security Council members on Iran’s nuclear activities on Thursday, saying they are willing to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers “to achieve an appropriate long-term solution.”
Gates, who was due to return to Washington last Friday, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki in the morning before flying to the oil-rich Kurdish region of Iraq for meetings with soldiers in Kirkuk and Kurdish officials in Irbil.
Tensions between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq continue to be high, particularly with regard to borders, property rights and the distribution of public revenues.
Gates urged both sides to lower the potential for conflict to prevent delays in U.S. plans to reduce U.S. troop numbers from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
U.S. officials quoted Gates as saying to Masud Barzani, president of the Kurdish regional government, "We will maintain your security, your prosperity and your autonomy within a united Iraq.
We will not leave you."
A change of course in aging China
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters giving them lectures that "Mother Earth is too tired to entertain more children" and "One more baby means one more grave".
These lessons they learned so well that when government officials in Shanghai, who suddenly began to change course this summer due to the low birth rate and aging population, and encouraged young couples to have more than one child, their answer was immediate and definitive: “No way.”
We have already invested all our time and energy in a child.
There is nothing left for a second child, said Wang, 31, a human resources manager with an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one-child policy in China, which has spawned two generations of notoriously thick, warped single children affectionately called “little emperors,” a population crisis is looming in the country.
The average birth rate has fallen to 1.8 children per couple compared to 6 at the time this policy came into force, the UN
According to the Department of Population Affairs, the number of people aged 60 and over is expected to increase from 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent by 2050, well above the global average of around 20 percent.
The imbalance is stronger in rich coastal cities with educated populations, such as Shanghai.
Last year, 60-year-olds and older people accounted for nearly 22 percent of Shanghai’s reported residents, while the birth rate was below one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, head of the Shanghai City Population and Family Planning Commission, has said that couples of childbearing age must have babies to “help reduce the ratio of aging populations and alleviate the labor shortage of the future.”
Shanghai will soon be "as old -- but not as rich -- as developed countries, like Japan and Sweden," she said.
A gradual relaxation
Enshrined in the country’s 1978 constitution, China’s one-child policy is likely to be the most controversial decree introduced by the ruling Communist Party to date.
Couples who violate this policy face huge fines -- up to their triple annual salary in some regions -- and discrimination in their workplace.
Chinese state officials have attributed it to this policy that the critical use of the country’s natural resources could be avoided, while human rights representatives have condemned abuses in the enforcement of the policy.
In rural areas, some officials have forced pregnant women who already had a child to abort.
Many couples had also had sex-selective abortions, creating an unnaturally high male-to-female ratio.
In recent years, government representatives for the population have gradually weakened their stance on one-child policy.
In 2004, they allowed more exceptions to the rule -- including city dwellers, members of ethnic minorities, and cases where both husband and wife were single children -- and in 2007, the tone of many hard slogans was softened.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at Beijing University’s Institute of Population Research, said government officials have recently even discussed more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children where a partner is an only child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to promote more births.
Posters that taught families to have only one child were replaced almost overnight by guidelines detailing who qualifies for a second child and how to apply for approval.
The city government has sent city employees and family planning volunteers to visit couples at home and push through information sheets under the doors.
She also asked to provide psychological and financial advice for those who have more than one child.
The response was not exactly encouraging, family planning representatives said.
Disappointing reaction
Although officials from a rural small town in the outskirts of Shanghai said that an upturn in the applications of couples who want a second child after the start of the campaign can be seen, the urban districts, on the other hand, report no change.
For the municipality of Huinan with a population of 115,000, as an example, only four to five applications are still received per month.
Disappointed Shanghai officials say that despite the campaign, the number of births expected in the city in 2010 will still be around 165,000 -- slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the Caolu Family Planning Committee in Shanghai Municipality, said that financial considerations were probably the main reason why many people don’t want to have more children.
They want to give their first best, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said that they would like to have two children and that this is also legally permissible.
But they, like many Chinese, have only a small amount of health and life insurance from the government.
Without a social network, they say, this decision would be irresponsible.
People in the West mistakenly rate the one-child policy as a human rights issue, said Yang, a civil engineer whose wife is pregnant with her first child in the seventh month.
Yes, we are robbed of the opportunity to have more than one child.
The problem is not just in politics.
The problem is money.
Other couples give psychological reasons for their hesitation.
Wang, the head of human resources, said she only wants a child because she was also an only child. "We were the center of the family and used to everyone taking care of us.
We’re not used to taking care of others and we don’t really want to.”
Chen Zijian, a 42-year-old who owns a translation company, said it more bluntly.
For middle-class parents with dual careers, through which the birth rate drops, he said, it’s all about being successful and for that you have to be selfish.
The 20- to 39-year-olds grew up watching their parents struggle during the early days of the Chinese capitalism experiment, and they don’t want such a life for themselves, he said.
Even a single child, he said, places huge demands on the time of parents.
A mother must give up her social life for at least two years.
Then there's the spatial question -- "You have to rebuild your apartment" -- and the life planning -- "When the child is 9 months old, you already have a resume for the best preschools ready."
Most of his friends are willing to go through this once, Chen said, but not twice.
Our generation is the first to reach a higher standard of living, he said.
We do not want to make too many sacrifices.
UN Group Drafts Plan to Reduce Emissions
The UN-sponsored climate conference -- which has so far been characterized by wild poses and mutual accusations -- has again put a spotlight on Friday with the publication of a document that will record an ambitious reduction in greenhouse gases for the next 40 years, with industrialized nations shouldering the biggest burdens in the near future.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement on the regulation of greenhouse gases, showed both the remaining obstacles and the way forward.
But it has been seen as an important step forward in a negotiation that will run out of time as more than 100 top politicians from around the world arrive in Copenhagen next week.
The text, which was drafted by a specially created UN working group, remains silent about the amount of money that rich countries should give to poor countries so that they can master global warming in the short and long term.
It also offers a range of options for the key issues, including how developed and large emerging economies can limit their carbon emissions and how high should be the upper limit of global temperature rise that policy makers would support.
The process is given great flexibility, according to John Coequyt, senior representative of the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who drafted the six-page document, has summarized a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what the UN’s leading climate protection official, Yvo de Boer, has called “the big picture.”
It shows the floor plan of a possible agreement in which industrialized nations would collectively reduce their emissions by 25 to 45 percent by 2020, compared to 1990 limits, while larger developing countries would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 percent over the same period.
Together, countries could reduce emissions by 50 to 95 percent by 2050.
The European Community also boosted the talks on Friday by committing to providing $3.6 billion a year over the next three years to help poorer countries adapt to the impacts of climate change, from mastering floods and droughts to avoiding deforestation.
Friday nevertheless brought the same verbal fireworks that had determined the talks last week.
U.S. Special Envoy for Climate Change Todd Stern has rejected formulations calling for binding greenhouse gas emissions reductions for developed countries, compared to voluntary reductions for larger emerging economies, if not funded by industrialized nations.
This move announced that the Obama administration is taking a tougher line with China than representatives of the Bush administration did less than two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without major emerging economies standing up and taking action, said Stern, who also complained that the text does not go far enough to ensure that the reductions could also be confirmed by outsiders.
Stern issued his statement an hour after China’s Deputy Foreign Minister He Yafei said the leading American climate negotiator was either lacking in “reason” or it was “highly irresponsible” of him to say earlier this week that the United States would not help China financially master global warming.
Because the future economic march of the great world powers is at stake, fault lines have opened up both within the industrialized nations and between the industrialized nations and the emerging economies.
The current struggle is equally concerned with saving individual economies, as well as saving the planet, with China and the United States contending for their respective commitments, while poorer countries claim that the two dozen most influential countries would ignore the scientific need to take bolder action.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it is not surprising that the big powers are fighting over who should bear the costs of curbing greenhouse gas emissions, as even affected countries have moved to be more aggressive in holding the very high greenhouse gas tax countries accountable for their actions.
This is clearly a game from which a new economic hegemony will develop, according to Ulate, who also works as a regional climate change consultant for Conservation International in Mexico and Central America.
Some of the countries most exposed to the effects of climate change said they would continue to fight for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although leading participants say the talks will lead to a political agreement at best.
The 43-member Alliance of Small Island States presented a 24-page draft treaty early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who heads the international climate negotiations for the European Commission, said that the small island nation’s offensive “exercises political pressure on the entire political process,” partly because they are now united and demand action from emerging economies, such as China and India.
The talks took on a new urgency as delegates focused on the fact that most open questions need to be resolved before the government leaders arrive to reach an agreement.
High-ranking officials, such as India’s Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and China’s Vice Minister, stepped out of their planes and raced through the corridors of the Bella Center to meetings behind closed doors and press conferences to stake out claims that will be negotiated during the next week.
The sheer scale of the gathering -- 13,000 people go in and out of the convention center every day, guitar-playing activists put on nightly shows making fun of the countries they believe are betraying and selling themselves, and draft contracts are handed out hand-to-hand rather than via email -- is already a challenge.
The intensity is just beginning to build: almost all the important ministers are here now and from Wednesday, 60 government leaders will be in Copenhagen.
“We are coming to the Oberliga,” said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, vice president of global politics at Conservation International.
The heavyweights are coming.
Britain’s first 225 km/h fast train redefines Monday feeling
Monday morning at 5:13 p.m., a pipe will permeate the darkness to announce a train departure that represents a revolution in traffic in the UK.
The first high-speed commuter train in the country will reach 225 km/h on its lightning journey from Ashfort, Kent, to London St. Pancras, covering 93 km in 38 minutes.
Dame Kelly Holmes will then board the first Javelin commuting service from London to Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport.
He hopes that the new service will eventually link Britain to an international rail network of fast, reliable trains and connect the major metropolitan areas of the Midlands, the North and Scotland to London.
The neglected province could become vibrant commuter cities, work commutes would be radically reduced, and the change from plane and car to train would reduce national carbon emissions and congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three major parties believe in this vision.
But the many billions of pounds needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable planning battle, and fears of environmental damage could still drag the brakes on Britain’s high-speed rail.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company set up in January to submit a feasibility study to the government, will hand over the report to Lord Adonis on December 30, according to the Times.
This gives him a detailed route map of the next planned stage of the high-speed rail network.
The new rail line, which will connect London with the West Midlands, will pass by urban areas and places where the impact on the environment is controversial, with a travel of five metres.
In open terrain, the plan will show the concept within a distance of 25 meters from the final route.
HS2 will also create three options for a larger, northbound high-speed rail network.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
The preferred proposed option is a Y-shaped route, where a single high-speed route would lead to the West Midlands.
The route would split into or near Birmingham and one branch west of the Pennines would lead to Manchester and Scotland and another to the northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would lead to Scotland.
"It seems to be the best-functioning option," said one railroad insider.
Once completed, travel time between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first section, which would not be opened before 2025, would allow travellers to cover the London-Birmingham line in 49 minutes, compared to today’s just over an hour.
The designs would allow trains to travel at a speed of 400 km/h, making the British rail network the fastest in Europe.
The first line was planned in such a way that 400-metre-long trains with a maximum capacity of 1,100 people can travel on it.
Up to 18 trains per hour could operate on the London-Birmingham route.
This, in turn, would mean the need for a terminus in London, where 20,000 passengers per hour could be handled.
Given the spatial constraints in the capital, it is expected that an existing station would be expanded to accommodate the high-speed network.
Railway experts say that only St. Pancras International or Euston have this potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he believes this plan should be continued, but the protracted public consultation and planning measures mean that a final decision will not be made until after the parliamentary elections.
But even if he sets the wheels in motion, the rail network must be built in sections.
The trains would first have to switch from high-speed lines to existing rail lines in the north of Birmingham, which would keep the travel time between London and Scotland at over three hours.
This is considered to be a crucial sticking point in order to ensure a change from aircraft to rail, a benchmark for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers pay for a conservative’s <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 orange mortgage
Alan Duncan, the Conservatives’ leading member of the House of Commons, has charged the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year for the cost of an orangery he built in his home in his constituency.
The party’s prison spokesman, who was demoted by David Cameron for complaining that members of the lower house have to live on “lean rations,” has increased his mortgage by <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 to get an oak timber timber-framed plantation built at his second home in Rutland.
He was allowed to charge the taxpayer the additional interest income, a sum of hundreds of pounds per month.
The House of Commons approved the motions at the time, and they were not questioned by Sir Thomas Legg, who is conducting a review of MPs' spending. Last night, Duncan said the motions could not have been "even cleaner or more understandable."
Duncan, one of the wealthiest members of the House of Commons, owns a two-story house in a village in his Rutland and Melton constituency.
Nearby houses have achieved a purchase price of almost one million pounds (1.1 million euros).
The ground floor includes kitchen, living and dining room, but the Fees Office, a spending checkpoint of the House of Commons, has agreed that Duncan needs more space.
Last year, he planted a conservatory called "orangery" in the plans.
Neighbors described it as a "glass house for entertainment."
Duncan was also not asked to comment on the increased borrowing during a recent investigation of his previous mortgage contracts by the Standards and Privileges Committee.
The Committee acquitted him of breaching the rules last month after an examination of his expenditure.
In 2004, Duncan transferred the security for a <0xC2><0xA3>271,406 mortgage from his London home to his constituency house, which he had purchased in 1991, a year before his election as a Member of Parliament.
Documents published this week show that Duncan was reimbursed about <0xC2><0xA3>1,400 per month as mortgage interest until March last year.
In April, his claims rose to more than <0xC2><0xA3>1,800 a month.
The interest rate on Duncan’s RBS mortgage has not changed during this time, suggesting that the entire increase was used to fund the <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 raise.
The normal stepless RBS mortgage rate fell from 7.94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March of this year, where it still stands.
The latest documents released by the House of Commons show that Duncan continued to assert his right to <0xC2><0xA3>1,250 a month this May.
Duncan lost his post as opposition leader of the House of Commons in September after an undercover reporter filmed him doing so when he said after the spending scandal that MPs were living "of lean rations."
"Essentially, working for the state means living off lean rations and being treated like s***."
He said, "I have spent my money on my garden and I am entitled to a very small share of what belongs to me.
And I could have demanded the whole damn amount, but I don't."
The Member of Parliament, a millionaire from his previous career as an oil wholesaler, was attacked for his expenses for the first time in May when it became clear that he had claimed thousands of pounds for his garden before clarifying with the Fees Office that this “could be considered an exaggerated demand.”
An activist has dug a hole in Duncan’s lawn in the form of a pound sign as a protest, after it became known that he had claimed 4,000 pounds (4,500 euros) over three years.
When asked about the increased mortgage last night, Duncan said, "This had been approved by both the Fees Office, and subsequently by Legg for the increase in value."
He added: “There is no debate about dodging and slashing or bending the rules or anything like that.
Everything is perfectly transparent and moves strictly within the rules, is approved and everything.
It couldn’t be cleaner and clearer.”
Come all you believers to admire Brighton’s beach hut advent calendar
Beach huts in Brighton have found a new way of life as an interactive Advent calendar for the winter months.
"Beyond", an alternative church group that encourages spiritual discoveries through creativity, has invited 24 owners to decorate their huts for each December day with Christmas carols as a theme.
The event started on December 1st and visitors were able to view the newest hut every day from 5:30 pm to 6:30 pm with free mulled wine and traditional mince pies, pastries filled with dried fruits.
The Christmas carols selected so far are "I saw three ships", "O come, o come, Emmanuel" and "The first No<0xC3><0xAB>l", where the hut decoration is the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is a volunteer minister of the Chichester Diocese and head of Beyond.
He said: "We want to make religion more important for people in a post-Christian society again.
Why do we, as a church, expect people to come to a strange old building? I think the church should go to people and have exciting celebrations.
The idea for the beach hut advent calendar started as a conversation with some friends at dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastically creative and vibrant place and we are trying to express this through our spirituality."
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and in the world for the climate.
Tens of thousands of people demonstrated worldwide and in Copenhagen on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding agreement on the fight against global warming, where police have made several hundred arrests.
At least thirty thousand people, according to police, a hundred thousand according to the organizers, have marched in the cold of the Danish capital, on the sidelines of the United Nations climate conference, which should lead to a conclusion by Friday, which could come into force from 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish chairman of the climate conference, the increasing mobilization in the world for climate contributes to this, which is illustrated by these demonstrations that the “political price” of a failure in Copenhagen would be very high.
The incidents in the Danish capital took place shortly after the train passed, when a group of 300 protesters, all dressed in black, smashed shop windows with paving stones and hammers, an AFP journalist noted.
Anti-riot police officers intervened immediately and without consideration.
The police have announced that 600 to 700 people, according to their assessment mainly members of the "Blacks Blocs", this extremely violent faction, who have already made themselves famous at the NATO Summit in Strasbourg, were arrested in the east of France, in April.
The Coalition Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organizers of the demonstration, has sharply criticized the conditions under which hundreds of militant supporters had been arrested "without distinction", and has underlined that about a hundred of them "were still being held in the streets on Saturday evening", despite the extreme cold with handcuffs and in sitting position.
The rather peaceful train has gone from the parliament towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations took place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to get in.
A stage was installed to welcome the intended speakers for an evening of candlelight, with the participation of former South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu.
The majority of the demonstrators arrived by bus and train from major European cities, but also many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, as well as some Africans were present.
About 3,000 people, most of them with sky-blue raincoats, have made a first run-up in the morning in Copenhagen, as they have followed the call of the Friends of the Earth to form "blue tides" for the "climate justice."
Today, we are taking to the streets to demand a redress of ecological debt in favor of the South,” said Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino activist with the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can’t go on like this and say to ourselves: we have time, said Angelique Kidjo, singer from Benin.
There are rivers in Africa that dry out, watercourses where you can walk, as it has never been the case in the past.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, founded in 1992 with the adoption of the UN agreement, the movement of globalization critics has approached environmental organizations.
MEP José Bové, who is a figure of the globalisation critics, announced that he came to Copenhagen to link "climate justice and social justice": "Today there is no difference between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world."
The Asia-Pacific region, where there are many islands that are particularly vulnerable as a result of the warming, has given the starting shot for the demonstrations.
About 50,000 people have taken to the streets in Australia, according to the organizers.
In Manila, there were several hundred people, mostly students, marching in red and raising bandanas, in which you boasted the solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, but also in Canada, marches of several hundred demonstrators took place to demand an energetic approach to climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the "350" network have gathered several hundred people, namely in Paris, in Marseille (south), in Lille (north), in Bordeaux (west) and in Lyon (east).
A number of people gathered in Geneva.
The separatist Abkhazia has elected its president, Georgia denounces that this is a "strike".
Abkhazia elected its president on Saturday, this happened a little more than a year after Moscow recognized this pro-Russian separatist Georgian territory as independent, Tbilisi denounced the "strike".
Some 131,000 people were called to participate in the first election after the August 2008 Russo-Georgian War for control of the South Ossetian Territory, another Georgian secessionist territory recognized by Russia.
The polling stations are closed at 5pm GMT.
The turnout was about 58% a few hours before the polling station closure, according to the Abkhaz election commission officials.
The first preliminary results should be announced in the night from Saturday to Sunday.
The five candidates, including the previous president, Serguei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which condemns the election.
These elections are a farce.
For his part, the Georgian president, Mikheil Saakachvili, regrets that Abkhazia is now under Russian total occupation, his press secretary, Manana Manjgaladze, has declared.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognized the independence of this area with 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world perceives it as part of Georgia, which is illegally occupied by Russia.
After separating from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict, which killed several thousand people, Abkhazia wants to use this election to prove that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage in our new life, a new era, as an independent state, Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian who claims to have voted for Mr Bagapch, has explained.
She was one of the voters who went to vote in a polling station located in a school in the capital Soukhoumi, a beautiful white building with a few palm trees in front of the entrance.
The question of Russian dominance is at the heart of this presidential election, in a region with beautiful black sea landscapes.
Big signs showing Bagapch alongside Russian President and Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and Vladimir Putin are all over this small area, which has 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, which is in the east of the country, the district chief, Beslan Archba, has prepared a warm welcome to the Russian representatives who have come to oversee the election.
We, the Abkhaz people, are grateful, he said at a small celebration, as an allusion to Moscow’s support, especially regarding the decision to recognize Abkhaz’s independence.
“I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations,” Alexei Ostrovsky, a member of the Russian parliament, replied, raising a glass of vodka.
The opposition, for its part, represented by the former vice-president and two Russian businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, has criticized the agreements reached with Moscow last year, as the one in which Abkhazia leaves Russia to control the railway for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Banba, claims to support neither the current government nor the opposition.
A 50% majority plus one vote is necessary to win the election.
If none of the candidates reaches this limit, a second round of voting must be organized within two weeks.
Climate: Worldwide Demos, Copenhagen Incidents
Tens of thousands of people demonstrated around the world on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding contract from the Copenhagen Climate Conference, where police, ready for action at any time, arrested about 700 people on the edge of an important demonstration.
Thirty thousand people according to police, a hundred thousand according to the organizers have demonstrated in the afternoon cold in the Danish capital, which until December 18 receives delegates from 193 countries, who are looking for an agreement to come into force on January 1, 2013.
From Parliament, the peaceful train marched towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations are taking place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the center and did not try to enter.
A stage was set up to welcome the speakers for an evening of candlelight, with the participation of former South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu.
A few moments after the train passed, a group of protesters dressed all in black and armed with bricks and hammers began smashing windows, an AFP journalist noted.
Anti-riot police officers immediately encircled you and intervened without consideration by throwing some of them on the ground.
The police have announced that 600 to 700 people have been arrested and have made it clear that they are mainly members of "the Blacks Blocs", these extremely violent factions that have already made themselves famous at the NATO Summit in Strasbourg, in the east of France, in April.
In the evening, a police officer suffered an injury to his chin during the incidents, in which, according to police, about twenty people were provisionally arrested. Four vehicles were burned near an occupied house.
"We have the extreme groups under control," police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen said as the helicopters of the police force circled in the air.
Most of the demonstrators arriving by train or with their own vehicle from major German cities, from London, Amsterdam or Milan, were Europeans.
However, there were also many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, and Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in a sky-blue raincoat, formed in Copenhagen in the morning after the call of the "Friends of the Earth" to a first group, which should represent the "blue seas" for "climate justice".
“Today, we are taking to the streets to demand that the ecological debt be repaid to the people of the South,” said activist Lidy Nacpil of the Jubilee South Coalition of the Philippines in Copenhagen.
"We can no longer say to ourselves: We still have time," says singer Angélique Kidjo from Benin.
"In Africa, there are rivers that dry up, there are watercourses that you can walk through, which was never the case before."
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was established in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the anti-globalization movement has approached environmental organizations.
José Bové, a French MEP for the European Parliament and a critic of globalisation, told AFP that he had come to Copenhagen to “connect climate justice and social justice.” “There is no difference today between fighting global warming and fighting for another world.”
The organization Oxfam has mobilized several personalities, such as the Danish model Helena Christensen or the former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson, who are addressing the masses.
The Asia-Pacific region, home to many islands that are particularly vulnerable to global warming, has given the impetus to the demonstrations.
In Australia, according to the organizers, about 50,000 people took to the streets.
In Manila, several hundred people, mostly students, dressed in red with bandanas, have advertised solar energy in front of the city administration of the Philippine capital.
Hundreds of protesters have also gathered in Hong Kong and Jakarta in an action against climate change.
In France, several hundred people joined during the demonstrations organized by the "network of 350", in particular in Paris, Marseille in the south, Lille in the north, Bordeaux in the west and Lyon in the east.
Several people gathered in Geneva.
According to Chatel, the subjects of geography and history emerge strengthened from the school reform of the Lycées.
National Education Minister Luc Chatel stated in an interview published in the Sunday newspaper "Journal du dimanche" that the subjects of geography and history emerge stronger from the school reform of the Lycées, even if they are not taught in the Terminale (12th school year).
"The students of the Premi<0xC3><0xA8>re (11th school year) now have every four hours of the week and the same program," confirms Mr. Chatel.
For the minister, “this hypocrisy must be overcome,” because according to him, “the scientific profile is no longer a scientific profile,” but, by and large, a concentration of “the best students.”
"The economic-social and literary profile (ES and L) must not become a sub-profile of the scientific," he continued, underlining that "neither have I heard many historians and intellectuals who would have been outraged at the lack of historical-geographical education in the terminal on technical lyces."
On Saturday, an IFOP survey published by the Humanité revealed that nearly seven out of ten French (69%) criticized the government’s project to remove compulsory education in history and geography in Terminale S (12th school year with a scientific profile). Many teachers and intellectuals also criticized this project, as well as the left and some representatives of the right.
The Minister replied, however, that there was no question of limiting the philosophy of the Terminale S programme.
Luc Chatel also defended education reform for teachers, while 16 organizations (students and unions) called for Tuesday to protest against the project, which they believe will fall victim to the pedagogical training of future teachers.
The Minister stated that in Master 2 (M2) they undergo a subject-related aptitude test at the beginning of the year and an admission test at the end of the year, during which their teaching skills are tested.
In addition, they carry out internships during the year in M2 and then teach one year in front of the students as a teacher in the internship.
He went on to say, “If you add all the internships offered before the performance exam, you will achieve even more hours spent in front of the students, i.e. more than 300 hours.”
The minister finally stated that he wants to offer “the individual right to education” – a “thing that does not exist in popular education.”
He confirmed that he wants to abolish the school card "by 2012".
15 minutes for the climate at the "Ecole Normale Supérieure"
Fifteen minutes to talk about the deployment at the Copenhagen Summit: this is the challenge that Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, had to face on Saturday morning at the Ecole Normale Supérieure on Rue d'Ulm in Paris.
As an AFP journalist noted, Nobel Peace Prize winner Jean Jouzel opened the first of the "Ernest" conferences, at which experts each turn to the audience for fifteen minutes with filmed contributions.
Edouard Hannezo, 22 years old and one of the organizers of this day, said that he wanted to do something that would reach people and make them feel like they wanted to know more. The name of this event is the name given to the fish in the pool of the school.
"Among the experts, around twenty panelists were selected, also according to their charisma," he explains.
"You can talk for hours about global warming, but the core goals can also be set out in a few minutes," Jean Jouzel told AFP, who only cleared in front of about 50 people with the help of slides.
“This is part of our role as scientists,” he stressed, hoping that listeners might infer that “the Copenhagen Conference is based on an absolutely serious scientific dossier.”
The videos filmed by these conferences will be available online on the school’s website from 15 December.
The next "Ernest" day is scheduled for February and will take place every two months thereafter.
Late payment : angry prison guards, actions planned
The unions of prison officials on Friday called for a general day of action to ensure that the premiums and overtime, the payment of which has been postponed until January for budget reasons, will be transferred before the Christmas holidays.
The second union of prison officials ("FO-Pénitentiaire"), called on employees who are not on duty to demonstrate in front of the prison on Tuesday morning and block them in order to draw attention to the "theft of what is due to them".
The 3rd CGT-Pénitentiaire called for “a strong mobilization in the various prisons” on which the non-payment of overtime, nighttime allowances and Sunday and holiday allowances in December is branded as “shameful and unacceptable”.
The first union of prison officials, the Autonomous Federal Detention Centre Union (UFAP/UNSA), called for "general mobilizations (...) to show dissatisfaction and anger."
The prison management and the Ministry of Justice stated that overtime had increased sharply in 2009 and not all of it was planned in the budget, but they guarantee that the remaining claims will be paid in January.
The Ministry of Justice said in the evening that Mich<0xC3><0xA8>le Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the unions of prison officials guaranteeing that the payment would be made next month.
"I am well aware of the efforts of the staff to keep our prison system in working order and to modernise it," the Minister of Justice said in this letter.
"I have instructed the management of the prison to take immediate measures so that such a situation, which has arisen due to a lack of assessment of the overtime, will not be repeated in the future," Ms Alliot-Marie added.
The December wage is therefore low, except for the management staff, who benefit from high service and target premiums, explains the UFAP/UNSA, for which the "budget constraints" must serve.
"This is an absolute scandal," outraged the interregional trade union FO in Marseille, announcing that "all gatherings and convocations" should be boycotted until new instructions are given.
"The staff will not go to work on Sundays and public holidays if the hours of October in December are still unpaid, including their overtime hours," the FO Rh<0xC3><0xB4>ne-Alpes-Auvergne said.
“At a time when more and more tasks are being put on us without more staff being hired, the attempt to enrich ourselves with the funds of the staff is more than inappropriate,” said the CGT union of Bordeaux.
According to the trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions; some are less affected than others.
In any case, however, it is wrong, states the Secretary General of the UFAP, Jean-Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Forget.
Obama says he always gives better gifts than he gets.
President Barack Obama, who will be spending Christmas with his family at the White House for the first time, has told TV talk show host Oprah Winfrey that he is always handing out better gifts than he gets himself.
In a special broadcast broadcast on ABC on Sunday evening, the President and his wife Michelle gave insight into how they will spend the holidays in their new illustrious home.
Even Bo, the little four-legged companion of the family, will be part of the game.
"Santa Claus loves Bo too," Michelle Obama said, adding that the dog will also receive a gift.
Michelle Obama firmly rejected her husband’s claims about the quality of the gifts: “I gave you beautiful gifts last year,” she teased the president.
“So, please,” he scolded her mischievously, pointing to the First Lady’s pearl necklace: “And who gave you this one?”
During this hour-long airing in a casual atmosphere with the well-known television host who had so vehemently supported Barack Obama during his campaign, the president and his wife also talked about gifts they had loved most as a child.
Barack Obama remembered a bicycle with ten gears and also a basketball that his father, whom he rarely saw, had brought him from Kenya for Christmas.
“I remember when my father visited us once for Christmas and brought me a basketball,” the president said.
“It wasn’t until much later in my life that I understood that I had this ball from him.”
The First Lady, in turn, remembered her dollhouse.
"I didn't know how to arrange the furniture in a house at all, so I put them all on the wall instead of grouping them around the fireplace, but I loved this little dollhouse," Michelle Obama said.
Johnny Hallyday surgery again, RTL confirms he was put into an artificial coma
Johnny Hallyday was operated on again in Los Angeles for significant "damage" after an operation in France. According to the people around him, the situation is "under control", although RTL confirms that the singer was put into an artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rock musician underwent surgery again on the night of Wednesday to Thursday at the Cedars-Sina<0xC3><0xAF> hospital in Los Angeles, after American doctors found “damage from the surgery of a herniated disc” he suffered in Paris on Nov. 26, according to his production company in Paris, which added that these damages had necessitated another operation.
Still, the singer’s production company wanted to make it clear that the situation was “under control” and said that a new medical opinion would be available in 48 hours at the latest.
However, according to RTL, the partner during the singer's last tour, Johnny Hallyday was put into an artificial coma to avoid "pain and complications."
However, it was only after 48 hours that one had a little more certainty about the patient’s condition than he opened his eyes, RTL added.
At AFP’s request, there was no confirmation or comment from the production company.
RTL also confirms that "certain sources indicate" that "no drainage" was laid after his first operation in Paris.
The rocker had been operated on in the international clinic of Parc Monceau because of a herniated disc.
The procedure, which was planned over several days, was performed by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known doctor who had already treated many stars.
This was not available for comments to RTL on Thursday evening.
After Johnny Hallyday's surgery, the singer was admitted to Cedars-Sina<0xC3><0xAF> Hospital in Los Angeles on Monday due to a subsequent infection after the procedure.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, who is very close to Johnny Hallyday, told RTL on Thursday that his friend was walking through a “deep valley”, but he assured that “you don’t need to worry” about the rock musician because he is “a good fighter”.
“He called me before he left for Los Angeles, and I told him it was stupid to sit on a plane for 12 hours after such an operation,” Mitchell said.
On Wednesday evening, the singer’s producer, Jean-Claude Camus, confirmed that Johnny Hallyday is “responsive to the antibiotics” and that “the infection is contained.”
Mr Camus also stated that he had spoken to Laeticia, the singer’s wife, and he had not felt any particular concern.
Still, concern for the singer’s health had grown since he spent nine days in a hospital in July after crashing on his yacht.
Two months later, to the general astonishment, Johnny Hallyday had a “small bowel cancer surgery,” which resulted in a mild infection.
At the end of September, the singer recorded his long "Tour 66" as a farewell tour.
Since then, however, every health problem has been commented on extensively. Fans and journalists have not forgotten that the singer on stage had trouble moving.
It was not until mid-November that the people around him had to deny a new admission to the hospital.
Euro-2009/Kurzbahn: First place for Bousquet over his favourite distance
The Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, triple medal winner at the 2009 World Swimming Championships, won an international title on Thursday over his favorite distance, 50m freestyle, at the Euro-2009 on the short track in Istanbul.
On the first day of this competition, the last time polyurethane suits were allowed, there were only three world records, while a true record flood was expected.
A record was improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto over 4 x 200 m layers and the other two by Russia at 4 x 50m layers of the men.
A pity for Bousquet, who wanted to reach for the world record in the 50m freestyle, whose record he holds in the large pool (20.94).
At one of the two royal distances in swimming, 50m freestyle, the 28-year-old Frenchman prevailed in 20.53 sec, in a final with ten swimmers at the start (usually there are eight) - a premiere at international level.
Bousquet defeated Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but failed to break the world record (20.30) as planned.
“You can believe in bigger and bigger things, and in this case, I said if the world record is within my reach, I’ll try.”
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers started in polyurethane suits, which are banned from January 1, 2010.
With 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations end their epic in Istanbul, which began in 1999 at the same competition for the first time.
The use of the combination did not pay off this time for the German Paul Biedermann, two-time world champion in the pool this summer in Rome and world record.
The young swimmer did not manage to improve his best time over 400m freestyle (3:32.77), yet he has prevailed with the second best time in his career (3:34.55), ahead of the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
“I didn’t give everything this time.
I knew I couldn’t set a world record today, but I defended my title and did my job.”
"Lobintsev will be a serious opponent in the future," said Biedermann.
U.S.: Tombstone at Zola estimated at $1.5 million
A Roman tombstone, which appeared with the French writer Emile Zola, was valued at $1.5 million over its value on Thursday, according to the art dealer Sotheby's.
This plate is two meters long and 63 cm high. It dates from the 3rd century AD and has always been valued at 150,000 to 250,000 dollars.
The marble, on which "four scenes of Dionysus are depicted in a sophistic architectural decor, surrounded by satyrs and Bacchus figures, is a rare piece. There are only four or five of them in the world," Florent Heintz, vice president for auctioning Roman and Egyptian antiquities at Sotheby's, told AFP on Tuesday.
It was sold under hundreds of pieces.
“The sale is still going on, but this part is certainly what buyers have bid for most so far,” Sotheby’s spokesman Dan Abernethy told AFP.
The discovery of this part of the marble by Emile Zola goes back a long way.
The record was at home in Rome for almost 300 years in the famous collection of the Borghese family, after which it appeared piece by piece to the French actress Cécile Sorel, who was used for it in her bathroom of her Paris hotel, and to Paul Reynaud, Minister in the III French Republic and President of the Council, before Marshal Pétain came to power.
The next 50 years are in the dark.
While searching the Louvre database, Florent Heintz discovered that this record was part of an "Inheritance of Emile Zola", which opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of the "Thér<0xC3><0xA8>se Raquin" and the fresco "Rougon-Macquart".
Zelaya's attempt to leave Honduras for Mexico has been thwarted
On Thursday, Mexico had declared the conditions for the transfer of the ousted Honduran President Manuel Zelaya to domestic soil as incompatible, after this escort by the coup government had rejected as unacceptable.
After a telephone conversation with President Zelaya during the night, everything seems to indicate that there is disagreement about the possibilities of carrying out this transfer, said the Mexican Minister of Foreign Affairs, Patricia Espinosa.
According to the immigration authorities, the plane, which was provided by the Mexican government and arrived in Salvador on Wednesday for the purpose of the transfer of M. Zelaya, returned to its starting point.
The coup government wanted to force Mr. Zelaya to "abdicate" and ask him for political asylum abroad under escort.
The ousted president refused, however, as he wished to return to Mexico as the most welcoming current head of state.
The coup regime "has suffered another failure in trying to get me to give up at my expense... they wanted me to abdicate," Mr. Zelaya told Radio Globo on Thursday, in which he has spoken out frequently since the beginning of the political crisis that has been going on in the Central American country for five months.
I can stay here for ten years, I have my guitar here, added the ousted president, who fled to the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa two and a half months ago, with some chords.
The Mexican embassy has presented us with a request for escort, but unfortunately we cannot accept it because it does not include a request for asylum, said Oscar Raul Matute, interior minister of the coup government, to Honduran radio HRN on Wednesday.
I do not seek asylum in any country at all, Manuel Zelaya had answered in an interview with the Telesur channel, whose headquarters are in Caracas.
A possible departure from Honduras, he had underlined, he would only do as president of the Honduran people.
The rumours of M. Zelayas leaving the country on Wednesday had mobilized the supporters of the ousted president, who had set out to the Brazilian embassy and gathered around it, whereupon the military there had intensified its efforts.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticized the coup government’s position.
This, he said, reveals the marginal nature of this government in the face of international norms.
Zelaya, who had approached the socialist Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, had been overthrown on June 28, the day of the referendum he organized in preparation for his re-election, contrary to the advice of the Supreme Court, the army and the Congress.
He had surprisingly returned from exile in Costa Rica on September 21 and had fled to the Brazilian embassy.
If he leaves, he is imprisoned for treason, of which he is accused by the judiciary, according to the coup government.
The coup president Roberto Micheletti has managed to organize a presidential election on November 29 to replace M. Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo had been recognized by the United States in the course of the disputed election, but was rejected by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil.
Three days later, the Kogress had voted massively against M. Zelaya's return to office until the end of his mandate on January 27.
Wall Street Upswing, U.S. Trade Balance Feeds Optimism
The New York Stock Exchange closed on Thursday with a high, the figures of the American trade balance testify to a recovery in the price of the shares of the United States and their partners: the Dow Jones rose by 0.67%, the Nasdaq by 0.33%.
According to the numbers at the close of trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has risen from 68.78 points to 10,405.83 points, while the Nasdaq, which is dominated by technology, has risen from 7.13 points to 2,190.06 points.
The expanded Index Standard & Poor <0xCC><0x81>s 500 was written with 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1,102.35 points.
There is good news from various sectors of the economy, Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial said.
However, this remains anecdotal under the premise that the market only focuses on "semi-full glasses", it moderated.
According to Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors are primarily fixated on the figures of the US trade balance, “which shows an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter.”
The United States trade deficit fell by 7.6% to $32.9 billion in October relative to September.
Analysts, on the other hand, had expected an increase in the deficit.
Both imports and exports have increased.
The big news is the increase in the total volume of trade, especially in goods exports, which reflects the economic growth of the United States’ main trading partners, commented Christopher Cornell of Business Research Economy.com.
In return, unemployment claims in the United States have risen against all expectations in the last week and have now reached the level of 474,000 requests.
However, the average of new job seekers during the last four weeks “fell to the bottom of the year,” Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors said.
The bond market has fallen.
The profitability of government bonds for 10 years has risen to 3.482% compared to 3.432% on Tuesday evening, while the profitability of government bonds for 30 years has risen to 4.492% compared to 4.408% on Tuesday evening.
Cuba: Hundreds of partisans in power whistle "Ladies in White"
Several hundred partisans in Cuban power on Thursday lashed out at the wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana for World Human Rights Day, as well as thwarted another rally that temporarily arrested a dozen dissidents.
Around forty "Ladies in White", wives or political prisoners, were being booed on the open streets by partisans of the government under Raul Castro, just as they were on the march to the center of the capital to demand the liberation of the political prisoners, confirmed a journalist of the AFP.
Down with the Yankies!, "Mercenaries!", "the street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "Fidel and Raul live!" chanted the empowered partisans with a raised fist towards the dissidents.
The latter were escorted by civilian agents who had appeared to "ensure their protection."
A similar demonstration against the "Ladies in White" had taken place in Havana the night before, during which there were neither injuries nor arrests.
In the Vedado district of Havana, on the other hand, a dozen dissidents, who also set out on Thursday for the demonstration in front of the International Human Rights Day, were temporarily arrested by civil police, an AFP reporter confirmed.
According to this journalist, the police have forced the dissidents booed by the partisans of the government to use force to get into civilian vehicles.
The temporary detention of dissidents in such circumstances is usually limited to a few hours.
As candidates for the Sakharov Prize awarded by the European Parliament in 2005, the "Ladies in White" have organized an unauthorized march for the purpose of "Ask for the release of all political prisoners", whose number according to the dissident list has around 200 people, said Laura Pollan, one of the leaders, whose husband Hector Maceda is serving a prison sentence of 20 years.
M. Maceda belongs to the group of 75 Cuban dissidents imprisoned in March 2003, 53 of whom are currently behind bars.
The Cuban authorities perceive the opponents of the regime as "mercenaries" or "agents" in the service of the declared arch-enemy, the United States.
A rarity in itself is that Cuban television reported on the demonstration events that took place on Thursday between militant pro-government fighters and “counterrevolutionaries.”
Cuba, led by a single party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of denigrating rights and freedoms, especially freedom of expression.
Madman kills 80-year-old with knife and leaves 5 injured in Clichy-la-Garenne
An insane man armed with two knives killed an 80-year-old man and injured five others on Friday late afternoon during peak business hours in downtown Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine).
According to the first information of the survey, the 28-year-old attacker had injured the eighty-year-old for so far unexplained cause in or in front of a pharmacy on the Boulevard Jean-Jaures with two knives and this, according to police information, in the presence of witnesses.
The old man, who was born in 1929, died at the hospital of his injuries, according to a representative of the Police Syndicate Alliance.
In or in front of the same pharmacy, he has a couple with a pregnant woman pre-buttoned.
The man, about in his thirties, intervened and was injured.
The first two victims were taken to the hospital, where the 80-year-old died.
The other injured man is in danger of his life because, according to police sources, he apparently affected vital organs.
The pregnant woman has become ill as a result of the events and is said to have been hospitalized in a "shock state", according to a police source.
The armed man, who, according to police reports, seemed to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs, is said to have immediately escaped to the street, the same boulevard Jean Jaures.
He would have injured two other passers-by, apparently accidentally: a thirty-year-old and a forty-year-old, the latter of both heavy.
The scenario remained in the dark in the evening.
He had been armed with two butcher's knives, which he carried crossed behind his back, said Arnaud Pressé, a leader of the Alliance syndicate in the Hauts-de-Seine region.
Several passers-by, including young people, are said to have tried to tame the maniac, according to the witness reports determined by the AFP.
I saw a guy in his thirties with a green vest.
Three young men tried to intervene.
They didn’t make it because the guy was well-built, Alberto, a waiter at a nearby bar, reported.
A horde has fallen over him, he added, including a city policeman who broke his wrist in the process.
Still on Boulevard Jean-Jaures, at number 61, two city police officers, including their superior, tried to arrest the armed man and were injured with stab wounds, according to police information.
The event took place in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where a number of shops are located.
Passersby approached me to tell me that there was an injured person outside.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old person lying on the floor, I put them in first aid position and noticed a gaping wound in the stomach area, Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist, told AFP.
Five minutes later, a second, about thirty-year-old person came, injured by cuts.
Police officers arrested the man who did not carry identification documents.
The public prosecutor’s office of Nanterre has commissioned the district department of the criminal police of Hauts-de-Seine (SDPJ 92) with the investigation of the case.
The man was hospitalized Thursday night.
In view of his condition, he has not yet been heard in court.
A police source does not rule out the possibility that he will be admitted to a mental hospital.
According to another police source, it required six police officers to restrain him at the police station in Clichy, where he had been taken away.
He found himself "in a state of overexcitement" like "all the mentally confused of this kind, in which the forces are released during the process."
USA: Polanski's lawyer calls again for cessation of prosecution
The lawyer of the French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski has repeatedly called on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, western United States) to drop the prosecution of his client, who is currently in court at his place of residence in Switzerland due to a moral violation of more than 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, a lawyer for the director of the "Pianist", has denounced gross procedural errors before three judges of the Court of Appeals in the second district of California at the time of the trial in 1977.
I am calling for immediate sentence, M. Hummel explained, before adding that the conduct of the judge charged with the case at the time of the trial "let a cold run down the back".
According to him, the judge Rittenband, who had died in the meantime, had discussed with a public prosecutor before he passed his sentence, who is said to have told him that Roman Polanski deserved prison -- which is a serious procedural error.
This discussion had been raised in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired", specifically by the prosecutor David Wells.
M. Wells had finally declared at the end of September that the authors of the documentary had "betrayed".
Should the Court refuse to close the criminal proceedings, Mr Hummel demands that a trial be conducted which would enable him to present the evidence for his argument.
The prosecution, for its part, has repeated the evidence already explained in the first instance, i.e. that a discussion for the annulment of the facts charged to the accused cannot be seriously considered as long as Roman Polanski does not appear in court.
The 76-year-old director had fled the United States in 1978 before the sentence for "illegal sexual relations" with a minor of 13 years.
Since then, he has not traveled to the United States.
Los Angeles County Deputy Attorney Phyllis Asayama had stated that Roman Polanski "must be there to attend the trial."
Do you want to spread the message in this matter, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other defendants, who escape is a way out?, asks Mrs. Asayma.
In her opinion, “the filmmaker asks the court for a favor and thus despises his authority.”
One of the three judges – who now have 90 days to announce their decision – even pointed out “that there are other alternatives to escape”.
Hummel was not the only one who had requested the suspension of prosecution against Roman Polanski.
The lawyer of Samantha Geimer, the victim, once again demanded the annulment of the criminal proceedings.
She recalled that her client would no longer endure being harassed by every resurgence of Polanski's affair, adding: "No one in this room can say that this procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years is enough.”
Roman Polanski was arrested in Switzerland on September 26 at the instigation of an American arrest warrant.
After spending two months behind bars, he was then sentenced to house arrest in his chalet in Gstaad in anticipation of eventual extradition.
Wall Street is slowed by the rise of the dollar and closes without a price.
The New York Stock Exchange closed without a price on Friday in a market torn between better-than-usual indicators and a rise in the dollar: The Dow Jones gained 0.63%, while the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
Based on the final figures available at closing, the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased by 65.67 points to 10,471.50 points, while the technologically dominant Nasdaq dropped 0.55 points to 2,190.31 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 expanded index increased by 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1,106.41 points.
“Honestly, the market is pretty quiet,” noted Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
“It remains tight, the trading volume has become very low, and I think it will remain that way until the end of the year.”
The trend was supported by the publication of better-than-expected economic indicators, which "helped to improve the market view on the solidity of the recovery of the economy," summarized Charles Schwab's analysts.
In the US, retail sales increased by 1.3% in November, already two months in a row and far more than planned.
Furthermore, American consumer confidence improved significantly in December, to 73.4 from 67.4 in the previous month, according to the University of Michigan Index Preview.
However, the indexes have been held back by a new rise in the dollar’s exchange rate, which has reached its highest level against the euro in two months, pushing down sectors vulnerable to the economic situation,” said Owen Fitzpatrick, Deutsche Bank.
As a result, technological values have lost some ground.
The bond market has declined.
The yield on the Treasury bond over 10 years increased by 3.540% on Wednesday evening compared to 3.482% and that of the bond over 30 years to 4.497% compared to 4.492% on the previous day.
Miss World to be re-elected in South Africa
After a month’s tour of South Africa, the 112 contestants for the title of Miss World on Saturday will cross the final hurdle to realize their dream: to be voted the most beautiful woman in the world and do so in front of a billion television viewers.
During this major beauty fair, which is being held in the Johannesburg area for the second time in a row, five of them have already won their ticket to the semi-finals.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma from Canada were crowned Miss Sportive or Miss Topmodel during their African stay.
This was a true vortex of pleasure.
Beautiful cities to visit, such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Horn, was simply exceptional.
I’ve seen a lot of things and had a lot of experiences!, said Miss Sierra Leone with great enthusiasm.
This competition will take place for the ninth time in South Africa and will be broadcast live from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, on Saturday, starting at 5pm (3pm Central European Time).
I couldn't think of a better country to hand over my crown.
This experience was simply fascinating.
I am happy to have had this experience twice, underlined Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the South African summer.
For the young Russian, her second stay in South Africa was characterized by numerous exchanges of experience with candidates and the rediscovery of "breathtaking landscapes".
After a month of galas, rehearsals, meetings with the press and safari, the Misses now focus on the competition.
Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to follow in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, who was elected in 2000 and will also be present at this election, as well as emulate Aishwarya Rai, who was elected in 1994 and both became Bollywood stars.
It is, of course, every woman’s dream to be crowned as the most beautiful woman in the world, but it’s not just about appearance.
We are ambassadors of our country and I want to come home with the crown, Miss India throws in with a big smile.
According to the organizers, this 59th edition will be underlined with music and dance.
The candidates defy in traditional costumes and not to forget, in bathing suits.
The performance will be presented by a television presenter, Chinese Angela Chow, former beauty queen from South Africa, Michelle McLean, and Miss World committee leader, Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it can receive the world with an unsurpassed warmth and pride, Julia Morley, chairman of Miss World, assures.
The candidates have, like last year, made a safari, visiting the famous township in Soweto, but this time by bike and taste the local cuisine.
However, the meeting with South African President Jacob Zuma, who gave them their hand, was quite extraordinary.
Not usual for a head of state, noted Miss Sierra Leone.
Their most beautiful memory, however, remains undoubtedly the draw in Cape Town (south-west) to the World Cup in June 2010, a way of the country to advertise this event a little more.
I'm with people I'd probably never be able to get close to.
I will certainly come back to the World Cup 2010, promised enthusiastically Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
News of Johnny Hallyday is “very positive” according to his son David
The news about Johnny Hallyday is “very positive,” his son David assured on Friday when he arrived at Los Angeles Airport, where he visited his father, who has been in the hospital for several days.
The news is very positive.
He is very strong, everything is going very well, explained David Hallyday to the press when he got off the plane, in which he arrived from Paris shortly after 1 p.m. local time (21:00 CET).
The singer's son, who made a relaxed impression, assured that he would "fastest" go to Cedars-Sina<0xC3><0xAF> hospital, where Johnny Hallyday was hospitalized on Monday for a bacterial follow-up infection following surgery on a herniated disc in Paris on November 26.
The singer was “put into an artificial coma this night in Los Angeles to relieve his severe pain and perform his treatment, the press service announced.
Johnny Hallyday was put into an artificial coma by the doctors at Cedars-Sina<0xC3><0xAF> Hospital in Los Angeles, where he was admitted on Monday for a bacterial follow-up infection after a disc surgery on November 26 in Paris.
The singer had to undergo surgery again in the night from Wednesday to Thursday due to the pathological changes caused by the last intervention.
His wife Laeticia attended a school event Friday morning at the French high school in Los Angeles, where her daughter Jade goes to school, an AFP photographer noted.
Yves Catoné, head of the department of orthopedic and traumatological surgery at the Pitié-Salp<0xC3><0xAA>tri<0xC3><0xA8>re hospital, announced that he would visit the singer on Monday at the hospital in Los Angeles.
The producer has heavily burdened the neurosurgeon Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, who operated the singer on November 26 at the Clinique internationale du parc Monceau in Paris.
We were told that he had committed the purest massacre.
The Los Angeles surgeons said they were completely outraged, Mr. Camus explained.
“I’ve heard that you may be going to court,” he said.
Jean-Claude Camus is of the opinion that Johnny Hallyday "traveled far too fast and this with the permission of the Paris surgeon to Los Angeles".
I personally talked to this doctor on the phone, who assured me that he sees this trip as completely unproblematic, which had surprised me a lot, since I myself have already had two intervertebral disc operations behind me, he added.
Shortly before, he announced to RTL that the singer had apparently left the hospital "without drainage, without everything" after the operation.
Dr Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the artistic world.
He had the actress Marie Trintignant, operating in Vilnius a few days before her death, at a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine, where he was practicing at the time.
In 2007, he had also operated on the actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to reabsorb a hematoma after a brain haemorrhage.
But he is also a doctor with a dubious reputation, who has already been convicted several times for failed operations and not to forget, for tax evasion and fraud.
Olivier Metzner, lawyer of the Medical Association, has described him as "a man without scruples" who is "regularly" responsible before the board of directors and "everything else is not recommended".
After a few days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux made a statement on Friday about his lawyer, Me David Koubbi.
He said the intervention was “perfect” and the post-operative examinations were “normal.”
The operation "did not cause bleeding and therefore does not require drainage," he added.
In any case, the tour of the singer, whose health problems have been brewing since last summer, seems to be in question.
It is quite clear that it is a bit too short for a continuation of the tour on January 8 (in Amiens), explained Mr. Camus.
The UDF (Union for French Democracy) party alliance is becoming vigorous and calls on the Nouveau Centre party to stop using its seal
The coalition of parties, which is being monitored by Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou’s MoDem party, reacted strongly on Friday to an attempt to take over the seal, the party once founded by Valéry Giscard d’Estaing, by the leader of the Nouveau Centre party, Hervé Morin, and asked him, under threat of prosecution, not to use this seal on any document.
Hervé Morin publicly announces his intention to adopt this UDF seal, believing that Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou would not be worthy of defending this political legacy after handing it over to the left.
By the way, the Minister of Defense, whose party partner is the UMP, wanted to reaffirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
In order to underline his efforts, he had received the support of MEP Hervé de Charette (former UMP, now with NC), who claims ownership of the UDF brand, since he was the first to apply for that brand at the Institut national de la propriété industrielle in 2004.
However, the office of the UDF party alliance overseen by Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrous's friends broke the silence and made it clear that they could not be expropriated and, under threat of prosecution, set a deadline for the Minister and the Member of Parliament to cease using this seal and to transfer the ownership rights of the trade mark to them.
You have made numerous statements in recent days that you would propose to your political movement to +take the UDF seal+, the party alliance wrote in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 office members, including Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez, the MoDem party and Senator Jean Arthuis of the centrist alliance.
You also believed that you had the right to have the name of this movement +Nouveau centre+, the slogan + of today’s UDF +, printed on your political material as well as on the homepage of your website.
As you know, you are not entitled to the use of this seal, the UDF Office stated, and urges the NC Party to “immediately remove the mention of the name UDF from all material and from (its) website.”
In addition, Hervé de Charette was required to "transfer the rights of ownership of the brand to its legal claimants".
If you refuse to do so, we will file a lawsuit against you to gain respect for the law and to defend the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories warned.
In their letter, they stress that “UDF” has been a full-fledged political movement since 1978 and recall that Morin and his friends “made the choice” to leave it in 2007 to form a competing movement, as others had done in 2002 to found the UMP party.
The Nouveau centre party therefore, according to the signatories, does not have any rights to use the UDF (Union pour la démocratie fran<0xC3><0xA7>aise) seal.
They also recall that the UDF’s last congress in 2007 approved the three-year membership of the MoDem party and the establishment of an office to defend “the material and moral interests” of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d’Estaing.
As far as Hervé de Charette is concerned, the office continues, "at the time he applied for the brand name, he was no longer a member of the UDF for three years" but of the UMP.
He benefits in a scandalous and fraudulent way from the lack of depositing the acronym UDF to do this for himself.
You also point out that this recklessness is well on its way to turning into a crime, and ironize NC’s strategy: “It seems more dignified to make a name for yourself in politics as well as in life, rather than trying to come out of anonymity by fraudulently acquiring a name that you have no legal right to.”
Affaire Liliane Bettencourt : Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois-Marie Banier sentenced for exploiting weakness
The Court of Nanterre decided on Friday to judge the artist Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois-Marie Banier to determine whether, as claimed by the daughter of the billionaire Liliane Bettencourt, he exploited a weak moment of the eighty-year-old to steal a part of her fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, who is known for his star photos, will face trial on 15 and 16 April 2010 for exploiting weakness, a crime punishable by a maximum prison sentence of three years and a fine of 375,000 euros.
This decision means that there will indeed be a trial in this affair worthy of the saga of one of France’s richest families, where mother and daughter are fettered and at the same time have the reins of the cosmetics empire L’Oréal in their hands.
Similarly, the 15th Criminal Chamber ordered a medical examination of the 87-year-old Liliane Bettencourt, which is carried out jointly by three doctors.
The heiress and main shareholder of L’Oréal has so far refused to undergo such an investigation, especially under the conditions presented during the investigation by the prosecutor’s office of Nanterre.
The doctors appointed on Friday should submit a report before 10 March 2010 in which you clearly state whether and at what times Liliane Bettencourt may have been in a state of weakness.
I think she's going to go through these investigations.
I'll talk to her," Bettencourt's lawyer, Me Georges Kiejman, said after the trial.
As for the lawyer of Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise Bettencourt-Meyers, Me Olivier Metzner, he is very satisfied with the decision of the court.
This is excellent news (...). The report will prove that he (Banier) manipulated this old lady, which must be protected, he affirmed.
For the past two years, Liliane Bettencourt’s only daughter has filed a criminal complaint against Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois-Marie Banier, photographer and all-round artist, accusing him of taking advantage of her mother’s weakness for years to sneak up on donations totaling one billion euros in the form of bank cheques, insurance policies or paintings.
For her part, Liliane Bettencourt had always denied being manipulated by the photographer, whom she sees as a long-time friend.
Although the court would have to consider the admissibility of the lawsuit initiated by Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers, the lawyers' plaidoyers led to a major family debacle on Friday.
Liliane Bettencourt’s lawyer has referred to three letters (1999, 2003 and 2005) sent by his client to her notary, in which she wrote that she distrusts Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise Bettencourt-Meyers’ husband.
According to her lawyer, Liliane Bettencourt added: “Could you please explain to my daughter that I have been writing to Banier for fifteen years, once or twice a day.
I have never been able to speak to Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise since her marriage.”
Nanterre’s public prosecutor’s office is again of the opinion that the plaintiff had no right to react in this way, especially because a guardianship judge has rejected her request in recent days to initiate a judicial protection procedure against her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "is fully legal, is not under protection and has no guardian.
No one has the right to act in their place,” said prosecutor Marie-Christine Daubigney.
The court has now decided to issue a judgment after the admissibility trial of Mme Bettencourt-Meyers took place.
Managerial Revolution or the End of Early Strategic Enlightenment?
If nothing changes in the leadership of the great French companies, our struggle for the development of economic intelligence has been in vain ...
For over a decade, the attitude of the management of large companies in relation to its employees, said the position of the companies vis-<0xC3><0xA0>-vis the consumers before the marketing revolution: It is for the staff to join "values" determined the best, as it was earlier to impose on the consumer products designed by the technicians at the factory.
By putting the customer at the center of the business, the marketing revolution has given the strategies of conquering the markets in place... although the authoritarian temptation separates products factors to impose customer preferences again regularly!
Demobilization of employees can lead to fatal demoralization.
The suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are just the tip of a much larger phenomenon that affects employees in particular.
This demobilization has a negative impact on the development of all intellectual functions of the company, especially those of R&D and, more crucially, those of economic intelligence.
In fact, the IE (Intelligence Economy = economic intelligence) demands "a proactive approach and a forward-looking view from all the parties involved (...)"; it demands from the employees a commitment that is completely contrary to the instructions of the authoritarian management.
That is why we are calling for an operational revolution, which would consist in placing the employees at the centre of the company’s concerns alongside the customers on an equal footing.
The Very Conditional Benefits of Internal Opinion Polls
Will the internal opinion polls, such as the questionnaire submitted by Orange to its wage earners, stimulate this revolution in terms of management practice?
I'm afraid not.
- First of all, because I was able to find that in the face of a new situation, after many detours, the whole fabric finally comes down to primarily doing what it has always done.
Also because authoritarianism – one of the pathologies of power – increases proportionally to the meaning of its own failures.
And finally, because most leaders have a greatly simplified idea of human behavior.
Originating from the great engineering schools, their interpretation of psychology is mechanistic.
They adopt, through intellectual comfort, the old behaviourist theory, recently reactivated by the American “neurosciences” and unwittingly widely disseminated by research institutes and by the media.
Thus, and by suggesting that it is possible to use the "lever" (sic) to engage employees, a recent survey published in Le Figaro.fr by Ipsos encourages leaders in an attitude towards a mechanistic control system that is unsuitable for today's world.
Identify and measure the mobilization factors
Instead, an operational revolution necessary for the smooth functioning of modern enterprises presupposes the adoption of a definitive view of human behavior.
It consists of integrating a basic protocol into any management thinking or practice: for the wage earners, commitment to the enterprise is only possible if it clearly appears as a means of realising part of their dreams, ambitions and intentions.
Currently, only the studies from the multifunctional analysis take over this conception of the motivation of the employees.
These studies have shown that they assess their company on the basis of a pre-defined Doxa that allows them to estimate what it offers them to achieve their life goals through their perceived image of the company.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of these mobilization factors, the managers of the companies can control, predict and anticipate their "social performance" and place their human resource management back in the right place.
In this way, they create fertile soil that is favorable for the coordinated development of a robust and efficient economic intelligence.
Oslo speech: the ‘just war’ brings Obama praise from the right
The American right welcomed Barack Obama’s speech in Oslo on Friday and was satisfied that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize defended the notion of “just war” against the enemies of the United States.
The Conservatives, who mocked the awarding of the award to Obama on October 9, applauded the president’s speech this time, following the example of former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin in the 2008 election.
I liked what he said, explained Palin, the face of the Republican Party’s right wing in the daily USA Today, adding that she herself had raised the topic of a “sometimes necessary” war in her recently published memoirs.
The war is, of course, the last thing I think the Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
We need to stop the terrorists down there, she says.
Obama, who inherited two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, on Thursday in Oslo sought to justify the use of force; a way of declaring his decision nine days ago to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, expressed the opinion that the president had done “very good work” in Oslo.
I found that the speech was really very good, the former President of the House of Representatives, who especially acknowledged the reference to "the existence of evil in the world" in the words of Obama, rejoiced.
In some parts, I felt this speech was entirely historical, said Ginrich, who was interviewed on the radio show "The Takeaway".
The former MP, considered by some to be a possible candidate for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination, said he was pleased to have seen a “left-wing president” who reminded Nobel committee members that they were “not free and could not hand out a prize for peace if the use of force did not exist.”
For Michael Gerson, former George W. Bush writer and now editor at the Washington Post, Obama gave “a very American speech.”
In addition to portraying himself as a “cosmopolitan,” as “he always does,” he has “spoke like an American president,” when he pointed out that Europeans “live like in a security bubble that they haven’t created themselves and they don’t do much to protect,” Gerson said.
Among the few unconvinced right-wingers, former UN Ambassador John Bolton, a falcon of the Bush era, described the speech on the National Review Online website as "boring, haughty and uninspiring."
To the left of the president, Democratic Rep. Dennis Kucinich is concerned about how Barack Obama is defending the use of the armed forces.
If the war is packaged under the guise of justice, the massacre of the innocent can simply be justified, he warns.
The press of the moderate left, however, continues to praise the president.
The Los Angeles Times, which still believes that the Nobel Prize was prematurely awarded to Obama, called the speech a “monumental work” even for a speaker like him who is known for his talent.
The speech in Oslo “provides a roadmap for managing international decisions against conflict, poverty and oppression,” according to the Californian daily enthusiastically.
The New York Times believes that Obama “proclaimed the necessary discourse” and calls his speech “dark and exemplary at the same time.”
Truck driver: Three marathons for an agreement that secures supplies for Christmas
After a three-week negotiation marathon, the unions of the road federation and the TLF - the only employer organization that remained until the end - came to an agreement on Friday evening, which puts an end to the strike order and the looming severe supply shortage at Christmas.
At the signature meeting on Friday evening, State Secretary for Transport Dominique Bussereau "welcomed" the agreement, which was initiated on Wednesday morning after several weeks of negotiations.
After a second night of negotiations, the negotiators parted early Friday morning, hoping to quickly sign the agreement late in the morning.
This was despite the fact that the three employers’ associations (FNTR, Unostra and OTRE) had left the meeting.
However, more than six hours passed from the beginning of the meeting at 11:00 a.m. to the conclusion of the agreement, and it was not until 18:00 that the agreement was signed.
The conflict "would have caused a lot of damage to the companies" and "it was to be feared that it would affect the holidays at the end of the year," said Bussereau.
The agreement provides for a 4% wage increase for the lowest wages (local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest wage groups (international transport).
The hourly rate for employees with the lowest wages thus rises from 8.72 euros to 9.06 euros.
"It's not much, but we're starting small," said Patrice Clos (FO).
The activists are now ordered to stop blocking the supply centers.
"However, there will probably always be some inconsistent people who are not satisfied with the agreement," he adds.
TLF chairman Philippe Grillot called it a “good deal,” although it was “difficult to concede these wage increases in the face of international competition.”
According to him, the increase is at 170 euros per month for the low and at 100 to 120 euros for the high wage groups.
"This agreement is based on common sense and respect for employees," said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) spoke of "a historic agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) said it was "an acceptable compromise".
The agreement also provides for an increase of 3% in travel costs and for the maintenance of the total road transport budget in the first half of 2010, which will make it possible in particular to address the issue of 13th monthly salary and the modernisation of collective agreements.
M. Bussereau recalled that "the fall in taxes for employers amounting to 100 million euros" was the subject of a government amendment to the Bill of Corrected Finance for 2009, which was passed by the National Assembly on the night of Thursday to Friday.
The government is demanding "an identical" vote from the Senate.
The signature of the TLF allows the agreement to initially apply to the companies affiliated to that organisation and then to apply to the entire profession in the event of extension by the Minister of Labour.
This will be the case "in the shortest possible time", Bussereau assures.
The opposition of the employers' associations can only delay the proceedings.
The association FNTR denounced a "fraudulent trade" because the 100 million euros "had already been promised to the sector to compensate for part of the carbon tax".
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate as quickly as possible, but not on the basis of a joint analysis, but in order not to embarrass the goose eaters on the approaching Christmas days, complains the Unostra.
For the Otre association, the agreement "threatens to shovel a big grave for the small and medium-sized enterprises in the industry in the next 12 months".
Line RER A: disruptions this weekend, unions dissatisfied with RATP proposals
The disruptions on the RER A line, the largest high-speed rail network in France for the metropolitan area of Paris and <0xC3><0x8E>le-de-France, continued over the weekend, while a meeting on Friday, the 2nd day of strike between the trade unions and the leadership of the RATP (Independent Paris Passenger Transport Administration), made strikers wait with their demands for pay increases.
There were no trains on the main line (between La Défense and Nation) between 10 a.m. and 8 p.m. on this important shopping weekend before Christmas.
Connection to SNCF trains was interrupted in Nanterre Prefecture, forcing passengers to change trains.
The Galeries Lafayette department store chain, which counts 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "RATP is trying to connect the major stores with traffic technology."
The RER A line runs through the Paris metropolitan area from west to east.
The RATP section connects the towns of Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre as well as Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one in two trains ran as scheduled at rush hour, and almost none during the low-traffic period.
As on Thursday, there was no commotion on the platforms, as the inhabitants of the <0xC3><0x8E>le-de-France had prepared themselves to the situation.
So early in the morning, the train station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was far less crowded than usual, mainly because of the lack of high school students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), engineer Jack Nbakina (29) declared that he had “got up an hour and a half early to get to work on time”.
The SNCF, which had planned to take care of the passengers by staff and police, pointed out that there had been no bottlenecks at Saint-Lazare station.
The trains operated by the SNCF on the RER A line from or towards Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or left via the Saint-Lazare station to ensure connection to the metros.
On Saturday and Sunday, general meetings of the strikers were held again, during which the results were reviewed, which the associations had classified as "poor" after the meeting with the top management on Friday afternoon.
The RER Managing Director proposed the specific elaboration of a protocol for the RER A line with regard to all relevant aspects, working hours, career paths, etc.
According to Thierry Garon (Sud), they are asking for a long-term wage increase, which is not what the drivers want.
The CGT was outraged that the RATP itself put its salary surcharge proposals in brackets, stressing that the top leadership “is unable to solve a problem, while it was also possible with the long-distance drivers and the SNCF.”
The RATP made it clear that a new meeting for the "comprehensive review of working conditions" is planned for Monday.
This also shows the associations that the company "ignores the weekend drivers".
In the morning, about 150 drivers visited the branch of a committee in Paris.
Once again, it was the leadership who, to date, rejected any discussion during the strike and suggested a meeting after a calming of the situation.
On Tuesday, the conflict threatened to expand to the RER B line after an announcement by Unsa and Indépendants.
The associations demand a wage surcharge of 120 (USA) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud, Indépendants). In addition, they complain of the deterioration of working conditions on this route, on which millions of travellers are traveling every day.
The drivers of the RER line, who have many years of professional experience, receive a gross wage of 2,200 to 2,700 euros as well as a wage surcharge of 600 to 650 euros for shift services as well as Sundays and public holidays.
Turkish Constitutional Court dissolves pro-Kurdish party. Decision with serious consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court announced on Friday the dissolution of the country’s main pro-Kurdish party; a decision that was immediately followed by furious demonstrations in the Kurdish community in the southeast of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision threatens to make the work of the government, which is trying to reach out to the Kurdish community to put an end to the conflicts that have been going on for 25 years.
The "Party for a Democratic Society" (DTP) was dissolved because it had become a "site for activities that are detrimental to the independence of the state and its indivisible unity," said the president of the Constitutional Court Hasim Kili<0xC3><0xA7> four days after the order to the press.
According to Kili<0xC3><0xA7>, the decision would have been taken unanimously by 11 judges, with a majority of seven votes needed to impose the dissolution, and he pointed out that 37 of the party’s leaders, including chairman Ahmet Türk and parliamentarian Aysel Tugluk, were excluded from the political scene for a period of five years.
The judge also announced the lifting of the parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Türk and Tuglik, as well as the confiscation of the party’s assets.
The DTP now has 21 seats in parliament (out of 550).
The party leaders expressed themselves before the verdict that the parliamentarians would rather leave the parliament than to meet like non-partisan parliamentarians.
The decision followed a trial initiated in 2007 by the prosecutor of the Turkish Federal Court Abdurrahman Yal<0xC3><0xA7>inkaya, who accused the DTP of following the "instructions" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which Ankara and numerous other countries consider a terrorist organization.
Numerous observers believe that the DTP is the legal political showcase of the PKK rebels.
The party claims to have "no connection" to the PKK, but refuses to call it a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate.
The ruling of the Constitutional Court is intervening with the government, which seeks to accommodate the Kurdish community and propose a series of measures to strengthen the rights of the Kurds in order to drain the support of the PKK by the Kurds and put an end to the conflicts.
The leaders of the DTP reiterate that a resolution could lead to a re-emergence of tensions in Southeast Anatolia, where numerous demonstrations against the detention conditions of PKK leader Abdullah <0xC3><0x96>calan have led to clashes with police in recent weeks.
Since the court’s announcement, thousands of demonstrators have gathered outside the DTP’s premises in the megacity of Diyarbakir in the southeast, which is predominantly populated by Kurds.
The law enforcement used tear gas grenades and water cannons as protesters began throwing Molotov cocktails and stones.
Hundreds of people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Türk assumed that the court's decision will "deepen the despair even further."
"Turkey cannot resolve this (Kurdish) issue by banning a party," he told the press.
The government, consisting of a party that emerged from the Islamist movement, also regretted the decision.
"We oppose, on principle, the closure of the parties.
This does not solve the problems," said Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
"This decision is a torpedoing of the democratic opening promoted by the government," said Ahmet Island, a political market observer.
“You can obviously expect a reaction from the PKK,” he adds.
On Thursday, the PKK claimed responsibility for an attack that killed seven soldiers in northern Turkey three days earlier, one of the most brutal in recent months.
The snow can come
A really crisp winter, that’s what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not because he wants to bully the citizens, says the winter service manager of the FES.
But so that his employees can try out and master the entire vehicle technology.
According to meteorologists, it could be the first time this has happened.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of snow and ice.
The FES follows a precise plan.
As soon as it snows all over Frankfurt and the temperatures are below zero degrees, 20 so-called A-routes are traveled with large-scale stray vehicles, explains Brauburger.
These include, for example, main traffic and through roads such as the Neue Weg and the Hanauer Landstra<0xC3><0x9F>e.
But also fire brigade access roads, public transport routes, pedestrian zones and routes with gradients, such as the Atzelbergstra<0xC3><0x9F>e.
The FES service starts at three o’clock in the morning
If necessary, the approximately 1040 kilometers would have to be sprinkled in a maximum of three hours with wet salt, which adheres better.
Therefore, the FES starts at three o’clock at night, “so that the routes are free until the professional traffic starts”.
It will be difficult if it does not snow until 7.30 a.m.
Then we have a problem, says the winter service manager, "because then no one is willing to make room for the spreading vehicles".
Only after that, if it does not snow further, are feeder and access roads, which also includes the Rat-Beil-Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e, the turn.
The last priority is side streets and side streets.
There will be complaints there, Brauburger knows.
At five o’clock in the morning, the foot soldiers of the FES set off, danger points and transitions are cleared as a priority.
The FES usually cannot take care of all cycle paths.
There is a special service in Frankfurt that mainly keeps an eye on the bridges from 10 p.m. to 4.30 p.m., says Brauburger.
Since there is smoothness on this quickly, as soon as the temperature drops below two degrees, the spreader is on its way.
If necessary, it will also be called by the police.
The Cradle of the Dinosaurs
Tawa hallae looked like many other carnivorous dinosaurs: the two-meter-long and 1.50-meter-long animal ran on two strong hind legs, had an elongated skull with sharp, curved teeth, short arms with sickle claws and a long tail.
If the species had lived a few million years later, it would be nothing special.
But Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these body features, reports Sterling Nesbitt of the University of Texas at Austin and colleagues in Thursday’s journal Science.
The animal lived about 215 million years ago in what is now New Mexico, which was then located in a dry zone of the supercontinent Pangaea on the equator.
Tawa opens a new window on the early evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
He shows us a lot about the kinship relationships, the spread and the characteristics of the early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other paleontologists began a dig at Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico.
We have sometimes found a dozen dinosaur bones in one day, which is unprecedented for Triassic deposits, reports team member Randall Irmis of the Utah Museum of Natural History.
Some of the bones the researchers quickly identified as a new species.
In the course of the excavation, they collected the remains of a total of five individuals.
Fund confirms theories about early dinosaur history
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt, it is an extraordinary find: "Dinosaur fossils from the Triassic are extremely rare, usually only individual fragments can be found."
Other dinosaur experts don’t necessarily share the enthusiasm.
This find is not particularly spectacular, but it confirms some theories about the early history of dinosaurs, says Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
According to the current theory, the dinosaurs first appeared about 230 million years ago.
However, many of the oldest fossils are incomplete, which is why the assignment of these primordial dinosaurs is usually controversial.
For example, the experts debate when the lizards split up into their three main lines of development: the carnivorous theropods, which later included the Tyrannosaurus rex, the Velociraptor, and also the birds, the four-legged sauropods and their relatives known as "long necks", and the plant-eating ornithoid squids.
According to the analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa hallae is an original theropod.
It has an interesting combination of primitive and advanced features, Nesbitt says.
On the skull of Tawa hallae, for example, the researchers found evidence of air sacs, as they also possess the descendants of the theropods, the birds.
Thanks to the air sacs, the respiration of birds is more efficient than that of mammals.
At Tawa hallae, the bones of the spine were also apparently partially filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive theropod with air sacs, says Randall Irmis.
Since the related line of giant sauropods later also possessed air sacs and lightweight bones, the common ancestor of both groups had probably already produced this useful innovation.
At least three waves of migration to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs known to date lived in South America, the researchers conclude that the lizards first appeared there.
Thus, the three development lines separated early and spread from South America over all continents, which at that time still formed as a supercontinent Pangaea a single land mass.
This is supported by the fact that the team, together with Tawa hallae, found the remains of two other, not particularly closely related theropods.
The three cannot be descended from a common, immigrant ancestor, the researchers argue.
We believe there were at least three waves of migration to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, a co-author of the science study.
Of course, there are also contradictions.
An even older species, Silesaurus, which belongs to a sister group of dinosaurs, lived in present-day Poland, says the Bonn paleontologist Martin Sander.
In his opinion, a distorted picture could emerge, because in South America just particularly many primitive dinosaur fossils have been preserved, while on other continents there is hardly anything to be found.
How the dinosaurs managed to evolve from a relatively rare sideline of the reptilian tribe to the dominant land vertebrates of the Middle Ages is still puzzling.
During the Triassic, the dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, such as the ancestors of today's crocodiles and pterosaurs, and with numerous other lizards.
Towards the end of the Triassic, the dinosaurs spread around the world and developed many new species, while the relatives on the border from the Triassic to the Jurassic became extinct.
Success story does not last forever
There are two hypotheses to explain this shift, says Martin Sander.
There may have been a mass extinction that the dinosaurs happened to survive, but the other reptiles did not.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted so that they could beat the competition out of the field.
The success story did not last forever.
150 million years later, a meteorite strike helped a group of animals to flower, which had also developed in the Triassic and has since lived in a shadow: the mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatories are international.
Professors from the University of Toronto, the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna or from Berkeley in California are on it.
Lecturers from Naples are there, from Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The police eviction of the occupied casino of Frankfurt’s Goethe University is making waves worldwide.
278 professors and lecturers from Goethe University, as well as from universities throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America show solidarity with the protesting students on the Westend campus.
In a statement written in German and English, they "disapprove" the police intervention initiated by the Presidium.
University President Werner Müller-Estler had the building occupied by students and lecturers in the education strike cleared last week, because walls and works of art had been smeared.
Five students were injured.
The material damage, the signatories judge, did not justify "the violent dissolution of self-organized courses of students and teachers by a police commando."
The eviction represents an "unacceptable interference" in the freedom of research and teaching.
The exclusive focus on vandalism serves "the deligitimization and criminalization of protest" and distracts from the content.
The Bureau has evaded the necessary discourse.
The lecturers call for the immediate cessation of criminal prosecution.
The majority of the occupiers did not support the damage, it said.
Protest legitimized
The youth of the Verdi trade union and the German Trade Union Confederation also show solidarity with the students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of a growing concern for one’s own future, says Verdi State Youth Secretary Alexander Klein.
Hesse’s Minister of Science Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) defended the actions of the university president and the police.
We are grateful to the President.
Destruction and occupation are completely unacceptable means, she said in a current hour on Thursday in the Wiesbaden state parliament.
We have an understanding of the protest, but no understanding of vandalism, according to the CDU member of parliament Peter Beuth.
The opposition factions SPD, Greens and Left saw it differently.
The CDU uses painted walls as a pretext to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (left).
Instead of dealing with the arguments and demands of the students, they have been cleared.
The Left has tabled a motion calling on the Interior Minister to report on the police operation.
New Silicon Valley
For many years it was considered a secret city, inaccessible to Western visitors.
Selenograd, one of the ten districts of the capital Moscow, was in the Soviet Union a strictly guarded location for secret arms research.
Today, the municipality with its 216,000 inhabitants, 37 kilometers from the center of Moscow, is considered "Russian Silicon Valley".
Important research and production facilities for micro- and nanoelectronics are located here.
Since September 2008, representatives of Selenograd had already established contacts with the Frankfurt science location Riedberg - with the university institutes and the companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Center (FIZ).
There were several mutual visits and on Wednesday, Selenograd and Riedberg signed a "protocol for closer cooperation" in Frankfurt.
Moscow Deputy Mayor Yuri Roslyak and Prefect Anatoly Smirnov of Selenograd led the Russian delegation, for Frankfurt signed planning officer Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises of the scientific research focus will travel to Selenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
It is a matter of continuous scientific exchange.
But it is also about economic relations.
FIZ companies will be able to gain a foothold in the growing Russian market.
Conversely, Russian science companies want to get contracts in Germany.
Selenograd is home to major Russian research institutes and companies.
These include, for example, the Moscow Institute of Electron Technology, the large corporations Sitronics and Rossijskaya Elektronika.
The municipality was founded in 1958 as a so-called "socialist planning city" for arms research.
Selenograd (literally translated "Green City") got its name from the wooded hilly landscape in which the research facilities are embedded.
Stuttgarter Bremsklotz
The dimension of Stuttgart 21 cannot be set high enough.
For the proponents of the project, it is simply about "the new heart of Europe".
S21 is much more than the lowering of a railway station, more than a monstrous construction project that will plunge the city of the state capital of Baden-Württemberg into a hopeless chaos of construction sites for a decade.
Stuttgart 21 was born out of the spirit of the 1980s.
Station stations with tracks that end in the middle of the city were then considered to be transport fossils of the 19th century, which acted like brake blocks of modern rail traffic, since it once took an enormous amount of time to span locomotives from rear to front.
Drive in, keep it short, keep driving - that's how it should go.
And that’s why the top stations should disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a transit station, which lies about halfway between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava on the Trans-European rail route – hence the slogan of the "Heart of Europe".
S21 is now actually being tackled, even though the visions of the 80s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even very ambitious planners have realized that it is almost priceless in the Hessian and the Bavarian big city to implement the lowering.
However, head stations no longer have an entry and exit problem, since there are modern reversible trains with rail vehicles and control cars at both ends.
Nevertheless: Stuttgart 21 together with the new ICE line to Ulm is now being tackled.
Local and regional politicians have done it.
The railway is taking part, partly because the risks of the largest single infrastructure project of the Republic of the taxpayers and not the state corporation bear.
In terms of urban planning, the project can still be justified to some extent.
The result is a new urban space, which - according to the computer-generated graphics of the planners - is equipped with a lot of greenery.
S21 is harmful to the rail transport system.
The transit station and the extension of the line are intended for passenger traffic, to which - typical 80s - huge growth was attributed.
At that time, there was no competition from low-cost airlines.
However, modern transport policy must first of all be about strengthening freight transport, since rail transport is considerably more environmentally friendly than road transport by truck.
But the new line is not suitable for freight trains because of heavy gradients.
What is even more serious is that S21 indirectly affects many other rail projects.
A good six billion euros are to be buried in the Swabian.
That is the official number.
Experts think 10 to 15 billion is realistic.
It is certain that in the next decade, the money will be missing from other nodes and bottlenecks in the network.
A total of sixty major projects are on the list of the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the expansion of the 180 km long route through the Rhine Valley.
Since 1987, the track has been built at a slow-motion pace.
It would be urgent to press the tube properly.
But S21 will act as a brake pad.
The Rhine Valley route becomes the bottleneck for international freight transport: right in the heart of Europe.
The government is considering a decision on the airport
The state government has left open in the Wiesbaden state parliament whether it will go against the judgment of the Hessian Administrative Court (VGH) to the night flight ban in revision.
The CDU/FDP coalition has commissioned experts to have the more than 400 pages of the VGH judgment legally examined, said Economics Minister Dieter Posch (FDP).
On those days, the VGH in Kassel had justified in writing that the country had to re-regulate the night flight ban in the event of the construction of the planned Northwest runway in Frankfurt Airport.
The approval of 17 flights between 23 and 5 a.m., as provided for by the state government, is not compatible with the statutory protection of the population from nocturnal aircraft noise.
The coalition has until January 4 to decide whether it goes against the verdict in revision.
The opposition criticized this postponement and urged the government’s representatives to refrain from a review at the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
SPD party leader Torsten Sch<0xC3><0xA4>fer-Gümbel called on the CDU and FDP to return to their promises made before the election to a night flight ban. Otherwise, this is to be considered a "word break".
It is damn hard if you can keep your word, said Green leader Tarek Al-Wazir in reference to the FDP election slogan "We keep word".
Minister Posch rejected Sch<0xC3><0xA4>fer-Gümbel’s accusation that the state government is still trying to use “right-wing twisting and trickery” to get to its night flights.
A thorough legal examination will take your time.
The coalition does not want to operate on the basis of a "fast first impression".
We need a legally sound decision, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
Just as she represented the opposition, the statements of her group on the night flight ban had never been.
U.S. banks pay back aid
The crisis-ridden U.S. big banks are stripping off their state bonds.
The Bank of America on Wednesday repaid the aid from the bank rescue fund Tarp in the amount of a total of 45 billion dollars (about 30 billion euros) in one fell swoop.
According to a report by the US broadcaster CNBC, Citigroup is also planning to reimburse state aid.
The institutions want to get rid of the restrictions associated with accepting the money – such as the limitation on the payment of manager bonuses and the payment of high fees.
The Bank of America had been concerned about convertible bonds a good 19 billion dollars of fresh money with investors.
She took the rest of the sum from her own cash register, which was well filled, among other things, by divisional sales.
Bank chief Kenneth Lewis thanked the American taxpayer on Wednesday evening: The injection of money had helped over a very difficult time.
The money house had risen to the height of the financial crisis with the acquisition of the investment bank Merrill Lynch.
Citigroup also wants to raise money on the capital market in order to liberate itself from its liabilities to the state.
As early as Thursday, the U.S. bank could announce a $20 billion increase in its capital, CNBC reported, citing circles.
A Citigroup spokesman declined to comment.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had already repaid their aid.
Fast choice
Then everything went faster than I thought.
Just two weeks after the ZDF Board of Directors forced the acting editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender out of office, the broadcaster can present a successor.
Last night, the committee wanted to vote on the staff.
The favourite was Peter Frey, head of the ZDF-Hauptstadtstudio in Berlin.
However, there was no confirmation from the station for this - officially, in order not to anticipate the procedure.
However, it should also have played a role not to further damage ZDF director Markus Sch<0xC3><0xA4>chter if this proposal does not come through at the board of directors.
Frey, Sch<0xC3><0xA4>chter’s candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 panel members.
The result of the vote has not yet been determined by the time this issue was published.
Two weeks ago, Sch<0xC3><0xA4>chter failed on the Board of Directors with his proposal to extend the contract with Nikolaus Brender for a further five years.
Only seven members voted for Brender, seven voted against him. Brender's election was a bitter defeat for Sch<0xC3><0xA4>chter, but an expected one.
The majority of the Board of Directors of the European Union had already signalled weeks before the election that it would not want to confirm Brender in office.
He had organized the resistance against the editor-in-chief of the Hessian Prime Minister Roland Koch.
With the argument that under Brender the news broadcasts of the ZDF had lost in ratings, he rejected another term of office of the highly respected editor-in-chief.
Until shortly before the election, there were therefore protests in which the political influence on the ZDF was scourged.
Most recently, even 35 constitutional lawyers had interfered in the debate, who considered Koch’s actions to be unconstitutional.
It was useless.
About the person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and Romance studies.
He then worked for Südwestfunk and Frankfurter Rundschau.
In 1983, Frey moved to ZDF, initially to "heute-journal".
Subsequent posts: 1988 to 1990 personal speaker of the editor-in-chief; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 head and moderator of the "Morning Magazine"; until 2001 head of ZDF foreign policy; since then head of the ZDF Capital Studio.
The Greens announced a constitutional lawsuit after the election of Brender, who was elected Journalist of the Year by the industry magazine Medium Magazin on Wednesday.
Koch’s opponent on the board of directors, the Rhineland-Palatinate Prime Minister Kurt Beck, said last week that the countries should change the ZDF state treaty in such a way that personnel proposals of the director can not be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
However, Beck also ruled out an excerpt of party politicians from the supervisory bodies of the ZDF.
Brender’s likely successor, Peter Frey, had recommended the board of directors with a clever move – by criticizing the board immediately after the Brender election.
Thanks to this proof of journalistic independence, both Sch<0xC3><0xA4>chter was able to nominate him for the post of editor-in-chief without losing face and the board of directors elected him without the suspicion of hurling a partisan into office.
In party arithmetic, Frey is attributed to the left-liberals anyway.
Study is de-cluttered
Partial success for the students: After a year of the education strike, the Ministers of Education of the L<0xC3><0xA4>nder finally gave in on Thursday: At a meeting of Ministers of Education and Rectors of Higher Education Conference, both sides agreed to improve the study conditions for Bachelor and Master.
In the future, students should also be able to cope with their studies.
In particular, they agreed to reduce the workload of the examination: basically, each study module should only conclude with a single examination.
In addition, the work load of the students should be checked and "a realistic and justifiable measure" should be ensured.
Politicians and universities also want to simplify the recognition of examinations between universities within and outside Germany.
The L<0xC3><0xA4>nder committed themselves to making common structural specifications for Bachelor and Master programmes more flexible.
There should also be no deviating country regulations.
Fewer tests
Since the start of the student protests in June, ministers of culture and university rectors have been saying the word about better studyability in their mouths.
For the first time, it was filled with concrete content.
The so-called Accreditation Council decided to drastically reduce the number of examinations in some cases: "Each module usually concludes with only one examination," says a 30-page paper, which is intended to partially re-regulate the admission of study programs.
With the "significant reduction of the audit burden," said the Accreditation Council Chairman Reinhold Grimm, "a failure development should be stopped, which significantly impaired the studyability."
In addition, "studyability" should be "the decisive criterion" in the design in the future.
Modules such as content are "strictly to check" whether "unnecessary restrictions of the students in the choice of the
“Events” are avoided.
The students would "have the right to be given room for manoeuvre, which enables and encourages personal initiative".
The rules should apply to the admission of new, but also to the examination of existing courses of study.
These must be “re-accredited” every five years – which means that it will take until 2015 for all degree programmes to be reviewed.
Ten accreditation agencies are responsible for this throughout Germany and are under the responsibility of the Accreditation Council set up by the L<0xC3><0xA4>nder.
In October, the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs urged the L<0xC3><0xA4>nder to act on the agencies in such a way that the abundance of substances is not too great and the examination regime is not too strict.
In individual federal states, universities and universities of applied sciences have already agreed on appropriate measures with the state ministries.
As the only country to date, Rhineland-Palatinate has committed additional funds for the further development of the Bologna process.
Of this money, the universities are primarily to set up tutoring programs and strengthen student advisory services as well as examination and foreign offices.
The state and universities want to spend 10 million euros on this.
At the beginning of 2010, the government wants to introduce a amendment to the Higher Education Act into parliament.
According to this, only a single examination is required for the completion of a study model.
The study design should become more flexible, the recognition of certificates of achievement at other universities should also be ensured and access to the Master’s degree should be facilitated.
By the end of next year, all courses of study in the country are to be checked for their studyability.
On Thursday, the government and opposition had again argued about the study conditions in the country.
In addition to praise, there was also criticism of the decisions.
The Federal Executive Board of the Juso University Groups demanded that the shaping of education policy should no longer take place "behind closed doors" of the ministers and university rectors.
At the latest after the educational strikes, the students as affected should now also "take a word in".
The future academics received support from the President of the University Rectors' Conference (HRK), Margret Wintermantel: "We need the experiences of the students," she said on Thursday at a meeting with the Ministers of Culture, with whom the HRK discussed a joint reform paper.
The Gewerkschaft Erziehung und Wissenschaft (GEW) did not go far enough for the Bonn decisions as a whole: it demands a legal entitlement that allows every graduate with a bachelor’s degree to access a further master’s degree.
On the other hand, the countries must ensure that there will be sufficient master’s courses with the best possible study conditions for today’s generation of bachelor’s students tomorrow, according to GEW Executive Board member Andreas Keller.
Countries need to hire a lot more teachers.
However, the Ministers of Culture did not comment on a freer access to the Master’s programme.
More than a footnote to Herta Müller
Entering Germany and leaving is pretty much no control..." is the opening line of a poem by the poet Werner Söllner, in which he addresses the arrival experience of a dissident who has won freedom, but at the same time lost his linguistic space.
Born in Banat, Romania in 1951, Werner Söllner had worked first as a German and English teacher in Bucharest and later as a lecturer in a children's book publisher before moving to Frankfurt am Main in 1982.
Söllner has been awarded various literary prizes, in 1993 he gave the legendary Frankfurt poetics lectures at the Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been head of the Hessian Literature Forum at the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He caused considerable extra-literary attention last Tuesday during a conference in Munich, where it was about "German literature in Romania in the mirror and distortion of their securitate files".
Söllner was visibly unsettled and misled by a statement in which he acknowledged his involvement as IM for the Romanian secret service Securitate in front of fellow Romanian German writers, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer.
Together with some of those present, Söllner received the German Language Prize in 1989.
The recruitment attempts would have begun insidiously, first in 1971.
I am, concluded Söllner, "so someone who has not resisted enough attempts to intimidate the Securitates."
The lyricist Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
Almost at the same time as the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller and her unprecedented literary engagement with the mechanisms of dictatorial rule, the literary scene, and in particular the community of German authors from Romania, is shaken by a case that identifies the abysses and desperation of a political system based on surveillance and spying.
Werner Söllner is, as far as we can tell from our previous knowledge, not only a perpetrator, but also a victim.
In his Securitate file, IM Walter played a role, said after the confession of Söllner the literary scholar Michael Markel and referred to the positive influence of IM Walter for him.
He had him in all difficult points for him at the time, “cut out,” according to Markel.
He felt a moral need to make that comment.
Söllner’s statement was unexpected in form and in front of this audience, but the confession of a former dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian secret service is not completely surprising.
Germany had been a cozy reserve for Securitate-Spitzel, Herta Müller had already written in July, after she had read her own file, 914 pages.
Those affected, it may be assumed, are speculated and in some cases probably also knew which clear name was hidden behind the aliases Sorin, Voicu and also Walter.
In contrast to the now very process-safe inspection of the Stasi files in this country, the handling of the legacies of the Securitate monitoring is still very diffuse.
In recent years, systematic education has been thwarted and hindered.
A National Council for the Reprocessing of Securitate Files (CNSAS) corresponding to the Birthler Authority was founded only in 1999, but the release of the files has been rather sluggish since then.
Only since 2005 has there been a law regulating the administration of the files.
The fact that the influence of former Securitate members in Romania is still very large was confirmed by an interview after the announcement of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller, in which a former Securitate boss from Temesvar expressed disparaging comments about the prize winner.
She has a psychosis, after all, she was only interrogated once.
The infamy of power meant to be able to express itself quite openly in the form of freedom of expression.
Certainly, the case of mercenaries, as is so often the case in connection with concealed guilt, is linked to inevitable questions.
The thoughtful reaction of the audience to Söllner’s confession gives hope that the continuation of this chapter will be determined by an urge to know rather than by blame and shame.
On the genesis of the work of Herta Müller, who received the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a footnote.
Saturation supplement Champions League
It seemed as if a neatly dressed field salesman was coming from a very nice Christmas party, at which a sporting goods manufacturer Goodies had distributed, when the new VfB coach Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange plastic bag of the outfitter, climbed into a summoned C-Class a quarter of an hour after midnight.
The man with the distinctive baldness had himself chauffeured because of the city that was still foreign to him.
Otherwise, he could have driven himself - after all, alcohol was not in the game, and drunk with luck, the 55-Year-old was just as little.
It was a pleasant evening, but tomorrow the work continues.
Or just get started.
In the words of the Swiss, who had only signed three days earlier: "We have reached the round of 16", namely in the Champions League thanks to the 3-1 victory against Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we must not be blinded by the success: it will be a brutally hard fight against the relegation."
The "much more important task" lies ahead on Sunday.
Then it is important to repeat the king class performance in Mainz in everyday league life.
And to put an end to the weaknesses, which were clearly revealed again after the quick three goals by Marica (5th), Tr<0xC3><0xA4>sch (8th) and Pogrebnyak (11th).
Draw (disambiguation)
The round of 16 of the Champions League (first leg 16/17 + 23/24 February/ second leg 9/10 + 16/17 March) will be drawn in Nyon on 18 December.
The joy of the fulminant debut of Babbel’s successor remained subdued.
Not only with the supposed savior, who in the short time had conveyed the unsettled Stuttgart professionals self-confidence, commitment and joy of playing.
I approached the players and told them to focus on their strengths, and I told them to be more courageous, said shrink Gross, explaining the simple-sounding recipe for success, which had no effect under Babbel.
He has sparked some magic, admitted Babbel advocate Jens Lehmann, "when a new impulse comes in football, sometimes things happen that you wouldn't have thought possible."
And Sami Khedira, who became the best player on the pitch thanks to his dynamic after weeks of injury break, tried to describe the established "phenomenon" with the proverbial "fresh wind" and the working method of the new manager: "He is a man who pushes through and demands discipline.
That’s what we need in the current situation.”
Under Babbel, this was obviously lacking.
VfB Stuttgart is not over the mountain yet, warns sporting director Horst Heldt
But VfB Stuttgart needs above all consistency.
Like Gross, players and managers were also wary of overestimating the victory against a replacement-weakened and completely overwhelmed defense of the Romanian guests.
They would also have won in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen in the 0:4 the bad awakening had come, Khedira said to consider.
And sporting director Horst Heldt warned that although one season goal has been achieved, the other is still a long way off.
We're not over the mountain yet.
The fact that Heldt did not feel like celebrating on his 40th birthday even after the first home win in three months was due to the events of the weekend, which were revived in the form of a television interview by goalkeeper Jens Lehmann, which was broadcast immediately before the start of the match.
There are decisions that others make and not Jens, Heldt countered Lehmann’s harsh criticism.
He had accused the board of leadership weakness and had decided to change coaches under pressure from pubescent fans.
Lehmann also considered that his day off after games had been cancelled as a sign of lack of sovereignty and resentment.
Lehmann's statements were "infused with pure egoism", Heldt waved back and announced consequences for the final man.
I don't think they'll be friends for life anymore, the two 40-year-olds.
After all, however, they agreed with everyone else that without the preliminary work by the replaced coaching team, the playfully and combatively strong performance would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants had "a large part of the success," said Heldt and Lehmann in unison - and also the man with the plastic bag agreed.
World Heavyweight Championship
Hot duel in Bern: Challenger Kevin Johnson repeatedly provoked world champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
But after twelve tough rounds, the Ukrainian defended his heavyweight title according to the version of the WBC.
The verdict of the judges was unanimous.
Hamburg - Vitali Klitschko remains boxing world heavyweight champion.
The 38-year-old champion according to the version of the association WBC defeated the American Kevin Johnson unanimously on the night of Saturday in Bern by points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klitschko it was the third successful title defense after his comeback in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian was twice world champion of the associations WBO and WBC.
Unfortunately, it didn’t work out with the K.O. that everyone expected.
Klitschko built up his record to 39 wins in 41 professional fights, twice he had to admit defeat due to injuries.
Challenger Johnson suffered his first defeat in the 24th round.
In front of around 17,000 spectators in the Berner Arena, the 2.02 meter tall Klitschko wanted to dictate the fight, especially with his left leading hand.
The eleven centimetres smaller Johnson, who had announced the end of the Klitschko era before the duel, but repeatedly evaded the blows of the world champion, so that Klitschko could not decisively bring his dangerous rights to the goal.
Overall, the passive Johnson did too little for a challenger and only tried to make ends meet.
Although he provoked Klitschko with words and gestures, his punches rarely hit the world champion.
After all, he is only the second boxer after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who went over the full distance of twelve laps with Klitschko.
The challenger had caused some turbulence before the fight in the Swiss capital.
He insulted Klitschko as an "ugly zombie" who "can't do anything right".
On Friday, while weighing, the champion was provoked to push Johnson’s sunglasses off his nose “to be able to see his eyes.”
Fourth victory after Klitschko's comeback
Klitschko also remained victorious in his fourth fight after his comeback on October 11, 2008.
After almost a four-year break, he had beaten the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin at the time and had to get back "his" WBC belt, which he had previously had to surrender without a fight.
This year, he defeated Juan Carlos Gomez from Cuba in his title defenses and Chris Arreola from the USA in September.
I only got one hit in this fight and am physically very well in shape, Klitschko had justified the quick return to the ring.
But his dream remains the union of all four important titles in the family.
Brother Vladimir is world champion of the associations WBO and IBF.
The WBA's belt, however, is worn by the British David Haye, after he was able to dethrone the 2.13 meter tall Nikolai Waluyev in November.
Haye had previously cancelled a fight planned for September against Vitali Klitschko in the summer.
His promotion company is reportedly already planning the fight against Klitschko at London's Wembley Stadium.
Kunduz
Frontal attack from the opposition: Green Party leader Jürgen Trittin has called Defense Minister Guttenberg a liar because of false information about the Kunduz affair.
The SPD and the Left demand clarification from the Chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to the latest findings on the Kunduz air raid, the opposition has accused Defense Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) of deliberate deception.
The minister had to the deadly bombing on two tanker trucks from September "knowingly said the untruth", said Green party leader Jürgen Trittin on Saturday in the ARD news program "Tagesschau".
It’s commonly called: He lied.
The order to kill was issued in violation of the rules of the International Protection Force for Afghanistan (ISAF).
That is the substance of the report that NATO had, which Mr Guttenberg read, said Trittin.
On Friday, it became known that the attack was not only about destroying the abducted vehicles, but also about deliberately killing two Taliban leaders.
In the US air raid requested by the German Kunduz commander Colonel Klein, up to 142 people were killed or injured, according to the NATO investigation report.
On Saturday, the Greens, the SPD and the Left Party called on Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to make an immediate statement to the Bundestag and to clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Mrs. Merkel must clarify whether a strategy of targeted killing is part of the Federal Government’s policy on Afghanistan – and whether the Chancellery, the Bundeswehr and the intelligence service have approved this new strategy, Jürgen Trittin and fellow Green Party member Renate Künast demanded.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm strongly rejected the criticism.
The Chancellery had no influence on concrete deployments of the Bundeswehr in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, doubts had also been raised about the Ministry’s presentation about the background to the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and State Secretary Peter Wichert.
According to information from the SPIEGEL, the two Guttenberg have correctly and completely informed about the background of the tanker attack.
Officials said they had denied the existence of the NATO reports and withheld sensitive details from the minister.
However, the two top officials reported that they had even alerted the Ministry of Defense to several reports, including a two-page document from commanding Colonel Klein and a field fighter report.
Wichert is said to have asked in a letter for clarification of the facts, reports the "Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung".
He has not yet received an answer, he said.
The ministry did not comment on the allegations on Saturday and pointed out that this will be clarified in the Committee of Inquiry of the Bundestag, which wants to be constituted next Wednesday.
Dreamworlds
Some see images in a waking state and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
Not only in the case of the mentally ill and in the drug rush, the boundaries between imagination and reality are blurred.
As long as it happens in sleep, everything is fine.
When we lie with our eyes closed in our dark rooms, we are allowed to give ourselves uninhibitedly to the wildest imaginations and imaginations.
However, those who experience dreamlike states in their wake, see and hear things that others do not see or hear, are usually considered crazy or drug addicts in the modern Western world, at least as an eccentric.
But such images and voices do not only arise in the mentally ill or in the drug rush.
Our imagination is to blame: the same neural processes that allow us to design houses, paint pictures or write novels sometimes blur the lines between dream, delusion and reality.
Dreamlike altered waking consciousness states can occur in a variety of forms, in the best case we call them visions, in the worst case delusions.
Although triggers and effects may differ, the visions of mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of New Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, shamanic rapture states, psychosis and hallucinations can be traced back to similar processes.
Hallucinations or delusions arise when the balance of the brain’s neuronal messengers – especially dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and acetylcholine – is derailed and the interaction of different parts of the brain is disrupted.
Complex hallucinations and delusional thoughts very often occur during a schizophrenic psychosis.
Gravity has no power over him.
The connection between delusion and dream has occupied philosophers and physicians since ancient times.
Aristotle understood hallucinations as a form of dream in the waking state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, stated in 1861 a "great similarity of being wrong with dream states", for Sigmund Freud the dream was even "a psychosis, with all inconsistencies, delusions, sensory illusions of such a one".
It is autumn 2001 when Henning T. turns into a comic character.
His body is two-dimensional and squeaky-colored.
Gravity no longer has any power over him, he floats on the ceiling of the room.
He feels a kick.
Behind him winged devil figures with blood-red, distorted grimaces, teething.
They chase him, kick him with heavy, flaming boots, throw him against the walls, he feels the pain all over his body.
Loud, vicious voices roar from walls and radio.
He can no longer stand them, the voices that insult and insult him.
Henning T. pulls two cables out of the stereo, knots them into a loop and attaches them to a hook on the ceiling.
He gets on a loudspeaker and puts the sling around his neck.
Jumps.
The noose is loosening.
This is supposed to be a lesson for you, the voices shout in drum-fell shredding chorus, "Go to the clinic and let yourself be healed!"
Today Henning T. is 40 years old, he has experienced six acute psychoses, the last is 2 years ago, the first almost 20 years.
It was triggered by LSD.
His diagnosis is schizoaffective-paranoid psychosis, he is also manic-depressive, he takes medication against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, he has been married for three years.
In psychosis, I have experienced the worst fear and deepest despair, he says.
The illusions are cruel reality
About one percent of the population suffers from schizophrenia at least once in their lives, in psychiatric clinics it is treated as the second most common disease after depression.
In an acute schizophrenic psychosis, those affected can usually no longer distinguish between the inner and outer world, they get into an overexcited state, which can lead to hallucinations, size, relationship or persecution.
Voice-hearing is especially common - voices that command, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are also not rare.
The affected person is no longer able to separate important from unimportant things, the brain can no longer filter out disturbing signals, the consciousness is flooded with impressions.
Like the dream, psychosis also opens the floodgates to a flood of ideas and fantasies emanating from deeper layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is subject-centered, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, senior physician at the Department of General Psychiatry at Heidelberg University Hospital.
The schizophrenic is at the center of the event, everything has a meaning directed at him.
At the same time he falls into a passive role, he is, like in a dream, overwhelmed by the events and cannot actively shape them.
Schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
A reality comparison is usually not possible for them, the illusions are cruel reality, waking up excluded.
Having experienced a hallucination once in a lifetime
In contrast to the dream, says Fuchs, “the sensuous and spatial structure of reality, which is perceived in psychosis, remains basically preserved.”
The delusional thoughts and hallucinations are based in reality, the alienation of the experience takes place in the real framework.
Why exactly our brain beats caprioles, researchers still pose puzzles.
Exceptional circumstances can cause every person to lose touch with reality for a short time, says Fuchs.
But not everyone will develop psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but twin studies have shown that the genes are not the sole determining factors.
Researchers assume that there is minimal brain damage in those affected.
We suspect that the neural maturation of the brain at an early stage of development is disrupted by a viral disease of the mother during pregnancy, for example, explains Fuchs.
But it remains a mystery how the disruption of the neural system comes about, which also initially does not manifest itself for many years.
Environmental influences also play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can be triggers for a psychosis if the disposition is present.
Hallucinogenic drugs can also trigger psychosis because they interfere with the transmitter system.
When our brain is hot
The crazy thing is, psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and swallow expensive drugs to get rid of them, others spend money on drugs to get some, says the Lübeck psychology professor Erich Kasten.
Whether illusions are perceived as pleasant or unpleasant is often only a question of point of view.
Kasten has been collecting reports of hallucinations and cheats for ten years, last year he evaluated his results in the book "The unreal world in our head".
Hallucinations are among the typical side effects of psychosis, but also of surprisingly many other diseases.
In addition to mental disorders such as borderline or depression, these often include diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer’s and skull brain trauma.
Surprisingly, even the brains of healthy people hallucinate under certain conditions.
Hallucinations, according to Kasten, are composed of memory contents that are usually held back.
They occur when areas of the brain where sensory perceptions are processed are overactive or under-inhibited; when our brain is running hot or even when stimulation is lacking.
Drugs can trigger this condition as well as brain damage or psychosis.
But also irritation, stress, heartache or other mental states of exception.
In more recent studies, up to a third of respondents reported having experienced hallucination at least once in their lifetime.
In the summer of 2005 Sarah K. is 16 years old, she lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and attends the high school there.
A normal girl, actually.
If it weren't for the pictures and the voices.
During the break, it can happen that a lanky boy with long, dark hair addresses it.
If it answers him, the classmates look at it in surprise - no one else sees or hears this boy.
They think the shy girl is a spunky daydreamer, but Sarah K. doesn't dream, she knows.
She is awake, she hears and sees this boy, just as she hears and sees the girl in the bench next to her.
She can even feel his presence, at least for moments.
A pleasant feeling is that she likes the boy.
Am I crazy? she asks herself sometimes.
But she knows that this boy and the other illusions are not real and disappear again.
At night, the apparitions are usually frightening
Often the illusions are also a burden.
When she sits in the classroom, she sometimes cannot follow the teaching material, because the teacher in her eyes and ears is introducing a new classmate, while he explains mathematical equations for all the others on the board, both audible and visible.
At night, the apparitions are usually frightening.
When she waits in her dark room for sleep, which is far too rare and far too late, she often cannot distinguish whether she is awake or already dreaming, whether the pictures she sees, the grimaces or the girl with the bleeding cuts on her arms and legs, arise in front of her open or closed eyes.
Leave me alone, she screams at the figures.
Parents and friends don’t tell her about it, they would think she’s crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
She passed her high school graduation last year and lives with her boyfriend.
A year ago, the hallucinations stopped.
Ever since she contacted the psychologist box on the internet, she knows she’s not crazy.
Madness is also a work of art of despair
If someone is socially isolated or suffering from irritable withdrawal, they are likely to have hallucinations after a while, Kasten says.
I suspect that the brain is then underemployed and takes care of its own entertainment.
Sarah K., an only child, was afraid of other children as a little girl, often playing alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at the age of 13 that the man she calls dad since she can think is not her biological father.
Since the same areas of the brain are active in visual and acoustic hallucinations, which also process real impressions and sounds, it is difficult to distinguish between illusions and reality. "Every experience," says Kasten, "takes place in the brain, reality is reflected there.
Hallucinations are also images that create the brain, which is why they seem so real."
Also, nocturnal dream pictures value box as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from those of acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, mentally healthy people are able to recognize their delusions as unreal.
Kasten therefore advises his patients to also value the hallucinations as a special ability.
Boundary state between dream and hallucination
In our too mind-centered world, imaginary experience is unfortunately mostly pathologized, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor in Heidelberg and chief physician of the Clinic for Psychiatry and Psychotherapy of the Florence Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious, painful disease, but it also contains positive, creative - delusion is also a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has researched the so-called oneiroid form of experience, a special form of the traumatically altered waking consciousness.
Oneiroides are highly complex, detailed quasi-dreams that the experiencer considers to be real and which he cannot distinguish from the waking state even in retrospect.
The oneiroid state of consciousness arises in trauma- or disease-related extreme situations, for example in polyradiculitis patients who experience motor paralysis with full consciousness.
When a person is threatened with loss of self and world, for example by persistent, complete inability to move, he replaces the life-threatening real situation with his own, imaginary world, which is decoupled from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
A kind of boundary state between dream and hallucination.
Since coping with a situation in reality is not possible, a world change takes place, but the real situation is made present in the imagination.
An intensive form of meaning creation and giving meaning in an inherently intolerable situation, which allows us humans own creative ability, not to sink into a nothing of loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in the memory
The Zurich art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen also describes his Oneiroid experiences in his book "Herzwechsel" as a rescue of the soul.
He is 49 years old when his consciousness travels for days after a heart valve operation followed by a heart transplant, while his body is condemned to immobility in the intensive care unit.
Claussen dives into a self-created world, visits strange times and places: he experiences himself as a bedridden, old man, on board a train sanatorium, a robot watches over his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages among nobles who make intoxicants from blood.
Being kidnapped by a Greek on a motorcycle in his home country, surfs with his hospital bed in the firn snow of the Alps and meets a Korean mafioso.
He is completely absorbed in the imagined events, everything is real, even later in the memory.
These inner journeys are fundamentally different from any dream for Claussen.
Dream is a different state, he describes his experience.
In contrast, the memories from mental journeys are still clear to me after years and in minor details.
More intense and even more intense than the real thing.
The intensity of this experience is beyond the horizon of our other life-worldly experiences, says psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
In the end, oneiroids, psychosis, hallucinations and drug intoxication show how fragile our inner images of external reality are even in waking.
Any change in the state of consciousness, the psychologist Kasten concludes, “can lead to a deformation of what we call reality.”
An experience that can also be enriching.
The snow can come
Burda
Children should take over the publishing company at the age of 27
The new publisher Kallen is an interim solution: In the long term, Hubert Burda wants to give his company into the hands of his two children, he told SPIEGEL.
The holding company will continue to be 100% owned by the family.
The publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the long term in the hands of his children.
Both children inherit at the age of 27 and have the firm will to enter the company, the 69-Year-old told the SPIEGEL.
We have arranged the details as a precaution.
The question of whether they are also active in the company arises only after that.
The question is also whether they are able to do so.
You can’t introduce 7,500 employees to your children if they don’t have enough skills.
This kills the children and the company as well.
Burda announced on Thursday that he would step down from the chairmanship in January, and appointed Paul-Bernhard Kallen as his successor.
The 52-year-old Kallen has been a board member at Burda since 1999.
Initially, he was in charge of technology.
Later, the Treasury division added responsibility for the company’s assets and, after Jürgen Todenhöfer’s departure, also for direct marketing, foreign countries, printing and finance.
For the first time, no family member is at the head of the publishing house.
Burda’s children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who would be 42 today, died a few years ago.
The designation of Kallen also serves to "bridge 10, 15 years", says Burda.
The holding company should continue to be 100% owned by the family, Burda said.
With regard to the cases of Schickedanz and Schaeffler, Burda said that even family businesses are not certain of the demise: "This always affected families who were infected by a capital addiction, who have completely speculated and thought that they could become a very big player.
My strategy was never that.
He had "never had any dreams of world power," said Burda.
I don't see myself as the political preceptor of this country like Springer was, and I don't want to play in the world league with 'Time' either, these stores have become too big.
Perfect beauty
Everything you want in terms of beauty and well-being is now at your disposal.
At least that is what El Corte Inglés has set out to do, which recently opened a retail store with an area of more than 1000 m2 in the shopping center in Callao (Madrid), where everything revolves around personal care.
In the wellness area, which is located on the eighth floor, you will find prestigious companies such as Hedonai, which provide hair removal with laser; Spaxi<0xC3><0xB3>n, with rooms for relaxation and beauty treatments; the hairdressers Luis & Tachi, Marina d'Or with a gym or L'Occitane with its natural cosmetics.
But there is also a food department that stands out for its tea house with more than 130 different types of tea.
Enjoy a relaxing massage together with your partner while having a fantastic view of the capital, or rent the relaxation area for two hours to set up your own "beauty party" with eight girlfriends and then relax in the hot tub or with massages and a glass of champagne, these are just some of the many possibilities that Spaxi<0xC3><0xB3>n offers.
The total area is 250 m2, which is divided into 12 rooms for the latest facial and body treatments as well as for hydrotherapy.
For example, for cavitation in the fight against cellulite or with vibrating surfaces.
The gym also has this type of equipment, and there are also virtual trainers who take care of the training sessions of the customers and thus offer them a completely personal training.
You start a training session by entering a personal password on a touchscreen located opposite the devices.
After that, various videos will show you how to perform your workouts correctly.
The head of the gym assures that 15 minutes (including warm-up and stretching) is all it takes to train the body muscles.
And if, after training your body, you still want to stop by the hair salon, the company Luis & Tachi has a room where treatments to regain the beauty, shine and health for your hair are offered in a personalized way.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to be the key words for this wellness area in the middle of the city, which is always open from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m., 365 days a year.
The most diverse cleavage
Christmas is getting closer and closer and therefore it is again a good opportunity to copy the appearance of the stars and to bring their wedding dresses in our wardrobe.
The shape of the décolleté, which is very important for highlighting the silhouette, is one of the points that must be considered.
Here are a few suggestions.
The singer Fergie has chosen an exaggerated and very complicated cleavage, which can only be advised against.
Endesa and Barcelona by electric car
The electricity company Endesa has created the "LIVE office" together with the city of Barcelona.
This is a project to develop and promote the electric car in the Catalan capital.
The "LIVE Office" (Logistics for the introduction of the electric car) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the introduction of the electric car in the city and make agreements regarding mobility by managing, coordinating, subsidizing, etc.
On the other hand, the MOVELE project is being developed to promote the electric car and to summarize opinions and measures of the areas involved.
This is an attempt to advance the means of transport of the future.
3 "Electric cities"
However, Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the introduction of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville are also participating in this project.
These are the three cities selected by the government in the MOVELE project to accelerate the introduction of the electric car.
The electricity company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Government of Catalonia (la Generalitat).
The aim of this framework agreement is to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These activities are, among other things, those related to energy and, in particular, to its efficiency.
However, it is by no means the only initiative Endesa is taking part in with a view to promoting the electric car.
The company participates in standardization groups throughout Europe and maintains a whole series of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees "a horizon of calm" for the automotive sector
The President of the government, José Luis Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Zapatero, predicts the Spanish automotive industry, which is the country's largest exporter, "a horizon of calm".
At the presentation of the 2009 economic report by the President of the Government, Zapatero reminded once again of the measures that the Government has put in place to support the automotive sector during the year.
"Without the plan for the competitiveness of the automotive industry, today we would have a panorama of the neglect and closure of some of our main production plants," he said.
"Thanks to this plan and the willingness of the car manufacturers to continue to produce in Spain in a very competitive industry, we can see a calm horizon for the future of this industry, which is our largest export industry," he added.
He also recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, which is part of the overall plan for the automotive industry (PIA), provided 800 million euros for projects by 19 vehicle manufacturers and 137 suppliers, which in turn provided for investments of more than 3 billion euros.
The Prime Minister said that these investments are intended both for the development of new models and for the modernisation of existing products and processes.
Zapatero also underlined the government's efforts to boost demand, in reference to Plan 2000E, which is being implemented in cooperation with the Autonomous Communities and car manufacturers.
According to the head of government, this plan allows to reduce the exhaust emissions of new vehicles sold on the Spanish market on average by 6%, which in turn led to a "strong increase" in registrations, which in November rose "by 40%".
On 20,000 square meters of classic vehicles
Madrid hosts the first edition of the International Classic Automobile Fair, an exhibition for professionals and lovers of the world of engines.
This fair will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 in the Pabell<0xC3><0xB3>n de Cristal of the Casa de Campo in Madrid.
200 domestic and foreign exhibitors will present their brands on an exhibition area of 20,000 square meters.
Not only can you admire classic motorcycles and vehicles, but you will also find all imaginable articles related to the world of engines at the ClassicAuto Madrid.
So you can find accessories, spare parts, components, fabric accessories, accessories, publications, miniature cars, etc. at the exhibitors at the fair.
Hundreds of articles from the world of classic engines that will delight collectors and lovers.
Among the companies that will participate in this fair are Cl<0xC3><0xA1>sicos de Mos and Good Old Times, vehicle sales; Juan Lumbreras, restorations; Coupe-Francisco Pueche, sale and restoration of automobiles specialized in Mercedes Benz.
Outdoor Dexterity Tests
In addition, the sales activities at this fair are complemented by parallel events: meetings, sports car exhibitions, skill tests, events and competitions.
Dexterity tests with classic cars and motorcycles are also carried out on a specially equipped race track in the outdoor area of the exhibition grounds.
Mazda3 i-Stop: Environmentally friendly sportiness
Mazda wants to prove that sportiness is compatible with the protection of the environment.
For this reason, Mazda has recently introduced the automatic stop and start system of the engine, christened i-Stop, on the Mazda3 model, a device that is currently only available for the 2.0 petrol engine with 150 hp.
This second generation of the Mazda 3 stands out for its good marks in the overall picture.
The finishing, the car’s design, the comfort, its road behaviour, the mechanics, the i-Stop system...
All these aspects are "very good" with the new Mazda3.
Starting with the front seats, you can see that the front seats offer excellent ergonomics and good grip.
Furthermore, the play of the steering wheel is excellent.
Looking further at the unit, which consists of the instrument panel and the dashboard, it can be seen that Mazda is on the same line as the Japanese trend towards a futuristic interior design with a variety of buttons and switches in the eye-catching colors red and blue.
This style reminds us in part of the style of the Honda Civic.
That is why it can easily be said that both the Mazda 3 and the Civic, both Japanese models, stand out from the sobriety of German automobiles, especially the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to outperform.
The passenger compartment of these two Japanese compact cars offers more than ever the corresponding comfort, so that four adults can drive extremely comfortably by car.
To all this comes a large and clearly shaped trunk.
Until now, the stop and start system is only available for the 2-litre petrol engine with 150 hp and a 6-speed transmission.
This engine is a real pleasure and stands out for its fineness, its quiet noise, its performance and its low consumption.
And all those who do not drive many kilometers a year should consider this i-Stop with gasoline engine because of its great comfort in gearing and its low consumption, even if at Mazda especially the diesel models are the best-selling.
In terms of equipment, the so-called Sportive model selected for the test drive is a special feature, as it has a much larger number of elements from the standard equipment.
From the standard equipment stands out above all the assistant for the lane change (RVM), which thus eliminates the blind spot, but also the controls for the traction and stability, the speed control, the light-sensitive interior mirror, the on-board computer with a large screen, the sensors for parking, an independent air conditioning system, rain and light sensors, Bluetooth and audio Bluetooth as well as the chrome-plated 17-inch.
In addition, this version also includes, as if that were not enough equipment, the Premium package, which for an additional 1,500 euros contains the following: in addition to other elements, especially the learnable bixenon headlights and the sound system BOSE with CD charger.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars in its class.
It is particularly outstanding in terms of the materials used, its handling and the variety of equipment.
In addition, those who do not travel many kilometers a year can also buy the i-Stop version, which is only available with a 2.0 petrol engine with 150 hp.
The only negative about this model is its somewhat high price, which ranges between 21,770 euros for the model Luxury and 23,270 euros for the test driven model Sportive.
In return for this high price, however, the Mazda3 offers us the highest driving pleasure every day.
A premiere with a lot of glamour
L. A. rolls out the red carpet of sensuality for Penélope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
At the premiere of "Nine", the stars, dressed in models that look as elegant as they are sexy, shined more than ever. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our "Pe", as elegant as ever, opted for a dark "Lady" dress.
The promises of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, a device with which you can only read your e-mails, without a possibility to see certain attachments or to be able to surf the Internet.
It enjoyed its five minutes of fame when it chose Time magazine as one of the products of the year.
Seeing it on the street is rather unlikely, but the idea in itself is still of interest especially for young people.
In contrast to the smartphones, Peek costs very little and has a very cheap flat rate, for example, only half the price of the flat rate of an iPhone.
After seeing the success with it, the company has launched two new devices: one designed just for Twitter, the other with a lifetime free service for data, unlike the peek where you have to pay a six-times higher price.
Fonpeek, which was presented yesterday at the event Le Web, is the European version of this invention and thus its third version.
It has the same limits as its American counterpart, but has a surprise in store.
The monthly maintenance price for the telephone, about 12 euros per month, includes roaming for the whole of Europe.
Those who travel around the world with a smartphone already know what it means to give up all the data to be able to read their emails once you have crossed the national border or if you are desperately looking for a café with WIFI (or a connection with Fon).
The idea of flat-rate roaming is incredibly seductive and should have been possible for a long time.
It is true that some telephone providers already offer special contracts and prices for stays abroad, but in my experience you already need a PhD in physics and good glasses to be able to read all the fine print.
The European Commission’s repeated criticism of affordable roaming rates across Europe has almost always gone unnoticed.
Outside of your own country, you are always afraid to read your emails and rightly so.
The fact that a small device like FonPeek (although it’s always amazing that it’s called Fon even though it doesn’t have Wi-Fi) can offer these types of rates means that phone providers need to slowly but surely rethink and start considering different ways to deploy their data network.
Kindle is another good example of this, its prices include downloading books and other requests on the Internet.
Without a contract and without a hook.
This is an internet-enabled device and you only pay for it once, when you buy it, and not month after month.
And that’s exactly what I expect one day from FonPeek, a purchase option with lifelong internet access as the Peek already offers in the USA.
Not because I want to buy it.
I read my emails on the phone, thank you.
But I expect this because I think it would be a more appropriate model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
Michelle's Fetish Color
Yellow is without a doubt the favorite color of the American First Lady.
Already when Barack Obama took office as President of the United States, she appeared in a dress and coat of this color and chose the same color again to accompany him at his, no doubt, second most important moment in his life: the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama has worn very similar models on both occasions: except that it was almost the same color - a shiny green-yellow -, the clothing consisted of three parts - dress, jacket and coat made of the same fabric, and she wore something large-shaped embroidered or a necklace.
It even goes so far that it seemed at first sight that the First Lady of the United States wanted to follow the example of the Princess of Asturias and had decided to wear the same dress on more than one occasion.
However, the two dresses are very different in the type of fabric they are made of.
At the inauguration, she wore a lace dress and in Oslo, a velvet dress patterned.
The accessories were also different: the first time green shoes with half-height heels and the second time a similar model, but gold-colored.
The hairstyle was also different every time: The hair was put up as a hair ring on this occasion, on the previous one she wore the hair open.
75% of working mothers have problems at work because of their maternity
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially among younger women who want to have children.
This is the conclusion of the study "Fertility and Career of Women in Spain" carried out by CSIC in collaboration with the Institute of Women.
The survey of 9,737 women aged between 15 and 75 leaves no doubt about this: 75% of working women see their career opportunities in the labour market restricted due to their motherhood.
The study reveals that there are large differences in the decision to start a family and the number of children, depending on whether the women work or not and if so, what kind of profession they pursue.
Those of them who do not perform any other activity outside the home, work only half-days or do not have a fixed employment contract are more likely to become mothers and have more children.
In contrast, women with a permanent job, especially in the public sector, postpone the establishment of a family and motherhood and therefore also have fewer children.
"The women in the age group between 35 and 49 years of age with a permanent employment get their first child on average only 3.7 years after the contraction, a number that increases to 4.1 years for women with permanent employment who have taken longer to achieve this and who have realized their contraction and the first child much later.
In addition, the type of work also has a great influence on motherhood, although less than the calendar in terms of willingness to conceive," explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that must be taken into account in the age of women at marriage and the first child.
According to the survey, the higher the level of education, the higher the age at the time of marriage and the first child.
This difference could also be observed in women of the same age.
For example, the women in the group between 35 and 49 years of age, depending on whether they only have a high school diploma or a higher education, became mothers for the first time, on average, at 25.1 or 32.1 each.
There is also another difference between women, depending on their level of education.
While the women with a high school diploma get married before their first permanent job and have their first child, the women with a middle or high school diploma do it the other way around and first look for a permanent job and then marry and then have their first child, Delgado notes.
Diane Kruger is worth it.
L’Oréal Paris recently added a new name to its ever-enviable list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will be the image of various products of the brand and also say the well-known advertising slogan "Because you are worth it".
The leading actress from "Joyeux No<0xC3><0xAB>l", one of the most elegant actresses on an international level, will thus become another famous figurehead as before her Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before her, the last to join this exclusive club were actresses Evangeline Lilly ("Lost") and Freida Pinto ("Slumdog Millonaire").
Among the men, the cosmetics company also has only exceptional ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey ("Grey's Anatomy') and Matthew Fox (an acting colleague of Evangeline in "Lost").
The British Fashion Industry Award Ceremony
The British have an important word to say in the fashion world.
Their highest representatives – fashion designers and models, both yesterday and today – met at the annual awards ceremony held in London at the Royal Court of Justice.
On this occasion, they all appeared.
The ex-model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, which was voted the best model of this year.
The Poker Game by Manuel Vicent
Manuel Vicent presents in "Poker of Aces" (Alfaguara, pictures of Fernando Vicente) to the three x-rays of writers who have accompanied him in his literary life (and, in some cases, in real life).
He does not use a predictable and fear-inspiring genre (short biography, life and work), but looks for a similarity to the glowing heart of the creator.
The journey is exciting and Vicent spares neither terrors nor illuminations.
Apart from the fact that this book is a delicious treat to read, it is also a moving invitation to read and read again and again.
Here are some excerpts from the book.
As I read his pages, I found that the Mediterranean is not a sea, but rather a spiritual, almost sensuous drive, just as I have always felt it, without finding words for it: joy in contrast to the ominous fate, morality without guilt and innocence without any god.
About Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, allegorical Christian, he wrote about what he had in his blood, not in his mind, between impotence and ignorance, with a stunning poetic humor, without any sense, like the knife blade that almost killed him."
About Graham Greene: "Our man was captivated by this woman with a passion that lasted thirteen years, in whose flesh the emotions of adultery combined with the pleasure of repentance, a spiritual privilege that consisted of going to heaven in the detour of ruin."
About James Joyce: "The Odysseus" was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. This is one of the 8000 summits in worldwide literature, you have to climb on the north wall, on the wall, where the best mountaineers try again and again."
About William Faulkner: "He was a funny guy.
He sometimes said about himself that he was the heir of a landowner of the county and again other times he said that he was the son of a black man and a crocodile.
Both dreams were of a certain size."
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: This writer took up the mad scream that was shouted out of Munich from a bridge by that personality, so that his echo echoed in his literary way well into the night of the 20th century, during a journey on which he fled from himself and implored posterity with a speech full of violence before the worms.
One day, she knelt down and prayed, "My God, I beg you to do everything in your power so that I may finally stop writing like a woman."
About Joseph Conrad: "On his grave are engraved these verses of Spencer: ' the sleep after the effort, / after the storm of the harbor, / the rest after the war, / after a full life one finds pleasure in death."
About Virginia Wolf: "In her luggage she always had her depression with her.
The husband accepted it with complete normality when she told him that Edward VII was spying on her between the azaleas or singing the birds in Greek.
There is no other case known where the man was so patient and in love with a neurotic whose literary talent was far greater than her madness.
About P<0xC3><0xAD>o Baroja: "What else did Mart<0xC3><0xAD>n-Santos do but try to instill Joyce in Baroja?
What did Benet intend to do if he did not lead Baroja to Faulkner’s weapons?
What did Cela do except to destroy that man’s glory, so that he could put himself on this pedestal?”
Cowardly Aggression
My 70-year-old mother was walking through our neighborhood in the village of Fuenlabrada last week when suddenly a group of young people between 15 and 18 years of age ran next to her and our dog, our dog is a mongrel that we have brought from the shelter and that weighs just six kilos, and then out of the blue they missed him two foot kicks and seriously injured him.
Our indignation cannot be put into words, since it is incomprehensible to us, where the fun should be in a cheap aggression against a small and helpless animal, which of course was carried out on a leash.
Add to this the suffocation that a woman who went for a leisurely walk got when she wanted to correct these people because of the incident, she even feared for her own life, because if such a madman attacks a dog, he may also do the same with a woman, a child, an older gentleman or probably even with anyone who is weaker than himself.
The incident occurred in a normally quiet neighborhood at five o’clock in the afternoon on an ordinary Tuesday.
The dog cried all day.
Of course, we have filed a complaint in a nearby police station, but we have great doubts whether this will bring anything at all and to prevent any prejudice from the beginning, we just want to make it clear that the cowardly criminals were Spaniards.
Our outrage at what has happened has led us to report this incident.
We cannot understand what must go on in the minds of these young people, that they find a cheap attack on a helpless animal funny, on an animal that gives us love, society and friendship.
We do not know where good education and respect for animals and persons have remained.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of the helmet
The tyre manufacturer Michelin, in cooperation with the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to promote helmet use, especially among younger motorcyclists, as announced today by both companies.
This initiative aims to draw attention to the importance of helmet use, since it is ultimately the only protective element that can prevent head injuries or even death in the event of a motorcycle accident.
Michelin pointed out that this campaign is part of its commitment to road safety, which “comprises far more than just designing and manufacturing products that become safer every day,” and further reaffirmed that with other actions of a pedagogical and informative nature, it is helping to move one step closer to this goal every day.
This new campaign to promote helmet use on the motorcycle, which runs under the slogan 'To be or not to be', will distribute posters to over 500 motorcycle workshops in an initial phase in order to achieve the best possible distribution.
In conclusion, Michelin stressed that road safety is "a constant concern" of the company, and precisely because as a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheeled vehicles, they are always committed to the fact that one of their main goals must be the development of increasingly safer products.
The sale of small trucks is increasing somewhat again
After almost two years, the car market for vans is finally starting to see some light at the end of the dark tunnel.
The 9,425 vehicles registered in Spain in November represent an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, more importantly, the first increase ever after 22 consecutive months of steady decline, according to the figures presented by the Anfac Association and the Ganvam Association of Car Dealers.
However, these good figures are currently to be enjoyed with great caution, as the reference data used for comparison are from November 2008, which was a particularly bad sales year with a 60 % decrease compared to the previous year.
However, it should be borne in mind that, apart from the increase in the last month, the total approvals of these 11 months are still 40% below the sales figures of the previous fiscal year.
Since January, a total of 95,853 vehicles have been sold, but this figure includes all vehicles that make up the van market: descendants of passenger cars, pick-ups, vans, small vans and lighter light trucks/carriages.
Furthermore, the same storm clouds are still in the sky, which affect demand the most, because even if some of the vehicles are bought by private individuals, the majority of sales go to small and medium-sized enterprises, which in almost 100% of all cases make the purchase with a third-party financing.
Thus, these restrictions, which are the result of the shut-down of the financial institutions, must include other factors, such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the continuation of the bad economic situation.
With this panorama and unlike the passenger cars, the financial support provided for the purchase of a vehicle of the Plan 2000E has been of little help.
However, this plan is not only for private individuals, even self-employed and small businesses have a right to it if they want to buy a van up to 3.5 tons with a CO2 emission that may not exceed 160 grams per kilometer driven, but the low sales figures speak for themselves.
Just yesterday Ganvam reminded that it is absolutely necessary on the part of the state to pay special attention to these small trucks as well as, of course, to industrial vehicles (trucks and buses).
The Car Dealers Association predicts a similar year for 2010 as the just past, for which it expects a sales loss (for passenger cars and off-road vehicles) of 19%.
Support in braking manoeuvres in critical situations is now mandatory
As was the case with the ABS anti-lock braking system back then and as is currently the case with stability control ESP, the emergency braking assistance systems must become mandatory equipment in European cars.
In fact, they are already mandatory for all newly registered passenger cars and light vans, for the remaining vehicles a grace period has been set until the end of February 2011.
The action decided by the European Union aims to improve the protection of pedestrians, but because of their working methods, these braking systems can also help to prevent many rear-end collisions.
The task of the emergency braking assistant is to apply more pressure to the brakes in the event of a critical braking maneuver, which the system recognizes on the brake pedal on the basis of the braking force carried out by the driver.
However, this system does not exert this pressure until the end.
According to an investigation commissioned by the component manufacturer for the Bosch vehicles, a third of the drivers involved in an accident did not even get on the brake pedal before the collision, and half of them had not braked with full force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The brake aid, on the other hand, engages with maximum force in the brake system and thereby reduces the braking time and thus also the braking distance covered by a car during the braking process.
According to an EU study, up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be prevented each year if all cars were equipped with this type of emergency braking assistant.
There would be even fewer accidents – one in four accidents with personal injury is expected to be prevented – as soon as the so-called intelligent emergency braking systems become popular.
Then the vehicle is equipped with a system that detects obstacles (via radar or a camera) and warns the driver, while at the same time exerting a slight pressure on the brakes.
If the driver responds, the system helps to increase the pressure on the brake pedal if it becomes necessary.
If the driver does not respond to the warning and even if the collision is already unavoidable, the Brake Assist exerts maximum pressure on the brakes to keep the damage as low as possible.
General Motors postpones plans for Opel until January
While the staff at Opel’s Figueruelas plant in Zaragoza have already been informed by Nick Reilly, the new chairman of General Motors (GM) Europe, that production of the new Meriva will start in the first week of April, probably on the 8th, according to Javier Ortega, the American vehicle manufacturer points out that it needs more time to finalize the Opel rescue plan.
Nick Reilly, the new chairman of GM Europe, wants the affected side to give their consent to each point of the plan in advance.
And for this reason, it may be that the final document, which will be presented first to the workers and then to the governments of the countries where there are works, will be postponed until the beginning of 2010.
However, GM is confident that it will make a decision regarding the sale of Saab in the coming days.
It is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased the pressure on the American car manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to being in touch with some potential new buyers.
One of these buyers could be Geely, who also wants to buy Volvo, but the option of the Dutch manufacturer of the Skyper sports car, which has the Russian group Converg backing, is gaining more and more popularity.
If none of these buyers come to an agreement, GM could sell some assets to the Chinese BAIC.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year, if it has not been sold by then, will continue.
At the wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
For the development of their latest and very expensive jewel, the engineers used the Boxster S as a basis and really managed to make it 80 kilos lighter, so that it now weighs only 1,275 kilos.
To create such a thing, they first dispensed with the automatic folding roof, which was replaced by a tent canvas roof with manual drive, so alone you have saved 21 kilos; thanks to the aluminum doors used in this model such as the GT3 "disappear" another 15; due to the removal of the air conditioning again 13; moreover, the sport-parts were reduced by 12 times by 7 liters.
Then the CDR-30 audio system was again reduced by six kilos and the missing kilo was achieved by replacing the door handles with fabric handles.
Although it is also available with the PDK dual-clutch transmission, the test drive was carried out with a 6-speed manual transmission, mainly on the smaller roads of California, on mountain routes that were really very winding.
In his driving behavior, you can only give him the grade perfectly.
However, the reduction of his weight did not in any way mean that he would no longer be as safe on the road.
It’s the opposite: we haven’t tested such a small and lightweight model for a long time, but it also gives you a feeling of great safety when cornering, even at high speed.
He is a little athlete, able to warm up his muscles at a low pace in the time required, until we give him orders to race, brake, recover and then get everything out of his engine again...
The car does everything we tell it to do with our hands on the steering wheel, thanks to its steering, which is as communicative as it is precise.
And he does it with the precision of a surgeon.
A motor sound for all tastes
The sound of his V6 Boxer with 320 hp (10 more than the Boxster S) is extremely successful and you can increase it with the 'sport' option and by means of a system that can change the engine noise, which was already used for the first time in the Panamera.
Acceleration is unimaginably brutal, whether standing up or accelerating again.
The suspensions are strong, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The tarmac on the roads we drove with the Boxster Spyder was already quite damaged, but the car mastered the potholes well.
The electronic assistants had almost nothing to do on the entire track; and that, although we found ice at dawn and gravel in the morning at some of these curves.
In summary, it is an ultra-light car, a car with which you have an indescribable driving pleasure, as it is otherwise rather rare and in it there is much more than just a small improvement of the Boxster Ss.
The car will be launched in February 2010 and will cost 70,831 euros.
Bag Girl.
The singer, a bosom friend of Karl Lagerfeld, is the face of the cosmetics line Coco Cocoon and an occasional starlet at the fashion shows of 'maison', she presents her evil face with the same stubbornness as her Chanel bags.
Much more than "Bad Girl" or "It Girl", she is a "Bag Girl".
The Baskonia gives itself a victory in Israel
Despite the many unusual players in Dusko Ivanovic’s team, the Caja Laboral celebrated an excellent 82-91 triumph during his visit to the complicated football pitch of the Maccabi Electra, taking first place within his group after the great performance of Mirza Teletovic, who was the best of his team with eight triples (29 in the evaluation).
The team from Vitoria was able to replace the significant losses of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with a large dose of commitment and teamwork, even if they had to wait until the bitter end for their victory.
The great hits from the perimeter with 16 rated triples contributed significantly to their final victory.
The game began with the leadership of the Blue-Reds, who from the beginning placed themselves at the top of the scoreboard.
Since the first four baskets of the team from Vitoria already came out of the perimeter, it could already be guessed that they had come to the pitch with well-warmed wrists.
It was English and Teletovic who were mainly responsible for the 18-20 at the end of the first quarter.
The second quarter was hardly different, only that the team from <0xC3><0x81>lava opted for an inside game of Barac and for the game of Eliyahu, who was received on his return to the team with whistles and applause, which is his home to further expand their advantage until the break (34-43).
Teletovic already started to stand out as the best of his team with 13 points, although the "minus six" rating of Splitter already hinted that this would not be the Brazilian's best evening.
Nevertheless, despite the clear advantage in the break, the game was still far from decided and the Maccabees wanted to remind the Vitorians once again that not everyone wins on their pitch, and thanks to the repeatedly attacking "Hand of El<0xC3><0xAD>as" they came back into the game.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to the "Yellows" turning the rudder (50-49).
Even more disadvantages
Ivanovic's team, injured, but anything but dead, had to prepare a few moves with accuracy to get air again and with one of them suddenly came the pistol of Mirza Teletovic, who with three almost consecutive triples and with the support of English and Ribas, ensured that on the scoreboard again a calming distance of (54-67) was shown, which the host could finish with 57-67 at the end of the third quarter.
The Alaves were exposed in the last quarter and English and San Emeterio (60-75) already announced that they would not allow anyone to take away from them the victory they had honestly earned in the first thirty minutes.
Nevertheless, Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team, did not resign and tried to give their team strength again by three points off the line (70-77).
Despite this, and although splits were put off due to fouls, Ivanovic's team did not give up, defended well and although the Israelis were still catching up at the last minute (80-85), the game already had a winner and Tel Aviv lost for the first time this season.
Injuries prevented Unicaja from being put on the forehead
Unicaja lost loudly in Greece to Olympiacos and had to give up the lead in Group B of the Euro League to him, in a game that was characterized by the failures of the players of Unicajas (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), especially in the indoor game, which made the Greeks the victory easier.
The Malaga team was not afraid of the atmosphere in the Hall of Peace and Friendship, nor of the opposing team, which is perhaps one of the strongest in Europe and has a lot of money.
Thanks to their first quarter play, the Andalusians were able to start dreaming. An aggressive defense and three consecutive triples, two by Omar Cook and one by Guillem Rubio, dazzled the hosts with 12-18 in the 9th minute.
Olympiacos were surprised by the intensity of the one Unicaja, even though the local team with an inside match between Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis managed to get the scoreboard in their favor in the 13th minute 22-20, the minute in which an action almost led to a fight between the two Americans Beverley and Williams and why both were disqualified.
The Greek team finally started to warm up and its superiority on both sides of the game, while the departure of Englishman Joel Freeland due to an injury and the three self-made mistakes of Carlos Jiménez left a clear mark on Unicaja.
Among their players in the field and Lithuanian forward Linas Kleizas, with his triples, they increased their advantage in the 19th minute to 44-32.
Catching up was impossible
The third quarter was characterized by many attacks against the Olympiacos team, which, despite its 19 losses, proved to be superior and even managed to make up for the difference of the match played in M<0xC3><0xA1>laga with 66-48 in the 27th minute, which in turn fluctuated the lead within the group.
Unicaja tried to overcome the many failures and the departure of Robert Archibald, who was injured during the match.
Despite the many disadvantages for the Unicaja in the 31st minute thanks to the leadership and the triples of Cook and the use of Lewis again some hope for 66-57.
Nevertheless, it was actually impossible, since the Olympiacos, as soon as he attacked and showed his superiority with centimeters within the basket area, could not be braked.
Croatian captain Nikola Vujcic managed to raise the basket difference to 81-62 in the 37th minute and Unicaja had to give up the lead to Olympiacos.
How much should you earn based on your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can now experience their salary, which they should earn based on their profile, thanks to the new application Trovit, the search engine with the most ads of properties, jobs and cars in Spain.
The "How much should you earn?" tool calculates the salaries of users based on more than 140,000 job offers available at Trovit in Spain. Users have a form on Facebook where they can enter their profession, work experience, age and the city in which they work.
Already after a week after the application was available for the first time, the search engine found that the Spanish worker on average “feels poorly paid,” explains Albert Ribera, who is responsible for the product Trovit, in a press release.
The Spaniards are the lowest paid according to the data Trovit has through its search engines in the UK and France.
A British programmer gets an annual gross salary of 45,226 euros and a Frenchman 31,059, as opposed to the 24,000 euros a Spaniard earns.
As a result, a truck driver has an annual net salary of 34,247 euros in England, 25,751 in France and 16,420 euros in Spain.
According to Trovit, the lowest paid work in Spain is that of a waiter with 11,592 euros net a year, followed by the work of a salesman with 14,725 euros and that of a worker with 15,667 euros.
The most searched jobs on the Internet in the last three months are those of a driver, half-day jobs and social workers.
Brazil calls Zelaya a date to leave
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya to stay at its embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The President removed from office must leave the diplomatic mission by 27 January 2010 at the latest when his mandate officially expires.
Francisco Catunda, the trade delegate of the Brazilian embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows that before that date he must have left the embassy where he had found asylum since September 21.
"He is aware that he has to leave on January 27th, as his mandate expires on that day and he has to find a new place to stay."
The station also quoted the ex-president, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the scheduled date: "My point of view is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the backing of the government of Brazil," Zelaya said on the phone.
After the elections on 29 November (in which Porfirio Lobo emerged as the winner), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, he tried to get refuge in Brazil this week.
This failed, however, due to Zelaya's refusal to recognize the status of an asylum-seeking politician, which the "de facto" government, chaired by Roberto Micheletti, wanted to impose on him.
Thank you for everything!
After the most enticing days since last spring, when asset inflation was the dominant mood in the markets, uncertainty has returned to the markets, which is by no means surprising, as this is their natural state, in an environment where brokers make decisions about a naturally uncertain future.
The measure used to stabilize the markets was to settle the debt with the direct purchase of assets and indirectly to give liquidity free rein in interest rates that are around zero, so that the banks buy assets for settlement.
The central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchases of assets are as good as finished and, without questioning their heterodox liquidity policy, begin to throw some sand in the gear, as the BCE n<0xC3><0xA4>c already demonstrated with its annual auction, which will take place next week.
That is why investors doubt the ability of the global economy to sustain the economic recovery without these heterodox measures, and we are witnessing a reversal in the reduction of risk premiums.
Stock market volatility and differences in corporate bonuses are rising again, even though they are still far from the paranormal amounts they reached at the beginning of the year.
States were forced to nationalize private risks, and public debt was rising again.
Quality is now being restored and the US, Japan and Germany are the preferred havens for investors, which in turn leads to an increase in the differences between the eurozone countries with regard to Germany.
Spain has so far been barely affected by this episode of instability, but then Standard & Poor's came and threatened with a new revision down regarding the valuation of Spain.
On the other hand, a certain amount of uncertainty does not hurt to silence the moral risk defenders who once again tried to create awareness of what they had caused among those responsible for world economic policy, because they had slowed down the devastating effects that the restriction of credit led to the loss of jobs when they should have decided on a new day to take action to thank them.
Nevertheless, what happened in Dubai points to a tribal war between the Emirs to restore power in the Emirates, and developments in Greece have been foreseen before.
A government that conceals the national debt, elections and a new government that is pulling in the same direction.
Prodi made it in Italy to Berlusconi and S<0xC3><0xB3>crates in Portugal to Dur<0xC3><0xA3>o Barroso.
It makes no sense for Ecofin to rescue Hungary at the beginning of the year from the non-fulfilment of its foreign payments and thus allow a euro member country to no longer fulfil its obligations.
On the other hand, it is logical that Ecofin has forced the Greek government to be transparent and to take its citizens to task in the case of the need for extra-ordinary measures to maintain the stability of state funds.
Yes, we are as expected before an episode of normalization of risk premiums, after some debauchery on too high amounts, that would now be within the expected.
In the case of Spain, there is no need to worry as long as the differences in national debt increase at the same rate as the European corporate bonuses.
If, however, European differences were to diminish and the Spanish were to increase further, this would be a special Spanish risk.
Standard & Poor's's is a farce, and while the above-mentioned indicators force a large part of the market research institutes to put their recovery scenarios ahead of them and to revise their 2011 scenario upwards, including the OCDE and the European Commission, which again come up with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy, all this does not promise a long life, despite warnings.
Once again, it seems to be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish stocks, although at the moment "beware of driving" is required.
Associated branches
Iberdrola’s chairman, Ignacio S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Gal<0xC3><0xA1>n, was the first to appear before Parliament’s subcommittee yesterday, where the strategy for Spain’s energy supply over the next two decades is being debated these days.
Following his appearance, which was followed by Gas Natural-Fenosa chairman Rafael Villaseca, Gal<0xC3><0xA1>n gave some key points to the press about what he had submitted to the subcommittee behind closed doors.
According to the chairman of Iberdrola, Spain will have to invest 50 billion euros by 2020 and another 60 billion by 2030 from that date, on the premise that the current nuclear power plants will continue to operate.
If this were not the case, the investment required would not be 60 billion, but up to 95 billion.
However, Iberdrola is of the opinion that it is no longer necessary to invest in an increase in energy production capacity, but in distribution networks and international associations.
From 2020, the question will change and performance should be increased.
His proposal focuses on both gas and coal plants with facilities to capture carbon dioxide and, of course, especially on renewable energies.
In this case, he assumes that 18,000 MW more will be needed, provided, of course, by other "support energies".
Gal<0xC3><0xA1>n, who believes that the draft law for a sustainable economy, which has just been passed by the government, is in line with what his company has demanded, did not want to say anything against this law, how to create incentives for national coal consumption, which would be the exact opposite of all political strategies in the fight against climate change.
In his opinion, "in the long term, this direction is clearly being taken, despite some "individual" measures, as the chairman of Iberdrola called them.
Be that as it may, Gal<0xC3><0xA1>n believes that investment decisions should be made now, even if they are long-term, as it will take some time and a stable remuneration framework must be created to tackle them.
Ferrovial gets the "handling" of Aer Lingus at ten airports
Ferrovial’s subsidiary for ground-based services, Swissport, is the preferred partner of the Irish airline Aer Lingus for baggage service at ten European airports where they are represented.
Paris, London, Frankfurt and Brussels are some of the most important.
The agreement, for which no figures have yet been announced, is scheduled to run for five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Government of Castile-La Mancha and the University of Alcal<0xC3><0xA1> de Henares yesterday signed a cooperation protocol for the creation of an innovation center for smart infrastructures.
The alliance plans to invest 20 million by 2012, 50% of which will come from Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the Centre will be the study of energy efficiency on motorways and airports.
Acciona competes with Hochtief and Bouygues for its first motorway construction in Australia
Acciona is fighting for the approval of its first motorway in Australia, a market where they are already represented as an energy and water company.
The construction is a tunnel that will cost 1.7 billion Australian dollars (about 1.047 billion euros).
The French company Bouygues and the German Hochtief are its competitors.
A 5-kilometer tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, has become the best opportunity for Acciona to establish itself in the country as a construction company and motorway operator.
The City Council expects the construction to be completed by the end of 2014.
After the Public-Private Cooperation Administration (PPP) decided to move the project forward according to a business plan drawn up by Ernst & Young, the Administration already has a definitive list of candidates for construction and toll booth management.
In anticipation of the offers presented in May, the estimated investment amounts to 1.7 billion Australian dollars (1,047 billion euros), with three consortia, mainly consisting of European construction companies, competing in the final phase.
The Transcity group is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first company is one of the largest construction companies in Australia, while the second, based in Italy, is one of the best specialists in civil engineering.
The Northern Direct consortium will compete against the Acciona team, consisting of the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian Transfield, which is responsible for the infrastructure, and the French Bouygues sub-assembly.
The third and final shortlisted consortium is LBRJV, made up of the capital of the Australian Leighton (subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief, which in turn belongs to ACS), the also native Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the French company Razel, which specializes in public construction.
The Australian infrastructure market promises huge construction and privatisations, but has a hurdle to overcome, as you can only access it by buying a local construction company.
A strategy followed by the mentioned companies Hochtief or Bilfinger, in addition to Asian references, and which has yet to be pursued by the Spanish construction giants.
Even ACS has only gained access to this market through its 30% stake in Hochtief, owner of Leighton.
Millions of assets
Acciona relies on this geographical area of the highest importance for the industry, in which it is already very well known for its activity as an energy supplier and in the desalination industry.
Among other assets, it already has its largest wind farm (192 MW) in Victoria and leads the group of companies commissioned to build and manage the Adelaide desalination plant with a budget of 700 million.
His intention now is to consolidate in these two areas and to use these synergies to gain access to the construction and infrastructure branches.
The underground toll road, which is promoted by the Brisbane City Infrastructure Office and is called Northern Link, is intended to connect the western highway in Toowong with the Kelvin Grove bypass road (see map) over a length of 5 kilometres through tunnels, the largest measure of congestion reduction on the Brisbane roads.
The timetable issued by the city administration provides for the award of the contract for summer 2010 and the start of construction work in December next year.
Even if this toll road is already expected to open up to traffic in the last months of 2014, it is expected that the construction work will continue until 2016.
The tunnel was designed in 2005.
It has two lanes in each direction, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Queensland government is contributing 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euros) to the financing.
For Hochtief, Brisbane is already a big business.
Australia continues to award significant contracts to Hochtief, which signed a 154 million-dollar contract with the government yesterday.
Through its domestic subsidiary Leighton, ACS will improve the infrastructure of the domestic broadband network with fiber optic cables.
This improvement will create fast internet access for 400,000 people and will keep the German company busy for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has received the 27-storey King George Towers project in the Australian city of Brisbane, where construction has not yet begun and Hochtief has received 129 million.
Also in the United Kingdom, in Manchester, it competes with Laing O'Rourke for the construction and administration of two schools for 25 years.
The initial investment amounts to EUR 75 million.
FCC awarded a contract for a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million euros
Through its subsidiary Alpine, FCC has secured the construction of a 2.1-kilometer-long tunnel for a motorway in Slovenia for the sum of 64.5 million euros.
The company received this contract just a few days after it was awarded the contract for the construction of the extension of the Bosruck tunnel (Austria) over 130 million.
In this way, Alpine strengthens its experience in tunnelling.
The start of construction is planned for the beginning of 2010 and its implementation will last over 32 months.
Sra. Rushmore receives advertising budget from Renfe
Renfe has attributed the advertising and marketing services for the next two years to the agency Sra. Rushmore over a sum of approximately three million euros annually, the railway company said.
Rushmore has been selected from 16 agencies that participated in the competition, four of which entered the finals, including TBWA, which has been in charge of advertising for the past three years.
From now on, Sra. Rushmore will be in charge of the design and production of the campaigns.
France Télécom fined over 63 million euros for slowing down the competition.
France’s competition regulator has fined France Télécom €63 million for anti-competitive behaviour in the Caribbean region.
According to the authority, the telephone provider has restricted competition on landlines and mobile phones by signing exclusive contracts, pricing plans and loyalty programs for consumers on the edge of regulation.
Together with this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state-owned company has accumulated more than 560 million euros in penalties since 1994 for obstructing its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday has even been increased, as the competition watchdog believes that France Télécom has committed similar violations in the past and has therefore relapsed.
Application trading
On the other hand, the subsidiary of the French company followed the example of other telephone providers and opened an application trading site on the Internet in order to increase revenues from non-telephone business.
Basically, this application website of Orange is active in France and the United Kingdom.
You have to wait until 2010 until this page will also be available to other countries, such as Spain.
The game at the Champions League has brought in Madrid and Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a since the beginning of 476.4 million.
Since its inception in 1992, the Champions League has become a source of income for football clubs.
So much so that Real Madrid and Barcelona have since taken in 476.4 million, earning them the third and fifth places of the football clubs that have made the most money in the league.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League not only brings glory, it is also one of the main sources of revenue for the big clubs.
According to UEFA, the league has distributed up to 5,362.5 million euros to the 105 teams (12 of them Spanish) that have participated in this event since its inception in the 1992/93 season.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona have benefited from this distribution.
The white club is the third in Europe to have made the most money from its participation and the only one besides AC Milan to have won the trophy three times.
The reigning Catalan champion and last winner of the former European Cup in 1992 occupies fifth place.
The list tops Manchester United and Bayern Munich, two teams that also made the most money by participating in the past Champoins League.
And that, even though they lost to Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a.
On the other hand, Spain is only in third place among the countries that were able to take money through the champions, although it has more titles than all the others (five, as opposed to four in Italy, three in England and two in Germany).
Distribution
This obvious contradiction is explained by the complicated money-granting procedure used by UEFA.
The organisation, chaired by Michel Platini, expects to generate 1,090 million euros in revenue from the Champions League this fiscal year.
Of this money, UEFA provides 413.1 million for fixed payments: each of the 20 football clubs that participated in the qualifying preliminary round (including the Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who fought for participation received 3.8 million by their mere presence, in addition to the 550,000 euros for each game they contested.
There is also a bonus for winning (€800,000) and for a draw (400,000 per team). The clubs that made it to the round of 16 will each receive three million; the four that made it to the quarter-finals, 3.3 million.
The last four get 4 million each.
The winner earns 9 million, as opposed to the second, who receives 5.2 million.
For example, a football club receives at least 7.1 million and a maximum of 31.2 million in fixed income.
Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a, on the other hand, earned 2.5 million with his victory at the European Supercup in August.
However, there are also the variable payments, for which 337.8 million are planned.
This money is allocated proportionally to the value of each individual television market.
The Spanish is one of the first and has 4 assigned places.
Last year’s champion will receive 40% of the allocated money, 30% of the second, 20% of the third-placed, and 10% of the fourth-placed.
The other part will be distributed depending on the number of games they play at this year’s edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million for 29.9% stake in Sos
The Nueva Rumasa Group yesterday leaked details of the offer to buy shares, with which it intends to purchase an upper limit between 25 and 29.9% of the capital of Sos.
A percentage that does not force them to make a public tender (opa) due to the number of shares.
In concrete terms, Nueva Rumasa offers €1,5025 per share, which will be paid out over a ten-year period and with an interest rate of 1% annually due to this shift.
Yesterday, the Sos shares closed at 1.85 euros, which is why Nueva Rumasa values the company 18% below the market value.
According to Nuevan Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the real valuation of Sos.
The offer is associated with the appointment of eight of the 15 consultants.
The Jeréz Group gives shareholders a period of 15 days to communicate their interest in selling their shares.
CNMV assured that it had not been informed of this offer, although the company Ruiz Mateos confirmed that it had come into contact with the authority.
Upon closing, the deposit would amount to 611.7 million, while the value of Sos is 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, Sos continues to restructure its management.
In an attempt to stay on the edge of possible offers to buy and the judicial squabbles of his ex-managers, the brothers Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s and Jaime Salazar have announced the appointment of Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Luisa Jord<0xC3><0xA1> as head of internal audit.
A decision that will make her the first woman to hold a high position at the food company.
This is a newly created post, which is directly subordinate to the chairman of the group.
This is anything but free of polemics because the company is involved in a court battle on suspicion of diverting more than 230 million Sos to other companies of the Salazar family.
It cannot be ruled out that Sos will be deferring further capital over the next few months.
With regard to the Salazar credit, the former advisers Ildefonso Ortega and <0xC3><0x81>ngel Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez Noriega (representatives of the CCM and Unicaja) appeared before the National Assembly yesterday and confirmed that they had approved the postponement of 212 million without knowing their destination.
CNMV approves Paternina’s public tender for exclusion submitted by investment company Mer
The National Stock Exchange Commission (CNMV) approved the public tender for Federico Paternina submitted by the investment company Mer last October 9.
The supervisory authority stated that it approved this tender after it had been demonstrated that the conditions comply with the legally binding laws and thus the content of the explanatory supplement submitted, after the amendments made last 2 December, can be considered "sufficient".
CNMV has also announced that this offer is aimed at the acquisition of 550.008 shares of Federico Paternina at a price of EUR 7.65 per share, which in turn is 8.95% of the share capital, which consists of EUR 6,142,786 in shares admitted on the Madrid and Bilbao stock exchanges.
In addition, it has been announced that 5,592,778 million shares have been invested, which cannot be transferred in any way until the closing of the tender and the price of which has been set by Federico Paternina in accordance with the legally binding laws.
New programs for the assessment of vehicles
In these days of severe weather and accidents, not only the car repair shops deserve
Every day, thousands of vehicles involved in an accident are towed to the workshops, where an appraiser must assess the damage incurred and the cost of repair.
No single accident is the same and calculating the cost of the parts and working hours can be a tedious and complicated task.
The calculation of the repair costs of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros by hand, including the parts and working hours, can take up to two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the support of the latest computer science tools, it is a matter of minutes
That’s why almost 100% of reviewers use this type of system.
The accident assessment and repair service and application providers collect the information they receive from the manufacturers in order to process it afterwards and offer it to their customers in the form of a useful program.
In Spain, Audatex, part of the American group Solera, is the market leader; 80% of all expert opinions are produced with their products.
The other two companies competing in the tool market for review and drafting a report are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data provided by the manufacturers is anything but easy.
According to Eduardo Vel<0xC3><0xA1>zquez, sales manager of Audatex, 63 manufacturers and importers work together, each of them providing the information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed is increasing, to the point that in the last five years even more versions, variants and motorizations have come onto the market than in the entire fifteen years before.
As soon as a new car comes on the market, the work begins for the companies.
It is a tedious task, because every single one of the thousands of vehicle parts must be catagolised and its price entered.
In addition, each model creates an "intelligent" graphic image on which you can "click" different parts of the vehicle.
If this is a much-sold model, the work can be completed in a week if the procedure proceeds quickly.
If this is a less common car, it can take up to three or four months. Currently, Audatex has complete information on 99.2% of the cars sold in Spain.
Among the more exclusive models, for example, they have information about the Porsche models, but not about Ferrari or Lamborghini.
In terms of the fleet of vehicles travelling on the roads, it is over 99%.
In order to carry out the documentation work and the production of databases, Audatex has eight centers worldwide (Spain, France, Germany, the USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) distributed and each of them specializes in certain brands.
The national headquarters is located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (usually mechanics) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests 90 million euros annually in the development of these databases.
Every month, they record 2.5 million data and their customers get the updates every other day.
The elaboration of this enormous flow of information allows companies to use it in different ways and thus offer different products.
The most common use is the use for repairs and repairs, but depending on the country, there are also tools for managing scrap parts or calculating the filing or residual value of a car.
The only company that has a guide that informs about the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer this offer in Spain, but in the United States.
When reviewing the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to get an overview of the kind of support they provide to industry experts.
This company offers ten different tools, with the star of the products being AudaPlus, a standard solution for appraisers to assess accidents.
It includes vehicles, motorcycles as well as light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it includes the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or the painting prices.
This tool is paid for depending on the purpose, i.e. for each expert opinion.
It is most expensive for customers who rarely use it, a maximum of ten times a month, namely 5.75 euros per month.
On the other hand, every insurance company that makes thousands of reports negotiates the price with Audatex.
With other products, such as AudaVIN, you can fully identify a vehicle and the equipment it ran with from the assembly line using the chassis number alone.
AudaGlass deals with the vehicle windows, and AudaSubastas is a service open to the specialist market on the Internet, with which one can offer vehicles that have been declared to be totally damaged.
Their statistics service is very useful in identifying trends, performing geodemographic analyses or in order to obtain information about deviations by brand and model.
For example, you can investigate how many models of a particular car brand had to go to the workshop due to breakdowns or how many of them were involved in a serious accident in a certain period of time.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of computer tools.
Among other things, it distributes Gt Estimate, which is also intended for reviewers and provides digital images, access to parts or prices and official working hours of the manufacturer in the same way.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa Group, which was founded in 1971 as a provider of services and solutions for the assessment of damage, breakdowns and maintenance of vehicles.
The GT guide for expert opinions is a reference product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in workshops, 3,100 appraisers and 53 insurance companies.
Their business volume has increased by 20% annually in the last three years and in 2008 sales amounted to 10.8 million euros.
At the beginning of last year, they also started to enter the international market with the opening of an office in Paris.
Audatex, on the other hand, was founded in Germany in 1966 and established in Spain in 1979.
According to the company’s sources, 62% of its business is done in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% in North and South America, working with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 workshops, 3,000 of them in Spain.
Total revenues in the world of the Solera Group (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) are 557 million dollars, 3.35 more than in 2008.
In this country, the company has revenues of 19.1 million euros, 7.2% more than in the previous year.
In 2005, the Solera Group was worth $1 billion on the stock exchange and today its shares are traded at a value of $2.4 billion.
Since 2007, they have been listed on the New York Stock Exchange and part of the Standard & Poor's benchmark index.
Auction of accident cars on the Internet
Last October, the Solera Autoonline group bought a record on the Internet for the sale of accident vehicles and motorcycles.
This purchase meant the payment of EUR 59.5 million for 85% of the company’s capital, which could increase to the remaining 15% next year.
The purpose of this purchase was to offer more services and value to its customers, with the possibility of gaining access to a huge international market.
This assessment and purchase service is exclusively aimed at industry professionals, such as insurance companies, appraisers, car rental companies, workshops, scrapyards and car dealers, who are required to register before their activities.
This platform was founded in Germany in 1996 and manages more than 650,000 operations across Europe, 500,000 of them in Germany alone.
Its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
The site now has more than 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 reviewers.
3,000 ads are managed every day and 100 new ads are added to the Spanish market every day.
According to Spanish legislation, a vehicle whose chassis number has been deregistered may no longer drive on the roads, but certain non-damaged parts may be used as spare parts.
The cars with historical value, on the other hand, may be registered again, even if they have been deregistered after difficult administrative procedures.
Workshop cost estimate in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, the company Audatex ensures that the user receives a cost estimate in only four steps: identifying the vehicle, searching for the spare part, creating and creating a cost estimate.
The ease of use of these systems is a fundamental condition, especially to convince the older professionals, who are usually more or less against the use of these new computer techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, 666 of which are passenger vehicles, 109 off-road vehicles, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Of course, you need a computer with an internet connection to use it.
After the model to be repaired has been identified on the basis of the chassis number, a graphic of the respective model appears and then the required spare part is selected.
The user can include variables such as the price of the working hours, surcharges or discounts and after that he can have the cost estimate printed out and passed on to his customer.
However, AudaTaller is not a tool for assessment like AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalog.
The main difference between the two systems is that the workshop-oriented does not include estimated working hours.
The cost of using this tool is 350 euros per year, an amount that the customer can easily pay.
At the moment, Audatex is working on offering these images in three-dimensional format.
This is an innovation that car mechanics have been waiting for for a long time, because you can use it to select a door, for example, and then turn the picture completely around to look at the inside.
