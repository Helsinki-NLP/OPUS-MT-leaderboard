Yes, she wants...
"Schöne Münchnerin" 2018 will be!
In the afternoon, another surprise awaits our candidates: they will not do the romantic candlelight shooting before MY SOLARIS alone, but at the side of Male-Model Fabian!
Hvar - Flirting, flirting, seducing - no easy tasks for our girls.
Especially when a friend is waiting in Germany.
Nevertheless, the nine "Schöne Münchnerin" candidates deliver at the shoot with People photographer Tuan and defy wind, spray and rain like real professionals.
The romantic shooting can be seen in the video:
DFB boss Grindel sees no basis for <0xC3><0x96>zil comeback
Berlin DFB President Reinhard Grindel currently sees no basis for a return of Mesut <0xC3><0x96>zil to the national team.
"This is a question that depends, of course, on the fact that you get into a conversation with him once, that you also talk about why he apparently felt one or the other as it is stated in his statement," Grindel said in the football podcast "Phrasenm<0xC3><0xA4>her" of the "Bild-Zeitung".
Despite the now months-long debate over the photos of <0xC3><0x96>zil with the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regrets the resignation of 92-times international player <0xC3><0x96>zil.
"I would have been happy if Mesut <0xC3><0x96>zil had continued to play for Germany.
I also assumed at some point that this would be the case," Grindel said.
The 29-year-old had declared his resignation from the DFB team in July and also justified it with the fact that Grindel had not defended him against racist hostility during the World Cup.
The head of the DFB repeated his criticism to <0xC3><0x96>zil that he was not ready for a conversation with national coach Joachim Löw and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He did not want to build pressure, but he knows it from football so that when "you leave a team or change a club, you talk about it with your coach and I find it a pity that this conversation has not yet come about".
Linz: Gartenhütte in Schrebergartensiedlung burnt
At 2:13 p.m., the professional fire brigade Linz was alerted to a fire in the Angererhofweg.
Because a high-voltage power line leads directly over the Schrebergartensiedlung, danger was in default.
The fire department moved out and found the hut in full fire when it arrived.
The roof had to be practically completely removed and fire debris had to be removed to the extent that was absolutely necessary.
According to the owner of the burning garden hut, he had a battery for charging at noon.
This could be the cause of the fire.
In any case, according to the fire department, the charger was in the area of the greatest fire intensity.
The damage caused by the fire has yet to be determined, as well as the cause of the fire.
However, it should be considerable, because the owner had many collectibles in his garden hut.
Lindsay Lohan Attacks Refugee Family on the Open Road
What drove Lindsay Lohan to do this strange thing?
She apparently wanted to snatch the children from an alleged refugee family.
Lindsay Lohan (32, "Herbie: Fully Loaded") has herself streamed live, as she apparently wants to snatch the children from a family in Moscow.
This is reported by the US portal "TMZ" and publishes a partial recording of the stream.
Here you see "Kissed for Happiness" with Lindsay Lohan
In the clip, Lohan gets out of a car and goes to a possibly homeless family she wants to have identified as a refugee family from Syria.
When the family flees from the actress, Lohan follows the parents and their children.
She accuses adults of child trafficking.
There is no evidence for this in the clip.
"The whole world sees this right now," Lohan can be heard in the video as she continues to follow the family down the street.
Apparently, she is trying to separate the children from their parents.
At some point, however, the obviously angry mother seems to have had enough.
It looks like she's turning around and Lohan slaps her in the face.
In tears, the actress then asserts how shocked she is - and she holds her cheek.
What prompted Lohan to take this action is currently completely unclear.
Landing on Ryugu: This task has "Mascot" on the asteroid
The Hayabusa2 spacecraft was launched in December 2014 in Japan.
It is said to approach the asteroid Ryugu so much that it can suck material from its surface and bring it to Earth.
The lander "Mascot" will remain on Ryugu.
Foreign ticker: number of dead on Sulawesi rises to more than 400
After the 7.5 magnitude earthquake and subsequent tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, at least 420 people were killed.
The death toll could rise even further.
The rescue teams have not yet penetrated the devastated areas cut off from the outside world.
Elon Musk Resigns as Tesla Supervisory Board Chairman
In the beginning there was a tweet.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk caused a stir in the stock markets in early August when he announced a withdrawal of the electric car maker.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued him for fraud, but now both have agreed.
Tesla and Musk have to pay, and the Tesla boss withdraws from the supervisory board, but he may remain chairman of the board.
Congress of British Conservatives
Sharply guarded - the party congress of the Tories
Birmingham is becoming the scene of a power struggle.
The party congress is supposed to be about foreign policy, trade issues and development policy, but the four-day conference is overshadowed by the dispute between Prime Minister Theresa May and the Brexit hardliners, on the front line ex-foreign minister Boris Johnson.
Referendum for a new state name
The Foreign Ministers of Macedonia (right) and Greece have already agreed
Macedonia is a country in the Balkans, but Macedonia is also a province in northern Greece.
Skopje and Athens have been arguing about these names for years.
Now they have agreed.
The state of Macedonia is to be called North Macedonia in the future and on this Sunday the population will vote on it - whether it is okay?
Protests in Brazil against right-wing populist Bolsonaro.
"Ele Nao" ("The Not") - meaning Jair Bolsonaro.
A week before the presidential election in Brazil, the mood in the country is divided.
Thousands took to the streets in several cities to protest right-wing populist Jair Bolsonaro.
The "Trump of Brazil" presents itself as an anti-system candidate and is thus ahead of the polls.
Its fiercest competitor is Fernando Haddad of the Left Workers’ Party.
Audi: "Dieselgate" refurbishment takes longer than planned
"The Diesel Task Force still exists," said Peter Mertens, chief development officer, to the industry magazine "Automobilwoche".
Rupert Stadler, the head of Audi, who was detained and on leave of absence, announced in December 2017 that the task force would soon be disbanded.
“In the first quarter of 2018, all engine/gearbox combinations are expected to be tested,” he said.
Mertens said: "At the beginning of July, we reached an important milestone in the reprocessing of the diesel crisis.
We have completed the internal technical analysis of our VTDI engines.
The task force was founded in September 2015 after the discovery of the diesel scandal at the Audi mother Volkswagen.
Mertens stressed that the carmaker had made "grave organizational changes" so that such a scandal would never occur again.
The VW Supervisory Board had postponed a decision on Stadler's future on Friday and wants to discuss this Tuesday.
The investigating authorities accuse the Audi boss of having approved the sale of diesel cars with false exhaust values after the exhaust gas frauds became known.
He knew about the manipulations or deliberately ignored them.
Bram Schot currently heads the company as acting CEO.
Because of the switch to the new exhaust gas and consumption test standard WLTP, there are production failures at Audi, said Schot the "Heilbronner Stimme".
Basically, he sees a falling demand for sedans such as the Audi models A6, A7 and A8, which are produced in Neckarsulm.
“The segment itself is difficult,” he said.
Schot focuses on electric mobility.
15,000 reservations have already been made for the e-tron, Audi’s first electric car.
Grindel seeks re-election - Lahm to be appointed to the DFB presidency
Mainz (dpa) - Despite the criticism of his person after the World Cup and the <0xC3><0x96>zil affair next year, Reinhard Grindel wants to run again for the office as DFB President.
“I’m doing my job and trying to do it as well as I can,” Grindel said as a guest early Sunday morning at the ZDF’s “Current Sports Studio.”
You always have to seek re-election, I will.
And then you have to see if the support is there.
In his own words, the association leader would find it "remarkable" if he did not "desire to cooperate in the future project" after the bid for the European Football Championship 2024.
Since April 2016, Grindel has been the head of the association as the successor to Wolfgang Niersbach, who had fallen over the summer fairy tale affair.
In the fall of 2016, he was elected for a first full term of three years.
The next vote will be held at the DFB Bundestag on 27 September 2019.
According to Grindel, the future European Championship chief organizer Philipp Lahm will be working in the DFB Executive Board.
"I would be pleased if my colleagues in the Presidium agreed that he would continue to advise in this role in the Presidium in the future and then, of course, would be cordially invited to make his experience available on sporting issues," Grindel said.
He did not want to participate in speculation as to whether Lahm could become his successor as head of the DFB.
As a consequence of the affair around the photos of Mesut <0xC3><0x96>zil and Ilkay Gündogan with the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Grindel expressed the wish that in the future a national player without a migration background should become an integration ambassador of the DFB.
Cacau and Celia Sasic, born in Brazil, currently hold this office, the latter of which has family roots in Cameroon.
“If someone without a migration background clearly affects society and football and says, ‘the issue is important, we have to take care of it,’ that would also be an initiative to provide a better foundation for our clubs on the ground, where integration has to work,” Grindel said.
Lose weight correctly with a semi-intelligent scale
I have had a new toy for four weeks.
A scale that not only measures my weight, but also the body fat percentage.
It can also indicate muscle and bone mass.
The body mass index also calculates the thing, but that is more for the sausages.
He doesn't say anything about whether I've replaced fat with muscle.
Basketball-Bundesliga: clear kick-off successes for Berlin and Oldenburg
Berlin - ALBA Berlin has started the new season of the Basketball-Bundesliga with a clear victory.
Against Science City Jena, the runner-up won easily with 112:55 (52:31) and offered over 40 minutes a convincing game.
Newcomer Rokas Giedraitis was top scorer of the dominant Berliners with 20 points.
The international player Johannes Thiemann (18 points) from Ludwigsburg also showed an appealing performance in front of 9113 spectators in his debut.
Former champion Brose Bamberg won in the mandatory game debut of coach Ainars Bagatskis with 84:80 (39:37) at s.Oliver Würzburg.
Augustine Rubit was the best thrower among the guests with 24 points.
Würzburg professional Gabriel Olaseni came on 14 points.
Last year’s playoff semi-finalist MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg defeated Frankfurt’s Fraport Skyliners 83:76 (41:34).
New international Karim Jallow was with 24 points the most accurate shooter in the team of coach John Patrick.
The EWE Baskets Oldenburg started the new season with a clear success.
At the Basketball Lions Braunschweig there was a clear 100:64 (48:30) and the first two points.
The new playmaker Will Cummings surpassed the Oldenburgers with 25 points.
The Braunschweig team, in which NBA star Dennis Schröder has been the majority owner since the start of the season, disappointed after a good first quarter.
A 26-1 run by the Baskets quickly provided clear conditions.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an opens mosque in Cologne
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an officially opened the Ditib Mosque in Cologne on Saturday.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an had previously met with Chancellor Angela Merkel and Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier during his three-day state visit.
Criticism of Germany
In his opening speech, Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an called on the German government to extradite supporters of the Gülen movement living in Germany and to take action against Kurdish separatists.
We will protect our citizens, no matter where they live.
We will not allow sympathizers of the PKK or Gülen movement to shake our citizens and harm German-Turkish friendship," he said.
For the opening of the Ditib Mosque, the city center of Cologne was partially closed.
Several thousand police officers were on duty, including snipers.
The Islamic Association Ditib is in criticism because it is considered an extended arm of the Turkish government.
"Global Citizen Festival": Music against Poverty: Stars, Buhrufe und Schrecksekunde
Musicians such as Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn Mendes and Cardi B have campaigned for greater engagement in the fight against poverty and disease at a joint concert in New York’s Central Park.
"Commit wherever you can," Mendes said at the festival in the night to Sunday in front of around 60,000 spectators.
Thank you for coming here, it's a dream.
Cardi B appeared in a red outfit with fringes and golden microphone.
I’m nervous, I sweat, but it’s okay, because I’m here and ready to change the world.
Actors such as Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker as well as representatives of governments, the United Nations and aid organisations also showed themselves on stage at the multi-hour spectacle.
In between, however, there was a moment of terror when many spectators took the sound of a falling metal barrier as shots, got scared and tried to flee.
There was panic, people were confused.
Seven spectators were slightly injured, said the organizer Hugh Evans.
The New York police and the musician Chris Martin then reassured the people from the stage.
“No one is trying to hurt anyone,” Martin said.
You're all safe.
Tickets for the "Global Citizen Festival" concert were available free of charge on the Internet as every year.
Anyone who wanted to get hold of one had to read and disseminate on the Internet texts, photos and videos about the global fight against poverty and disease.
For the numerous musicians and actors, there was cheers and applause from the audience - boos, on the other hand, for the Republican Senator Jeff Flake.
Together with his democratic colleague Chris Coons, he spoke on stage for more equality between men and women.
On Friday, however, Flake had spoken out in the judicial committee of the US Senate for the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh as a judge on the Supreme Court, and thus many women in the head.
At least three women have made allegations of abuse to the attempted rape against Kavanaugh, which he rejects.
Flake called for an FBI investigation into the allegations after two women, who claimed to have experienced sexual assault themselves, confronted him on the way to the committee meeting in an elevator.
"You can also get together with me in an elevator at any time," Flake told the crowd at the concert in New York.
Press freedom: Federal government defends expulsion of journalist
Government spokesman Steffen Seibert has defended the expulsion of a journalist from the press conference of Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an.
In the Chancellery, the Turkish journalist living in Hamburg had put on a T-shirt with the Turkish and German inscription "Freedom for Journalists" and had gone in the first row.
The T-shirt, had not been the problem, Seibert told the Bild am Sonntag.
It was about disrupting the course of the press conference.
The action of the journalist had created a strong unrest, which was unacceptable.
That’s why he’s called in the personal protectors to take the man out.
Seibert said that it was not allowed to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences in the Federal Chancellery.
This is true regardless of whether it is a legitimate concern or not.
The rules are the rules.
In Turkey, many journalists are in prison.
Many of them are accused of alleged espionage or support or membership in banned parties or the Fethullah Gulen movement.
The Turkish leadership blames the movement for the failed coup attempt on 15 July 2016.
Some of the accused journalists face several decades in prison.
Foreign journalists are also not safe from the Turkish authorities: Only at the beginning of September, the Austrian journalist Max Zirngast was arrested.
Most recently, the cases of imprisoned journalists Me<0xC5><0x9F>ale Tolu and Deniz Yücel had caused a stir.
They were released and were able to return to Germany, but trials are still underway in Turkey against the two.
Munich: Florian David Fitz completely drunk with Ina Müller
His fans usually know him so fresh and good-looking: Florian David Fitz.
You have to look twice: Yes, this is really Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and experienced a wild night!
Hamburg - The talk show "Inas Nacht", produced by the NDR, is known for a lively conversation at the bar of the Hamburg harbor pub "Schellfischposten".
Presenter Ina Müller and her guests toasts some beer, some wine or even high-percentage drinks to loosen up the mood and tongues.
Quite a few celebrities also drink themselves up for the obligatory singing inlays.
On Friday, another episode of the popular talk show was recorded.
This time: The actor Florian David Fitz known from films such as "Men's Hearts", "Terror - Ihr Verdict" or "Der geilste Tag".
But the trip to the far north did not go well for the Municher.
On Saturday, he posted a selfie - his face is completely crumpled on it, the eyes only two small slits.
The bed selfie shows a completely drained Florian David Fitz.
But he is not sick, he only has a powerful hangover.
Addressing his fans, he posted some - perhaps not quite serious - insights that he has now gained: "Rule one: NEVER go to Ina's night.
Rule two: Never drink the black sow.
And Spritz.
And leave out the round eggnog that Ina throws at half past three.
Alcohol consumption is truly written in the face of the 43-year-old.
His fans immediately posted a few tips to combat the afterglow.
They ranged from instant broth, fish buns or – probably most effective – headache tablets.
Others were simply amused by the sight of the usually attractive cinema star.
It is not yet known how Ina Müller survived the nocturnal drinking spree.
Since she has been moderating the TV fun at the counter since 2007, the 53-year-old seems to be much more experienced...
On a beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa struggles with vandalism and rubbish
The entrance to the 36 km long railway cycle path in the Red Riding Hood Country in Treysa presents itself difficult to find and littered.
Recipes against rampant vandalism are being sought, but solutions are barely emerging.
Shards, cigarette butts, garbage and rubbish, demolished trash cans and now dismantled signposts - this is how the entrance with seating group to the bike path on the Haa<0xC3><0x9F>e hill in Treysa presents itself for a long time.
A more than inglorious sight for the flagship Bahnradweg in Rotk<0xC3><0xA4>ppchenland.
The topic has been on the minds of members of the ADFC local group Schwalmstadt but also others for some time, according to the cycling commissioner of the city of Ulrich Wüstenhagen.
The problem has already been raised in the cycling advisory board.
There is no solution yet.
The proposals ranged from the laying of the seating group to regular emptying of the waste containers and cleaning of the surfaces at the entry point.
"I think the latter would be the order of the day - regardless of possible further activities," says Wüstenhagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that he has also contributed the topic to the local advisory board.
It’s not just the garbage that drives away cyclists and local residents – the seating group is a regular gathering place for celebrations on weekends.
Not only is it often loud, during the celebrations it is also destroyed: posts are torn out of the earth, trash cans are demolished, signs are bent over, seating furniture is smeared.
Volunteers have already cleaned up more often, says ADFC member Susanne Klippert.
But the actions are just the proverbial drop on the hot stone.
They are annoyed that the resting place on the bike path in Treysa is a meeting place for drinking.
"The focus here is clearly on the Haa<0xC3><0x9F>e hill along the entire cycle path," confirms the cycling commissioner, who is now also concerned about the new bike park in Ziegenhain, which will be opened today.
"If they suffer the same fate, it will be really expensive."
Another idea is a video surveillance on the hill: "This may set the threshold significantly higher for accessing commons.
However, this would require that a police patrol then pass in a short time.
In principle, Wüstenhagen wishes to develop the Haa<0xC3><0x9F>e hill.
It needs to be made more attractive.
You can be very satisfied with the frequency of the cycle path so far.
Tourism marketing is still expanding.
Our cycle path is very high-quality compared to others in Germany," said the ADFC members.
As an extremely critical danger area, ADFC member Susanne Klippert assesses the situation in the Ascheröder Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e in Treysa.
There is no turning track on the Haa<0xC3><0x9F>e hill.
In busy traffic, it can happen that cyclists have to wait in the middle of the road between traffic flows on both sides," she explains.
This is not a problem for sporty drivers, but it is for the elderly and especially for children.
Music contest at the Kulturbahnhof: The "Kö von Hiltrup" and the lake
The first call to the music contest was a success, creative and togetherness.
"D ein Lied für Hiltrup" is the appeal of the district offensive Hiltrup, in the "music contest for big and small, young and experienced musicians".
A contest "with a wink in the sympathetic Hiltruper family", as Karl Franke put it.
In fact, it was soon a family get-together over coffee and cake from the volunteers of the Kulturbahnhof.
Seven formations took place, from the one-man band to the large ensemble: Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Ihmig, a long-time Albanian living in Hiltrup, the nine of the "Hiltruper Sternfarben", three members and three generations of the Trenkamp and Claus families, an ensemble from the Kindergarten Lummerland and finally the Wekeies.
This contest, said district mayor Joachim Schmidt, is a novelty.
We have not seen this in other parts of the city.
What did the writers see themselves connected to?
The Hiltruper See and the Marktallee were particularly frequently mentioned in the villages.
Rolf Ihmig named the avenue "Kö von Hiltrup" in his schlager-like song.
The cultural station was also appreciated.
Again and again it was about experiencing togetherness in these places, especially with Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke revived the short breaks with short interviews with the performers or hints about their work.
Humberg learned that he had actually studied chemistry, but now also teaches guitar.
From the sound engineer Stefan Schemmelmann, Franke knew to report that the recently performed in Ludwigshafen - at a big event of BASF with Barclay James Harvest in the program.
And Alvin Jasic has put all sorts of things on YouTube.
“It’s not about winning,” Franke said.
In fact, all participants received a gift from the Hiltruper gastronomy.
For the favourites of the jury, however, there was something special - so that others can also listen to their songs.
Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied can record an entire CD with sound engineer Schemmelmann.
Other musicians can record a song: Ihmig with his Hiltrup-Schlager, which particularly impressed Franke with his musicality, and the "Lummerland-Rudel": "a very nice performance" with ten children and two teachers on guitar and cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.
Like all of them, the children performed again for the finals - and even sounded "really good" without electronic support, as Franke said.
The jury was guided by the aspects of originality, reference to Hiltrup, catchiness of the melody and recognition value.
The jury consisted of Gisbert Keller from the Westphalian School of Music, Andreas Klomfa<0xC3><0x9F> from the KvG-Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers from the Wirtschaftsverbund as well as Jan Kaven, chairman of the district offensive.
The district offensive had brought the event to life on the occasion of its ten-year existence.
She described the event as a complete success.
All were "very satisfied", and "the atmosphere was good" in the soon to be very crowded cultural station.
The word game: "Decrypto" in the game test
Players form two teams facing each other.
For each side there is a screen, in it four cards with keywords, which you - the old trick with the red foil - can only decipher when you have inserted them.
This ensures that the other side cannot read anything by mistake.
On the cards, for example, you can read from left to right: "1st Renaissance.
2nd window.
3. Dice.
4th Fest".
These are the terms that must be encrypted from now on.
It is not the terms that are supposed to be guessed here, but codes.
Alternately, one player per team is the cipher.
He gets a code card that might say "3.4.2".
In "Decrypto" not the terms behind the secret foil are to be guessed, but their encryption codes.
His task in this case: he should describe the terms "cube", "fix" and "window" in this order and in this example - in such a way that his own team recognizes the correct order and the opposing team, if possible, does not; because this wins the game if he manages to crack the code twice.
So the encryptor writes down and reads aloud: "throw" for the dice, "loose" as a contrast to Fest; here, of course, something like "party" would be possible and "prague" because he paid attention at school and knows the slump there.
So it goes round by round, team by team.
One does not know the terms of the opposite side - but this can better rhyme with every hint that the encryptor gives there.
So the descriptions should be as mysterious as possible, but not too twisted, otherwise you make it unnecessarily difficult for your team.
The most cryptic thing about "Decrypto" is unfortunately the rulebook.
The players probably have to study it for quite a long time and in detail until they can finally play.
The explanation video at decrypto.info on the net makes it easier.
But once you get started, you will be fascinated by how much feeling there is in this inconspicuous game.
Overall, however, "Decrypto" is not quite as conclusive as its predecessors and genre-primus "Codenames", which also puts an agent theme on a game of fewer words, but is much better to play in small groups.
And for those who are only interested in guessing and not in victory points, you can easily find a version for two.
Kulmbach: Man shows police Hitler salute and harasses guests in the pub
A 48-year-old man employed the Kulmbach police inspectorate twice during the night from Saturday to Sunday.
First he showed the Hitler salute in the Upper City to a passing police patrol, later he also noticed in the Upper City in a pub when he harassed other guests.
After he clearly did not comply with the assigned place reference by the police, he had to spend the night at the police inspection Kulmbach in the detention cell.
In a sober state, he must then also be held criminally responsible for the use of marks of unconstitutional organizations.
Pressig was the home of the Schubloks
For decades, the railway operations plant in Pressig was the hub in the Frankenwald.
In 1991, a piece of railway history ended.
"When buffers popped on buffers, you heard it all over Pressig," recalls Georg Dinkel, who archives the history of the place and the station.
It didn't upset anyone.
The brakes also squeaked and the wagons rattled.
It was pure railroad.
Statements that stand symbolically for Dinkel's home Pressig.
Nowhere in the Frankenwald was a place so shaped by the railway.
Here was the starting point of the steep ramp mountain route to the north, which has its peak point in Steinbach am Wald after a rise of about 220 meters in altitude.
To cope with this, train and Schubloks were needed in the past, who had their home in Pressig.
In 1901, the Bavarian parliament approved the construction of a railway workshop with 21 locomotive sheds, apprentice workshop, overhead line and railway master workshop.
"The centerpiece was the turntable, which had a diameter of 18 meters after a reconstruction in 1899," says Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid, railway historian and professional railwayman for 47 years.
From the Bahnbetriebswerk (BW) Pressig, which was subordinated to Bamberg in 1968, locomotives for the secondary lines Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - Nordhalben were also operated.
On July 15, 1950, the "Volksblatt" reported a staff of 160 men; 13 steam and eight elloks were stationed in Pressig at that time.
The electrification of the line in 1939 already minimized the need for train and Schubloks.
From 1977 they were only used for freight trains.
By 1991, at least 10,000 weighings had been placed in the month.
In 1982, parts of the plant were abandoned, in 1991 the rest.
Heidrich: "It is regrettable that we have not considered a better use of the site, also in terms of freight transport".
On Pentecost 1989, the Nuremberg Railway Directorate celebrated a pompous station festival in Pressig on the anniversary of "50 years of electrification Nuremberg - Saalfeld".
“There were 10,000 enthusiastic spectators here,” recalls Georg Dinkel.
A little later, it's over.
On 1 June 1991, the last 30 men were withdrawn, the marshalling yard Pressig was history.
"The shunters and hitchhikers did the most difficult work in train traffic," recalls Dinkel.
Every mistake would have had fatal consequences.
Why the station Pressig-Rothenkirchen led for the reversal of the hierarchy of the two places and many more historical and current pictures can be found here in the infrankenPlus article.
Kerber with first success at China Open
Wimbledon winner Angelique Kerber and Laura Siegemund have reached the second round at the tennis tournament in Beijing as before Julia Görges.
Kerber won the China Open 6:2, 6:2 against the French Kristina Mladenovic.
The next opponent of the world ranking third is either Julia Putintseva from Kazakhstan or the Spaniard Carla Su<0xC3><0xA1>rez Navarro.
Siegemund led 6:3, 4:2 against Darya Kassatkina when the Russian placed at number 13 gave up.
The swan is now dealing with Anett Kontaveit from Estonia.
As part of the series "Kunst und Genuss" a special exhibition was opened in Mittelehrenbach at the weekend.
With great relief registered organizers and visitors watched the ideal weather when the special vernissage "Windspiel-Performance" was opened in the open-air area of the Dahlmann-Schmidt estate, Mittelehrenbach.
It takes place under the umbrella of the tourism association "Rund ums Walberla" as part of the series "Kunst und Genuss".
It opened its doors in the 15th year.
A large number of visitors showed the fascination of the exhibition.
21 copies of 20 artists are now on display in Mittelehrenbach.
Host Ernst Jürgen Dahlmann welcomed the artists to the opening of the vernissage.
He has been with us since the very first hour.
Just like Volker Hahn, who made a name for himself as the main organizer and artist.
Somewhat surprisingly, however, Hahn announced his resignation a few days ago.
With Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer, however, he placed his task in proven, young hands with good prospects for the future.
Both have already actively participated in the selection of artists in the past and helped to design flyers.
Once again this year, a 70-cent special stamp designed by them will be available at every art station on the occasion of Art & Enjoyment.
This year's poster "Betzn austanzen", designed by Volker Hahn, can also be purchased there for eight euros.
Hahn was pleased with the high popularity of the special exhibition.
Max Marcus Stadler from Nuremberg was chosen for the musical framework.
Walking through the spacious garden, the visitor quickly realizes that the title "Windplay Performance" formally challenges the artistic imagination and ultimately expresses it in a playful way.
They are works of art made of metal or ceramic, often with colour accents.
Already at the entrance of the property, the visitor awaits on the right side of the "Glücksbaum" by the artist Werner Baur, Eschenau.
It is a tree stump, bright in color, playfully provided with 20 windmills, 24 horseshoes and 24 aluminum tubes as a sound piece.
With the sun flashing through the bushwork in the background, the object seems fairytale-like and invites you to linger.
Barbara Waschneck comes from Eckental, who prefers to write three-dimensional letters and dedicates herself to the event 15 years of K&G.

50 years MGV 68 Albachten: Singers celebrate 50th birthday
1968 - that was the time of protest and the student movement.
And the Albanians also vented their displeasure at that time.
At least five of them.
They did not want to come to terms with the fact that after the dissolution of the church choir "C<0xC3><0xA4>cilia" there should no longer be a singing life in the district.
It has now become a legend: On a bench in the Tinnenbusch they raised the MGV 68 Albachten from the christening.
That was 50 years ago.
Now the anniversary was celebrated in the "House of Encounter".
"It's going to be full today," chairman Jürgen Holstiege suspected, and he should be right.
There were 150 guests, a real success for the Albanian singers.
Especially for the anniversary, they had revived the foundation festival.
For years it was tradition, then there was a break.
Just in time for the 50th anniversary, the traditional festival was back.
An elegant ball was there, festive clothing had been requested before.
The guests did not sit in rows of seats in the "Haus der Begegnung" as usual, but comfortably at tables.
In between movements were needed: DJ Matthias Drees from Nottuln put on the controls and asked for the dance floor.
It is a matter of honor that the singers of the MGV 68 Albachten themselves let the voice ring.
In keeping with the occasion, happy songs were announced.
It’s like, “A day as beautiful as it is today.”
Matching the exquisite grape juice that many had in front of them, there was the "Rüdesheimer Wein".
In allusion to another cool drink, "Humulus lupulus" sounded, which is the Latin name for "hop".
Richard Homann, who is one of the five who were in the Tinnenbusch at the time, was once again sovereign.
"It's just fun to sing under his direction," said Holstiege: "He has such an easy way, it's a masterpiece that he accomplishes". By the way, this time it wasn't just men who were singing.
The women's choir "Hohes C" was also a guest, whose repertoire includes especially evergreens from the 20s to the 60s.
Finally, there was poetry.
Singer Theo Weber had sat at his desk until three in the morning to create his own rhymes.
And Andreas Winterhoff also presented melodious poetry.
There was also a big raffle.
The proceeds will be used to finance a visit to the all-weather zoo for the children of the Albatros Youth Centre.

Volleyball: 3rd League Women: USC II wins high-class derby against BW Aasee
The climber marches.
Three games, three victories - the reserve of the USC Münster under the patronage of Axel Büring can be found really well in league three.
No trace of shyness or freaking out, the independents do their thing.
And the 3:0 (25:15, 25:23, 26:24) against city rival BW Aasee really good.
“It wasn’t crystal clear, but we’ve already made an impression,” says the reasonably satisfied coach.
BWA coach Kai Annacker immediately agreed: "This is a defeat with which we can live very well.
We are not satisfied." On the contrary.
In the evening at a subsequent birthday party of Ronja de Boer, the mood was good, the game ticked off.
Yes, the result is indeed an optical illusion.
In the third set, the guests had a set ball.
"If they bring it to the goal, such a game can sometimes tip over," Büring knows from years of experience.
Finally, the USC made everything clear with its routine forces and brought the full yield to the goal.
“We all know who’s on the other side in a derby like that.
That won't break our necks.
I saw really good volleyball in phases," Annacker did not hesitate with the 0:3 - and immediately went on to the agenda.
Where the journey goes for the independents seems to be unforeseeable after just three matchdays.
“It’s just too early for that,” says Axel Büring.
Only one thing he feels confirmed: "The 3rd league has an incredibly good level.
This is not nearly comparable to regional league volleyball." They do not want to look down into the fourth league anyway.
If the vest is not soiled in the next few weeks, they have to look up.
However, a first balance can only be drawn after ten, eleven games.
On Saturday we go to Emlichheim.
Aasee will take place in Essen on 14 October.

On her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband
On the "dream ship" Heide Keller became a star.
Now she speaks openly about the fact that the series may have had a complicity in her marriage with Hans von Borsody.
Her role as the head hostess Beatrice von Ledebur on the "Dreamship" made Heide Keller (76) famous, but on January 1, 2018 she went off the ship forever.
The series, which made her a star, could be partly responsible for her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929 - 2013), with whom she was married for ten years.
“That could have been a reason.
Because I grew up with this work, traveled around the world alone with a suitcase and many colleagues I admired perceived me on an equal footing," Keller tells in conversation with the "Bild am Sonntag".
At first, she had always been only "the wife of Hans von Borsody", but that had changed with the "Dreamship".
For now, the journalists only called Heide Keller.
"Whether he liked it so much, I don't know."
She thinks it is possible that her husband at the time could have been jealous, but "how many men did Hans shy away from conversations about problems and feelings".
“Keller always tried to be the right person for Hans von Borsody and he didn’t want to know my fears, my weaknesses.
This means in good German: I have misled myself", as she explains further.
I always felt like I wasn’t good enough for him.
He saw me as an emancipated woman who I never really was, even though I sometimes appeared cheeky and brave on stage.
I wanted our love to be forever.”
After a previously failed marriage to Thomas H<0xC3><0xA4>rtner, Keller said yes again, "although I was afraid that it could go wrong a second time".
The day before the civil wedding I sat crying in the wardrobe and wanted to cancel everything.
Borsody's marriage also failed.
Why have they never worked with men?
Because I wanted too much.
Keller had imagined the love at that time "as in the film.
Unfortunately, this vision is not suitable for everyday use.
I'm too naive about love."
The moth, which regularly explores the city’s nightlife in the NZZ resort of Zurich, has this time ventured to the ZFF opening party.
Our moth is not a moth, but a little bit shy of light.
And the glaring brilliance, in which a green carpet is immersed in the Sechsel<0xC3><0xA4>utenplatz, blinds him beyond measure.
But it is just a film festival, where more or less famous people want to sunbathe in the spotlight.
So on this late Thursday evening, he stumbles across the square to make himself briefly easier in the "Aquaclean-WC-Oase".
This is the name of the public toilet system sponsored by a large sanitary company, which is celebrating its premiere at the festival: The need facility on the ground floor of a new pavilion makes a lot of effort to exude a luxurious ambience.
This evening, however, the men's oasis smells of heaven for some reason.
So get out of here, across to the other side of the street: Invited guests, who have just entertained at the very best level in the cinema next door to the opening film "Green Book", celebrate the beginning of the festival as every year with a party in the three-storey department store.
Its name fits perfectly with this film festival: the works shown are known to have originated from all over the world.
What do you not have to come up with in an article about this festival, in order not to fall into stealth advertising for its 190 partner companies.
The butterfly wraps a ribbon around the feelers, which has given him a good fairy, and two bully bouncers actually wave him generous in.
Inside, the guests crowd each other, they dance far after midnight to live music or let DJ dictate rhythms to which they shout at each other, and rinse down with Cüpli exquisite appetizers.
In the delicatessen shop in the basement oysters wait for sipping mouths, next door the incomparable raw ham Culatello di Zibello is freshly sliced, a chocolate fountain bubbles.
And the hammer is: all the shelves full of exclusive products have not been cleared for the occasion.
This has been the case for years, so it seems to work without major losses.
You have to love this country for it!
The butterfly studies the sign at the escalator: "wear a long dress, please be careful on the escalator".
If these are two separate instructions, he has misspelled himself in the dress code.
But it is more of a conditional construction, and it has certainly already saved lives.
In the household goods department on the upper floor, the winged man flips a cocktail prepared with espresso called "Golden Eye", matching the festival award.
This mix, with which a capsule manufacturer presents itself, does not necessarily receive the price for the best drink.
And George Clooney, who has been promoting that brand for years, isn't here that night either.
But a face that seems familiar to the observer passes between the local celebrities, the box office table and kitchen items: Peter Farrelly, the director of the opening film.
The main character should not be far away.
And really: Viggo Mortensen, with almost sixty acting almost like a choirboy, immediately walks through the crowd.
He is not talked about, he is not liked, at most he is squinting stealthily.
Especially for this reluctance, often misunderstood as restraint, international stars love this film festival.
Maradona celebrates victory in Mexico with Cumbia dances
Coach and ex-football star Diego Maradona is delighted about his team’s victory.
Argentina's football legend Diego Maradona seems to have settled in well in his new home of Mexico.
After a 2-0 win by his club Dorados de Sinaloa, the 57-year-old coach danced to cumbia rhythms with a player in the cubicle, as can be seen in a video already released on Saturday.
In the 15-second clip of a team member, Maradona dances in the yellow jersey, cheered on by the players.
The Mexican second division defeated the Leones Negros 2-0 on Saturday.
After the game, Maradona called out to a TV camera, "Always with my boys, always."
The 57-year-old has been coaching the Mexican club since the beginning of September.
Handball: Verbandsliga 1: ASV Senden after last-minute failure "destroyed at ground"
Swen Bieletzki, coach of the handball club ASV Senden, could hardly believe it: "Such a bitter defeat". His protégés were "destroyed on the ground" after the unfortunate 29:30 (12:14) - bankruptcy - the fourth in the fourth game - on Saturday evening at LIT Germania 2.
They had - as in Steinhagen, as against Hüllhorst - not played badly over long phases, the Senders.
Only the initial phase "we totally overslept", the ASV coach was annoyed.
The hosts quickly led with 8:1, even the early break that Bieletzki had taken, initially did not bear fruit.
"But then suddenly a jolt went through the team," Bieletzki summed up the second quarter hour.
At the break, the gap was only two goals.
In particular, Senden’s best, Marius Hintze, scored in the phase over and over again.
After the change, it got even better from the visitor’s point of view.
After 33 minutes, David Ernst equalised at 15:15, then led the relay changer almost continuously.
Four minutes before the siren, the lead was still seemingly reassuring three hits (29:26).
And then what?
Let the unbiased come into play.
Bieletzki usually avoids blaming others.
But: The 120-second time penalty, which Steffen Mühlhoff collected, "was a joke".
LIT had a good laugh and hit four more times until the end - while the decimated ASV also failed in the last attack.
The guys fought great, stood well against seven men in the back and threw again and again on the empty gate.
You can buy very little for compliments.
"Now there must be a damn victory," Bieletzki said.
ASV gates: Hintze (9), Ernst (6), Schlögl (4), Kretschmer (3), Kümper (2), Mühlhoff (2), van de Pol (2).
Hüging (1).
Bavaria: Woman missing for 30 years - police dig for body parts
More than 30 years after the disappearance of a then 18-year-old from Naila (district of Hof), the police are searching for the woman's remains.
Emergency personnel dug up a road near Marxgrün on Saturday.
For this purpose, the road surface and several layers below were removed, as police and prosecutors jointly announced.
According to new findings, the missing person may not have been buried far from her home at the time.
She has been missing since November 4, 1986.
Investigators did not rule out a crime at the time.
Since last year, the Criminal Police Court has been working intensively on the case together with the public prosecutor’s office.
Together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the Bavarian Monument Protection Authority, the investigators came across a conspicuous sight under the road near Marxgrün by means of a ground radar.
With the help of a dog trained on the smell of human bones, the officials limited the position to a few meters.
The results of the excavations should be announced during the afternoon.
The hacker attack on millions of Facebook users shows the dangers lurking on the web.

Elon Musk, founder of electric car manufacturer Tesla, has escaped his impending dismissal as head of the multi-billion dollar company.
He and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed an out-of-court lawsuit over misleading Twitter messages in which Musk could have lost permission to run listed companies.
As part of the settlement, Musk and Tesla pay $20 million each, and Musk will serve as Chairman for three years, a position comparable to that of Germany’s Chairman of the Supervisory Board.
He can stay head of the board against it.
In the settlement, which has yet to be confirmed by a court, neither Musk nor Tesla acknowledged wrongdoing.
The SEC had sued the world-renowned manager in the US federal court Manhattan for fraud.
Musk, who also heads space company SpaceX, is the public face of the loss-making electric car pioneer, which is now valued at more than $50 billion on the stock market.
Musk is not guilty.
Musk said he had done nothing wrong and was sad and disappointed by the lawsuit.
He has always acted in the interests of truth, transparency and investors.
On August 7, Musk wrote to his more than 22 million Twitter followers that he might take the company off the stock exchange, paying $420 per share, the financing was secured.
Tesla was valued at $72 billion.
Musk said that Tesla would remain on the stock market.
After the deal, Tesla will need to find an outside chairman, hire two independent board members, and set up a committee to oversee Musk’s communications.

Record champions Manchester United are slipping deeper into the crisis after the worst start to the season since 1989.
The team of the controversial coach José Mourinho lost at West Ham United with 1:3 (0:2) and remains with ten points after seven matchdays only in the table midfield.
The pressure on Mourinho will continue to grow ahead of Tuesday’s Champions League match against Valencia.
Former Leverkusen goalkeeper Bernd Leno made his first Premier League appearance after an injury to Petr Cech.
Before the Champions League match at 1899 Hoffenheim on Tuesday, Manchester City won 2-0 against Brighton&Hove Albion by goals from Raheem Sterling (29th) and Sergio Agüero (65th).
Leroy Sané prepared the 1-0, Ilkay Gündogan was not used in the new leader.

46% don’t want Merkel as chancellor by 2021
After the squabbles of the past few weeks, the GroKo collects several poll slips.
The SPD falls behind the AfD in a survey - Angela Merkel is viewed critically.
Berlin - The AfD has overtaken the SPD in the Emnid Sunday trend for Bild am Sonntag for the first time nationwide.
In the weekly survey of the opinion research institute, the AfD increases by one counter to 17 percent, the SPD gives off a point compared to the previous week and ends up at 16 percent.
The CDU and CSU also lose a numerator and only reach 27 percent.
This is the lowest value for the Union in the Sunday trend to date.
The Greens reach 15 percent, the Left 11 and the FDP 10 percent.
If Bundestag elections were held on Sunday, the ruling parties SPD, CDU and CSU would receive only 43 percent of the votes, according to Emnid.
With the exception of Allensbach, the grand coalition has currently lost the majority in the Sunday question at all major research institutes.
The governing parties consistently get 43 to 45 percent of the vote (Allensbach: 51 percent).
In the 2017 federal election, they received a combined 53.4%.
The bandwidth of the other parties is also large: The AfD, in several polls the second largest party, comes to 15 to 18 percent.
The Greens have between 12.5 and 17 percent of the vote.
The left is at an average of 10 percent, FDP at 9 percent.
For statistical reasons, such polls have an uncertainty of 2 to 3 percent up and down, depending on the proportion of votes.
But also the support for Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in the population has fallen significantly since the 2017 federal election.
Currently, only 48 percent of the citizens think that Merkel is the right one in the Chancellery, as the Emnid survey on behalf of the BamS revealed.
According to the survey, only one in two (50 percent) currently wants the grand coalition to hold in three years until the next regular federal election, 41 percent are for a new election.
Also in a further survey published on Saturday, there had been a clear loss of popularity for Merkel.
Divided, the Germans also judge whether Merkel should run for the CDU chairmanship again in December.
According to Emnid, 47 percent are in favour, 44 percent against.
In the case of the Union supporters, 64 percent want a candidacy, 35 percent do not.
Poster at Aldi: Price reduced to happiness of love
Is Aldi going to be Tinder 2.0?
Who says in times of Tinder there are no more romantic stories to get to know - he should talk to Aldi about turkey.
Munich - In times of digital "fast food dating" by Tinder and Co., the supermarket as a meeting place for great love almost radiates an anachronistic romance.
Yes, right, a conversation about reduced turkey meat, boxer shorts bargains at the wobble table or the favorite pudding is, in doubt, still a better story for the future grandchildren than a mere swipe to the right.
The Tinder app has a reputation for being less of a contact, but more of a slippery stock exchange.
We risked the test: How do women react when you don’t talk around the bush for long in the first message?
Here is the amazing result.
Regular Hollywood love story potential has it when an out-of-the-eyes-lost-and-rediscovered-plot precedes the love-happiness.
If the guy then also under the e-mail address bio-putenfleisch<0x40>gmx.de reports to his beloved, then that sounds very much like Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant and Konsorten - Romantic Comedy at it's best.
So it is the author of this ad in an unknown Aldi branch to wish that she will also find her dream man, with whom she has briefly talked about the "30 percent reduced organic putt meat".
For her belief in the magic of analog getting to know each other, she definitely deserved her happy ending <0xC3><0xA0> la Hollywood.
Billerbeck: 500 lids for a life without paralysis
Since the beginning of the new school year, the Ludgeri School has participated in the action "Lid against polio - 500 lids for a life without polio".
Polio is the abbreviation for poliomyelitis, an infectious disease caused by polio viruses.
The disease called polio in German leads from paralysis symptoms to death.
In Germany, polio is considered eradicated, but there are still three countries in the world where the disease occurs.
The cause of poliomyelitis, the polioviruses, can so far only be contained by vaccinations, as stated in a press release.
Football: Reus and Zorc demand peace for Götze
Leverkusen (dpa) - BVB sports director Michael Zorc and captain Marco Reus have called for an end to the public discussion about form and fitness of Mario Götze.
"We should stop worrying about Mario.
That doesn't do the boy any good.
And that doesn’t do us any good,” said Reus, a friend of Götze, after the 4:2 victory in Leverkusen at the TV station Sky.
Zorc had already stressed before the game.
For him personally, this is not an easy situation.
Football: Eberl: No rush in contract talks with Hecking

There is no fixed date when we do this.
"There will certainly be a moment when we sit down and talk," Eberl told Sky.
Football: Bezirksliga: VfL Wolbeck researcher's appearance against SC Altenrheine gives courage
There were moments in this still young season, when Alois Fetsch went to court hard with his own.
Wortkarg, the coach of the football district club VfL Wolbeck, first withdrew (inside) to reflect on the lack of willingness to perform on the green.
All history.
Meanwhile, it runs around the Brandhoveweg again.
Fresh proof is the 1:1 on Sunday against SC Altenrheine, in the past season only very thinly scrapped past the ascent.
Yes, I am very satisfied with the performance.
"We made the spaces tight and put pressure on the ball.
That could be seen," Fetsch praised his boys and looked up to each individual after the game to simply say "thank you" for so much resistance against the ambitious guests.
The coach had to make a system change after 26 minutes.
After the injury to Nico Frerichs (muscular problems) - for him came Luca Rehberg - it went from the 4-4-2 almost seamlessly into a 4-2-3-1, in which Niklas Thewes was waiting in the front line for balls.
Wolbeck had significantly more play in the first section.
And chances.
But Frerichs before his exit (17.), the substitute Luca Rehberg (26.) and Jan Schroer (38.) missed the lead.
That would have almost avenged itself when the SCA in minute 41 twice in person of Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberb<0xC3><0xA4>umer hit dangerously in front of the Wolbecker Kasten - Tormann Damian Hallas proved to be a master of his trade.
After the break, the VfL took full control.
Thewes from 18 meters narrowly failed.
Schroer was also late after 58 minutes at a Thewes re-entry.
With the replacement of Miles Geske, Fetsch again missed a fresh cell cure on the left side.
When Altenrheine’s Chris Naberb<0xC3><0xA4>umer fell Robin Westhues in the 70th minute, there was an indirect free kick for the pitchers 18 meters in front of the guest enclosure.
The fouled man appeared himself and demonstrated his dangerousness at standards.
Westhues" thing with the right slap hit bottom left from the shooter's point of view - 1:0 (71.).
20 minutes that should be damn long.
And then this: VfL captain Florian Quabeck flew in the 80th minute the leather in the penalty area unhappily to the hand.
Referee Hüseyin Sahin (Hamm) immediately pointed to the point.
Jannis Schneider did not miss the gift (79.).
Wolbeck had to survive in the final phase, before Geske in the 87th minute from twelve meters still had the victory goal on the Pushchen.
Maybe it would have been too much of a good thing.
VfL: Hallas - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Schroer - Klemke (75th Seidel), Bensmann - Frerichs (26th L. Rehberg), Westhues, Vielmeyer (66th Geske) - Thewes

Helicopters crashed in Kottingbrunn
During the landing there was an accident at the airfield.
The four inmates were slightly injured.
Around 2 p.m., a drama took place at the airfield in Kottingbrunn on Sunday.
The landing of a helicopter caused turbulence, as the police confirmed to oe24.
The helicopter was caught by a gust of wind, crashed to the ground and came to a standstill laterally.
Police, rescue and fire brigade were immediately notified.
With a large contingent, the emergency services came to the scene of the accident.
The <0xC3><0x96>AMTC emergency medical helicopter was also called for caution.
Inmates only slightly injured
Fortunately, everything turned out to be largely harmless.
There is only one damage.
The four inmates were only slightly injured and were able to go home on their own.
The exact circumstances of the accident have not yet been clarified and are the subject of the investigation.
According to fire department spokesman Franz Resperger, there was a small fire, which was quickly extinguished.
Allbright Foundation report: Women remain a rarity on corporate boards
As a result, only 8% of the board members were female on the September 1 deadline, according to the report "Die Macht der Monokultur", which will be officially presented by the Allbright Foundation this Monday and available to the German Press Agency in advance.
"The companies will have to position themselves differently, otherwise the international competitors will move past them," said Wiebke Ankersen, managing director of the foundation.
In the USA, Great Britain or Sweden, male-only management teams – with a few exceptions – are no longer conceivable.
The backlog makes German competitors less diverse in comparison, innovation-friendly and future-oriented.
It is a different corporate culture.
The slight increase in the proportion of women among the German stock exchange companies was also due solely to positive impulses among the companies of the index of medium-sized values (MDax).
According to Allbright, only 6.8 percent of the board members are female.
Last year, however, the figure was 3.8 percent.
Among the 30 Dax companies – pioneers in recent years – the proportion of women has stagnated.
Most recently, 26 women worked on the boards.
“I’m sure that the Dax companies will recruit more consistent women in the coming year – in their own interest,” Ankersen said.
Only RWE and Heidelberg Cement had signaled that they would continue to make no commitment to increase the share of “zero percent” so far.
A different picture emerges from the supervisory boards: As of September 1, the proportion of women there was 30.5 percent - 45 women more and 68 men less than a year ago.
“If the same number of women were recruited annually for the board of directors, a proportion of 40 percent would have been achieved by 2023,” the report says.
Some even make a mess: Luxury cars: Which manufacturer earns the most per car?
Ferrari deserves the best.
The Italians take 280,000 euros with each Ferrari sold and make 69,000 euros operating profit.
Big cars, big profits: This slogan still applies today – in most cases.
Who among the noble providers makes the most profit per car.
Ferrari, Maserati, Bentley: How much do the luxury manufacturers collect per car they sell?
"Autopapst" and economics professor Ferdinand Dudenhöffer dealt with this question.
His study shows that the differences are massive.
Ferrari made an operating profit of 69,000 euros with every car sold in the first half of the year – Jaguar Land Rover, on the other hand, only comes to around 800 euros, Tesla and Bentley even put a lot of money on each car.
Mercedes, BMW and Audi are good in the race with prices ranging from an average of 33,000 to 38,000 euros per car and around 3,000 euros in profit before interest and taxes.
On the day of her 38th birthday, tennis legend Martina Hingis announced on Twitter that she will become a mother for the first time.
The longtime No. 1 finished her career at the end of last year with 25 Grand Slam titles - five in singles - definitively.
In July, she married the Zuger Harald Leemann.
She did not reveal the date of birth.
Torchlight procession for the opening of the 60th Abtswinder Wine Festival
With a torchlight train, the tourist association in Abtswind opened its wine festival session.
For the 60th time, the association organizes the wine festivals, which from now on rise every Saturday in October in the large festival tent on Rehweiler Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e.
At the start of the anniversary, the people in charge of the festival moved through the town to the festival square under the sounds of the Spielmannszug from Wiesenbronn.
In the already clumsy party tent, the chairman of the tourist association, Wolfgang Starz, Mayor Jürgen Schulz and Weinprinzessin Lisa Kursawe welcomed the guests. "To do something like this for 60 years - this is an amazing achievement for a small town with 800 inhabitants.
You can be proud of that," Starz thanked all the helpers.
Wine Princess Lisa II later symbolically toasted with the guests from the stage.
"Nice that again so many have found their way to us after Abtswind". Later "Die Troglauer" provided the mood.
On Sunday, on which the Abtswinder Kirchweih was also celebrated, the association had set the drink prices on the occasion of the anniversary in the afternoon, as it did 60 years ago.
A festive evening for the 60th wine festival will take place on Friday, 5 October, in the guest's house, before it goes into the second round in the marquee a day later.
In Bonn: Notarztauto kracht in Taxi
An ambulance is severely damaged next to a road.
In the collision of the emergency vehicle with a taxi, a 27-year-old passerby was fatally injured.
When emergency doctors are called, they should help - preferably even save human lives.
Such a rescue trip took a deadly end for a 26-year-old in Bonn.
Bonn - A 26-year-old pedestrian was fatally injured in the collision of an emergency ambulance with a taxi in Bonn.
The taxi driver, the emergency doctor and their driver were seriously injured, as the police announced.
The 46-year-old driver of the emergency car had run over a red light with blue light and Martinshorn on Saturday afternoon.
He then came across a junction with the taxi that was driving at Green.
After the collision, the doctor’s car hurled at a traffic light pole and a tree.
He captured the passer-by who died at the scene of the accident.
Driver of ambulance and taxi driver seriously injured
The 62-year-old taxi driver and the driver of the ambulance were severely injured in their vehicles and had to be freed by emergency services.
The 29-year-old emergency doctor, who was also seriously injured, was able to free herself, but the pedestrian could no longer help her.
Another doctor tried to do this, but to no avail.
The three seriously injured were taken to hospitals.
The police, in close coordination with the Bonn public prosecutor’s office, are investigating who is to blame for the accident.
Manchester United lose again, for Mourinho we are uncomfortable
After the embarrassing end in the league cup, Manchester United now also loses in the 7th round of the Premier League.
Against West Ham United, ManU is subject to 1:3.
The scene was emblematic in the 74th minute, in which the revived Marko Arnautovic shot 3-1 for West Ham; only three minutes after Marcus Rashford had supposedly led the Red Devils back into the game.
Presuming an offside at Mark Nobel's pass, all Manchester defenders stopped, leaving Arnautovic all the time in the world to pass the ball by the helpless David de Gea.
This was the negative culmination of a performance that had previously been insufficient over long distances.
At the moment, the atmosphere at United’s city rival Manchester City is quite different.
The Citizens coached by Mourinho's great rival Pep Guardiola came against Brighton & Hove Albion to an unassailable 2-0 victory.
After half an hour, Raheem Sterling broke the outsider's defense for the first time for the home team.
After a good hour and a double pass with the former goal scorer, Sergio Agüero ensured the sixth victory in the seventh game, and thus also the jump to the top of the table.
Liverpool no longer a leader
Three days after their 2-1 defeat in the League Cup, Xherdan Shaqiri beat Liverpool in the Premier League 1-1 against Chelsea.
As in the Cup-Off, Belgian Eden Hazard was the best man in the London team.
The 27-year-old's goal in the 25th minute remained the only goal of the game until the final phase.
Shaqiri, who came on the field in the 66th minute for Mohamed Salah, narrowly missed the balance after 70 minutes.
Daniel Sturridge did better in the 89th minute with his Schlenzer.
After the Reds started the week with a flawless record, Chelsea were unbeaten for the second time.
First, the Londoners eliminated the team of Jürgen Klopp in the Cup, through the draw in the league, the Blues Liverpool now also fall from the top of the table.
Like City, the two London city clubs Tottenham (in Huddersfield) and Arsenal (against Watford) also celebrated 2–0 victories.
The Gunners fans, who played through Granit Xhaka, had to wait until the 81st minute for a success report against the surprise team from County Hertfordshire.
Nine minutes before the end, Watford defender Craig Cathcart pitted Alex Iwobi into his own goal, only two minutes later Mesut <0xC3><0x96>zil made the decision with his third goal of the season.
Arsenal moved past Watford thanks to their fifth straight win and are now in 5th place immediately behind their rival Tottenham. Wolverhampton continue to make a strong impression under their Portuguese coach Espirito Santo.
The Wolves remained unbeaten in the league for the fifth time in a row and finished in 8th place.
VW core brand missing: Paris Motor Show under the sign of the diesel debate
The Paris Motor Show takes place every two years alternating with the IAA in Frankfurt.
Paris - Officially not an issue and yet ubiquitous: The diesel scandal and the struggle for driving bans and retrofitting should not let go of the German car companies at the industry meeting in Paris.
At the 2018 Motor Show, they will be presenting their innovations in the French capital from next week, together with competitors from all over the world.
Diesel no longer plays a major role in this.
The possible exchange and retrofit offers for diesel owners in Germany, which are to be negotiated with the government in Berlin until then, should nevertheless be an important topic at least behind the brilliant backdrop of the exhibition stands.
A big name is missing in Paris: The Volkswagen Group is with Audi, Porsche and other subsidiaries, but not with the core brand VW itself.
Audi and Mercedes-Benz are there and among other things have their first pure electric models: the e-tron of the Ingolst<0xC3><0xA4>dter is to be launched on the market at the end of the year, the EQC of the Stuttgarter 2019.
Both have been officially presented.
BMW’s iNext is not expected to launch until 2021.
The focus in Paris is on the new 3 Series.
In total, more than 250 exhibitors will be represented this year from 4 to 14 October.
In addition to car groups, motorcycle manufacturers as well as numerous mobility service and software providers are present in their own halls.
The trade fair, which this year celebrates its 120th birthday, takes place every two years alternating with the IAA in Frankfurt.
In 2016, more than a million visitors came.
At least 380 people have died on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi in the severe earthquake and tsunami that followed.
Dozens are still missing.
In addition, there are more than 500 injured.
The island was hit by two earthquakes on Friday.
The first quake had a magnitude of 5.9, the second a magnitude of 7.4.
Communication and traffic connections are damaged, there was enormous damage to property.
After the quakes, the tsunami hit the west coast of Sulawesi.
In the coastal town of Palu, hundreds had gathered on the beach for a feast.
It is feared that the number of victims is still going up significantly.
So far, the figures have only come from Palu.
However, numerous other communities are also affected - along Sulawesis' west coast.
About 150 bikers celebrate church service in Werdohl
Motorcycle pastor Frank Schröder (right) from Herne celebrated the closing service for motorcyclists in the Friedenskirche in Eveking with a team of helpers on Sunday.
Werdohl - The square in front of the Friedenskirche in Eveking belonged to the motorcyclists on Sunday.
After all, the final service for the bikers was on the program.
Frank Schröder is the motor pastor within the Evangelical Church of Westphalia and thus responsible for the pastoral concerns of the horsepower-strong two-wheelers.
Between April and September, the traditional motorcycle service (MoGo) always takes place on the last Sunday of a month at Haus Nordhelle.
The end of the season is traditionally celebrated by bikers in the Church of Peace in Eveking.
Around 150 bikers had gathered there on Sunday to perform a service that was anything but ordinary.
From 10 a.m. the cars were lined up in front of the entrance portal of the church.
First the biker breakfast was on the program and it was allowed to be strengthened with coffee and cake or even with a hearty currywurst.
In addition to the MoGo team, the Holy Riders, a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach, were also present.
The sermon was given during the biker service by Pastor Dirk Grzegorek.
Singer-songwriter Valerie Lill provided the musical background.
"Although the bikers prefer the blues-rock, Valerie Lill plays rather poetic-quiet tones," said Father Frank Schröder.
This, too, was certainly a novelty in the history of motorcycle worship yesterday.
Füchtorfer Heimatverein celebrates big party: After the apple comes the milk
And even at the actual day of action, Borisch was active.
She provided her hungry guests with freshly prepared apple pancakes.
Georg Hartmann-Niemerg also aroused great interest.
He had his apple press in his luggage and showed his amazed spectators step by step the process from ripe apple to apple juice.
Every now and then Hartmann-Niemerg gave the children the field and had them fill the apples in the large funnel.
With a little muscle power, the apples became a finely shredded mass.
Not many of the children could imagine how it would become a tasty drink.
But they were also able to take a look at this important work step on this late Friday afternoon.
Packed in moulds and encased in nets, Georg Hartmann-Niemerg stacked the apple pieces layer by layer on top of each other, which looked a bit like chopped goods.
Thanks to a certain amount of technical support, the last step was no longer so difficult.
The freshly squeezed juice gradually ran into a large vessel.
But the Füchtorfer Farmer also had already filled specialties with it.
So he opened his "treasure chest" and presented the latest feather whites to the older visitors.
The demand for the good drop "Made in Füchtorf" was correspondingly high.
In a cozy atmosphere, the parents started talking, while the children could not only follow the process of pressing apples, but also discovered the built-up bouncy castle for themselves.
Active members of the Füchtorfer comradeship of former soldiers also got involved in the festival and invited to entertaining games at some stations.
Also next year, the Heimatverein will offer a day of action.
Then, however, as Gregor Krützkamp emphasized, not the home in the heart of the asparagus village will be the place of the event.
Instead, a farm will be visited.
This is also obvious due to the topic: After all, it will then go around the milk.
1:4 against Frankfurt: Hannover with fourth defeat of the season: "Basic situation"
Frankfurt/Main After the fourth Bundesliga defeat in a row, coach André Breitenreiter gathered his disappointed Hannover 96 pros around him and gave them courage.
However, there was not much positive to see in the 1:4 (0:2) of the last table at Eintracht Frankfurt.
"It's a shitty situation, but you have to get out of there as a team," said 96-football pro Pirmin Schwegler and pushed after: "This is of course disappointing, because you always take a lot of action."
The still winless Lower Saxony, for which only Florent Muslija (86.) came to the conclusion, are with two counters at the very bottom and are in their current constitution a relegation candidate.
Led by the outstanding Ante Rebic, Frankfurt celebrated its first victory of the season.
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute, Rebic (45.+1), Jonathan de Guzm<0xC3><0xA1>n (59.) and Luka Jovic (89.) scored goals in front of 46,300 spectators for the DFB Cup winner, who advanced to the middle of the table with seven points after the successful dress rehearsal for the Europa League match against Lazio Rome.
Croatia's vice world champion Rebic was involved in almost every dangerous offensive action of the Hesse in his starting eleven debut and was never able to get a grip on Hannover's defense.
The striker, who had been battered for a long time after the World Cup, showed with his speed and assertiveness why he is so valuable for Eintracht.
In addition to Rebic, Brazilian Allan, who was loaned out by Liverpool, stood for the first time in the initial formation of the Frankfurters, who started swinging.
A header from Lucas Torr<0xC3><0xB3> (17th) falsified on the goal net brought danger for the first time.
Six minutes later, Sébastien Haller was stopped in a promising position at the last moment by the 96-defence around the Brazilian Felipe, who replaced the short-term Kevin Wimmer (back).
The leadership for the landlords fell almost inevitably and completely deserved.
Filip Kostic lifted the ball into the penalty area after a defensive corner, Haller extended his head in front of the goal, where Ndicka only had to keep his foot.
It was the first Bundesliga goal for the defender who came from the French second division AJ Auxerre in the summer.
And Frankfurt followed even before the break.
This time Haller fitted on his storm partner Rebic, who skilfully refueled and left 96-goal keeper Michael Esser no chance.
At halftime, Hannover coach Breitenreiter reacted to the weak performance of his eleven and brought in Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt two new offensive forces.
The Niedersachsen now played a little more courageously forward, but brilliant ideas remained until shortly before the end, when at least the follow-up hit succeeded.
The Hessians were much more efficient.
After less than an hour, Rebic started a solo and then put across De Guzm<0xC3><0xA1>n, who only had to push the ball into the empty goal.
The rest was only show-running for the Frankfurters against overtaxed guests, Jovic also met one minute before the end.
Morlaixplatz becomes a party mile
Würselen Despite cool temperatures, there was a good atmosphere at the Oktoberfest in the city center.
The mayor of Munich, Dieter Reiter, made it in front of a crowd of millions at the opening of the 185.
Munich Wies'n last week with two strokes.
Geisingen: Geisinger Christians celebrate Holy Cross festival
The Geisinger Catholics celebrate the Feast of the Holy Cross on September 14 or on the Sunday after.
The festive service takes place in the city church, followed by a procession to the Church of the Holy Cross with the final blessing.
The Church of the Holy Cross houses the shot Christ, which dates back to the Thirty Years' War and is said to have been shot by a Swedish soldier.
Blood then flowed from the gunshot wound.
This resulted in a great pilgrimage to the shot Christ, which then also led to the construction of the Church of the Holy Cross.
This is not completed to this day, only the altar room stands, the missing long house is indicated by the trees.
In his homily, Pastor Adolf Buhl reminds us that the cross is a sign of hope, comfort and life.
The service was poorly attended despite the importance for the Geisinger parish.
After the service, the procession to the Church of the Holy Cross took place and with the final blessing, the church part of the Feast of the Cross ended.
For many years now, the Catholic church choir has been inviting the secular part of the festival to the Catholic parish home.
The choir members provided the visitors with hearty food as well as a large selection of cakes and weather adapted, farm ice cream.
In the afternoon the parish offered guided tours around the city church, Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid-Seger informed the visitors on behalf of the parish about the damage to the facade, roof, the sandstone work and windows as well as the upcoming construction measures, which will last until next year.
After the scaffolding has been standing for some time, the damage could be determined more precisely and the individual tenders could be prepared more concretely.
It is certain that the renovation will be more expensive than planned, because the damage already existing a few years ago has become larger, but more has also been established, which was only possible through the inspection by means of scaffolding.
The plinth plastering work has been completed, natural stone works are still to be started before the winter and it is hoped that half of these works will be completed this year.
Inauguration: New residence in the Neu-Ulmer Münsterblickstra<0xC3><0x9F>e
The Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller opens a new dormitory for people with disabilities in Münsterblickstra<0xC3><0x9F>e.
That in the Münsterblickstra<0xC3><0x9F>e now "a very special house" is handed over to its destination - all present were agreed at the inauguration date.
After all, the twelve wheelchair users who have been living in the dormitory of Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller for some time now depend on the special architecture of the new building.
Wider corridors, corridors and doors, larger rooms and barrier-free access for all areas have been taken into account by architect Rudolf Bader in his concept.
The first plans began about eight years ago, when the former officer building of the US Army was put to the test for the residents with Handycap: "The house had aged and no longer contemporary in the equipment," Bader explained in retrospect.
In 2016, the excavators moved in to demolish the house.
The new building should be designed as friendly and bright as possible so that the residents can feel comfortable in it, according to the architect.
Donau-Iller opens new dormitory
Lebenshilfe invested around 4.6 million euros in the new building.
The Free State contributed 2.4 million euros, the district of Swabia 450,000 euros.
According to architect Bader, the construction work has remained within the planned framework - both in terms of time and money.
The managing director of Lebenshilfe, Jürgen Heinz, also thanked him for this.
The balancing act between a barrier-free and at the same time fire-proof construction has not always been easy.
Nevertheless, the planners and craftsmen had built a home with the many specifications that would allow the residents to experience the freedom to move around without the help of others.
Gertrud Kreutmayer, head of the Social Administration of the district of Swabia, said: “The house is oriented towards the special needs of its residents, who need tools to be mobile.”
The comfort and functionality were well combined, said Kreutmayer.
"The property in this location is a real stroke of luck, because it can no longer be acquired in today's situation."
In total, the new dormitory in Münsterblickstra<0xC3><0x9F>e offers space for 30 people with disabilities on almost 1500 square meters, which are divided into three residential groups.
Heinz is proud to be Managing Director of Lebenshilfe for the eleven full-time employees, all of whom are employed on a tariff basis.
Germany: Schwesig laments differences between East and West
Before the Day of Unity, the deputy SPD Federal Chairman Manuela Schwesig appealed to all compatriots not to accept the disadvantage of East Germans.
There are differences that hurt after almost 30 years of unity.
We must not settle for these differences," the Prime Minister of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern told the "Tagesspiegel am Sonntag".
The goal must remain to create a level playing field across the country.
It is unacceptable that East Germans on average work longer than the people in West Germany, but receive 15 percent less salary.
“I can’t explain this to anyone nearly 30 years after German unity,” Schwesig said.
North Korea: Is this cute dog ending the Korean conflict?
The one-year-old Pungsan hunting dog is said to smooth the waves between the two Koreas.
In an effort to relax relations with Seoul, Pyongyang has given the South Korean President Moon Jae In two North Korean Pungsan hunting dogs as a gift.
As Moon's office announced on Sunday, the two about a year-old dogs reached their recipient already on Thursday.
They therefore passed the border town of Panmunjom together with three kilograms of dog food in order to "facilitate the animals' acclimatization".
The dogs with the thick white coat, pointed ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent.
They belong to the national cultural heritage of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
The North had announced the gift of friendship at the third summit this year between Moon and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang in mid-September.
The two countries also agreed to compete together in international sports competitions such as the 2020 Olympic Games and to compete together for the 2032 Olympic Games.
In the course of the mutual rapprochement, Kim also agreed to close the Tongchang Ri test facility for rocket propulsion.
Austria's eventful history in the mirror of 99 documents
What is Austria?
On the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the Republic, which has now been celebrated for almost ten months in this commemorative year, numerous new books have been published, which usually answer this question in retrospect of the past hundred years.
Wolfgang Maderthaner, historian and general director of the Austrian State Archives, puts it quite differently in the magnificent "Picture Book" Austria, which will be published on October 1.
New week, new opportunity for the government
Back to substantive work - that's the unofficial motto for the Grand Coalition's working week beginning today.
Hardly an interview, hardly a speech in which the Chancellor and her ministers from the CDU, SPD and also from the CSU did not mantra-like invoke the "return to substantive work".
This may have led some craftsmen, doctors, cashiers and other working citizens in this country to the legitimate question of what is actually the difference between work and work in kind, but that's about it.
Now that the Federal Government is ready to return to its task of governing, we should not discourage it with debates on concepts.
Whether the Union and the SPD can actually achieve something together after the provocations and embarrassments of the last few weeks, will probably already show Monday.
In the evening, the heads of the governing parties meet for the coalition committee.
Chancellor Angela Merkel now wants to convene this round on a regular basis in order to defuse conflicts at an early stage; a lesson from all the controversy.
First of all, however, the diesel retrofits and the skilled labour immigration law are again on the agenda for conflict-prone topics.
CSU transport minister Scheuer wants the car companies to get away with exchange premiums, the SPD and CDU see the manufacturers in the obligation to technical retrofit older diesel.
While a rapprochement has emerged over the weekend in the diesel crisis, the Union and the SPD are still far apart in the planned skilled labour immigration law.
The SPD calls for a permanent perspective for rejected asylum seekers who work or do an education.
The Union is strongly opposed to the "track change" from the asylum system to the labour market.
So there will be another dispute among the coalition partners - and how could it be otherwise?
Not Gleich und Gleich has joined forces to form the GroKo, but three partners, some of whom have very different views and priorities on society.
Fighting is good.
Without dispute, a society marked by such diverse and sometimes contradictory interests does not progress.
In order to be constructive, however, disputes must not again be bloated on the question of being or not being for reasons of party tactics.
This is still about politics, not theater.
The Union and the SPD should fight – but always have the reality of life in mind.
What is possible and useful to many?
With this guiding question, both the diesel and the lane change question can be clarified pragmatically - and thus regain confidence.
That’s why the people’s parties have to fight now.
Pilz checks working hours at Hartinger
Minister in focus
Does the Minister of Labour, of all things, violate the applicable civil service law?
Daniela Holzinger wants to take a closer look.
"Really day and night" her lawyers had been working on the social security reform, reported an exuberant social minister at the presentation of the same two weeks ago.
The statement of Beate Hartinger-Klein (FP<0xC3><0x96>) comes as a surprise to list mushroom mandataress Daniela Holzinger - she is now bringing the matter to parliament via inquiry.
“The Minister only wanted to express her enthusiasm about the deployment of her team and not to announce violations of applicable service law in front of running cameras.”
Nevertheless, she now has questions to be able to absolve Har tinger "of any suspicion".
Police tear up a street in search of women's bodies
Marxgrün - For a long time, the police did not want to comment on this.
Now there is a confirmation.
Since early Saturday morning is dug on the state road between Naila and Bad Steben.
The line is closed in the Marxgrün area until Monday.
Previously, the investigators had used an archeology dog.
The dog, specially trained for the smell of old human bones, together with its guide in repeated use, was finally able to narrow the relevant spot down to a few meters.
In addition, a soil anomaly was discovered in the area of the said road section together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the highest Bavarian monument protection authority.
For more than a year now, the Public Prosecutor’s Office and the Criminal Police Court have been dealing with the missing person case.
Time and again, a cycle path was closed at Marxgrün and examined with sonar devices, because the investigators suspect that Heike’s body may have been buried here in the course of the new construction of the state road 30 years ago.
Colour powder and eggs: riots in Barcelona ahead of Catalonia anniversary
Monday marks the first anniversary of the controversial independence referendum in Catalonia.
But already there are riots.
The separatists have not forgotten the police operation of autumn 2017.
Barcelona - On the eve of the anniversary of the Catalan independence referendum on 1 October 2017, clashes between separatists and the police broke out in the centre of Barcelona.
Catalan security forces were attacked by supporters of independence with powdered paint, among other things, as they wanted to prevent them from approaching a demonstration by the National Police and the Civil Guard.
Some 3,000 officers from the Polic<0xC3><0xAD>a Nacional and Guardia Civil police units wanted to pay tribute to their colleagues who were in the polling stations at the referendum last year, which was considered illegal.
At that time, violence had also occurred in the attempt to prevent citizens from voting.
Catalan police had formed a chain to keep the separatist and central security forces demonstrations separate, Spanish media reported.
Some of the 6,000 separatists then tried to break the police chain by force, and the officials pelted with paint bags and eggs, among other things.
Six people had been arrested, 24 others were slightly injured, it said, citing the authorities.
Monday marks the first anniversary of the independence referendum.
Following the vote and a subsequent decision to secede the wealthy region from Spain, the central government in Madrid placed Catalonia under coercive administration in the autumn of 2017.
The then regional president Carles Puigdemont fled into exile in Belgium.
Other politicians have also moved abroad.
Several ministers of the former regional government and other activists of the separatist movement, however, remain in custody.
New elections were held in the region in December.
After the new Catalan government took office in May, forced administration was terminated.
But the new regional president Quim Torra also insists on the Catalans' "right to self-determination".
Football: Oberliga Westfalen: FC Gütersloh and RW Ahlen break up goalless
Red-White Eagles are still going strong.
Also at FC Gütersloh it was only enough to a 0-0 draw.
In front of 438 spectators in the Heidewaldstadion, they revealed the final light and the third last one as assembled perplexity.
The first half was very entertaining.
Those who wanted to get a beer or a bratwurst, could do this without worry.
There was no risk of missing out on a chance to score, as there were virtually none.
First shot in half an hour
Gütersloh’s Nick Flock was responsible for the first (harmless) goal of the entire game in the 28th minute.
The best - and in principle the only real - possibility was when Cihan Yilmaz forced FCG goalkeeper Frederic Westergerling to a parade after 32 minutes with a shot from the penalty area.
The hosts were even more innocuous.
Their most effective action was an early change.
Forward Lars Schröder had to be replaced due to injury, for him came Sinan Aygün.
After the change, both teams decided to do something about the increasing boredom.
In the 48th minute, Sebastian Mützel scored from 18 meters just above the case and after an hour, the Gütersloher also appeared offensively for the first time.
After a ball conquest by Matth<0xC3><0xA4>us Wieckowicz it went fast.
The quickly presented counter-offer about Sinan Aygün "crowned" Nick Flock (62nd) with a soft shot in the arms of RWA goalkeeper Bernd Schipmann.
In addition, they trailed with a header from Wieckowicz (66th) after a corner ball from ex-Ahlener Tim Manstein.
RWA interim coach Angelo Daut reacted, first brought Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy (60th) and a little later Enes Güney for Sebastian Mützel (70th).
It worked - nothing.
The Ahleners did not achieve more than optical superiority thanks to their own initiative.
It was only in the 91st minute that Cihan Yilmaz had the last chance, but she didn’t win either.
Angelo Daut then tried to highlight the positives: "I like that we played to zero", but unfortunately the zero was also in front.
"We weren't as dangerous this time as we were against Holzwickede and even though our opponent didn't want to play here," RW Ahlen's interim coach stated.
Offensively, “everything flopped a little bit” against a team that just wanted to defend.
I didn’t feel like we could score a goal,” said Daut.
To his chagrin, however, the spectators did not feel like his team could score a goal.
The performance was too poor for that.
Reckenfelder Erntdankmarkt: Fortunately, there are enough Kreimers
Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler from the Reckenfelder Tafelausgabestelle, for which these donations are intended, are delighted.
The volunteers assure: "These donations also remain in Reckenfeld".
At the opening, the sky was bright blue, but the place was still a bit empty, but that was to change during the day.
Because: "It's so nice sociable here, that's why we're here today," said one visitor.
Organizer of the festival Franz Josef Holthaus welcomed the guests in the Kiepenkerl outfit as always with a good dose of humor.
For the Brockmann couple, who were supposed to be balanced against food, Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer jumped in at short notice.
The Verena (daughter of Ferdi Kreimer) has become ill.
But there are enough Kreimers.
And the "replacement" could not fail to entertain the ever-increasing number of visitors musically in between.
This was so well received that at a later hour some folk songs were sung along.
"Simply great," said Marcel Kreimer.
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to include the opening date in his schedule this time.
He is happy about the many active people with their stands, including mainly clubs.
"Actually, there should be no such thing as a blackboard at all," he nevertheless thanked for the action of the men's choir.
Andreas Hajek praised the commitment of everyone who was on duty at the stands and also included the other festivals that took place in September and the "Clean up" action.
Our garden city gives itself a colorful coat of paint - here's what.
Then the Maikranz was taken off by Georg Knorr and Gerd Klück with the help of the fire brigade and brought to the winter quarter.
Many stalls were worked for physical well-being.
From sweet to hearty was to have everything.
Stefan Hagemeyer, who has only been living in Reckenfeld for a year, got creative with his scroll saw.
Veneer work, beer lid with stretcher panels motifs and much more he had on offer.
Three beekeepers from Reckenfeld offered a speciality: "Reckenfelder Honig", brought by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian Wedershoven and Helen Roth-Buschschlüter.
The latter has a speciality.
Honey cake in the glass, of course with honey from my own production.
Little Elsa had to access again and again, the cake tasted so good.
It is the conviviality that then allowed the visitors to linger long into the evening hours, even without a stage program that does not exist at the autumn festival.
Lubrications with a local political message: No successful advertising for skate facilities
In Lengerich, unknown people have advertised the construction of a skate park in a way that is hardly conducive.
In several places there are corresponding lubrications, says Jürgen Köhne of the city administration at the request of the WN.
In at least one case, a criminal complaint has been filed with the police for property damage.
In large letters, the three words "Skatepark für Lengerich!" are displayed on signs at the Gempt Hall and the Old Town Hall, among others.
Michael Rottmann, manager of the hall, reports that a corresponding lettering had already been discovered on the advertising sign on the stairway to the Gempt bistro after the career fair on 19 September.
Since the short message was apparently left "only" with an edding, it could easily be removed.
"But a few days later it was back there, this time sprayed on," said Rottmann.
He assumes that the corresponding advertising sign must be replaced.
A special note is given to this case by the fact that several large companies from Lengerich are also mentioned on the table.
If the skate facility is built, its realization should also be made possible by sponsors.
There are already promises, explains Jörg Hesselmann from the municipal department School, Sports and Culture, without naming names.
It is quite possible, however, that one or more of the sponsors are identical to those companies that are on the smeared board.
For years, local politics and administration have been dealing with the topic of skating.
After the old one had been dismantled at the LWL-Klinik, the search for an alternative location began after some time.
The majority of the council eventually voted in favour of the fire brigade parking lot.
However, this request was not implemented - too many factors apparently spoke against a construction at this point.
A turnaround followed at the end of June.
The members of the Main and Finance Committee now voted unanimously for the area of the Gutenberg School.
Jürgen Kohne says about the state of affairs that the administration is currently in the middle of the concrete planning.
The city council has the last word.
He assumes a decision this year, so that if a positive vote could be built in 2019.
Air traffic control bottlenecks get worse
Frankfurt/Hamburg After the European aviation chaos in the summer, the German air traffic controllers see no signs of improvement in the coming year.
"This year we had wind, in 2019 we will have strong wind and then the storm comes," Matthias Maas, head of the air traffic control union, told the German press agency ahead of the aviation summit on October 5 in Hamburg.
An important reason for the numerous delays and flight cancellations is the long-known shortage of personnel in European air traffic control, for which there is no quick solution.
“The airlines and airports can achieve rapid improvements for the coming year, but the training of new pilots takes four to five years,” said the trade unionist.
Across Europe, the market for fully trained pilots has been wiped out.
Around a hundred people were missing in the center of Karlsruhe alone to monitor the upper German airspace.
Maas again criticized that various aviation unions were not invited to the summit.
In the Hanseatic city, representatives of the federal government, the L<0xC3><0xA4>nder, air traffic control, the airlines and the airports come together on Friday to address the causes of the delays.
"If you want to talk about additional work compression and overtime, it will not work without us," said the head of the GdF, which has many members at the federally owned German air traffic control.
Maas once again blamed the EU Commission for the pilot miserere.
The traffic forecasts for the regulatory period running until 2019 were far too low.
The resulting cost targets and personnel savings for the national air traffic control systems are now fully reflected in the operational business.
Maas appealed to Federal Minister of Transport Andreas Scheuer (CSU) to work in Brussels for regulations that “do not cut off the air even further” for air traffic control.
Currently, the EU’s targets are to be agreed by 2024 and further tightening is to be expected.
The EU is under constant lobbying pressure from the airlines.
“Ryanair CEO Michael O’Leary and his colleagues are now reaping exactly what they have sown themselves in recent years,” Maas said.
He hopes that the high delay costs of the airlines initiated a rethink.
The GdF will only contribute to the improvement of the situation if the German air traffic control (DFS) offers a "consistent training and future pact", said Maas.
The previously announced intake of 120 pilot students per year over the next five years is just enough to compensate for the age-related departures.
The necessary personnel build-up is not yet connected to this.
Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board votes in favour of corporate restructuring
The members of the Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board voted unanimously in favour of the plans for the restructuring of the Group.
According to the will of Thyssenkrupp interim CEO Guido Kerkhoff, who was appointed Chairman of the Executive Board at the meeting on Sunday, the struggling group is to be split into two independent companies.
Both companies are to be based in Essen and listed on the stock exchange.
There should be no additional reduction in personnel beyond the already known reductions in the administration.
After two resignations, the supervisory board on the capital side has only eight heads.
This is opposed by ten representatives of the employees.
However, the final decision is expected to be made by a general meeting in 2020.
Among other things, the new Thyssenkrupp Materials AG will contain the 50 percent share of the merged steel business with the Indian partner Tata.
In the second company Thyssenkrupp Industrials AG, the business with elevators and subcontracting is to be bundled.
Barcelona: Violence at demonstrations by police officers and Catalan independence advocates.
In two simultaneous demonstrations by Spanish police and Catalan independence supporters in Barcelona, there have been violent clashes with numerous injured.
According to the city administration, about 3,000 police officers from all over Spain gathered on Saturday, as well as about 6,000 supporters of independence demonstrated.
The Catalan police tried with a large contingent to keep the two protest trains away from each other.
According to the forces, however, supporters of independence repeatedly tried to break through the security barrier.
They attacked the officers with paint and shot.
There were, according to the information, also between the participants of the various protest trains.
Rescue workers said 24 people were injured.
Police said there were six arrests.
Better salaries and appreciation of colleagues
With their demonstration, the police wanted to pay tribute to the colleagues who had taken action almost exactly one year ago against the independence referendum in Catalonia, which was banned by the Spanish central government.
At the same time, they demanded better salaries.
Members of the Spanish police and the Guardia Civil find it unfair that Catalan and Basque police officers earn significantly more than they do.
The demonstrators saw it as a provocation that the Spanish policemen were demonstrating in Barcelona of all places.
“Why did they come here to protest?” 55-year-old Catalan protester Manel Perez asked AFP.
Just to provoke and celebrate the fact that they threshed us a year ago.
A 31-year-old police officer from the Balearic Islands, who wanted to give his name only with Daniel, rejected the accusation.
"Of course, we want to support our comrades who did only their duty last year: defend the law," he said.
But the demonstration is there to enforce our rights and we are doing it in Barcelona because this is a big European city and there is more echo here.
He and his colleagues, however, “did not come to provoke,” the policeman assured.
Breakdown allowed access to personal data of British ministers
A security breach in a mobile app has resulted in the personal data of ministers and MPs of the Conservative British Tory party being temporarily accessible to everyone on Saturday.
According to British media reports, several ministers received calls from unknown people after the glitch became known a day before the Tory party convention in Birmingham.
Two people trapped on B217
The Hanover police report on Sunday morning a serious traffic accident on the federal road 217, Hamelner Chaussee, at the exit of Wettbergen in the direction of Ronnenberg.
Two people were killed when they drove their car into a tree.
The car is currently on fire.
The emergency services are on site.

Soccer: Juve coach praises after top game: Ronaldo's best game
The Portuguese star striker “played the best game together with half an hour of Valencia this evening,” praised Juve coach Massimiliano Allegri after the 3:1 (1:1) victory of the record champion against SSC Naples.
For the coach, the expensive star was the decisive man in the important game against the pursuer, even without his own goal.
"Ronaldo had a lot of fun and is doing well," Allegri said.
Even though we started with tactical mistakes, Ronaldo was very good at our first goal - and from that moment on we have grown.
Thanks to Ronaldo's three goals, Juve turned the game after the early back through the goal of Dries Mertens (10th minute) and suspended the worst chaser for the time being.
The goalkeeper, who was picked up by Real Madrid, initially put former Bundesliga professional Mario Mandzukic on the lead with a double pack (26./49.).
And Ronaldo did after a corner per header also the preliminary work to the goal of defense chief Leonardo Bonucci (76.), who just before the goal line only had to push.
"He gives a lot of submissions," the coach praised.
But Allegri also wants to see goals from the attacker, who is the record scorer in both the Champions League and the Portuguese national team.
“We need to be even better at serving him,” the coach said.
Best Juve scorer is currently Mandzukic with four goals - Ronaldo has three in the account.
With the purchase of Ronaldo for more than 100 million euros, the superiority of Juventus seems to be even more overwhelming.
Seven wins in seven games is the flawless series in Serie A. At 21 points, the champion of the past seven years has already six points ahead of Naples.
The second-place coach coached by former Bayer coach Carlo Ancelotti was not without a chance against Turin.
But at the latest after the referee of the already warned Mario Rui (58.) the top game was decided.
The Portuguese had to leave the pitch after a hard start against Paulo Dybala with yellow-red.
"We played well against a good Napoli," said the Turin coach.
Emre Can was also allowed to feel that way.
The German national player has prevailed at Juve.
The professional from Liverpool FC was in use in all seven league games.
The midfielder also played in the Champions League game against Valencia, which Allegri said with the "half hour": Ronaldo had flown off the pitch in the 2-0 victory of the Turiners and is locked for the home game on Tuesday against Young Boys Bern.
Kanye West has changed his name.
With a particularly bizarre appearance, rapper Kanye West has attracted attention on the US TV show "Saturday Night Live" at the weekend.
Among other things, his joint performance with Lil Pump in a mineral water costume caused frowns and question marks among the spectators.
The 41-year-old also announced a name change on time for the release of his new album.
From now on, you may just call him "Ye", according to the musician.
“The creature formerly known as Kanye West,” he tweeted in reference to the late singer Prince as he dropped his stage name.
The pseudonym is not news.
The tenth album was released under this name.
In an interview with the radio station KRRL, the artist had explained that "Ye" has a religious meaning for him.
“I think ‘Ye’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and that’s where it means ‘you.’
Football: Kreisliga A1 Münster: Finally!
Got it!
Hoetmar’s coach Averhage made no secret of his disappointment.
It was a weak game for us today.
The opponent was simply more grippy, we have almost never presented him with problems." Accordingly, the list of Hoetmarer shooting opportunities reads thinly.
Score two goals in 90 minutes, so that you can rarely make games positive.
Football League A1: SC Hoetmar defeated by SG Sendenhorst 0:2 (0:1) Photo: Heinz Schwackenberg
The SG also had only two options in the first round, but the first took advantage of Maik Krause from an acute angle to the early lead (7th).
In the 43rd minute Steffen Uphus could have increased, but after great preliminary work by Krause he snarled free standing.
The hosts only had a double possibility when first Moritz Höne failed to score against Torsteher Jos Schuhmacher and Jan Blome also found his champion in the Sendenhorst keeper.
After the break, the guests became even more dominant and had a number of good chances.
But Uphus (49.), Julian Turl (61,) and Heinz Linnemann (69.) all forgave.
A trade meter - Louis Kortenjann had saved on the goal line with his hand and saw red - Niklas Eilmann could also not use for the guests (75.).
It was only when Nils Berheide crossed the ball over the line that the game was decided (81st).
"We had criticized each other hard before, that was different today than in the last few weeks," was the conclusion of Florian Kraus.
Sendenhorst: J. Schomacher - Linnemann, Scholz, Eilmann, Mey, Kraus, Krause (77th Berheide), L. Hartleif, Uphus, Abu Dalal (90th Leibig), Turl.
Goals: 0:1 Krause (7.), 0:2 Berheide (81.).
Red card: Kortenjann (75./Hoetmar).
Football: Kreisliga A2 Münster: Spectacle football in Albania: GW Albersloh defeated Concordia 3:4
“I don’t know what to think about that,” he said.
"We didn't get any access to them", he said, presumably the wing pliers with Colby McGill and Janis Kroeger, but also all other green-whites who stood out with collective offensive drive.
He could still laugh: "A dirty victory," he said, winking cheekily and pulling away from his players, on the other hand, was the relief to note that they had pulled out of the affair with three points.
Mind you, after a duel between two teams, one of which, namely Albanians, is playing for the championship and the other, Albersloh, is fighting for class survival.
With mixed feelings, GWA coach Sven Lewandowski looked back at the 90 minutes that lay behind him.
“That was by far our best season performance,” he says.
"How we come back after the 0:2 as we hold against one of the league's top teams over the entire season, that was really phenomenal".
All the more bitter it seems that you now have to go home empty-handed.
Top scorer Lars Zymner put the hosts in the lead with his 12th goal of the season (24th).
He needed exactly two ball contacts in this game for this goal.
Fabian Fröhning (39.) put the 2-0 on the left side.
We knew that, but you can’t take such a player out completely.
"That was already insane, what he did," Lewandowski enviably acknowledged the quality of the opponent.
Shortly before the side change, his own eleven managed to equalize: McGill's free kick from the left sailed between Hövelmann and Concordia goalkeeper Hinkerohe into the long toreck (45.).
After the change of sides, it was McGill again who achieved the equalization (59.).
Then it went back and forth.
It was a tough, action-packed game.
Nübel shocked Albachten again (64th), only five minutes later Patrick Horstmann compensated (69th).
Despite the majority Albersloh was unable to counter the last Concordia hit (80th) again.
We must now focus our full attention on Wednesday.
"The game against sheepdogs, that's what we have to win now," Lewandowski said.
Albersloh: Spangenberg - Hecker, Strohbücker, Adolph, Zur Mühlen - Kröger (87th Diallo), P. Horstmann, Thale, McGill - Hövelmann, Bonse (87th Bareksai).
Goals: 1:0 Zymner (24.), 2:0 Fröhning (39.), 2:1 McGill (45.), 2:2 McGill (59.), 3:2 Nübel (64.), 3:3 P. Horstmann (69.), 4:3 Jülkenbeck (80.).
Yellow-red: Atalan (74./Albachten).
Football: TSV Stra<0xC3><0x9F>berg scores points against Primus
There was no winner in the Landesliga duel between TSV Stra<0xC3><0x9F>berg and FV Biberach.
The leader of the table had actually arrived for three points, but the team of coach Oliver Pfaff stood very well and in the end the game ended 0-0.
Media: The entire board of Dynamo Dresden resigned
According to media reports, the entire executive committee of football second division club Dynamo Dresden has resigned.
Several media in the evening unanimously appealed to a joint letter of the body of the Saxons.
There was no confirmation from the club at first.
The reason for the withdrawal should be internal power struggles at the former Bundesliga.
Erdogan in Germany: Politics instead of pomp
I'm glad he's gone.
There are only a few state guests whose departure in Germany provides as much relief as that of Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
For three days, the Turkish president was a guest in Berlin and Cologne, and many had thought that he should not have been invited at all.
Evangelische Akademie Tutzing: Prominent guests and new offers
The Evangelische Akademie Tutzing offers about 80 conferences until the middle of next year.
Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron has signaled that he wants to personally collect the price of tolerance in Tutzing.
For Christian Wulff, the term of office was too short: as Federal President, he was not in Tutzing’s Evangelical Academy.
But before and after, Wulff was a guest there.
For example, Academy Director Udo Hahn counted him in when he proudly said: "All Federal Presidents and Chancellors have already been with us." The fact that celebrities appear at the Academy in Tutzing Castle again and again, but was also an issue in the presentation of the annual program.
At the end of October, songwriter Konstantin Wecker takes part in a conference on spiritual experience in a philosophical perspective, on September 29 the writer Frido Mann is at a conference about his grandfather Thomas Mann.
Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron has also promised: He wants to personally accept the "Tolerance Prize" awarded to him by the Academy in Tutzing, which in another category also receives television presenter Dunja Hayali (we reported).
The approximately 80 conferences by mid-2019 have it all in themselves.
"The pension is just not safe!" is stated in a conference title.
"SOS at Europe's borders" - this is how the Academy describes the "risky and deadly route across the Mediterranean".
"And to a meeting on Syria: 'Barbarism without limit'".
Weapons deals, destruction, torture, death - the war derides every humane idea".
The spectrum ranges from structural racism in society to the gap between rich and poor to the radical change in work through digitization.
Academy director Hahn was convinced: "A free democracy needs places where a civil society can come together to look for solutions or at least partial solutions."
At a conference of 200.
Karl Marx’s birthday will soon see more visitors to the direction of criticism of capitalism, while the others expect a tendency “from the left to the middle”.
What about neutrality?
"We are 100 percent a daughter of the Evangelical State Church," said study leader Dr. Ulrike Haerendel, "so we are not 100 percent neutral."
Music cabaret: Gender understanding with heart - Wolbeck - Westf<0xC3><0xA4>lische Nachrichten
"Suitable for both adults and men" was the musical cabaret with Tina Teubner on Friday evening in the hall of the Christuskirche in Wolbeck.
As a cabaret artist, Teubner made a commitment to gender understanding, not only with humor and warmth of heart for the (felt) woman and the (felt) man and what else there may be, but also with music.
She used the mini-guitar and also mastered her violin.
On the wing was Ben Süverkrüp.
He is on the one hand the male sparring partner, who sometimes also comes to words until the end of the movement, on the other hand a true pianist: Süverkrüp Teubner accompanies him so congenially harmoniously that some may have wished for a solo.
There was, too, with Beethoven and Chopin, but in a different way, namely, as it fitted the red thread of the evening.
Teubner had brought a paradox into play: The satisfaction of a man comes when he has a partner, but she does not open the door.
A closed door without a partner, on the other hand, does not bring any benefit.
The piano solo now demonstrates the same: What would have emerged from Mozart’s composing if “das Nannerl” had unexpectedly opened the door?
Thus, Süverkrüp glides over in improvisations, from Bach's "O Haupt voll Blut und Wounden" into the "Lied vom Tod", and from Mozart's G minor Symphony into a playful little dance.
There was great applause and "Bravo" from the full hall.
Flowers were presented by Karlheinz Kleintje, treasurer of the association, the chansonette.
But Chairman Heidemarie Markenbeck did not accept an additional thanks.
She had the idea to give the duo not only performances in Stuttgart and Frankfurt but also one in Wolbeck.

After a bus accident on the A5 in Baden-Württemberg, the police corrected the number of victims slightly downwards.
Ten passengers were slightly injured instead of 15.
Everyone has since been released from the hospital.
The French bus driver had stayed in the hospital for one night for observation.

The cause of the long-distance bus accident at Bruchsal is still unclear.
The long-distance bus had crashed head-on against a guardrail on Saturday morning.
Handball: Damen-Landesliga: Ahlener SG keeps the white vest against TV Wattenscheid
The Ahlen women had problems especially with the third-league player Carolin Stallmann, who alone marked ten goals.
"Actually, I was happy with the defense, only one player scored too many goals.
We did not get a grip on them," said ASG coach Dogan Aydogdu.
But he was more annoyed by the many missed opportunities.
This time, his team missed the focus of the final.
As a result, the ASG trailed almost to the end with a gap of 11:12 and later with 15:18 (45.) in the back.
It was only towards the end that the wider bank of the hostesses made a decisive impact.
In addition, Aydogdu put back room Merle Klement on left wing, who then made "extremely clever the decisive goals" (Aydogdu).
ASG: Buschkötter, Bolte - Bruland (2), Pumpe, Exner, Klement (5), Colbatzky (5/3), Drewes (1), Schlautmann (1), Deventer (6), Baer (1), C. Fitzek, Ruschhaupt (4), S. Fitzek.
Volleyball: 3rd League Women: Top performance of BSV Ostbevern in the top match at VC Allbau Essen
Thanks to a top performance in the top game, the volleyball players of BSV Ostbevern have once again established themselves in the top group of the 3rd Liga West.
The Blau-Wei<0xC3><0x9F>en won with 3:1 in the second division relegation VC Allbau Essen.
“It was a big step for a cool season.
It makes Lenz to play in the top third of the league.
We have now worked that out," said coach Dominik Münch after an almost impeccable performance of his team at the fallen leader of the standings.
The first pass was dominated by the guests almost at will.
Over 4:1, 16:10 and 22:12 he went with 25:15 to the vice-champion of the previous year.
Food has accepted in the double-bar, but has not come into play.
We've been busy with them.
Our opponent hit with high risk, but also produced several tickets.
In the second set, the BSV already led with 12:8. "Essen has switched the assumption to three-bar.
We couldn’t keep up the pressure.
Food has sucked in, and we have let ourselves be lulled a bit," Münch continued.
At 18:17, the volleyball players from the Ruhr region were the first to have the lead.
Although Ostbevern fought off four set balls at the 19:24, the fifth attempt found its goal.
"The game was now a class better," said the trainer to the rising level.
Maike Rüdingloh and finally Wiebke Silge contributed significantly to the BSV turning the sheet in the third section from 14:16 to 25:21.
Münch: "We played consistently and calmly".
About 7:3 and 15:13 the blue-and-white passage brought four with 25:22 to their side.
Vera Horstmann was voted the most valuable player, but Maren Flachmeier also had an excellent day.
BSV women: Eggenhaus, Rüdingloh, Lea and Anna Dreckmann, Auen, Flachmeier, Mersch-Schneider, Silge, Horstmann, Roer.
International: Turkish community: Mosque opening as a missed opportunity
The Turkish Community in Germany (TGD) has criticized the way the grand Ditib Mosque in Cologne was inaugurated by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
"The opening of the mosque in Cologne has left a pile of pieces in the German-Turkish relationship, which can only be painstakingly turned together," said the chairman of the TGD, Gökay Sofuoglu, the editorial network Germany.
Both the Turkish and German sides had missed the chance to perform together in a conciliatory manner.
“Instead of underlining the Muslims’ affiliation with Germany alongside German leaders, Erdogan used the date for his purposes,” Sofuoglu said.
The extensive exclusion of the German public has "encouraged many reservations".
Heimatverein Nottuln: Offer has already been established
After the long summer break is finally Folktreff time again.
On 18 October (Thursday) at 7.30 p.m., the Heimatverein Nottuln organizes its fifth Nottuln Folktreff in the fireplace room of the Alte Amtmannei.
Almost exactly to the day it was a year ago that we held a Folktreff for the first time.
In the meantime, this event has become an integral part of the musical events calendar in Nottuln," says Hanns Moormann, chairman of the Nottulner Heimatverein.
I would not have thought that our Folktreff would be blowing so fast in Nottuln eta.
Whether Sturmtief Friederike in January or heat wave in July, the fireplace room of the Amtmannei was always fully occupied.
"The program at the next Folktreff is, as always, a colorful mixture of German folk, hiking and sailor songs, folk songs, evergreens and old hits," says Karl-Heinz Stevermüer, who repeatedly invites fellow musicians to Nottuln.
For the first Folktreff-"Birthday" Klaus Spellmeyer has promised with his accordion.
For many years he was a member of "Gaitling", a group from the neighbouring district of Steinfurt that played music with Low German lyrics.
Now he's on the road with an Irish folk band.
The makers of the Folktreff like to remember the last event in the summer, when Christoph Schulz of the Folktreff Emsdetten with his international version of the song "Frösche in der Nacht" excited the listeners and sent them home with a worm of the ear.
"We expect many happy guests to spend a sociable and humorous evening once again," says the invitation of the Heimatverein.
Anyone who plays an instrument and wants to get involved is invited to participate.
Since the coveted seats are always occupied quickly, it is advisable to be there in time.
The Folktreff starts at 7.30 pm, but admission is already at 7 pm.
China approves planned merger of Linde and Praxair
For legal reasons, all open questions must be resolved by October 24.
FrankfurtLinde and Praxair are taking another step forward on their way to becoming the world’s largest industrial gas group.
The Chinese competition authority has approved the proposed merger, Linde said on Sunday.
As a result, the billion-dollar merger is still subject to approvals in South Korea and - as the biggest hurdle - in the US.
According to an insider, the chances of gaining approval there had recently improved, because Linde has pledged to sell additional company parts.
For legal reasons, all outstanding issues must be resolved by October 24 in order for the merger to succeed.
From pure fruit cultivation to ecology
The 125th anniversary of the Kreisverband für Gartenbau und Landespflege was celebrated with a gala in the Dr. Stammberger Hall.
On September 29, 1893, the last founding impulses for the Kulmbach Horticulture and Landespflege district association were set with a fruit show in the Kulmbacher Vereinshaus, and exactly 125 years later he celebrated a great anniversary on Saturday evening in the Kulmbacher Stadthalle.
Of course, at that time it was still called differently: as "Bezirksobstbauverein Kulmbach Stadt und Land" (district fruit building association Kulmbach city and country) he was christened by Mayor Wilhelm Flessa in 1893.
The purpose of the fruit growing association also differed from today's work - it was actually purely about fruit growing, nobody thought about flowers and horticulture at that time.
"At that time, in the era of the Enlightenment, the fruit tree was a favorite child of the elites," said Günter Dippold, a resident of the district.
Fruit trees should line highways, in schools so-called industrial gardens were created.
Fruit cultivation is still the task of the 55 horticultural associations in the district of Kulmbach, which comprise almost 7000 members.
But the spectrum is far from exhausted.
Close-to-nature horticulture, biological crop protection, village beautification and nutrition play just as important a role as imparting knowledge, a healthy diet and youth work.
The members of the Hutschdorf youth group "Mouls" showed how versatile the responsibilities of a horticultural association are on stage in an entertaining way.
"Youth work is urgently needed, especially in the digital age," said Günter Reif, chairman of the district council, and OB Henry Schramm also stressed how important experiences in nature are for life.
The chestnut picking was a huge thing for us children, I doubt that you can collect a similar amount of pleasure with Smartphone & Co..
Schramm promised to plant two trees together with district administrator Klaus Peter Söllner for the anniversary.
"Where they should stand, the district association decides," added District Councillor Söllner, highlighting the special importance of the horticultural associations for the villages.
The district association stands for ecology, beauty of the garden and green areas in the village.
That this is a real concern of the many horticultural associations in the district, also county manager and specialist consultant Friedhelm Haun left no doubt.
He guided the many visitors with a lecture through the long history of the district association and reported, among other things, on the need for self-sufficiency after the war.
In the past, everything came from the garden, for the winter it was stowed.
At the end of the 50s, however, the garden turned into an ornamental and residential garden.
"Nature has stood the test of time, it was already there before us and we must orientate ourselves to it," argued the expert for fruit and nut trees.
Therefore, there is an incentive for the horticultural associations not to let up so that our homeland remains beautiful and livable.
This also includes welcoming the new citizens to our associations, added Wolfram Vaitl, President of the Bavarian State Association.
"We have to stop the blatant decline in insects, we owe it to our children and grandchildren," Günter Reif concluded the successful ceremony, which was solemnly framed by the tower blowers of the Musikverein Thurnau.

Priority for NAFTA talks: Canada’s Foreign Minister delivers UN speech
Mexico’s government wants clarity on NAFTA: they provide an ultimatum to both trading partners for an agreement.
Canada’s foreign minister now gives absolute priority to the trade agreement – and postpones her speech to the United Nations.
Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland has postponed her speech at the UN General Debate in New York because of the time pressure in the struggle for a new edition of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with the United States and Mexico.
Instead of this Saturday, the minister will only speak to the United Nations General Assembly on Monday, her spokesman Adam Austen said.
In the meantime, she focuses on the renegotiation of NAFTA.
Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo said on Friday that Canada and the United States would have 48 hours to agree if Canada wanted to join the trade agreement already reached between his country and the United States.
In August, the US and Mexico agreed on a recast of the NAFTA regional free trade agreement.
US President Donald Trump indicated that Canada could be excluded from NAFTA in the future.
Talks about a new edition have been going on for over a year.
They should now be brought to a conclusion by Sunday evening (local time), and Trump’s government wants to submit the agreement to the US Senate before October 1.
Mexico’s President-elect, Andres Manuel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador, announced on Friday that he would seek a bilateral agreement with Canada.

Protests against presidential candidate Bolsonaro
Brazilian presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro, who was injured in a knife attack, has left the hospital.
The far-right ex-military wanted to fly according to a report of the daily "O Globo" to R<0xC3><0xAD>o de Janeiro, where he lives.
After his release, it is still unclear whether the 63-year-old will make public appearances in the South American country in the last week before the presidential elections.
The politician had been attacked in early September during an election campaign event in southern Brazil on the open road.
Meanwhile, thousands of people took to the streets in several Brazilian cities to demonstrate against Bolsonaro.
Under the title "Ele n<0xC3><0xA3>o" (in German: "Der nicht"), women's associations in particular had called for protests against the ex-military.
In the social networks, the associations also mobilized racist and women-in contempt statements against Bolsonaro.
Several thousand demonstrators were expected in the economic metropolis of S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo.
In the capital Brasilia, the protests mixed with a rally of the presidential candidate of the Brazilian Workers’ Party (PT), Fernando Haddad.
He replaced former President In<0xC3><0xA1>cio Lula da Silva, who had been sentenced to 12 years in prison for corruption and is therefore not allowed to run for office.
Brazil’s presidential election is on October 7.
As ex-mayor of the metropolis of S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo, Haddad was far behind the far-right candidate Bolsonaro in polls so far.
The "Trump of Brazil" has been involved in politics for a long time, but has recently presented itself as an anti-system candidate.
If none of the candidates achieves an absolute majority in the first round of voting, there will be a runoff election on October 28.
Observers assume that Bolsonaro will not emerge from this successfully - no matter who he competes against.
Bolsonaro is known for inciting against homosexuals and blacks and glorifying the military dictatorship (1964-1985).
Again and again he is shocked with verbal derailments.
Another time, he said, supporters of Lula’s left-wing Workers’ Party should be shot.
Europe to reclaim Ryder Cup title
Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines - Just an hour away from Disneyland, the European golfers have written another Ryder Cup fairy tale just outside Paris.

After a long illness: Danish rock legend died
Danish rock icon Kim Larsen has died.
The singer died on Sunday at the age of 72 after a long illness, said his producer Jörn Jeppesen on Larsen's website.
On his deathbed, Larsen was surrounded by his wife and six children.
The musician had been in treatment for prostate cancer since the beginning of the year.
Larsen had become known with the band Gasolin', which was enormously successful in Scandinavia in the 1970s.
Their songs were influenced by international music greats such as Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan and the Beatles.
After the band's dissolution in 1978, Larsen was successful as a solo artist.
He sold about three million records in Denmark.
His 1983 album "Midt om natten" is still the best-selling album in Denmark.
Danish Prime Minister Lars Lökke Rasmussen praised Larsen on Sunday in a statement as a "street boy" who was "against everything, but in all hearts."
The head of government also recalled that the monarchy's opponent Larsen had appeared in 2010 on the 70th birthday of the Danish Queen Margrethe II.
Rock night in the shoe factory: volume at the pneumatic hammer level
"Here we stand, take the bone saw and light a concert evening with the power of a tiger" Alone the band names of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" suggest such a description of the rocking live music experience on Saturday evening in the hall of the Bürgerzentrum Schuhfabrik: pure hard rock by three other bands with a friend.
After the sound check and shortly before the start of the concert, the musicians even take time for a group photo.
There is no trace of lamp fever.
After that, the rock protagonists from Ahlen and the surrounding area - all in association with the booking agency "Mosquito" from Oelde - inspire the approximately 120 visitors of the "Mint Mosquito" rock night visibly with their bands.
The quartet "Tiger Bonesaw" with frontman and guitarist Dennis Hadrika already knows how to convince at the beginning of the concert evening with the latest, unknown pieces of their own accord and the soon-to-be-released CD.
In front of the stage, the band dances to the harmonious and powerful interaction during the performance.
Although "Zugabe" calls cannot be overheard, "Tiger Bonesaw" then leaves the stage to the trio "Here We Stand".
The fact that hard rock is not just hard rock is demonstrated by guitarist Sascha Bregenhorn, Golo Meierhenrich on bass and drummer Kai Hölscher with their alternative sounds, sometimes reminiscent of classic rock of the 1970s.
After the "High Energy Rock" of the "Tigers" a synthesizer is used in "Here We Stand" in addition to the guitar rock.
Not only the yearning, almost ballad-like "Take Me Home" captivates by the change from melodic passages to the guitar-heavy rock riffs of the multi-layered songs.
The quartet "The Ignition" from Tönnish<0xC3><0xA4>uschen has gained a special reputation since its foundation in 2005.
Full of agility, the band presents their hard rock on Saturday.
That "The Ignition" with their performances in front of a very large audience - recently documented in a film by Max Meis about the tour in China from 2017 - has special stage experience is obvious and unmistakable.
Singer and guitarist Tim Jungmann sets his own accents in cooperation with the band even with the only covered song of the evening, "Word Up" by Cameo from the 80s.
In the meantime, guitarist Norbert Brinkmann delivers a highly acclaimed solo to the sound, which feels even higher than before, whereby he runs through the audience.
A certain volume is of course part of the genre due to such a hard rock concert: At the "Mint Mosquito" rock night, according to the mixing console team, the three-piece concert of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" is about 98 decibels.
This is, for example, at the pneumatic hammer level, but is thus still well below the controls of the "Wacken-Fesitvals", to which "The Ignition" on their website point.
A deafening 120 decibels in jet drive volume as usual at the annual Metal-Stelldeine in the north of the Republic, the Ahlen audience does not need this rock night, however.
After almost four hours, the three bands of the harder, rockier gait have long since convinced with their sovereign, virtuoso playing and their own compositions.
"Here we stand, have taken the bone saw and ignited a concert evening with the power of a tiger," can all three groups, of course in the figurative sense, say in the end.
And above all enjoy the great applause of the visitors.

One dead in glider crash at Essen/Mülheim airport
There was a fatal accident at Mülheim/Essen Airport.
A glider crashed in a parking lot at Mülheim/Essen Airport on Sunday.
The pilot died in the accident.
A fatal accident occurred near Mülheim/Essen Airport on Sunday.
As the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" reports, a glider crashed in the exhibition parking lot at the airport.
The pilot was killed.
As the "WAZ" further reports, the flight student was alone on board - the plane is supposed to be a single-seater.
The plane was already in approach at the time of the accident.
The crash site is located not far from a marquee on the airport grounds.
But since this weekend an Oktoberfest is taking place.
Mülheim/Essen Airport is located on the city border of the two Ruhr district cities and directly at the entrance to the Autobahn 52.
From the car park there is a Park&Ride offer at major events in the Messe Essen or the Gruga Hall in Essen.
Trump says Kim "and then we fell in love"
It is no secret that US President North Korea’s leader Kim is quite well-intentioned despite the nuclear crisis.
Now, however, Trump has made a real declaration of love to his colleague.
It also has to do with Kim’s “beautiful letters.”
At the tender age of 72, the married US president has committed to a new flame.
The tragic thing is that it is a long-distance relationship.
In public, Donald Trump made an unusual declaration of love to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on Saturday.
In front of supporters in the US state of West Virginia, Trump found almost tender words for the half-so-old offspring of the ruling dynasty from Pyongyang, although in the struggle for North Korea’s nuclear disarmament, it turns out to be quite a tough chunk.
“I was tough, so was he, and between us it was going back and forth,” Trump said.
And then we fell in love.
Okay, okay.
No, really.
And it wasn’t just the conversations with Kim that made his heart melt.
He wrote me beautiful letters, they were great letters.
Her personal connection has also borne fruit politically: Trump referred to the stop of all nuclear and missile tests announced by Kim, even if critics behind it so far see little more than lip service.
That the affection for the infamous "Rocket Man" - so Trump's nickname for Kim - should not be remembered by everyone, seemed to the US president quite aware.
In any case, he anticipated the expected criticism of this during his appearance in a large sports hall in the city of Wheeling: "Donald Trump says they have fallen in love".
How terrible, how terrible is that?
This is so unpresidential.
Trump then pointed his finger at the crowd: “I’ve always told you it’s so easy to be presidential.”
But then out there wouldn’t be 10,000 people pushing into this crowded arena, we’d only have 200 people standing outside.
Oktoberfest attracts many guests to Baesweiler
Baesweiler Well-visited, atmospheric and on top of that pampered by sun: very varied and with a good shot of Oktoberfest flair, Baesweiler's city center has dressed up on Sunday.
For the first time, the Oktoberfest took place not only in the marquee at the fire brigade tower, but was extended by the trade association on Sunday to the city.
Refugees rescued from Libyan prison thanks to video
Nigerian refugees have used a mobile phone video to point out their catastrophic detention conditions in Libya and thus make their rescue possible.
The group had filmed the recording in their cell in the coastal town of Sawija in July under mortal danger and spread it online.
“They refuse to send us back,” said a man in the video message.
We suffer here, we die here.
The recording was sent to the website "France 24 Observers", whose editors alerted the International Organization for Migration (IOM).
The refugees were finally flown out to Nigeria at the end of August.
“Without the video, we probably wouldn’t have been able to return to Nigeria,” Efe Onyeka, who recorded the video, told AFP.
The 25-year-old was arrested in Libya while attempting to cross the Mediterranean to Europe.
With the video he put himself, according to his own statement, in danger of life.
One of his comrades was beaten to death by the guards, Onyeka said.
In general, the prison conditions were disastrous: "They beat us all with pipes and sticks."
They gave us nothing to eat, we had to drink from the latrine.
The IOM organises the voluntary return of refugees stranded in Libya.
Some 2,700 migrants from Nigeria were sent back to their homes this year with the help of the program, said the IOM spokesman in the West African country, Jorge Galindo.
The case of the now rescued Nigerians is not exceptional in view of the poor prison conditions in Libya.
He has not yet heard of a call for help via mobile video.
International organizations have long criticized the conditions in the Libyan refugee camps as inhumane.
The North African state, which is largely dominated by militias, is the main transit country for migrants on their way from Africa to Europe.
When a teacher went to the elementary school site on Sunday afternoon to prepare her classes for Monday, she surprised a burglar.
Around 4:50 p.m., the teacher entered the building via the main entrance.
In the front of the first floor, she saw a man who fled immediately.
First through a door, then over the roof terrace and from there via a staircase to the ground floor or the forecourt.
The teacher informed the police, who initiated the investigation.
Whether things or money were stolen, can not be said yet.
16 years old, black, very short hair, slightly darker appearance, dark pants, dark T-shirt.
Please contact the Obernberg am Inn Police Inspectorate, phone number 059 133 4244.
The German was trapped in his own car for days.
A 75-year-old man had to stay in his car for several days and nights in a forest area in central Franconia, after he had stuck the car off all forest paths and a tree blocked the car door.
Rescuers discovered the car on Saturday afternoon by chance not far from a pasture and freed the missing since Tuesday evening, the police said on Sunday.
The 75-year-old from Pleinfeld was in good health despite the cold nights and the long time without care.
He said he was looking forward to his home.
The pensioner had been reported missing by his family after not returning from a drive in his off-road vehicle over the local meadows and fields on Tuesday.
Despite intensive search measures, the whereabouts of the man had remained unclear for days.
Laschet urges rule of law in Turkey
Cologne NRW Prime Minister Armin Laschet (CDU) has in conversation with the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, according to its own statements, the rule of law in Turkey.
The two countries' relations are currently "overshadowed," Laschet said on Saturday after a meeting with Erdogan at Cologne Airport.
This mainly concerns waves of arrests, freedom of the press and freedom of religion.
“I made it clear to Erdogan that if relations are to normalize in the future, if economic relations are to be deepened, that the rule of law is a very important prerequisite for this,” he said.
Laschet said he also spoke about the cases of Germans who are in prison in Turkey.
He expressed the expectation that freedom of expression would be respected.
Erdogan reiterated his support for the independence of the Turkish judiciary.
The meeting between Laschet and Erdogan had been moved to a building of flight readiness of the Federal Ministry of Defense at Cologne Airport at short notice.
Originally it was supposed to take place at Wahn Castle - but the castle owners had rejected this out of political conviction against Erdogan.
After the meeting, Erdogan travelled on to the opening of the Ditib Mosque in Cologne.
Laschet had cancelled a joint appearance in the building.
But he said, "The Muslims who go to this mosque are also citizens of our country."
And we are also their point of contact - and not the Turkish president.
Lack of confidence in the US: North Korea calls for disarmament
While U.S. President Trump never tires of emphasizing the success of the negotiations on the denuclearization of North Korea, the East Asian regime is more sober about the circumstances.
Foreign Minister Ri calls for Washington to come to terms with this.
North Korea’s Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has accused the US government of blocking negotiations for a nuclear-weapon-free Korean peninsula with its continuing sanctions during the UN general debate.
“The recent stalemate comes from the U.S. building on coercive measures that are deadly to confidence building,” Ri said in New York.
Disarmament is inconceivable for North Korea in these circumstances.
“Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances, there is no way that we will be the first to disarm ourselves,” he said.
That punitive measures could force North Korea to “knee” is “a dream of people who don’t know us.”
In order to build trust, however, his country stopped its nuclear and missile tests and destroyed a nuclear test facility, Ri emphasized.
However, there were no "appropriate reactions" from the US side, the minister criticized.
Because of North Korea’s nuclear and missile program, the UN Security Council had decided on sanctions against the internationally isolated country three times last year alone.
US President Donald Trump and his Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have urged strict adherence to punitive measures at the United Nations in recent days.
At the same time, the US government is working on a rapprochement.
In June, Trump met North Korean leader Kim Jong Un for the first time.
After the first summit in Singapore, the US president is aiming for a second summit with Kim.
Pompeo is scheduled to return to Pyongyang in October to discuss ending North Korea’s nuclear weapons program.
The HoT serves: New cuisine with donations from the community
That they were actually in a youth gathering, the many visitors of the open house HoT got nothing from it: white blankets and flower decorations on the tables and a large buffet were waiting for the guests after the Thanksgiving service.
The young people of the HoT had conjured up the buffet with delicacies from different countries in the new kitchen.
The institution was financed by donations from the community, for which the young people wanted to thank with the food.
The start with the new facility was not easy, as Henriette Westbuer, the head of the HoT, remembers.
We had our fridges filled with food and ingredients before the summer break and were well prepared for the big day.
But then, on the first day after the summer break, the bad surprise came: a power failure had put the huge, two-part refrigerator out of operation, the food was spoiled and had to be disposed of.
"Now we had to start all over again: We got a lot of support from friends and neighbors, but the children and young people wanted to make it alone," Westbuer said.
And that's how everyone got involved.
The result could be seen, the guests were enthusiastic.
“Cooks can’t do better either,” a visitor said, while Hokkaido pumpkin soup was served or guests were allowed to serve quiche, liver cheese or cake.
"It's really great what the children and young people have put on their feet," emphasized pastor Frank Beckmann, while magician Stephan Lammen with card tricks and other feats caused astonishment.
Jürgen Sator leaves the State Board of Management of North Rhine-Westphalia
Out of frustration with criticism from his own ranks, the head of the Essener Tafel, Jörg Sartor, resigned his post in the national association.
Sartor had become known nationwide because the Essener Tafel had introduced a reception stop for foreigners.
He had already resigned in July as vice-chairman of the NRW boards, Sartor told the "Welt am Sonntag".
Too many fell in my back.
The head of the Tafeln-Landesverband NRW, Wolfgang Weilerswist, expressed his understanding of the decision of his long-standing deputy to the dpa.
Sartor took the harsh criticism with him.
"I can understand his move - there were people who did not know exactly why the Essener Tafel does this".
But Sartor is still active for the Essener Tafel - "six days a week, nothing changes," says Weilerswist.
In the "Welt am Sonntag", Sartor again criticized colleagues from other panels.
We should not take the approach of "without us, the people of the city will starve to death."
It is the responsibility of the state to ensure that people do not starve to death.
The Essener did not participate in a conference of the Tafeln on Friday in Berlin.
“I’m being told too much sweet cuddly,” he said.
There are all these social fuzzies who criticized me at the time.
SF Lorch lose 2-0 lead - Gmünder Tagespost
Football, Bezirksliga Lorch lose against Neuler 2:3 - TV Heuchlingen wins in Kirchheim after falling behind - Bettringen beats Lauchheim clear.
With 2-0 Lorch was already in the lead in the home game against TV Neuler - in the end it was 2:3 and the disappointment with the sports friends was great.
Quite different from the TV Heuchlingen: In Kirchheim, the TVH quickly fell behind with 0:1, but after 90 minutes won with 2:1.
Gladbach loses two-time lead - Schalke without Embolo with first victory
Borussia Mönchengladbach have to wait for an away win in Wolfsburg.
In 2:2 the foals lose a lead twice.
Schalke comes against Mainz to the first victory of the season (1:0).
(sda) Four times Schalke has manoeuvred in the first five league games with early goals in the offside.
Now the Domenico Tedesco team has once again demonstrated the strength with which it had taken first place behind Bayern last season.
Alessandro Schöpf led the home team in the eleventh minute after strong preliminary work by Yevgeny Konoplyanka per head, as a result the hosts preserved the mini cushion with a compact defensive performance.
Thanks to an extraordinary comeback, Borussia Dortmund greets again from the top of the Bundesliga.
The team of Lucien Favre against Bayer Leverkusen had a 0:2 deficit until the break, but came in the 2nd half still to the 4-2 victory.
Jacob-Bruun Larsen (65th) and Marco Reus (69th) equalised with a doublette within four minutes, Paco Alcacer, who was substituted by Favre in the 63rd minute, provided with another doublette in the final phase (86th/94th) for the crowning conclusion of the performance increase after the break.
VfB Stuttgart also scored their first victory.
Against Werder Bremen, who had already been decimated before the break because of a yellow-red card against Milos Veljkovic, the Stuttgart team had to fear in the meantime.
Borna Sosa and the inattentive goalie Ron-Robert Zieler fabricated a curious throw-in owner’s goal that helped the guests to compensate in the 68th minute.
Seven minutes later, Gonzalo Castro led VfB to its first victory.
In Wolfsburg, Michael Lang did not experience a completely successful, but also a failed debut for Borussia Mönchengladbach.
Gladbacher, who competed with the Swiss quartet Yann Sommer, Nico Elvedi, Denis Zakaria and Lang, twice gave a lead out of the hand, ultimately played 2:2 and have been waiting since 2003 for an away victory in the VW city.
Renato Steffen and his second Bundesliga ligator were responsible for Wolfsburg's equalisation to 1:1.
Yann Sommer was powerless in the flat shot from 20 meters of the Aargauer, as well as in the second goal after an hour.
Nevertheless, the trends at Gladbach are quite promising.
Alassane Pléa turns out to be a goalkeeper in the storm of the foals.
Against Wolfsburg, the French record-breaking buy-in from the OGC Nice hit for the third time in a row and for the seventh time in the seventh competitive game.
After seven laps, Gladbach finished in 4th place.
Within 40 minutes, the previously unbeaten Werder Bremen against VfB Stuttgart maneuvered into an uncomfortable position.
After 19 minutes, the team of Florian Kohlfeldt was surprised by a Stuttgart counter, which the ex-Luganesi Anastasios Donis finished with his first goal of the season, after 36 minutes Milos Veljkovic continued his team to gain: The 23-year-old Serb conceded after a jersey match against Daniel Didavi yellow-red.
Stuttgart's defender Borna Sosa and goalie Ron-Robert Zieler brought the Bremen back into the game with a curious throw-in own-goal (68th), a quarter of an hour before the end Gonzalo Castro shot the Stuttgarters, who are predominantly active, back on the Siegesstrasse.
Nürnberg won the duel against Düsseldorf 3-0.
After half an hour, Hanno Behrens brought the home team on track with foul penalty.
Macedonians vote on new state name
In Macedonia today, around 1.8 million citizens vote on whether to change the name of their country to North Macedonia.
A yes vote could resolve the nearly three-decade-simmering conflict with neighbouring Greece.
Athens had insisted on a name change because of its northern province of the same name and blocked any approach of Macedonia to the west.
Voters therefore also decide on the future of Western integration.
The US had announced that the country could quickly become a NATO member if the referendum was a positive outcome.
Syrians in U-Haft.
Refugees attacked three women.
A Syrian brutally beat three pensioners and severely injured them.
The 41-year-old asylum seeker had rioted on Friday around 10 p.m. in the Fluchtgasse in Alsergrund.
When the police arrived, they spoke to the accused, who went out with clenched fists on passers-by and tried to attack them, on his behavior.
The Syrian then tried to beat the officials and kick them.
Shortly afterwards, it turned out that the suspect had recently hit three elderly ladies (65, 67, 75) with his fists at a tram stop in W<0xC3><0xA4>hringer Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e.
He also kicked the trio with his feet.
Some of the pensioners were seriously injured.
They suffered hematomas, bruises and concussions.
The asylum seeker was also seriously injured "for an as yet unknown cause", as the police said.
He was taken to the hospital and monitored continuously during treatment.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Almost exactly one year after the entry into force of the marriage for all, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his long-time friend Christoph Rohde.
The two met in Hamburg on Saturday.
Kahrs had previously told the "Bild" newspaper that a registered civil partnership was not an option for her.
He's been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is a budget spokesman for the SPD parliamentary group and one of the speakers of the Seeheimer Kreis, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of marriage for homosexuals, Kahrs caused a stir on 30 June 2017.
For example, he had accused Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of having "stupefied himself" on the subject.
"That was your Schabowski moment," he said in reference to the accidental announcement of the GDR border opening by Günter Schabowski.
As of October 1, 2017, same-sex couples can marry just like heterosexuals.
Previously, they had been able to register their civil partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, for example in the case of adoption law.
Garden day: 400 meters hedge cut
There was a lot of work ahead of the members of the Civic Association Kinderhaus and the Society for Leprosy.
Around 400 meters of hedge around the gardens of the residents of the Pfründnerhaus should be cut.
Supported by the residents, it went to work for about twelve supporters.
"We are doing this to reduce costs," said Walter Schröer, chairman of the Citizens' Association.
And it has also accumulated so much.
Due to the hot summer we are late this time, but fortunately it is now only a shape cut.
Because already in the spring the hedge had been shorn once.
The breakfast always following the work also has a long tradition.
“We want everyone to stay strong,” Walter Schröer said.
World Championships in Rio: Hannes Aigner wins gold at the Canoe Slalom World Championships
Hannes Aigner from Augsburg won the gold medal at the conclusion of the World Canoe Slalom Championships in Rio de Janeiro.
The 29-year-old had a perfect run on Sunday on the Olympic track.
Two years ago, he had missed the Olympic bronze by three hundredths of a second.
I was well prepared, already had enough rides here on the facility and everything fit today," said the Olympic third of London 2012.
In the finish, he threw his paddle away with joy and raised both arms to victory - knowing that it would be enough for at least one medal.
After all, he had start number four.
But the six remaining starters could not top his fable time of 89.69 seconds.
Czech Jiri Prskavec finished second ahead of Russian Pavel Eigel.
The Gauting Police Inspectorate reports the first attempted burglary into a single-family home this autumn.
Fortunately, the perpetrators failed.
The days are getting shorter - that's what burglars want to take advantage of again.
Yesterday, the Gauting Police Inspectorate reported the first attempted burglary this autumn.
The fact that it stayed at the single-family house on Königswieser Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e is due to the alarm system.
It started when the perpetrators put on their hands just before 8 p.m. on Friday.
The burglars suspected that the residents were not at home.
The alarm system apparently surprised them to such an extent that they fled without loot.
Information to PI Gauting, telephone (089) 8 93 13 30.
Hertha’s bankruptcy: Catched up with reality: Bayern challenged against Ajax
The predicate is unbeatable: The defeat in Berlin FC Bayern "does not want to let go".
The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach now determine the first interim conclusion for the term of Niko Kovac.
The first small performance under the new coach Niko Kovac is not meant to rise to the greater autumn low for the Munich team.
“A week ago, you had the impression that we were invincible.
Now reality has caught up with us a bit," said Thomas Müller after the deserved 0:2 defeat at Hertha BSC and demanded a reaction for the Champions League duel with Ajax Amsterdam.
Anyone who knows us, knows that this really annoys us and that’s why we gas towards Tuesday.
For the first time in more than a year no own goal scored abroad, as at the same time of the pre-season two mandatory matches in series without victory, the table leadership in the Fu<0xC3><0x9F>ball-Bundesliga for the time being lost to Borussia Dortmund.
The overall situation is not as dramatic as the final stage of the failed Carlo Ancelotti at the end of September 2017, but the record champion must be warned.
FC Augsburg at the 1:1 with its man-on-man tactics and the Berliners through their playful needlesticks over the outside have delivered two blueprints within three days, as the last overpowering Bayern are to be cracked.
“Those who know FC Bayern know that we will not accept this and we will do everything we can to be successful again,” Kovac said.
Otherwise, however, he was surprisingly gentle with his losers in his hometown and pushed his first defeat as a Munich coach only to the again deficient handling of chances.
A win against Amsterdam and against Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday would nevertheless make the first interim conclusion of his term positive before the international break - otherwise the tone is likely to tighten.
So Kovac did not take any extraordinary measures before the second royal class appearance of this season after the 2-0 at Benfica Lisbon.
After the day off on Sunday, the short preparation for the second preliminary round match against Ajax begins as planned, which had also defeated AEK Athens sovereignly with 3-0 at the start.
"Now we've caught it in two games, but we'll also score again," announced national team captain Manuel Neuer.
As after the lost cup final against Eintracht Frankfurt in the same place, Joshua Kimmich spoke clearly.
The right-wing defender acted in the role of admonisher.
"I don't think that's all bad luck, we have to work it out again, because we don't make the numerous chances and make the mistakes in the back," the 23-year-old stressed shortly before the departure from the Olympic Stadium.
On the seventh day of the previous season, Bayern were even five points behind Dortmund, which has now taken the lead again with a point advantage.
And so Kimmich rated with a wink, at least positively, that the public debate about the supposedly unbeatable Bavaria has now come to an end.
"Yes, that's good," said the international player.
It’s good for the league.
DFB-Boss in line of fire: <0xC3><0x96>zil-Causa: Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an's sharp attack on Grindel
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an has denounced the expulsion of Mesut Ozil and Ilkay Gündogan from Germany.
DFB President Grindel sees mistakes, but defends the association line.
Now a new post is to be created.
Berlin - On different stages, Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought for the sovereignty of interpretation in the permanent controversy theme Mesut <0xC3><0x96>zil.
After the Turkish president strongly criticized the handling of the former world champion in Germany at the opening of the large Ditib Mosque in Cologne, the DFB boss defended the association line.
In the early Sunday morning, Grindel, who was personally attacked by <0xC3><0x96>zil, announced consequences from the causa in the Mainz ZDF "Sportstudio".
"In the future - because we also have many players with a migration background in the U-teams - we have to draw very precise conclusions that such a thing does not happen again," said the 57-year-old and wants to win a national player without a migration background as another integration officer.
At the same time, Grindel again stated that Erdogan did not stand for the values of football and the DFB.
He had sharply denounced a racism towards <0xC3><0x96>zil and Ilkay Gündogan.
Our German-born and raised Mesut <0xC3><0x96>zil and our Ilkay.
They excluded them from this society because they let themselves be photographed with me in England," Erdogan said on Saturday in the cathedral city.
Frankly, as their president, I could not believe that our two young men, who have risen to the German national team, were excluded.
Grindel referred to Gündogan's statement that, unlike <0xC3><0x96>zil, he felt "reasonably treated by the DFB" after the World Cup affair, which had started with photos of the two with Erdogan.
At the same time, he announced that he wants to face players in the future.
That someone says: If I win, I’m German, if I lose, I’m migrant – that’s not possible.
“That he has such an impression, I am very sorry,” Grindel said.
We should have defended Mesut more, I always said that.
However, he does not see a basis for <0xC3><0x96>zil’s return to the national team.
As a result, an additional integration commissioner will now be appointed alongside Brazilian-born Cacau and Celia Sasic, who has family roots in Cameroon.
“If someone without a migration background clearly affects society and football and says, ‘The issue is important, we have to take care of it,’ that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our clubs on the ground, where integration has to work,” Grindel said.
Despite the criticism of his person after the World Cup and the <0xC3><0x96>zil affair, he wants to run for office as DFB president again next year.
"I'm doing my job and I'm trying to do it as well as I can," Grindel said.
Man Builds Three Accidents in Three Hours
Coburg/Rödental - As reported by the police, the 75-Year-old caused the accidents on Friday between 10 and 1 pm.
First, the 75-year-old driver was approached by a lady at the red traffic light in the area of Lauterer Höhe.
She informed the pensioner that he had driven against her car.
However, there was no exchange of personal details, as the 75-year-old could not find the lady in the parking lot.
A short time later, the police received a telephone message about a driver who had come off the road and driven against a guide post.
Asked about this, the man did not want any police on site and then drove off.
After that the Rödentaler went home.
However, the pensioner got lost in his place of residence, where he has lived for decades, and rammed a construction vehicle when turning.
Eventually, the police found him and stopped him.
His car was seriously damaged by an accident.
The 75-year-old made a confused impression and could not remember much more.
The damage is about 1300 euros.
Moorbrand in Meppen: Almost 1000 emergency personnel are still in use.
About four weeks after the outbreak of the moor fire on a Bundeswehr site in the Emsland, 980 emergency personnel are still busy with the extinguishing work.
This was reported by the Bundeswehr on Sunday.
As the situation continues to develop stably, according to a spokesman, 70 volunteers were recently withdrawn.
A further reduction in the number of emergency personnel is planned, it said.
In the night of Sunday, an above-ground fire had been discovered and extinguished.
Last week, the disaster had been lifted, which had been declared a good week earlier on September 21, because it had been feared that the flames would endanger adjacent forests and settlements due to wind and sparking.
On Thursday, it was announced that the fire would no longer spread to neighboring communities.
At times, more than 1,500 emergency personnel on site tried to get the major fire under control.
The Luftwaffe continues to support the work on the Bundeswehr test site near Meppen with a transport helicopter.
There are also reconnaissance flights with Bundeswehr drones.
According to the Bundeswehr, reconnaissance flights with "Tornados" are also planned for 2 and 5 October.
The fire was triggered by test rockets fired by Airbus engineers.
The smoke plume of the moor fire was at times drawn up to a hundred kilometers over the northwest of Germany as far as Bremen.
On Monday, the Bundeswehr wants to set up a contact point that receives damage reports.
Initial claims for damages had already been announced by hoteliers and holiday home owners.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Johannes Kahrs (SPD, r) and his husband Christoph Rohde leave the main church of St. Katharinen in Hamburg after their wedding.
Almost exactly one year after the entry into force of the marriage for all, the politician married his long-time friend in Hamburg.
The two have been together for 25 years.
Almost exactly one year after the entry into force of the marriage for all, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his long-time friend Christoph Rohde.
The two met in Hamburg on Saturday.
Kahrs had previously told the "Bild" newspaper that a registered civil partnership was not an option for her.
When we get married, that's right.
He has been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is a budget spokesman for the SPD parliamentary group and one of the speakers of the Seeheimer Kreis, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of marriage for homosexuals, Kahrs caused a stir on 30 June 2017.
For example, he had accused Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of having "stupefied himself" on the subject.
"That was your Schabowski moment," he said in reference to the accidental announcement of the GDR border opening by Günter Schabowski.
As of October 1, 2017, same-sex couples can marry just like heterosexuals.
Previously, they had been able to register their civil partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, for example in the case of adoption law.
Macedonian Referendum on New State Names
In Macedonia, the much-awaited referendum on a new name for this small Balkan state has begun.
Around 1.8 million voters are expected to decide whether their state will be called North Macedonia in the future.
Because of its northern province of the same name, the neighbor Greece insists on this.
As a means of pressure, Athens had blocked any rapprochement between Skopje and the EU and NATO for almost three decades.
If the citizens vote yes, they will also give the go-ahead for the Western integration of their country.
Elie Wiesel - The author who saves the Shoah from oblivion
Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel would have turned 90 on September 30.
The 1986 Nobel Peace Prize winner dies in the United States in 2016, leaving behind a work that preserves the horrors of the Shoah for posterity.
Switzerland launches electronic register for organ donors
The register is intended to facilitate organ donation and relieve relatives in stressful situations.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs can only be removed with explicit consent, Swisstransplant emphasizes.
(dpa) Switzerland is launching an electronic register for organ donors this Monday.
This is intended to facilitate organ donation and relieve relatives in stressful situations.
People who want to make their organs available in the event of death can register there.
Your wishes can then be called up by Swisstransplant if necessary.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs may continue to be removed - as in Germany - only with explicit consent, Swisstransplant emphasizes.
It is assumed that 15 percent of the Swiss have a donor card, says Franz Immer, director of the Swisstransplant Foundation.
But only in five percent of the cases, a card is found at the decisive moment in possible donors.
In more than 60 percent of the conversations, the relatives do not know the wish of the deceased.
"They then have to decide on behalf of the deceased, which is often very burdensome," said Immer.
A similar registration system is already in place in the UK.
In Germany, there are considerations to store information on the possible organ donation on the health insurance card, as the spokeswoman of the Federal Agency for Health Education, Marita Völker-Albert says.
“A register in which people can enter their wishes – for or against organ donation – does not exist,” she says.
Federal Health Minister Jens Spahn has called for a new regulation on organ donation.
According to his proposal, everyone would initially be considered an organ donor, unless he or his family disagreed.
Among other things, the Catholic Church rejects this.
14-year-old student is world champion in mental arithmetic
Tomohiro Iseda, a 14-year-old student from Japan, is the world champion in mental arithmetic.
He won against 39 competitors in Wolfsburg this weekend.
This was announced by Martina Flamme-Jasper from the Science Museum Phaeno, the venue of the competition, on Sunday.
16-year-old Wenzel Grü<0xC3><0x9F> from Germany took third place.
The youngest participant in the World Cup was a 12-year-old Japanese student, the oldest a 74-year-old pensioner from France, chief referee Ralf Laue said.
The computer science professor from Zwickau (Saxony) organizes the competition every two years.
Previous tasks were, for example: 14,130 x 17,981,822 or 57,809,355 + 28 x 16,448,333.
Because spectators were not allowed, there was a show on Saturday afternoon, where participants competed against guests from the audience with calculators.
Wenzel Grü<0xC3><0x9F> from Lastrup demonstrated how he holds a ball with his head in the air when calculating.
He is one of seven Germans in the competition.
A total of 82 candidates from more than 20 countries tried to qualify for the competition.
Grü<0xC3><0x9F> was already present in Bielefeld two years ago as a then 14-year-old.
With terms such as superbrain, genius or prodigy, organizer Laue can do little.
“You can train your head,” he said.
Many participants practiced several hours a day.
In India and Singapore, there are even stadium-based arithmetic competitions.
The disciplines include, for example, the square root drawing of six-digit numbers.
When calculating versatility, candidates are given surprise tasks, for which they must quickly find a solution strategy.
The Germans also had good chances here, said the chief arbiter.
Otherwise, Asians are often at an advantage, because mental arithmetic is learned more intensively and with other, effective methods already in early childhood.
Video with naked Serena Williams: It's about breast cancer early detection
Tennis ace Serena Williams shows off her sensitive and sensitive side.
With this video, the 37-year-old wants to point out breast cancer and advocate for early detection.
It is about life and death, but also about courage and enlightenment.
Serena Williams sings above without the song "I Touch Myself" by the group "The Divinyls" - only her hands cover her most intimate places.
Singer Chrissy Amphlett has died.
The emotional video is part of the “I Touch Myself” project, which is about breast cancer early detection that can save lives.
Serena Williams died almost a year ago.
At the birth of her daughter Alexis Olympia, there were complications.
An emergency surgery was initiated to save the baby’s life.
In a subsequent CT, blood clots in Serena’s lungs were discovered.
Just in time...
Government wants to ban more extremist symbols
The German government is planning a significant extension of the ban on the use of extremist symbols.
Next week, the turquoise-blue coalition will send a corresponding draft law on the so-called "symbols law" in review.
This is intended to significantly increase the number of terrorist or similar groups covered by the ban.
Polar cold air brings fresh snow on the mountains in the west
Mrs. Holle shakes her beds for the first time in the West next week: Polare Kaltluft reaches Vorarlberg, North Tyrol and Salzburg on Monday.
According to the meteorologists of the Central Institute for Meteorology and Geodynamics (ZAMG), the snowfall limit drops to 1,500 to 1,200 meters at the beginning of the week - in narrow valleys it can snow down to about 1,000 meters at high intensity, it said.
From the Bregenzerwald to the Hohe Tauern, 20 to 40 centimetres of fresh snow are to be expected above 2,000 metres.
On higher pass roads (Arlberg Pass, Timmelsjoch, Bieler Höhe, Brenner Pass, Gerlos Pass, Felbertauern, Gro<0xC3><0x9F>glockner High Alpine Road) the road conditions become wintery.
Farmers are allowed to start the annual kink care on Monday
Schleswig-Holstein’s farmers are allowed to start their annual kink care on Monday.
The "green walls", which are unique in Germany, have shaped the landscape of this federal state, which is poor in forest, for about 200 years.
The tree and shrub hedges up to five meters wide are "forest set" and for many animals and plants the last retreat rooms.
Knicks connect as corridors scattered habitats, through which the exchange of organisms can still work, as the managing director of the Nature Conservation Federation Germany (NABU) in Schleswig-Holstein, Ingo Ludwichowski, said.
Knicks are living fences
The Knicks were created by order of the Danish king Christian VI in 1766, who ruled Schleswig-Holstein.
The "living fences" were not only field boundary and cattle fence, they also supplied the farmers with firewood and beams for their half-timbered houses.
From that time, his name "Knick" also comes: By "Knicking" the branches, the dense, intertwined boundaries could develop.
Today, some 45,000 kilometres of hedges stretch between the North Sea and the Baltic Sea, giving the image of a woody, diversely structured landscape.
According to the NABU, they are now used by around 7000 animal species as a substitute habitat.
Up to 1800 different species could live in one kilometre of bend and up to 30 pairs of birds could breed.
However, the kink can only fulfil its ecologically important function if it is properly cared for in winter.
Otherwise, it atrophied to a light row of trees, which, in addition to biodiversity, also loses the wind protection effect, said Ludwichowski.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, the kink care may only be carried out outside the breeding season from October to March.
After tsunami in Sulawesi Indonesians talk about situation on site
The local Radika Pinto describes in an interview with the Editorial Network Germany (RND) the situation on the island of Sulawesi after the earthquake and the tsunami:
Were you there during the tsunami?
No, I was in Jakarta on the island of Java at the time.
When the earthquakes happened, my wife called me, she was in Palu.
When I found out about the tsunami, I immediately made my way back to Sulawesi.
I arrived on Sunday morning because I had to drive more than 20 hours after a flight, because the airport on Palu was closed at that time.
What is the situation on the island now?
The national government has re-opened the airport so that relief supplies can also be flown in.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast, which are all completely destroyed.
Our office of World Vision has also been destroyed, but we have provisionally set up something where we have also accommodated other people.
Where are the people living in Sulawesi now?
Many have run to surrounding hills where they still persist for fear of another tsunami and earthquake and where they have no access to water and food.
Some are in front of their houses, there are still aftershocks.
Because many grocery stores and gas stations are completely closed, people sometimes steal food and gasoline.
The public service has been completely shut down, the national government is helping out.
A prison has also been destroyed, some of the prisoners walk around freely and the search for them is difficult.
There are still many bodies lying around, many people have not yet been found and are missing.
How does communication and information work on the island?
At the moment we have cell phone reception, but before that this did not work and we only got information on the radio.
Many people are still looking for their children, neighbors and other people they don’t know if they live and where they are staying, because people were not at home during the earthquakes, but, for example, at work.
The tsunami warning system did not work properly.
Do you have any information?
We don't know the reasons for this, but when the all-clear came, many thought "Okay, no tsunami" - and then he came.
In other regions that were not hit by the tsunami, there was misinformation that a tsunami hit the region and they ran to the surrounding mountains.
Is an island like Sulawesi, which lies on the Pacific Ring of Fire, not prepared for earthquakes?
Yes, there are earthquakes every day, but this was the worst.
We usually know how to respond to earthquakes and also train evacuations.
But the entire infrastructure has collapsed, the earthquake has hit a lot of people.
Muscle injuries against Werder: VfB has to give up Aogo and Donis for a long time
Anastasios Donis and Dennis Aogo will be missing from VfB Stuttgart for a long time with severe muscle injuries.
Aogo had pulled a muscle fiber tear in the back left thigh in the 2:1 against Werder Bremen on Saturday, the football Bundesliga team said on Sunday.
In Donis, doctors diagnosed a muscle bundle tear in the thigh.
Both players are definitely not an option against Hannover 96 on Saturday and will probably still miss games after the following international break.
VfB Stuttgart did not make a forecast for the downtime.
A muscle bundle tear usually heals within six to eight weeks, a muscle fiber tear usually heals a little faster.
Triumph of Hyperrealism at the San Seb<0xC3><0xA1>stian Film Festival
San Sebasti<0xC3><0xA1>n - The Film Festival of San Sebasti<0xC3><0xA1>n closes every year the most prestigious European festivals.
Despite all the chants on the cinema can be summed up: 2018 was a remarkable year for the film.
After a convincing competition in Cannes, especially with strong contributions from Europe and Asia and a Venice that attracted a lot of attention with Oscar candidates from Hollywood, San Sebastian also delivered one of his best competitions of recent years.
On Sunday morning, the fire department tried to catch an injured duck.
However, the action dragged on for some time.
Even a boat was used.
Olching - On Sunday morning, a white, injured duck caught the attention of walkers at Lake Olching.
She was in the area of the water station.
To help the animal, the passers-by called the police and the fire department.
However, the first attempts to capture the duck went wrong.
Despite the injury, she was able to evade the emergency services again and again.
In the end, she fled to the lake.
With a rescue boat, the fire brigade was able to circle the animal and push it back ashore, where it was then put into a transport crate after almost an hour by a firefighter with a courageous handle.
The duck, which was injured in the chest, was then taken to the LMU veterinary clinic in Oberschlei<0xC3><0x9F>heim.
But according to the first estimates, their chances of survival are rather low.
Biathlete Julian Eberhard aiming for World Cup medal
Fourth place at Olympia was long in the stomach of biathlete Julian Eberhard.
In the coming winter, the Saalfeldener wants to make up for the missed precious metal at the World Cup in <0xC3><0x96>stersund.
The last shot cost the 31-year-old in the Olympic sprint of Pyeongchang the close to medal.
Seven tenths of a second were missing on bronze at the end.
“I deliberately took the time to process this,” says Eberhard at the opening of the MyGym fitness studio in his hometown of Saalfelden.
A medal was the goal, I was in top form, but it just didn’t want to be.
The Pinzgauer is all the more motivated to make up for the missed precious metal in the new season: "The goal can only be to come back with the constitution to a major event, to win something.
At some point, you have to strike.
The track of the World Championships in <0xC3><0x96>stersund (SWE) is Eberhard: "I have already closed the track in my heart", he recalls with joy his fourth World Cup place in the individual race last year.
Immediately after the Olympics, he celebrated the only single win for Austria in the mass start competition of Kontiolahti (FIN) in the last World Cup winter.
With the season he ran in Oslo (NOR) in second place.
Brett Kavanaugh: FBI investigation at turbo speed
The time is extremely short and the number of scheduled interrogations is very limited.
With an FBI investigation at turbo speed, the Republicans in the U.S. Senate want to secure the wafer-thin majority for the controversial judge candidate Brett Kavanaugh due to coercion allegations.
President Donald Trump has given investigators a deadline until Friday to clarify the more than 30 years since the alleged incidents.
The latest turn in the drama surrounding Kavanaugh’s vocation, which was accompanied by a cultural struggle, was triggered on Friday.
After an eight-hour hearing of Kavanaugh and first prosecutor Christine Blasey Ford, during which the lawyer unleashed angry tirades against the opposition Democrats, the Senate Judiciary Committee should clear the way for the final confirmation of the arch-conservative judge at the Supreme Court of the United States.
The majority of Republicans seemed assured when suddenly, contrary to his original announcement, Senator Jeff Flake declared that he would agree, but demanded an FBI investigation.
After tumultuous scenes, his party friends agreed.
President Trump, who had described the heavy allegations on Thursday as "crisis", initially refrained from further attacks against the women and, on the contrary, spoke of "happiness in misfortune".
In this way, final doubts could be dispelled, he said.
Later, at an election rally, Trump sharply attacked the Democrats for rejecting Kavanaugh: “They are trying to block and destroy.”
Trump orders FBI investigation into Kavanaugh case
The White House has also severely restricted the powers of investigators.
“We will investigate the well-known accusations of two women, nothing more,” a government official told the Wall Street Journal, “They are not going on a fishing trip.”
According to the New York Times, only four witnesses are to be heard.
The mobile radar device installed in a "civil vehicle" of the municipality of Ried to monitor the speed limit is, according to the municipality, from Monday, October 1, stationed on Gartenstra<0xC3><0x9F>e.
This is also where the Federal School Center is located.
The municipality also operates several fixed-installed radar boxes.
FC Schalke 04 after victory against Mainz: You felt the fear
Coach Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated their first win of the season against Mainz.
The relief at Schalke is great after the first win of the season.
Nevertheless, the time factor also played a role against Mainz.
Gelsenkirchen - By now it is well known that Christian Heidel is a huge pessimist at football matches.
This was no different in the home game against Mainz 05.
“I’ve seen every ball in it.
And there were a lot of corners and a lot of balls in our penalty area," said Schalke 04's sports director - and breathed a sigh of relief.
After all, the Königsblauen had managed to bring the tight 1-0 against the Rheinhessen over time and thus the first victory of the season under the roof.
In fact, it could have been different.
After the lead by Alessandro Schöpf 11. of the team of head coach Domenico Tedesco had given security: "In sum, the first half was good, both playfully and from the pressing", obviously played with increasing playing time more and more the head played a role.
Don't actually create a head-ball monster
"The last ten minutes felt like two hours to me," Heidel said, "If the team was half as nervous as I was on the bench, I can understand that."
The boys were afraid to give this out of their hands and therefore retreated further and further.
And defended with man and mouse against Mainz.
To save the first three points of the season.
"We all have a huge stone fallen from our hearts," said Schöpf, who had no insignificant part in this with his header hit: "I am actually the worst header player in manschafft".
But in the end, only victory matters.
The relief was noticeable throughout the arena, of course also at Tedesco.
“We wanted to start in the initial phase with a lot of pressure and make a firework out of it,” said Schalke’s head coach.
Victory was important.
Finally we can look forward to a few hours.
I am very, very happy for the team and the fans.
We played intelligently, calmly and courageously, so we have to tackle games over 90 minutes
Probably the biggest shortcoming of the afternoon: Königsblau missed it, rather to worry about clearer conditions.
The possibilities for this were finally there, for example by the strong Yevhen Konpplyanka, who twice hit the bar 59./72. or Amine Harit 62.
"Then it wouldn't have been a trembling victory," Tedesco said: "You've already felt the fear a little bit".
So I'm glad we won.
He was not the only schalker.
Fischbachau: Smoke column in Leitzachtal 2 km visible
The smoke was not to be overlooked.
From about two kilometers away, a hiker observed a fire in the Leitzachtal on Sunday around 1.30 pm.
Now the police are investigating.
Fischbachau - The cause was soon found out by the police and fire brigade: an unknown person had lit garbage on a two-square-meter area on Gschwendner Berg.
According to the police, it appeared as if he had been monitoring the fire for a long time, but then left the embers unattended.
And this near the forest.
30 Fischbachau firefighters were busy pulling apart and extinguishing.
Police are now investigating arson.
Prof. Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani discusses integration: A discussion on equal footing
In front of them is the author, Professor Aladin El-Mafaalani.
He has once again accepted the invitation of Ernst Reiling and Lore Hauschild.
"I have set myself the task of bringing interesting people to Greven for many years," explains the founder and chairman of the "Reckenfelder Treff" - the association that cooperates with the alliance "Kulturpolitik" in the organization of the evening.
El-Mafaalani enters the reading very loosely, describes the writing process of the book, talks about how difficult it was to explain the topic in a comprehensible way.
With a lot of gestures, tangible numbers and a joke or two, he brings the audience closer to one of the most conflicting topics: migration and integration.
Why do conflicts arise despite successful integration?
The Syrian-born author uses a metaphor to answer the question.
At one table is German society, at the cat’s table are first-generation migrants.
Their children grow up in Germany and want to come to the table.
The third generation of migrants was born in Germany, they have always sat at the big table and now want to participate.
This leads to conflicts.
The decisive factor is therefore not whether one is politically right-wing or left-wing, but: "Am I for or against an open society?", he emphasizes.
In the beginning rather behaving, then more and more lively starts the discussion round.
And there is a need for speech.
An Afghan refugee reports from his perspective, two teachers tell how they see successful or unsuccessful integration among students.
El-Mafaalani stands before, not on stage, a symbol for the discussion: she is on an equal footing.
The sociology professor does not impose his opinion, emphasizes that he speaks of the average, not of individual destinies.
He is pleased that there is interest in the topic, because "only when we understand what the problem is, we can find solutions," says El-Mafaalani.
Even during the subsequent signing hour, he still has an open ear for the questions of the guests and was also discussed intensively in the foyer, with prepared Kurdish specialities.
Basketball: Bonn and Gie<0xC3><0x9F>en win opening games
The Giessen 46ers and Telekom Baskets Bonn finished the first matchday of the Basketball Bundesliga (BBL) with a home and away victory.
Giessen prevailed in a hard-fought match in their own hall with 91:84 (43:46) against the Central German BC.
The ambitious Bonners won at the BG Göttingen with 86:79 (49:47).
The first leader of the season is Alba Berlin after the 112:55 gala on Saturday against Science City Jena.
At the beginning of the new season, the German champions Bayern Munich and former series champion Brose Bamberg had much more trouble.
Munich struggled already on Friday to an 83:77 at ratiopharm Ulm, Bamberg won on Saturday the Frankenderby at s.Oliver Würzburg with 84:80.
Building in Landsham: 100 applications for 20 plots
The demand is apparently huge: more than 100 interested parties have applied for the purchase of one of the land in Landsham-Süd.
The municipality of Pliening has sold the first plots of land in the Landsham-Süd development area on the open market.
This was announced by Mayor Roland Frick.
In addition, the application phase for the 20 properties offered by the municipality at more favourable conditions or prices is completed – similar to the previous local model.
A good 100 applications were received, said Frick.
"Currently, the documents are being reviewed" with regard to the application criteria, completeness and correctness.
According to the mayor of Plieningen, the goal is to have the candidate ranking for the 20 properties drawn up by the end of the year and to submit them to the municipal council.
After that, the award can be made.
A total of 50 plots of land for single and semi-detached houses will be created on the site in the south of Landsham, as well as four areas for apartment buildings, each of which is expected to have eight residential units.
The development is now almost complete, the roads and paths are to be paved soon.
A single plot as well as two of the multi-family houses belong to a private individual, the rest of the municipality of Pliening.
It sells the majority on the open market, 20 properties in a socially acceptable model.
According to Frick, the two apartment buildings in the municipality are to be built as affordable housing.
With a total of 16 income-oriented apartments funded by the Free State.
Space for 200 people
Roughly estimated, on the area of the new development area Landsham-Süd living space is created for about 200 people.
Not only that: Now, at the beginning of October, according to Frick, the start of the construction of a new daycare center will take place there.
It is intended to accommodate three kindergarten and three nativity groups as well as a multi-purpose room.
The opening is scheduled for September 2019, at the start of the next kindergarten year.
How Schalkes Naldo succeeds in "big sport" on the bench
For the third time in a row not in the starting eleven: Nevertheless, Naldo thanks Schalke coach Domenico Tedesco.
Gelsenkirchen - After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues had not sat in the Schalke starting eleven for the third time in a row, but on the substitute bench, the understanding would have been great for many people, if the almost two-meter-tall Brazilian had once really spoken the frustration of the soul.
But after the 1-0 victory over the FSV Mainz 05, when the Schalke players gathered in the middle circle as usual and thanked head coach Domenico Tedesco for all his pros, the 36-year-old, who all simply called Naldo, turned on and said; "We have to thank, coach!"
"It was very emotional, it was a great sport," Tedesco later said of the reaction of his vice captain, who, despite his new reservist existence, bore no grudges at all.
Probably Naldo, who was celebrated as the best Schalker last season, knows that he has actually not been put on the siding with his coach - but for good reasons gets a break.
A reason called "load control."
It wasn’t easy to tell him.
“It wasn’t easy to tell him that, I’ll tell you quite honestly,” Tedesco said of the moment he told Naldo that he wasn’t in the starting eleven.
He is an important player, he is an important person.
But it’s always about the matter, it’s about the club,” Tedesco explained.
Naldo played 90 minutes against Bayern and Porto.
He is 36 years old.
It is important that everyone is able to jump through the cracks at the moment.
And that we all keep in the boat," Tedesco explained the rotation, which Naldo recently caught.
And to which the Brazilian responded with the wisdom of his advanced age: by also proving himself to be an exemplary team player on the bench.
The mood in Austria’s industry continued to accelerate in August compared to the eurozone.
The Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) was at a 37-month low of 46.7 points.
Nevertheless, Austria has the third-best mood in Europe behind Ireland and the Netherlands, the Markit Institute said on Monday to its survey of 3,000 companies.
Unlike in Austria, the euro-zone PMI rose by 1.1 points to 45.1 points, but the index is still below the 50-point mark for the 13th month in a row, which indicates growth.
Only Ireland’s industry cracked this threshold in August with 50.9 points.
The final score was the Greeks (42.1 points).
In Germany, France and Spain, the mood barometer fell, but more slowly than in the previous months.
In Spain, the index reached 44.0 points, the highest level since March.
“The slight slowdown could mean the worst is over,” Markit economist Rob Dobson said.
But in the third quarter, at least, industry remains the number one growth brake.
A rapid return to the growth zone is not in sight: export orders in the eurozone fell as strongly as they have not since November 2011.
The companies therefore cut jobs for the seventh month in a row.
Industrial production in China also fell more sharply in August than initially assumed.
The sentiment barometer fell from 49.3 points in the previous month to 47.6 points.
Experts had initially expected 47.8 points.

Tuchel's PSG team succeeds in eighth league game

Nice coach Thomas Tuchel rushes with Paris Saint-Germain in France's football championship further from victory to victory.
At the OGC Nice, the defending champion won thanks to two goals from superstar Neymar with 3:0 (1:0) and was thus also successful in the eighth league game.
Most recently, Olympique Lyon had made such a good start to the season 82 years ago in France.
The Brazilian Neymar brought PSG in the lead after 22 minutes and made the final score in the extra time.
Christopher Nkunku (46th) provided the intermediate 2:0.
Paris also managed the dress rehearsal for the groundbreaking second Champions League group match against Red Star Belgrade on Wednesday.
At the start of the premier class, Tuchel's team had to accept the only mandatory match loss this season in a 2:3 at Liverpool.
