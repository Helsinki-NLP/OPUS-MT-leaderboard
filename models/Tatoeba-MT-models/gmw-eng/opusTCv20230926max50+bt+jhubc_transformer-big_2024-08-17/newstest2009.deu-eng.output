The Prague Stock Exchange plunges into the negative against the close of business.
After the steep decline in the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange was able to correct the losses.
Transactions with <0xC4><0x8C>EZ’s shares accounted for almost half of normal day-to-day business.
The Prague Stock Exchange followed up on Monday’s slump right at the start of Tuesday’s deals, when it fell a further six percentage points.
This time the reason for the break-in was Wall Street.
In the Czech Republic, too, the market’s reaction to the result of the vote of the US House of Representatives, which had refused to support a stabilization plan for the financial sector there, is thus evident.
Fall of shares in Asia
Shares on the Asian stock exchanges experienced a dramatic fall on Tuesday, although the indices were able to offset some of the losses over the course of the day.
The Hong Kong Hang Seng Stock Exchange index lost nearly four percentage points over the course of the business day, but was later able to make up for some of the losses, reducing the decline to about 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index, which monitors the movement of Chinese stocks on the Hong Kong stock exchange, fell by 3.8 percent, while the markets in Shanghai were closed.
Stocks on the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent, but then decreased losses to 4.3 percent.
The stock market in Taiwan fell by 3.6 percent according to the index there.
“The timing for the bailout in the U.S. is uncertain and will affect financial markets worldwide,” said Hong Kong’s head of monetary affairs, Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong, although it belongs to China, determines its monetary policy itself, i.e. independently of the Chinese central bank.
Interest rates in Hong Kong are at the same level as those in the United States.
U.S. lawmakers should return to the negotiating table as soon as possible, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, and pass the draft to support the financial system.
Otherwise, other countries would also be affected by the burglary.
A bloodbath of American stocks
The U.S. House of Representatives on Monday rejected the plan to support the financial system, which would cost up to $700 billion (nearly K<0xC4><0x8D> 12 trillion).
Legislators thus ignored President George Bush’s call to support the plan.
In Bush’s view, the plan would address the root causes of the financial crisis and thus help stabilize the entire economy.
American stocks experienced a bloodbath on Monday, and the major stock indices recorded the largest slump in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones Index fell by almost seven percent, a similar slump it had last recorded in 1987.
The index had already fallen before the vote, but there were hardly any signs that the draft would not come through in the House of Representatives, the index experienced a free fall.
Congress makes concession: US government can pump $700 billion into the banks
The top representatives of the US Congress and the administration of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of agreement on financial assistance to the American financial system.
This is to be voted on at the beginning of next week.
U.S. lawmakers made a breakthrough in talks to pass a $700 billion bailout plan in the form of financial assistance to the U.S. financial system (about CZK 12 trillion).
However, this does not mean victory.
Congressmen still have to negotiate some details of the agreement before they can publish the final version of the law and vote on it.
The plan to support the financial system will be negotiated in the U.S. Congress on Monday.
On Sunday, Chairman of the Banking and Financial Services Committee Barney Frank told Reuters.
In the Senate, according to various sources, the plan could probably be voted on on Wednesday at the earliest.
According to economists, a communication on the plan’s adoption should be the first significant psychological factor in reviving financial markets.
After that, however, there is a "disillusionment" due to the complicated mechanisms of how to help the markets in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
“We have made significant progress.
We have clarified our divergent views on what a package to stabilize the market should look like,” said Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat.
According to her, a final vote could take place on Sunday.
Representatives of lawmakers met with U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson on Sunday night to give the government fund its final shape.
This provides for the purchase of unsold mortgage assets from the financial companies, which plunge the financial companies into heavy losses and endanger the stability of the entire system.
“We are on the verge of a definitive agreement on a plan that will work and must be effective in the market.
You have to continue the recovery plan, but I think we’re on target,” Paulson said.
A signal for Asian businesses
The global financial crisis is also clearly reflected in the stock markets, which are falling sharply.
Nevada Senator Harry Reid said lawmakers are trying to reach a final agreement in Congress before Sunday.
This is to reassure investors of deals on the Asian financial markets, which are in the first time zone, where a decision by Congress could affect the business on Monday.
So far, however, it is not entirely clear when both chambers of the American Congress will vote on the law, and it is unclear whether the negotiations could still fail at the last minute due to a problem.
Legislators hope it will be passed in the next few days.
However, the law will undergo some changes.
The total amount intended to help the system is to be divided into two parts.
The initial $350 billion is to be provided as soon as possible, as President George Bush called for.
But Congress can block the distribution of the remaining money if it feels that the program is not performing its function, with another $100 billion and later the final $350 billion.
Bush sees progress in negotiations as positive
While the president has veto power in this decision, Congress can override his veto.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the program, which was based on obtaining finances to buy bad mortgage securities whose value has fallen, has persisted because hundreds of thousands of Americans are no longer able to repay their mortgages.
“We worked everything out.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the bill on Sunday, then the Senate on Monday,” said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
The American President Bush was also satisfied with the progress.
His spokesman Tony Fratto said Bush was satisfied with Saturday's progress and "appreciated the mutual effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy."
Limitation of golden parachutes
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd, the lead negotiator, said lawmakers had agreed on responsibility for the money program, protecting taxpayers from losses, closing benefits, and a timetable for funding the plan.
The new law is also intended to limit the so-called golden parachutes for directors of the companies involved in the program and sets up a committee to oversee the fund.
The Ministry of Finance is to lead it.
“We’ve worked very hard on this and made great progress toward an agreement that works and is important to the market and to all Americans,” Paulson said.
The plan also expects help for homeowners who are having trouble repaying their mortgage.
The government should negotiate new installments on mortgages it buys up, with the goal being to lower the monthly costs for the debtors and allow them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological help
The proposed plan is a good idea, according to Patria Finance Chief Economist David Marek, but implementation will be very difficult.
“It’s because you don’t know the mechanism by which and at what price the problematic assets are bought.
This will be crucial for how the financial sector and the government split the losses between each other,” Marek told iHNed.cz server this week.
Whether the plan will be adopted now or at the beginning of next week is, in Marek’s view, not decisive.
“Much more important is for Congressmen to agree to support the plan and say goodbye to it as soon as possible.
The psychological importance of the agreement on the adoption is the most important thing at this moment," Marek stressed.
Duel on knife edge: MP3 player against mobile phones.
We advise you on your choice
While almost any mobile phone can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can make calls yet.
So, of course, it looks like it’s better to just buy a phone.
However, there are plenty of reasons why you should buy an independent player.
The choice depends entirely on the type of use and the claims of the future owner.
Surely it is hard to buy a great expensive turntable at home to listen to the latest album by Maxim Turbulenc.
On the one hand, such musical innovations do not appear on LPs, and from a qualitative point of view, there is no objective reason for this.
However, if you have LPs with art rock, jazz or blues on the shelf, you probably dream at least of one.
This is also the case with music when traveling, i.e. with compressed music, in simplified terms - music in MP3 format.
Here, too, there are price and quality categories.
For one, it may not be acceptable to spend eight thousand crowns on a player, but a Pink Floyd fan will probably hardly be able to cope with headphones for twenty crowns from the market.
Two extremes, between which there is enough space for everyone.
The selection is wide.
The battery life is also crucial.
Some good music players can play a lot more than just music, but what phones can do, they don’t even hint at.
No modern device can be used as universally as the telephone.
In addition to the primary functions, the calling and the texting, it can play music and videos, record both, it has sometimes a better, sometimes a worse camera and can maybe also navigate.
And if you still include the smartphones and communicators, you almost have a small computer in your pocket.
It is a small miracle, because no refrigerator can grill and no TV can photograph.
But the universality of mobile phones also comes with disadvantages.
However, the more features you use on your phone, the more often you will have to reload it.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy guzzlers.
Only a few phones can play music for more than ten-twelve hours, most of the time it is much less.
In this respect, music players (especially the simplest ones) are significantly more powerful.
That’s why you should expect the cheap phones to not be able to play music for more than a few hours.
If you then still make calls from time to time, you prefer to buy a charger for the office - this also applies to more expensive devices.
With MP3 players, you will not have this problem, even the less good will last at least 9 hours of continuous operation with one time charging off.
Another problem is when you want to transfer the music to your mobile phone.
Unfortunately, only a small part of the devices have a USB termination, and not every mobile phone can be connected directly to a PC without special software.
Of course, you can transfer the music directly to a storage medium, but only a few card readers can do without reduction with the tiny memory cards used in mobile phones.
With players, you don’t need any special software, except for the iPod.
You only need to feed the device with music from your PC via USB port.
Most mobile phones and players create their own music library, arranged according to the name of the artist, the title of the album, the genre or, for example, the rating by users.
Some devices only map the tree structure of the address directory, similar to Windows Explorer, some can do both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Players are easier to use, mobile phones can do more
When choosing a specific device, you should especially inquire about the battery life, storage capacity, quality and type of sound and, of course, the ease of use.
If music is primarily a backdrop for you and you listen to it every day only briefly, for example in the tram, then any mobile phone that plays MP3 files is enough.
This is something almost every cell phone can do.
You also don’t have to control which music formats a mobile phone or player can handle.
MP3 create all of them, and most of the music you get will just be in this format.
The format is one of the most widely used, and besides, most devices can also play music in WMA format.
Less common is AAC (a format Apple and its iPods use).
Better mobile phones also allow you to buy music online.
You only need to go to the corresponding pages of a provider (or another provider) via mobile internet, and you can buy a song or album.
This service can in and of itself be a compelling argument for why you should buy a music phone.
Unfortunately, the offer of the providers is poor and is mostly limited to fast radio hits.
The prices are also not the lowest.
In general, however, it is assumed that this type of sales of music (be it via GSM, Internet or wireless Internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people carry their cell phones with them.
If you feel like listening to something, reach for the phone in the jacket pocket while the player is at home.
However, it depends on whether you always carry headphones or at least a wireless hands-free device with you.
If not, you can fall back on the built-in speaker that almost every phone has, but only the fewest MP3 players.
Probably the biggest advantage of music mobile phones will be in the price for many.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than three thousand crowns.
For three and four thousand crowns you already get a very decent Walkman.
The biggest handicap for most will be that there are no normal headphones.
The best and most technically sophisticated phones with a 3.5 mm aperture for normal headphones cost up to fifteen thousand crowns.
The advantage of the players is in the ease of use.
The simplest - and not necessarily cheapest (see selection) - player can really serve anyone.
A minimum of functions, the similarity in operation with the formerly normal cassette recorder or, for example, the turntable is obvious.
There is no risk of a collision in the form of a mistakenly employed mobile internet and a subsequently horrendous bill for data transmissions.
Which device should you now reach for
Even the cheapest phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for removable storage media (type M2, microSD, etc.).
Even if you buy a corresponding card, two thousand crowns are enough.
But beware.
In the basic models, only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB are usually supported.
Only the most expensive can read 8 GB memory cards.
If you already own a mobile phone and want to buy an inexpensive MP3 player, then you can reach for Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
Depending on the capacity (maximum 2 GB) you do not have to put more than 1100 crowns on the table.
If you are one of the more demanding listeners, you prefer to take specialized phones - Walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some from Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have independent control buttons for MP3, and the ease of use comes close to that of a single MP3 player.
The Sony Ericsson is farthest away, whose Walkman series phones have the same user interface as the individually sold MP3 players.
The same services in the same price range of up to four thousand crowns, but with a higher storage capacity (up to 16 GB) and a long battery life (usually 15 hours, maximum up to 35 hours) afford you MP3 players of the above manufacturers.
The first virtual provider is already coming to the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite mature, the Czech providers offer virtually all services, as they are also offered by their partners in Western Europe.
Nevertheless, something is missing here - a virtual provider that forces the classic at lower prices.
Perhaps it will not be long in coming.
That the Czech mobile operators are among the most expensive in Europe, we have often reported on Mobil.cz.
Incidentally, this was also confirmed by the telecommunications authority <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>, which drew attention to the fact that the price for an SMS here is higher than in the rest of the European Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission in the field of regulation of roaming charges, it is so likely to come to a paradoxical situation - for some customers of Czech mobile operators, SMS from abroad will be cheaper than at home.
How is it that prices in the Czech Republic are so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, it lacks competition, which really makes a challenge.
Perhaps it sounds paradoxical, in the Czech Republic there are three mobile networks and a penetration of far more than 100%.
Mobile operators, on the other hand, like to complain about the fact that there is an extreme amount of competition on the Czech market.
The Chairman of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Authority (<0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>) Pavel Dvo<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xA1>k, who had often said in the past that there is no room for another provider in the Czech Republic, agrees with this.
It is probably true that a classic provider with its own network no longer has a lot of chances (by the way, it would probably hardly find frequencies anymore).
But there is another possibility - a virtual provider.
The entry of virtual providers into the mobile communications market in particular brought with it a significant price reduction, to which the traditional mobile communications providers then also had to react.
Even before companies such as Tesco Mobile and Virgin Mobile entered the UK market, there were similar voices as in the Czech Republic.
But it has been shown that there is room for such providers and that they can be really successful.
By the way, you do not have to look for examples for a long time.
In February of this we reported on the launch of the virtual provider Mobilking in Poland.
In just half a year, this provider succeeded in attracting more than 100 thousand customers, making it the fifth largest provider in the country.
Mobilking is backed by the financial group Penta, which owns U:fon in the Czech Republic, among others.
The advantage of virtual providers is that you can focus on a much more concrete target group.
In order to function effectively, virtual providers need far fewer customers than a traditional provider.
They do not require a relatively high cost for the construction, operation and maintenance of a mobile network.
In the world, the virtual providers usually distinguish themselves as low-cost companies - they offer cheap phone calls and SMS, but this is often accompanied by a less extensive range of services.
For example, Tesco Mobile in the UK offers SMS at least half cheaper than its competitors.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can also be a pretty good move to bet on a non-cliche target group.
This provider is specifically aimed at men.
“Real guys choose Mobilking – the provider they like and trust,” said David Seibert, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, the operator of this virtual provider.
It is difficult to say whether a similar concept as in Poland could also gain a foothold in the Czech Republic.
The spokesperson for Vodafone Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> also doubts this: "The Czech market is relatively small for a market segment on which most virtual providers are based.
In addition, it is relatively saturated from the point of view of the service offer."
In the Czech Republic, the mobile phone providers mean
However, it is almost certain that if a virtual mobile operator conquers the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
"We are talking about an expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations do not look very hopeful.
Mobilking is more likely to enter the market in other countries in our region," says Jana Studni<0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1>, press officer of the Penta financial group, in a telephone conversation for Mobil.cz.
Indirectly, it confirmed that the current mobile operators in the Czech Republic are not particularly inclined to this idea.
On the contrary, they try to do everything in their power to ensure that no potential competitor is created.
Their interest in starting a virtual mobile service provider has long been demonstrated by the GTS Novera group, which wants to take a further step towards becoming a real competitor of Telef<0xC3><0xB3>nica O2 in the field of corporate customers.
"We have a great interest in offering our customers not only fixed-line but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the sooner, the better.
We have repeatedly negotiated this possibility with all Czech mobile operators.
With some of them, we have already been able to make progress in negotiations," said Pavel Kaidl, press spokesman for the group.
Maybe there will be better times.
Non-official information indicates that the first virtual provider may be expected by the end of the year.
So far, however, this has been surrounded by an insurmountable wall of silence.
"At this moment, we do not assume that there is room in the Czech Republic for a fully-fledged virtual provider.
The Czech market is very specific compared to other markets.
So far, no subject has approached us with a complex and serious project in this area," says Vlastimil Sr<0xC5><0xA1>e<0xC5><0x88> from the press department of Telef<0xC3><0xB3>nica O2 in his statement for Mobil.cz.
Other providers also point to the specifics of the Czech market.
T-Mobile press spokeswoman Martina Kemrov<0xC3><0xA1> adds in rare agreement with the O2 statement: "So far we have not found a viable and mutually beneficial project to build on."
She adds: “There will be hardly any virtual provider on T-Mobile’s network by the end of the year.
At this moment, we would have to have a concrete offer in order to be able to think so short-term."
Vodafone focuses its attention more on meeting the requirements of its own 3G license.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> comments: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual providers, especially in the area of cost-sharing and infrastructure.
This is precisely what we regard as the best from the customer’s point of view.
Vodafone’s main strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a shared network for a fast mobile Internet.”
The responsible authorities - hand in hand with the providers
The approach of mobile operators is easy to understand, another provider would mean more competition, this would lead to falling prices and thus also to a decrease in profits.
So why should it be easier for such a competitor to enter the market?
That the providers can pull together when it comes to something, also proves the long back and forth around the creation of U:fon.
Probably the strongest pressure towards <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> was exerted by T-Mobile when U:fon was launched.
This is also proven by the publicly available information from the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> websites.
Now, however, U:fon is particularly suitable as an argument for why you should not allow a virtual provider.
Martina Kemrov<0xC3><0xA1> commented: "The competitive environment of the mobile communications market was recently strengthened by the market entry of a fourth mobile communications provider.
Taking into account the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that a new player would place high demands on the market itself and, above all, its services."
In view of this approach of mobile operators, however, the absolute disinterest of the Czech regulatory authorities is surprising.
This is not just the attitude of the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>, who unfortunately - unlike the UK and other highly developed countries - do not have the competence to intervene in economic competition in the Czech Republic.
It is exclusively owned by the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (<0xC3><0x9A>OHS).
This, however, related to this entire problem his very typical attitude.
“The market entry of a virtual mobile service provider would then be possible after a contract has been concluded between a mobile service provider and a virtual service provider via the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
So far, no such contract has been concluded, because the offer of potential interested parties was probably not sufficiently interesting for the classic providers", said in his response to our request Kristi<0xC3><0xA1>n Chalupa of the Department of External Relations of the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
Such a formulation would not come as a surprise to representatives of the providers.
This is more than worrying by an authority that is supposed to represent consumer interests and, among other things, ensure that no one abuses its position in the market.
In particular, when Kristi<0xC3><0xA1>n Chalupa adds: "Foreigners, where virtual providers operate normally, it can be observed that their market entry has contributed to a price reduction in mobile telephone services."
But probably the pressure on the correct functioning of the market and a price reduction do not belong to the interests of the OHS.
What is truly shocking in this case is the almost touching harmony of the three mobile service providers, which results from their reactions.
The question of whether it is really just a coincidence is obvious.
Just as the absolutely same price of petrol at petrol stations is certainly just a coincidence and the result of a tough competition.
"The Authority has not detected any sign of anti-competitive action in this matter and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way in the matter.
None of the providers has a dominant market position, so they do not have the corresponding increased responsibility for their actions in the market.
The necessary tools to open the mobile market to virtual providers are probably also lacking for the regulator of telecommunications," Chalupa said in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position in the market is one of many contentious points.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets, elaborated by the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>, according to which telecommunications is a single market from the point of view of economic competition.
In such a market, of course, none of the Czech mobile service providers holds a dominant position.
Some legal experts, however, offer a different view - for the market entry of a virtual provider, the consent of the network operator is always necessary.
And the mobile service provider has - logically - the monopoly for its network.
This means that he necessarily occupies a dominant position in a certain segment.
Even if you do not agree with this argument, it should at least be a warning for the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS that three mobile phone providers are strikingly similar.
Complaints from a number of interested parties (including the mentioned company GTS Novera) show that they encounter very similar obstacles when negotiating with all providers.
The transfer of responsibility to the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> is then a fairly common trick in telecommunications services, with which the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS distances itself from the whole matter.
This has already been observed in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, in the recently adopted amendment to the Telecommunications Act, it has not been possible to enforce the extension of <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>'s competences to the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although a number of experts had promised to improve the situation.
The representatives of the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS need to know this all too well, but they probably have other interests.
It works when no one is looking
First of all, the functioning of any pseudo-virtual providers, of which there are several in the Czech mobile networks, remains unnoticed.
They are companies that issue their own price lists for mobile telecommunications services, but are only partly public.
Usually, these are companies that operate in the field of multilevel marketing.
Own mobile telephone services offer, for example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and others.
The price lists of these companies usually only reach the chosen ones.
The joke of the matter is that the company appears to the operator as a classic corporate customer who orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer, he then receives special price offers (and other offers).
The problem is that the terms and conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit similar resale.
"If there are cases that you describe, then it may be a violation of the contractual conditions that we will then deal with, which may lead to an end of cooperation with the relevant company," Martina Kemrov<0xC3><0xA1> replied to our question on this problem.
However, it is quite unlikely that such a thing does not get around among those responsible for the mobile service providers.
In particular, in the case of the three companies mentioned, there may be thousands of customers.
However, no operator opposes such an approach.
The activities of these companies provide them with not negligible profits, at the same time they are - in contrast to the actual virtual providers - not impaired by the actual official marketing.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> draws attention to possible problems: "The law allows such types of speculation, despite all this, the services of these companies are used only by a very small percentage of customers.
In addition, they must accept that the SIM card in their phone does not run in their name, so they cannot have it fully as the normal customers of the mobile service providers."
But that alone should at least seem strange to the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>.
In addition, another question opens up for the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
If mobile service providers close their eyes to such an approach, why do they block themselves against a virtual provider?
It must be added that the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS has quite strong powers to detect such activities, and if it does not want to, it does not have to be satisfied with the provider’s statement that they know nothing about it and their terms and conditions prohibit it.
When Czech Republic is no longer the most expensive
As has already been emphasised several times in the text, the market entry of virtual providers brought with it a significant drop in the price of the various services.
Virtually in all countries where virtual providers have emerged, traditional providers have tried to prevent their emergence more or less.
The arguments they used were virtually identical - a market that was too small or too saturated, problems with the quality of services, etc.
In the highly developed countries, however, it was precisely in these moments that the regulatory bodies intervened, which by no means tried to protect the interests of mobile operators, but those of their customers.
Be it through formal measures or non-formal pressure, they achieved the creation of the first virtual operator, and this was followed by others.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory bodies throw themselves into the whole case like a hot potato.
Based on our experience, we cannot get rid of the impression that ambiguity in the competences in these cases is more than favorable.
But let’s not throw the gun into the grain.
If the background information is correct and a virtual provider appears soon, the Czech mobile market may soon start moving again.
If a provider allows the creation of a virtual mobile service provider, the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS will not remain inactive when it comes to rejecting (discriminating against) other interested parties.
And the Czechs will then finally make no more expensive calls than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four versions of the new Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek presented the new recordings of the national anthem Wo is my home country in a ceremony on the occasion of the Day of Czech Statehood.
The anthem was newly recorded by the Orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> B<0xC4><0x9B>lohl<0xC3><0xA1>vek.
There are four versions available - with male or female solo vocals, in choral version and in an instrumental version.
The vocal version was performed by Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Kn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD>nkov<0xC3><0xA1> and Adam Plachetka.
The editors of the hymn versions are Otakar Jeremi<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> and Jaroslav Kr<0xC4><0x8D>ek.
On the server iHNed.cz you can listen to all four versions.
For B<0xC4><0x9B>lohl<0xC3><0xA1>vek, the Czech national song is one of the most beautiful hymns.
He had previously told Czech Radio that he had chosen singers for the solo versions with young, representative voices that are distinctive and popular.
"From the beginning, I tried to keep a clear diction with both and then with the choir, so that you understand the text well, so that a harmony is created," says the conductor.
The Czech national anthem will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Kde domov m<0xC5><0xAF>j was first performed on the stage of the Estates Theatre in 1834 in the original Czech play Fidlova<0xC4><0x8D>ka by Josef Kajet<0xC3><0xA1>n Tyl, the music was by Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek <0xC5><0xA0>kroup.
It became popular, and people spontaneously adopted it.
The first stanza of the song then became an organic part of the national anthem after the emergence of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
It remained one of the seven symbols of the state even after the creation of the independent Czech Republic.
What does the "new" song sound like?
Prague’s public transport companies will also transport passengers on a chip for the first time on Wednesday
Wednesday, October 1, 2008, will go down in history as a date when the first passengers will board a subway, tram or bus carrying an electronic coupon in their pocket instead of a paper ticket.
At the moment, about one hundred thousand people who have the Opencard chip card can buy it.
Passengers can purchase a 30-day, 90-day or annual coupon (valid from 1 January 2009) and have it added to their smart card at the same time, at the information centres and branches of the public transport companies at the metro stations Muzeum, M<0xC5><0xAF>stek, N<0xC3><0xA1>dra<0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD> Hole<0xC5><0xA1>ovice, And<0xC4><0x9B>l, Roztyysk, Let<0xC5><0x88>lis.
Since yesterday, the coupons are also available via the Internet on the pages of the transport companies www.dpp.cz.
The service was used by more than four hundred customers until the afternoon hours.
Those who use internet sales can really forget about the output window in the subway stations, where until now they had to wait regularly in long queues for their paper tickets.
You buy the coupon via the Internet, it is stored on the Opencard in one of the thirteen branches of the city library.
"At these points, travellers also have access to a counter with trained staff who can advise interested parties on their Internet purchases and also add the coupon to the card," said Martin Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD>, spokesman for the project.
In addition to the libraries, the electronic coupons can also be played on the open card at self-service machines, which are mounted in some metro vestibules.
What do such machines look like?
They are red, reminiscent of ticket validators, the passengers may have noticed them already in the metro stations Roztyly, Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovick<0xC3><0xA1>, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavsk<0xC3><0xA1>.
"Currently there are five of them in the city, but by the end of the year it should be eighty," adds Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD>.
The coupon controls a vending machine instead of the driver
The operation of the machines, which will work from tomorrow, is easy.
All you have to do is insert the chip card, and the previously purchased coupon will play itself out.
The electronic coupons will be valid from tomorrow not only in the capital, but also in the surrounding area.
So in the suburban trains and on the bus lines with the numbers 300 to 499, with which especially the inhabitants from municipalities of the region Central Bohemia to the capital.
"On the trains that are part of Prague's integrated traffic, the train attendants have reading devices with which they can check the validity period of the coupons by time and zone," explains Filip Dr<0xC3><0xA1>pal of the Ropid organisation, which compiles the timetables for the Prague public transport companies.
The suburban buses have card readers at the driver's desk.
When boarding, the chip card must not only be presented to the driver, but the open card must be placed at a marked location on the side of the ticket office.
In this way, the driver checks the validity of the coupons.
"If a passenger wants to check the validity of the coupons, there is nothing easier than asking the driver for this information," Dr<0xC3><0xA1>pal said.
A passenger who does not use suburban buses and no longer knows when the coupon expires can in turn go to the self-service vending machines, where the coupons are added to the card.
Here the information about the validity of his documents is displayed on the display of the device.
The Sudeten demanded a referendum from the US
The Sudeten Germans had requested the annexation of the Bohemian Forest to the United States in 1945.
This is evident from a letter that is stored in the collections of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
If we cannot be a part of Germany or Austria, we would at least like to live under the auspices of the United States of America.
With such a wish, some groups of Sudeten Germans are said to have turned to the US President in 1945.
This is evident, among other things, from a letter that has been preserved in a private archive and that is now kept in the collections of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
In the letter, the Germans from Krumau ask the American president not to allow the return of the "Sudetengau" - which was captured by Hitler on the basis of the Munich Agreement - to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation correctly and really want to be sure of the words that the American units do not enter German territory as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," read a letter signed with the words "people for whom the fate of the Sudeten lies at the heart."
Since the connection to Czechoslovakia suggests to the Sudeten Germans - knowing the Czech national character - that they would expect brutality, recklessness, incomprehension, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the American president to take over the protection of the Bohemian Forest for today and forever.
"We cannot believe that, regardless of the opinion of a quarter of a million inhabitants of this area, you are ascribing this area to a foreign state which has tried to suppress and eliminate minorities and has contributed nothing at all to the victory of the Allies," the letter reads.
The reason why the authors are unable to sign is allegedly the fear of revenge from the “Czech oppressors”.
If the US President has doubts about the attitude of the Bohemian Forest Germans, it would be sufficient if he would initiate a referendum in the Bohemian Forest region on whether the inhabitants wanted to become part of the US or live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may sound somewhat na<0xC3><0xAF>ve in today's knowledge of post-war history, according to some contemporary witnesses it paints a good picture with regard to the expectations of the Sudeten Germans at that time.
Even if the Bohemian Germans had to at least suspect that they would negotiate their deportation from the republic, only a few of them admitted such a possibility at all.
Some waited for the United States and Britain to negotiate some sort of autonomy for the Sudeten.
Still others believed they could just stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is also confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, who comes from Budweis.
He was used in the war as a Budweiser German in the Navy on the Baltic Sea.
When he was taken into British captivity at the end of the war and taken to a prisoner-of-war camp in Holstein, dozens of other Bohemian Germans came to him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that if they came home, the Czech would suit them," Chalupa said.
In his opinion, none of the German prisoners of war who had lived in Czechoslovakia before the war expected him to be expelled from the republic on the basis of the Bene<0xC5><0xA1> decrees.
If you don’t, then pay.
An emotional campaign aimed at motorists
The most expensive road safety action in Czech history.
This is also how the emotional media campaign, which the Ministry of Transport wants to start on Wednesday, can be characterized.
The authority of Minister Ale<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0x98>eb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek promises to deter drivers from dangerous behaviour behind the wheel.
The campaign for 150 million crowns will run on television, radio, cinema, the Internet, but also on flyers.
It is designed to keep drivers from driving too fast and alcohol at the wheel.
And also remind them to strap on before you start driving.
Above all, the campaign wants to speak to the conscience of young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional drivers.
And what is shown in the spots?
Especially stories of people who appeal to emotions.
This is also evidenced by the "bloody" slogan of the entire campaign:
If you don’t, then pay.
The words "do not think" are written in capital letters on a license plate.
And in a pool of blood is the word "pay."
This means that you can pay for a moment of inattention with your own life.
The spots will "shock" viewers by 2010.
The ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where you can normally see pictures with drastic shots of accident victims.
It is expected that the number of accidents and the number of road deaths on the Czech roads will decrease.
The spots were compiled by the agency Euro RSCG.
Carrot and Whip for Drivers
"For the drivers, the motto applies to carrots and whips.
Carrot means that when they drive in red, for example, they save time.
The whip is then the threat of punishment or an accident.
The driver must be reminded of the risk," said the traffic psychologist of the hospital Na Homolce Martin Ko<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xA1>n.
And that is why information campaigns in the press and above all negative advertising are necessary, says the psychologist.
In his opinion, signs are already less effective, which draw the driver’s attention to a danger.
"If you put up a static sign that warns of a danger, it will probably soon flow with the environment, and the drivers will no longer perceive it," says Ko<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xA1>n.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace
The chairman of the provisional Israeli government, Ehud Olmert, has called for the return of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, including Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, if peace can be made with Palestine and Syria in exchange.
He emphasized this in an interview printed Monday by the daily Jediot Achronot.
“We need to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all (occupied) territories, if not all,” Olmert told the newspaper.
“We retain a certain percentage of these territories, but we will have to cede to the Palestinians a similarly high percentage [of Israeli territory] because there will be no peace without it,” he added.
He acknowledged that a possible return would include East Jerusalem.
“Anyone who wants security in Jerusalem and, above all, does not want tractors or bulldozers rolling over their legs, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to forgo part of Jerusalem,” Olmert said, referring to two attacks in the city in July that killed several people and injured dozens.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find a "special solution for the Temple Mount and sacred and historical places" that lie on the territory of the Old City.
“Whoever wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
That will not work,” he continued.
Departure from the Golan Heights
Olmert called for a withdrawal of Israel from the Golan Heights, which he believes is an indispensable condition for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Syria.
But this would also require some effort on the part of Damascus.
“My proposal is not to make peace with Syria solely on the basis of a withdrawal from the Golan Heights,” Olmert said.
“The Syrians know all too well what they have to do without in order to get the Golan Heights back.
They will have to give up their current relationship with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with the (Shiite) Hezbollah movement; they will have to give up the constant support they give to the terrorism of the (Shiite) Hamas movement, the terrorist network Al-Khaida and jihad (the Holy War) in Iraq," he said.
Questions after the accident: Are stewards on the bus illegal?
The law does not know them, in a long-distance coach, walking around is not allowed
In connection with the tragic accident of a student agency bus near the Italian Padua, the question arises whether stewards and travellers are allowed to walk back and forth on the bus.
"If we were to strictly and formally comply with the law, the activity of a steward would be contrary to the law on road traffic," said Karel Hanzelka, spokesman for the Ministry of Transport.
The accident, which killed a twenty-two-year-old stewardess last week, was probably caused by the driver of the truck crossing the bus.
The young woman was sitting next to the driver at that moment to all misfortune, in the least safe place in the car, although she had two more places available.
However, a bus can also have an accident or brake sharply at the moment in which the steward carries coffee or newspapers.
It also plays a role whether the bus is also equipped with standing places according to the vehicle letter.
If this is not provided on the bus, the passengers must sit.
Student Agency’s long-distance coaches do not have standing places, as the director of the company, Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, confirmed to Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz.
"We discussed this with the ministry, and this did not agree with the movement of travelers at first.
Later, this was taken back, and we reached a consensus that travelers can go to the toilet while driving, if they have their seat," he said.
The law does not have a steward.
"There is no clear legal interpretation for the role of a steward - no legal provision describes this role.
However, there is also no legal provision that prohibits the carrier from providing services.
The law on road traffic only knows the term vehicle attendant; however, it does not define its rights and obligations," the spokesman for the ministry Hanzelka clearly adds.
On the other hand, Josef Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD>, director of the Road Vehicles Department of the Ministry of Transport, says that the law covers this issue retrospectively.
"It depends on whether the bus also has standing places in the product approval.
That is all,” he said.
Buses are divided into city buses, where there are standing places and the maximum speed is limited, local buses with standing places and a higher permitted speed and long-distance coaches without standing places with the highest permissible speed and seats equipped with seat belts.
Like on a plane, says the expert
The BESIP road safety expert Jaroslav Ho<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>n sees no fundamental problem in the movement of stewards on board a bus.
"In the case of a liquid mode of operation, there are not many dangers, the situation is comparable to the service on board an aircraft.
Here, too, it is not certain when turbulence will come, and the stewardess may bump her head."
"However, if a bus brakes sharply, then of course the laws of physics also apply.
Just like a city bus or a tram.
The safety of the stewards must be clarified by the carrier through internal regulations," he says and also means that from the point of view of the law, this issue is not completely solved.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura is ready to cancel the services
Student Agency is the only bus company offering services from stewards.
The company employs about two hundred people in this function.
The director does not consider her profession to be risky even after the accident.
"But as soon as I get the impression that the steward's job is risky, I will delete him.
Coffee and newspapers can be obtained from passengers on board.
It would also reduce costs,” he said.
As an interest in safety, Asiana director Alexej Litvin justifies the absence of stewards in his buses, but his company operates only a fraction of lines compared to Student Agency.
"We don't have stewardesses, we've been fighting back from the start.
Sooner or later this will end in some kind of fatal accident," he told T<0xC3><0xBD>den.cz less than a year ago.
It was an incredible tragedy
In the accident of a regular bus to Naples, a young stewardess from the Pilsen region, who had worked for the company for two years, was injured.
The Slovenian truck had probably turned off the strip without blinking and had blocked the bus from driving.
The driver of the bus tried to dodge by a sharp maneuver, but collided with the right front part of the truck.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura denies that the two seats had been sold for the stewards.
"These places cannot be reserved for long-distance connections, they are blocked."
Company wants to sue truck drivers.
With compensation for the young woman’s family, the agency will not wait for the court ruling, but will also expect financial compensation from the guilty party.
A law change?
Not in sight
A more precise regulation of the movement of stewards on board a bus could bring a legal regulation, which a thirty-person team of experts from the Ministry of Transport has been working on for over a year.
“However, this has not yet reached a concrete conclusion.
Buses are also not necessarily on the agenda, rather the points system, the maximum speed on the motorway and the use of mobile phones when driving," says expert Ho<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>n.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of the stewards as something that could significantly endanger the safety of travellers," said Hanzelka, with the control of the safety of buses being the competence of the police and the occupational safety authorities.
Düsseldorf hopes rest on Frankfurt
There is no lack of big words in the letter from the WestLB Executive Board to the employees of the house.
Merging units of the Düsseldorf financial institution with the Frankfurt Deka Bank could create “the central capital market house of the Sparkassen-Finanzgruppe”, according to the letter announced on Monday.
WestLB would bring a "block of competence" with sustainable profitability into such a business.
And in general, such a link could be the decisive impetus for further bundling in the Landesbanken sector.
This is how it reads when a board wants to demonstrate ability to act in difficult times.
Because the battered WestLB is still under enormous pressure.
Not only on the part of the EU Commission, but also by the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority, which the North Rhine-Westphalian state government has only recently made clear, push the time to find a solution for the future.
However, the connection between Deka-Bank, which savings bank customers know about because of its investment funds, and WestLB has been talked about for some time now - also on the Frankfurt side.
Although Deka Bank CEO Franz Waas said at the presentation of the half-yearly figures at the end of August, he does not see any sense in a merger of the house on Mainzer Landstra<0xC3><0x9F>e with a Landesbank, such as Helaba or WestLB.
However, the Board of Directors of Deka, which is each half supported by the Landesbanken and the Sparkassenverb<0xC3><0xA4>nde, has commissioned the Executive Board to hold talks with WestLB about joint business activities.
This could be the capital market business or parts of it.
The talks, it is said in the financial center, have only just begun.
The Deka Bank, which with its 3,000 employees is one of the more important employers in the Frankfurt financial centre, is not the first to be mentioned when it comes to consolidation in the savings bank sector.
In 2003, it looked as if Deka-Bank could merge with Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and Helaba.
However, nothing came of this trinity.
As soon as the plans had become public, the Hessian state government spoke out against Helaba’s participation in them.
The other two houses did not find each other.
Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz went instead to Landesbank Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart.
But there have always been thought games about a connection between the Deka-Bank and Landesbanken.
Most recently, however, Günther Merl, CEO of Helaba, had spoken out against planning games about going together with his house.
Irrespective of this, however, the realization seems to be ripening that a rapprochement of the various houses of the public sector is a necessity.
Now that the state election in Bavaria is over, a connection between BayernLB and Landesbank Baden-Württemberg could be the first to move closer.
For the Helaba, this is not necessarily good news.
If the pressure for further mergers increases, the partners gradually go out for it.
In the south, she would only be a junior partner, although she has survived the financial crisis much better than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
In turn, the savings bank and Giroverband Hessen-Thüringen, which holds an 85 percent stake in Helaba, put a stop to the merger with West LB at the beginning of the year.
Stayed at Nord LB at the most.
However, such geostrategic considerations are only one side.
On the other hand, the question is how the different business models of the individual houses fit together.
In June, Merl said that the crucial question of which business model should be used to ensure the future viability of the Landesbanken had not yet been answered by the German Savings Banks and Giro Association.
In the end, the West LB could also be dismantled, which, of course, is not desired there.
So in the letter of the local board of directors, it is also mentioned that a "total solution" for the house will be sought in any case.
How this can be reconciled with the merging of individual units with the Deka Bank remains to be seen.
The second weekend of the Wiesn is known as the "Italian weekend"
For Elena it is the first time, for Luca already the third or fourth time.
But this time Elena is with him as his girlfriend, and so everything is different, he says.
Behind them, at the five-litre beer keg of the Kaiser brand, stands a massively built bearded tiger and proves to the approximately 200 Oktoberfest travellers what deep tones his throat can produce.
Elena gives Luca a slap, then a kiss.
They came to Verona from Bologna.
From here, the bus parking lot next to the train station Puorta Nuova, four buses, "destinazione Monaco, festa della birra", will depart this evening at 23:45, arriving expected at 6:30.
Three buses are mainly reserved for the Italians, in one bus only Brazilians travel.
In a corner of the parking lot, the South Americans sing next to their flag already, they have already celebrated in the night.
And so loud, Marco Guarda says, this is not for Italians.
Marco, who wears a long coat lined with fur and glasses with wide silver temples, owns the buses.
They have been going to Oktoberfest for five years, three tours this year alone.
At night, during the day on the Wiesn, at 22.30 clock back.
Staying overnight would only mean unnecessary expenses, says Marco.
75 Euro costs the trip, the welcome drink with Kaiser beer, brewed in accordance with the Bavarian purity law, the health insurance and the German-speaking tour guide - Marco attended a language course in Frankfurt - inclusive.
And already the buses roll into the night, on the Autostrada direction "Brennero".
There is no beer, not yet.
It quickly becomes quiet on the bus, the travelers sleep.
Good, they'll still need their powers.
It will be held in Bressanone and in Holzkirchen, where several other buses with Italian registration plates will take a break on the Autobahn 8 just before Munich.
When Marcos group finally arrives at the parking lot near the Theresienwiese at half past seven in the morning, there are already 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco gives a final speech, explains the plan of attack.
First, put on the yellow cap.
On the left is "Oktoberfest", in Fraktur, next to it the Internet address of Marco's travel agency: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second: "When the doors to the beer tent open, it means running!", Marco calls in the morning.
"Run!" Run and occupy the seats in the back of the tent.
"Not in front, otherwise we block, and not all yellow caps on the same benches, spread in the room!"
The measure, Marco yells, costs 8.25 euros.
And don't forget to tip.
"The security people show that we are behaving well!
As soon as you leave the seats, they’re gone!”
Third: "To get back here at half past eleven tonight!" Got it?
And now we're off to the Wiesn.
Along the way, a yellow cap binds as waymarks to the trees, to signs and even to the electoral poster of a large Bavarian People’s Party.
They want to be prepared for withdrawal.
It is the second week-end of the vineyard, known as the "Italian weekend".
There are no exact figures; we are talking about 50 000 who make their way across the Alps and fall into the beer tents, and ten percent of all visitors are supposed to have come from Italy this weekend.
The Munich police force is reinforced by seven police officers from South Tyrol, while Italian volunteers support the Bavarian Red Cross, which has a nation-wide statistics in which the Italians take first place ahead of the British (about 60 missions) and Austrians (about 80) with around 200 medical services.
The Hofbr<0xC3><0xA4>uzelt is particularly popular with Italians.
Sleepless nights for creditors of Hypo Real Estate
The German banking system is relatively stable, said German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück only last week.
How good that the politician used the word "relative" and also interwoven that the German banking sector is not spared from the crisis-prone developments.
Because it happened this weekend.
Munich-based real estate financier Hypo Real Estate (HRE), listed in the Dax, receives a billion-dollar loan from a consortium of German banks in order to shield itself from the turbulence in the markets.
A person familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday that the loan assistance amounted to up to 35 billion euros.
Hypo Real Estate only has to pay interest on the part it claims.
The money comes from both private and public banks.
The background is losses to the daughter Depfa.
According to a newspaper report for long-term projects for which he has loaned money, the state financier had refinanced himself extremely short-term - which is no longer possible because of the distrust in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank’s cash reserve had shrunk by 95 percent to 2.37 million euros, and the equity ratio had also declined slightly from 1.6 to 1.45 percent.
Current income and net income from financial activities fell to zero compared to the same period of the previous year, while income from attributions to receivables and certain securities and from the reversal of provisions in the credit business fell by more than 70 percent to EUR 5 million.
Only thanks to higher income from reimbursements of downstream transfer costs from the restructuring of the former Depfa Group as well as from the reimbursement of interest according to the tax regulations and from the business procurement for Group companies, the decline in earnings was still moderate at around 16 percent.
The former state financier had speculated after its privatization in 1990 first with commercial real estate loans, which had then been spun off in the Aareal Bank.
Because they earned too little in traditional state financing, the Depfa had then become increasingly involved in infrastructure projects and the financing of joint projects of private investors and the state (Private Public Partnership, PPP) and diversified internationally.
On the value of the subsidiary, the Hypo Real Estate must now make depreciations that will have a "substantial material effect" on the profit and loss account of the group, it is said to be quite indefinite.
The fact is that the dividend has been cancelled.
In 2007, it was cut by two-thirds.
Hypo Real Estate has been a major state and infrastructure financier since the acquisition of Depfa.
It is more dependent than other institutions on refinancing in the interbank market because it has no customer deposits.
With the collapse of the American investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, lending among the banks has largely dried up again, as the banks hoard their liquidity.
Every year, Hypo Real Estate needs short-term funding to refinance part of Depfa’s loan portfolio – around EUR 50 billion.
According to Hypo Real Estate, the financing needs of the group are covered by the loan for the foreseeable future and the company is "shielded from the influence of the currently largely inoperable international money markets".
From other sources, it can be heard that thanks to the funds, the refinancing was secured until the end of 2009.
HRE CEO Georg Funke said that the Hypo Real Estate Group will no longer have to use the money markets for the foreseeable future.
The Bundesbank and the Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht (BaFin) assume that the marketability of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now secured.
This is to be hoped for by shareholders and creditors of the bank.
But given the dynamics and uncertainties of the crisis, there is probably no certainty.
In fact, it is not inconceivable that the financing does not have to be used to its full extent.
But also the opposite is not to be worn out.
Since the bank was reportedly still facing insolvency on late Sunday evening, even the at least temporary rescue is not able to calm the minds.
The share price plunges by 75 percent to EUR 3.30.
On the other hand, bond prices hold up quite well.
While the senior debt hardly shows any movement, the prices of subordinated bonds give off more clearly.
Above all, the bonds of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo and, understandably, the maturities beyond 2009 are affected.
If Hypo-Real-Estate-Bonds once appeared as a speculative investment alternative, then after the significant worsening of the banking crisis and the institution itself, which had only brought the crisis into its own hands with the takeover of the Depfa, its value must be regarded as dependent on the stability of the international financial system.
As long as central banks, governments and less distressed commercial banks are ready to support the system, it can be assumed that pensions will be paid out on time.
Or something that hardly anyone dares to hope for at the moment – that the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
But in view of the reports that are sweeping over with the partial nationalization, the probability that borders on security has currently become only a legitimate hope.
This should prepare especially long-term believers some sleepless nights with the decision whether they should part with their engagements.
After all, short-term investors can use a closing line to make a loss carry forward for future withholding tax payments on price gains of later years.
Sylvana and the Secrets of the Bento Box
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, is supposed to introduce herself on the first day of school at Tachibana High School, the girls start giggling: The German is totally "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from manga - in the new exchange log she tells about Japan.
"The first day of school in Japan.
I was excited.
Even before school, I had a blast.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo in the direction of Kawasaki and drive 40 minutes by train to Tachibana High School.
I had to find the way alone, fortunately I did not get lost.
The start of classes at Tachibana does not seem to be as strict as at our home in Lower Saxony.
The students enter from eight o'clock until at twenty to nine a short meeting with the teacher begins, the 'home room'.
But before class started, it was my turn to introduce myself.
I’m not the kind of person who likes to talk in front of people, or even in front of a class of 40 students.
Because I didn't have a school uniform yet, I put on an old skirt of my host mother, with blouse, blue knee socks and black leather shoes.
So in this elevator I stood in front of the desk and tried to say everything correctly: 'Sayonara Wo she Sylvana...' - my name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and I have a birthday in a week.
At that moment I was very happy that I had already started to learn the language a good two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class all chatted, giggled and waved and I kept hearing the word "Kawaii".
I knew that from my manga.
It belongs to the essential vocabulary of Japanese girls and means 'cute, sweet'.
Then I quickly rushed to my place.
The girl next to me grinned quite broadly, she found it an honor that the exchange student should sit next to her.
The rest of the hour was quite quiet, but when the gong sounded, I was downright stormed.
Everyone was talking and giggling and asking me holes in my stomach - it's really hard to understand Japanese English.
During the break, everyone unpacked their Bentos.
My host mother had also made me a lunch box - that's something different than the boring German break bread.
I had rice with herbs, small sausages, salad of cucumbers and algae, fruit and a kind of meat in the tofu coat.
Most of the time I have no idea what I eat here in Japan.
Things look strange and taste completely new.
It is clear that everything is really delicious.
Well, except for the salty pickled plums maybe, brrrr!
The Bentos are not just lunches at Japanese schools.
It sometimes happens that a girl gives a boy a homemade bento, which she then makes especially artfully - in the hope of getting to know the boy at the break snack.
I read about it in my manga comics.
I wonder if I can watch it here too.
'Why Japan?' my friends asked me when I told them that I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
I always said:
“Because it fascinates me.”
I’ve loved reading manga for years.
And in order to better understand the comics and the culture in them, I also started to learn a little Japanese at some point.
So it was clear to me that I had to travel here at some point.
Because I also have a weakness for tradition, customs and customs.
And they attach great importance here.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends - on the other hand, it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I haven’t felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I’ve ever seen.”
Rats have feelings too.
A rat or a cockroach flees in the event of danger, does that mean that it also feels fear?
The neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that many animals also have feelings.
Just how can you check if they feel the same way when they behave in a similar way to us?
The Internet magazine "Edge" has been publishing contributions by famous scientists for several years.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents a series of selected answers to the question "What do you think is true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have sensations and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else being able to prove this so far where we can not even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case, we can at least hope, since all human brains have the same basic configuration.
However, as soon as we turn to other species and address issues of feeling or consciousness in general, we enter rough terrain because the hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same as many other animals: it poses dead, flees, or attacks.
Humans behave similarly, from which some scientists conclude a comparable subjective experience.
But I don't believe that.
Two aspects of brain structure make it difficult to transfer our subjective experience to that of animals.
On the one hand, the circuits almost always associated with human consciousness include the lateral prefrontal cortex (because of its involvement in short-term memory and in the execution/control functions).
This broad region is much more developed in humans than in other primates and seems to be completely absent in other creatures.
So, at least in those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, including knowing who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, there is reason to believe that man is even different from the other primates.
Another dramatic peculiarity may lie in the linguistic nature of man: Since so much of his experience is connected with language, it is often said that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
But even if consciousness did not depend on language, it would certainly influence it, so animal consciousness, however it may be, is likely to be very different from most of our states of consciousness.
Therefore, it is difficult to determine what consciousness may look like in other animals.
If, as something internal and subjective, it can neither be measured nor, because of the special hardware, analyzed on the basis of our own experience, its exploration presents us with great problems.
Most of my remarks relate to the content of conscious experience, but there is also another aspect of consciousness that should be more easily accessible scientifically.
One could study the consciousness processes of animals regardless of their content, and this is exactly what happens in studies on the short-term memory of primates, especially using the example of visualization.
But in this approach, which Christof Koch and Francis Crick followed, one shifts more to the neural correlates of consciousness than to the causal mechanisms: both may or may not be identical.
Interestingly, this approach also emphasizes the importance of the prefrontal cortex for the emergence of visualization.
What is the result of the sensations?
I attribute it to the fact that an emotional system like that of fear is activated in a brain conscious of its own activity.
So what we call “fear” is the mental state we find ourselves in when the activity of the brain’s localized defense system (or its consequences, such as physical reactions) occupies working memory.
Seen in this way, sensations are closely tied to the regions of the cortex that distinguish primates and, in particular, humans.
In combination with the linguistic nature, there are subtle gradations of feeling, because with the help of words and grammar we can differentiate and categorize states in order to attribute them to others besides ourselves.
In contrast, Antonio Damasio, for example, believes that sensations arise from more primitive activities in the body-feeling regions of the cortex and brainstem, similar to Jaak Pankseep, who, however, focuses more on the brainstem.
Since this network has not changed much in the course of human evolution, it may well be involved in cross-genre sensations.
Theoretically, I cannot disagree with this, but I think it is unprovable.
Pankseep argues that what seems like fear in rats and humans probably feels the same in both cases: but how can one check whether rats and humans feel the same if they behave similarly?
A cockroach flees in danger if it also feels fear?
In my view, mere behavioral similarity cannot yet prove an equality of experience.
Although the neural comparison helps further: rats and humans have similar brain strains, cockroaches do not even have a brain.
But is the brainstem responsible for sensations?
And even if you could prove it for humans, how would you prove it in rats?
I believe that rats and other mammals, maybe even cockroaches (who knows?), have sensations.
But I don't know how to prove it.
And because their sensations are probably fundamentally different from ours (since human consciousness is based on special circuits and on language), I’d rather explore the emotional behavior than the emotional sensations of rats.
In any case, progress on the neural level beckons here, provided one measures the same in rats and humans.
Just as I do not explore language and consciousness in rats, nor do I explore sensations, I do not know whether they exist.
You might think that’s short-sighted, but I’d rather go ahead than run into a wall all the time.
I am a practical emotionalist.
UEFA President Platini: Time for Poland and Ukraine to be pardoned
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Vasjunik said that the preparations would soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the President and Prime Minister.
“The government sees the decision of UEFA in Bordeaux as a vote of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to host the European Championship together with Poland,” Vasjunik said.
“This is not an amnesty for our country.
Work has only just begun and there is still a lot of work to be done in both countries.”
In the schedule for the construction or reconstruction of the stadiums, roads, hotels and airports, the two hosts lag behind.
It may even reduce the number of EM stages from eight to six.
“We can’t waste any more time.
We now have to work at top speed," Ukrainian Federation President Grigory Surkis said.
"UEFA will keep a constant eye on us."
An even more radical step was taken in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish association PZPN has been suspended by the National Olympic Committee after numerous scandals and replaced by the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The Commission had met at the request of Minister of Sport Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
“There is a serious danger that the PZPN will not be able to act according to the rules,” Drzewiecki told the Polish news agency PAP.
"We have assured UEFA President Michel Platini in a letter that the preparation for the Euro 2012 will not suffer."
Several first division clubs had been sentenced to forced relegation for manipulation in the past season alone, after all, even the league start had to be postponed at short notice.
Infuriated Dennis Quaid Strikes Back
She wanted to promote a new film, talked in the interview about privates - and now has trouble with the ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan outed her ex Dennis Quaid as an adulterer.
He foams - and hits back.
Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors are now having an unsightly argument with each other - in public.
In an interview with InStyle magazine last week, Ryan said, “Dennis was unfaithful to me for a long time, and it was very painful.”
She did not find out the extent of the fraud until after the divorce.
The reason for the soul striptease was Ryan's press work for her new film "The Women" - tells the story of an adultery.
Dennis Quaid’s reaction to his outing as an unfaithful husband was clear: “It’s monstrous,” the 54-year-old told the New York Daily News, that “Meg again chews and re-seals the story of our relationship.”
"It is regrettable that the joint 16-year-old son Jack is again publicly reminded of the pain and upheavals that mean a divorce for every child."
While Ryan has been living alone since the divorce, Quaid is remarried and recently became a father to twins.
And so his admissions close with the side blow: "My life goes on anyway.
I’m happy to have a wonderful family that is doing very well.”
Prices for airline tickets and hotels fall
In the first half of 2008, flights and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
According to a recent study, flights in Germany were even up to 50 percent cheaper.
Flights and overnight stays in hotels have become cheaper again - this is the result of a study by travel and financial services provider American Express.
The Company analysed its H1 2008 accounting data and, following a rise in prices in the first quarter, recorded a significant slump in the second quarter.
After the prices on the hotel market have risen for years, the overnight stays have already been reduced in many places.
From January to March, prices in 41 out of 48 European cities surveyed rose by an average of 6.9 percent compared to 2007.
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than in the previous year.
The trend was most evident in Paris and Rome, where travelers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than a year earlier.
The reason for this is American Express' weak dollar exchange rate, which has led to a "decreasing desire to travel by American tourists".
Financial centres such as Frankfurt or London are also more affected by the fall in hotel prices than industrial locations such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices even hold the record in Europe with an increase of 26.3 percent.
The trend in air fares also showed an upward trend in the first quarter:
Because of the kerosene tax, passengers in the economy class had to pay on average 7.1 percent more than in 2007, fuel-intensive long-haul flights were even up to 29.2 percent more expensive.
From April to June, prices for economy-class airline tickets fell by an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, but in the business and first class, the price changes were much lower.
In Germany, prices plummeted even more than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices had risen by 11.9 percent, falling by 23.6 percent in the second quarter.
On German domestic flights, prices have even halved, according to the study.
The reason for the price slump is, on the one hand, the declining economic growth, the company explains.
Demand in many segments of the air travel market is crumbling.
On the other hand, the Open Skies agreement, which liberalizes air traffic between the US and Europe, puts increased competitive pressure.
A sign of the tense situation is the cancellation of unprofitable routes at airlines, as well as the high number of airlines that had declared bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 - in Europe alone, this was 24 airlines.
HSV beats Gladbach 1:0
With a goal and simple methods, the Hamburger SV becomes the leader of the standings.
At Borussia, Luhukay still fails to find a functioning elf.
From Kristoffer Klein enlarge crash landing for international player Marko Marin.
The Gladbacher came into the game late and failed with a lift to the bar.
His message was precisely formulated, she convincingly went over his lips.
He simply knew he was right.
"We need the second goal," hissed Hermann Rieger in the cabin corridor of the Hamburg Arena.
There was not much going on in the catacombs, the half-time break was over and most of them were sitting in their seats again.
Rieger has been a physiotherapist at HSV for almost three decades, and he enjoys a higher reputation than some of the past actors.
And so his request was also heard in the responsible place.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol nodded and raised his thumb in agreement.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg head coach Martin Jol.
Its command will have been similar: Come with gate two!
The implementation did not take place.
"Everything wasn't nice to look at today," Marcell Jansen later admitted.
Bastian Reinhardt would have liked it more “relaxedly”.
The 1-0 (1:0) was due to the header of Mladen Petric (11th); and the fact that very weak Gladbachers could not hurt the weak Hamburgers.
"It was a dirty victory," Martin Jol summed up.
The Hamburger SV will be 121 years old this Monday.
On Saturday afternoon, the spectators celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena and the flash table on the video wall, which showed their club as the first class.
It will be a birthday without a real party.
"We know how to classify that," Marcell Jansen said.
He suspects that the tabular intermediate witness stands more for the unpredictability of the league than for the dominance of its HSV.
The team with its late-committed additions - the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the goal scorer Petric as well as the FC Bayern recruited Jansen - finds itself slow, but is not yet able to shine.
"We need more flair and more dribbling," demanded Jol.
After the defeat of the vote
There is fear on Wall Street.
First news of the failure of the rescue package caused the Dow Jones to drop by 700 points at times.
That was the biggest loss in a day in its history.
Later, the Dow caught on again.
At around 8:30 p.m., the world’s most important stock market barometer recorded a good five percent minus at 10,579 counters.
The Nasdaq technology exchange was down 1548 points with more than seven percent.
The biggest loser at the time was on the Dow American Express, which lost just under 14 percent and the Bank of America with a loss of around 12 percent.
No title could win.
Goldman Sachs shares fell by nearly 10 percent.
Just a few days ago, major investor Warren Buffett had invested in the company.
As part of the rescue plan, the funds for the purchase of so-called rotten mortgage papers are to be provided.
However, the sum is not to be paid in one fell swoop, but gradually.
In return, the state should receive stock option certificates from the financial companies, which could be redeemed if the price changes accordingly, in order to reduce the burden on the state treasury.
Stock prices in Europe and the USA in a downward trend
The billions of dollars in aid to banks in Europe and the US do not solve investors’ doubts.
The stock price of the German major bank Hypo Real Estate is plummeting and ripping the Dax down.
The U.S. Dow Jones index is losing despite the state’s planned bailout of the financial market.
Spectacular price losses by Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank have plunged the German stock index (Dax).
Despite the bailout by the German government and private banks, the shares of the Munich real estate financier temporarily lost three-quarters of their value, and Commerzbank declined by more than 20 percent.
The Dax clearly slipped below the psychologically important 6000-point mark and scored with a decrease of 3.7 percent at 5,839 points.
Stock markets around the world have fallen to their knees.
In New York, Wall Street opened with significant losses.
Investors feared that the $700 billion bailout package from the U.S. government might not be enough to reinvigorate financial markets.
The Dow lost 334 points or 3.3 percent to 10,809.25 points in the first hour of trading.
The U.S. House of Representatives wanted to vote on the rescue plan, the vote in the Senate could follow on October 1.
The other European stock exchanges also knew only one direction: in London, the FTSE index initially declined by 3.2 percent, the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia, the Japanese leading index Nikkei fell by 1.26 percent to 11,743.61 points after initial gains.
In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index slipped 2.1 percent to 18,286.90 points.
In India, the leading index Sensex lost 506.43 points or 3.9 percent and closed at 12,595.75 points.
In the MDax, shares of Arcandor declined following the announcement of a capital increase.
Private bank Sal. Oppenheim has subscribed the 23 million new shares.
The retail and tourism group also announced that the shares in Thomas Cook will not be sold.
Dark Matter Affects Flight of Space Probes
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has caused perplexity in research: dark matter influences the speed of spacecraft during so-called swing-by maneuvers.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity may not be entirely correct.
For almost 18 years, the Ulysses spacecraft flew through space.
Due to the soon-freezing fuel lines, she is now in danger of cold death.
Among scientists, a mysterious phenomenon has been causing confusion for years - the swing-by anomaly.
The swing-by is a flight maneuver of spacecraft in which they receive additional momentum in the gravitational field of a celestial body, such as Earth.
As a result, the probes can save a lot of fuel.
The European-American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick as well as the solar probe Ulysses.
What the researchers have been wondering for years, however, is that the missiles do not behave 100 percent as one would expect under the time-honored law of gravity.
There are irregularities in the speed.
The probes unexpectedly become faster or slower.
So far, the physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
They christened him swing-by anomaly.
Some experts fear that perhaps even Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity, which describes the attraction of matter through a curvature of space, may not be entirely correct.
The American physicist Stephen Adler from Princeton’s Institute for Advanced Study still firmly believes that Einstein was not wrong, and tries to explain the swing-by anomaly using the so-called dark matter that astronomers have identified in the universe.
“The anomaly could be caused by dark matter, which could also be very close to the Earth,” he writes.
The existence of dark matter has only been known to space researchers for about ten years.
It obviously exerts an attraction, the effect of which on other celestial bodies can be observed.
On the other hand, it itself is completely invisible, i.e. it does not transmit and reflect any electromagnetic radiation, in particular also no visible light.
According to the calculations of the scientists, dark matter makes up at least one fifth of the total mass of the universe.
Tourists abducted in Egypt are free
After ten days in the hands of their kidnappers, the tourists abducted in Egypt should be free again, as the Italian Foreign Minister confirmed.
The kidnappers from Sudan had demanded several million euros in ransom money.
In a pre-release shootout, six hostage-takers are said to have been killed.
In the south of Egypt, five Germans have been kidnapped.
The ransom negotiations are already underway.
Again and again, Germans are being targeted by kidnappers.
WORLD ONLINE presents the most important cases.
European tourists in the Sahara seem to be free.
This was reported by Egyptian state television, the Arab TV channel Al-Arabiya and Italian media alike.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release after reports from Italian TV channel Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and the other hostages have been freed.
We are currently checking their state of health," Frattini said.
The five Germans, five Italians and a Romanian as well as their eight Egyptian companions are safe and sound, reported the Egyptian state television.
The 19 participants of a desert expedition are already on their way to Cairo.
The background of a shooting before the hostages were released remains unclear: according to an Egyptian security official, the kidnappers were ready to end the kidnapping, before the Sudanese army surprisingly killed six of the kidnappers.
“The problem was solved.
They agreed to a ransom," the official said.
It was “just a matter of taking the hostages” when suddenly “this surprise” came.
Sudanese soldiers shot and killed six of the kidnappers on Sunday in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt, and arrested two of them.
The hostage-takers had demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany; the money was to be handed over by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The daily El Masri El Jom, citing a German intermediary, reported that the release of the hostages was delayed because the kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers want to release the female hostages after payment of the ransom.
The men were to be detained until the kidnappers had a safe escape route.
The German embassy in Cairo declined to comment on the report.
Abuse of stepfather 'led to suicide'
The years of abuse by her stepfather have led to a woman killing herself, a court has reported.
Michael Trerise, 57, from Stithians, Cornwall, received a six-year prison sentence after confessing to eight cases of sexual abuse.
The Truro Criminal Court learned that he regularly tied up his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle when she was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a confession: "I feel responsible for her death."
The court heard that Ms Randle had committed suicide at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on 1 April 2007 at the age of 34.
When she lived in Coventry as a child, Trerise tied her up and closed her eyes before performing sexual acts while her mother was away to work in a restaurant.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s and he moved back to Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
However, the court learned that Ms. Randle, who spent much of her time volunteering for the National Trust, was being persecuted for the abuse that had been inflicted on her twice a week.
Prosecutor Ramsay Quaife told the court that friends had said that Ms Randle, who had been a keen surfer and cyclist, had been “emotionally dead” since 2006 and had “given up her life”
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her Plymouth apartment.
She is believed to have killed herself by suffocating herself with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a letter of confession that ended in this way: "I used to tie her up and connect her eyes."
“I didn’t force them sexually.
I feel responsible for her death.”
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: "You are an extremely strange fetishist and it must have been terrifying for your victim, especially since she was only seven.
This unpleasant story ends with the suicide of the victim.
Worse still is the fact that it is very unlikely that the matter would have ended in court if it had not done so."
He added: "I take note of the impact, according to Stephanie's father and mother's description, her act has had on her daughter over the years.
Otherwise, she would have been a promising, successful and happy young woman.”
Officials responsible for lost data are charged
The BBC has learned that the cabinet official, who lost highly confidential documents on a train in June, will be charged under the Public Security Act.
The man was seconded to the Department of Defense when he lost two extremely confidential documents on a train to Waterloo.
The documents were handed over to the BBC before being handed over to the police.
It is the weakest charge within the law and there is no indication of criminal intent.
BBC Defence Correspondent Frank Gardner said the action was a surprise to many at Whitehall.
He said, "You would have thought that would be dealt with internally at the Department of Defense and Cabinet."
The employee whose name cannot be named will be charged in accordance with paragraph 8.1 of the Act, the clause that deals with the safekeeping of information.
The Royal Prosecution Service recommended that the officer be indicted by the Metropolitan Police for the highly sensitive nature of his work on the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents he published contained classified assessments of al-Qaeda and the capabilities of the Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was taken from his home to a secret location.
Housing companies look at B&B costs
British housing companies could face costs of more than <0xC2><0xA3>80 million after rescuing Bradford and Bingley Bank.
The government provided <0xC2><0xA3>14 billion to protect Bradford & Bingley’s 2.6 million customers.
The interest on this loan is paid by all companies that receive money from investors, including the 59 construction companies.
Adrian Coles, director general of the Association of Housing Associations (BSA), said it was “unbearable” that the companies and their members would have to pay.
The 14 billion loan will eventually be repaid when Bradford & Bingley’s loans are repaid.
But the interest accumulated in the meantime is credited each year to those 700 financial companies that accept deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Programme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 housing associations were included in this figure.
It is bitter that those institutions that have been prudent ... are now called upon to bear some of the costs of those institutions that have been far less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It said that each company would have to pay relative to the deposits it would hold, and that the companies together would have to pay about 18% of the costs.
The Treasury estimates that interest on the loan will be <0xC2><0xA3>450 million in 2009.
This means that the companies will have to raise <0xC2><0xA3>81 million for the first year’s interest.
Adrian Coles, director general of the Association of Housing Companies, told the BBC that he believes this is unfair.
It is bitter that those institutions that behaved prudently during the real estate boom are now called upon to bear some of the costs of those institutions that were far less prudent.
According to the BSA, no society has failed since the records were in existence in 1945.
"We will be watching all aspects of this matter over the next few weeks to see what alternatives there are to protect housing companies and their members from potentially significant costs."
The interest rates due in 2009 cover the seven months from the end of September this year to the end of March.
In 2010, interest rates are due for a full year and that could be almost twice as much.
Since construction companies are mutual organizations without shareholders, their members will have to pay for the costs either through higher fees or lower interest rates on savings accounts.
Milk becomes five pence per liter more expensive
The people of Jersey are faced with having to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy has announced that it will raise the wholesale price of its milk by another five pence per litre from Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after a two-pence increase in February, and comes after investigations were conducted by a consulting firm.
Retailers should decide for themselves whether they want to pass on the price increase to their customers.
Before the price increase in February, the wholesale price of Jersey milk last changed in 2002.
Bangladesh's former prime minister denied bail
A Bangladeshi court has rejected a bail application from former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, meaning she could be arrested if she returns to the country.
Her defense lawyers said the court refused bail regarding the charge of extorting 50 million taka ($729,700) from a businessman while she was prime minister.
The case is one of several pending charges of corruption against her.
Sheikh Hasina’s longtime political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina is due to return to Bangladesh in the next few weeks, but her party, the Awami Alliance, demanded that the military-backed transitional government first grant her full freedom.
Correspondents say that although her detention has been granted to go abroad for medical treatment, it is not clear as part of her release whether she will be able to remain at large if she returns to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers say she will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the Supreme Court’s decision.
"The upper court has rejected Sheikh Hasina's bail request because it says she does not need to be granted bail because she is already on detention suspension abroad to be treated abroad," said her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
We will file a legal complaint against the upper court."
Her lawyers claim that she needs bail to return to the country from abroad to prepare for the December elections.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return home after Oct. 17, an Awami Alliance party leader said Sunday.
She was detained last year after the army-backed transitional government took power, but was released from prison in June to go abroad for medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia deny all charges against themselves.
Fears about the anti-polio initiative in Afghanistan
In the latest anti-polio initiative in Afghanistan, nearly 200,000 children have not been vaccinated due to the violence associated with the Taliban, according to the United Nations.
Last week, the United Nations implemented a vaccination program in six provinces.
However, they were unable to reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for safety reasons.
According to a spokesman for the UN, this was the case despite the Taliban’s promise not to attack or obstruct the thousands of workers carrying out the vaccinations.
BskyB loses lawsuit in ITV case
BskyB has lost its lawsuit against the Competition Commission’s decision to reduce its stake in the competing broadcaster ITV.
The Competition Court ordered BskyB to reduce its stake in ITV from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
Previously, the Commission had claimed that the share of BskyBs distorts competition and allows it to have an unfair influence on the ITV channel.
BskyB acquired its stake in 2006 by successfully preventing NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Competition Authority reported that BskyB’s purchase of the stake in ITV raised doubts about the independence of ITV, prompting the Competition Commission to launch an investigation.
The Virgin boss Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and the Communications Office Ofcom have spoken out against the purchase.
BskyB argued that the pressure to reduce its share of ITV was an unreasonable and exaggerated measure, especially because BskyB had announced that it wanted to give up its voting rights.
New Investigation into the US Attorney's Affair
The U.S. Attorney General has hired a special investigator to deal with the dismissal of the nine prosecutors in the U.S. in 2006.
The occasion was a report by the Inspector General of the Ministry of Justice, in which the actions of the administration employees were criticized.
The report drew criticism from White House officials, lawmakers, and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was driven by fears that the lawyers had been dismissed for political reasons.
Special investigator Nora Dannehy is now to clarify whether the officers interrogated during the investigation have lied to the investigators in order to obstruct the justice.
Serious allegations including criminal activity have not been fully investigated or clarified, Inspector General Glenn Fine said in his report.
The appointment of a special investigator with the authority to compel the witnesses to testify was one of his main recommendations.
The conflict began when the Department of Justice removed nine U.S. prosecutors from their offices in December 2006.
At the time, the ministry argued that the prosecutors would be dismissed due to poor work performance.
However, it was later found that the dismissed prosecutors had been judged no worse than many of their peers, prompting many observers to view the dismissals as politically motivated.
Some of these prosecutors were involved in the judicial prosecution of high-ranking Republican members of Congress, while others had refused to investigate the allegations of Democratic electoral fraud.
U.S. prosecutors are tasked with investigating and prosecuting judicial cases for the government.
They may be dismissed at any time, but may not be dismissed for political reasons.
The then head of the Justice Department Attorney General Alberto Gonzales has come under fire for the dismissals and has finally resigned.
A number of Justice Department officials have also resigned.
In particular, the Inspector General’s report has addressed the role of Gonzales critically, bearing the “primary responsibility” for the dismissals, “giving up” his leadership role, and showing “extraordinarily disinterested” in the process.
Other officials, including former chief adviser to President Bush Karl Rove, have been criticized for failing to cooperate with investigators.
Meat Loaf's epic song to be honored
The Rockstar Meat Loaf is to be honored during the music award ceremony "Q Award" for its epic anthem "Bat Out Of Hell".
The singer, who will be accepting his special gold award at the awards ceremony in London next week, said he was honored to be recognized.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title track to Meat Loaf's 1977 hit album.
"Coldplay" tops the nominations for this year's awards after narrowing it down to four categories.
Q Magazine editor-in-chief Paul Rees said there are some songs that go beyond such matters as time and genre, and "Bat Out Of Hell" is certainly one of them.
The song, written by Jim Steinman, required a powerful voice delivered by Meat Loaf.
It starts with an instrumental part that lasts almost two minutes.
The song went on sale in the UK as a single in 1979 and reached number 15 in the charts.
However, Meat Loaf's "Bat Out Of Hell" has spent about nine years on the charts and has sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf, whose real name is Marvin Lee Aday, has suffered from serious health problems in recent years, including surgery in 2003 for irregular heartbeat after he collapsed on stage.
In 2007, he had to cancel concerts due to an acute laryngitis.
It was later revealed that he had a cyst on his vocal cord.
Obscure street in town, often forgotten and possibly soon to sell
New York City has thousands of major thoroughfares, avenues, side streets, and other bypasses, some of which are famous and others just convenient.
Still, even for experienced taxi drivers and long-time locals, it’s hard to tell where Extra Place is, simply because most have never heard of it.
This tiny street is located in the East Village and runs north from First Street between Bowery and Second Avenue without reaching Second Street.
It is 30 feet wide and 120 feet long and looks more like a dusty alley than an actively used thoroughfare.
There are also no road signs.
It is virtually impossible to find them on a standard road map.
This street still has its admirers.
For example, Avalon Bay, a construction company that recently built luxurious buildings on First Street.
It wants to re-pave Extra Place to create a clean passage to the shops and boutiques expected in the new buildings.
Among the other admirers is the long-standing neighborhood, which says it is fascinated by the short alley, simply because it is one of the remains of the block’s past.
But the municipal department, which is responsible for the protection and construction of the residential buildings and is responsible for the street, has no interest in maintaining them.
During a meeting of the Municipal Council’s Land Use Committee this month, representatives from the City Council and Avalon Bay drafted a proposal for the construction company to purchase the road.
Still, the committee prefers the road to remain in the hands of the city, and has asked for a new plan to be presented next month, according to Susan Stetzer, the District Manager on the City Council 3.
“Very little space has remained in the city’s possession and we want Extra Place to continue to belong to the city,” she said.
"There could be offers on how to repair and operate the road, which could be done by Avalon, but we also want public access to be guaranteed."
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that it would re-pave the small street and set up seats that would include a café to which the company would like to rent out space.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the road was made public for the first time during the meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, a spokeswoman for Avalon Bay, said that while the company wanted to use the road, it did not necessarily want to own it.
“Avalon Bay’s main concern is to renovate this dilapidated alley and make it a public meeting place,” she said, adding that the city itself had proposed the sale.
Seth Donlin, spokesman for the Department of Building Protection, said it was indeed the city’s desire to sell the street, stressing that the department’s job was to develop the properties rather than manage them.
Compared to its colorful neighborhood of The Bowery, Extra Place has retained some of its historical impression.
Some believe the road got its name in 1802, when a large farm owned by Philip Minthorne was divided among his numerous children and a narrow strip of land was claimed by none.
The back door of the CBGB music club, the punk rock monument that closed in 2006, opened to the Extra Place and the street is certainly best known as the backdrop for the photo on the cover of Ramones' "Rocket to Russia" album.
The patch was great, said Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones, who took the photo in November 1976.
The road was full of scrap, rags and parts of barrels, posters, leaves and ropes.
Some residents, including the bloggers who write about the gentrification of the East Village, have rejected the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that this public property, as modest as it is, should remain public.
Others have hailed Extra Place as a rarity – a virtually unchanged fragment of the city that should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs the blog called "Jeremiah's Disappearing New York" (subtitled "The Book of Complaints: A Bitter Nostalgic Look at the Extinct City"), has published part of the city's history talk about Extra Place, which appeared in The New Yorker magazine in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote at the time: “Extra Place is a small narrow cul-de-sac that remains dark even during the day and is characterized by rusted metal doors of warehouses, locked windows and week-old newspapers flying past gutters.”
With a few exceptions, the street has looked just as recently on one evening.
A rat ran through the back of the street, not far from the door that used to lead to the CBGB, where today there is a more expensive clothing store.
Graffiti could be seen on the walls and an empty beer bottle lay on the floor not far from a fresh bundle of discarded newspapers.
Some passersby said they had rarely thought about Extra Place, but suggested that the road could be polished up a bit.
Fields added that in his opinion, some people underestimate the appeal of the road in its current state.
The best years of my life, he said, were in the places that were dark, damp, and disgusting.
Debate on bilingual education: Education in an English-speaking environment
In this edition of Education Watch, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the candidates’ positions on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, senior research fellow in California Studies and senior director in the Department of Education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a co-author of the book "Not as Good as You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs a School Choice."
Addressing Hispanic voters is a complicated task.
Barrack Obama’s proposals on education are a typical example of this.
Obama’s election campaign mentions that “the likelihood of African-American and Hispanic students successfully completing school is lower than that of white students” — which is true.
To close this gap, Obama’s education plan specifically recommends, among other things, a bilingual transition period in education for those who are just learning English.
Still, the question for Obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which focuses on teaching in languages other than English, contradicts his interest in reducing the gap in school performance.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school in eastern Los Angeles.
The majority of students are Hispanic and come from low-income families.
More than a third of the students, many of whom have only recently arrived in the country, are learning English.
Nevertheless, in 2008 an astonishing 100 percent of fourth grade students passed the state exam in maths at a good level.
Also surprisingly, 93 percent of the children from the fourth year of school were rated as good in the English exam.
This amazing success has been achieved by methods other than those favored by Obama.
The Sixth Street School focuses on review and practice, on constant control of knowledge and an attitude that tolerates no exceptions.
The school also practices the approach of training in an English-speaking environment, which is exactly what Obama should pay attention to, according to headmaster Linda Mikels.
This approach places emphasis on the almost exclusive use of the English language in subject teaching.
Ms. Mikels, who rejects the idea of bilingual education, told me that the school had a remarkable success with a student who had just come from Mexico. 12 months later you would enter the classroom and not be able to recognize him.
“It works,” she noted, “it works for us.”
Would Obama use a school like the "Sixth Street Prep" as a model for other schools with a large proportion of Latin American and other English-learning students?
The school’s achievements would make the answer to this question easy, but the educational positions within its own party (the national image associations have long supported the idea of bilingual education) and its own consistent support of bilingual education make predictions about Obama’s response uncertain.
While agreeing to the point that immigrants should learn English, he recently trivialized the issue by noting that people should stop worrying about legislation targeting “English only.”
Instead, he said, “You should make sure your child can speak Spanish.”
If Obama really wants to close the performance gap, he should carefully consider educational models that work, rather than despising and trivializing them.
Oil prices fall as a result of renewed fears about the economy
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday due to fears that even the American bailout plan for the financial markets might not be enough to revive the economy.
Crude futures on the New York Stock Exchange fell 7 percent in the morning session to $99.80 per barrel.
Since last Monday, the price has fallen by more than $20.
Over the past two weeks, commodity markets have been rocked by both the financial turmoil on Wall Street and strong hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After prices peaked at $145.29 per barrel in July, they fell to nearly $90 per barrel this month, only to rise again as a result of the huge uncertainty in financial markets.
On Monday, investors expressed concern again, even though congressional representatives had announced they had agreed on a rescue plan over the weekend, which was to be the largest in history.
This news was overshadowed by new concerns that the financial crisis was far from over.
In the final chapter of the growing crisis, according to a government statement on Monday, Citigroup is to buy up the banking business of Wachovia Corporation.
Meanwhile, Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalized the European financial group Fortis.
According to analysts at Barclays Capital, despite the tense negotiations that took place over the weekend and led to a rescue plan, it seems that it has not been possible to revive the mood in the markets.
As the economic situation continues to deteriorate, demand for goods, including oil, is expected to continue to decline.
Analysts at Deutsche Bank have written in a message to investors that the forecasts for global capital markets, interest rates and exchange rates have become extremely uncertain.
We believe, they write further, that the goods markets will also be affected.
“From the perspective of commodity markets, we are most concerned about whether the U.S. American virus is spreading worldwide, especially to China.”
The bank’s analysts have revised down their expectations for oil consumption due to weak economic growth for the coming year, and lowered their oil and gas price forecasts for 2009 by 20%.
Team record set by series in second quarter
Center-back Shaun Ellis thought he’d seen it all after hitting the Jets jersey more often than anyone else for the last eight and a half years.
Then, on Sunday, he saw the second quarter, in which the Jets turned an unsuccessful game into a triumphal procession.
“I’ve never seen anything like it,” Ellis said.
After a sloppy game between the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals that matched the bad weather, the second quarter began.
However, when quarterback Brett Favre’s pass arrived at Lavernue’s Coles for a 12-yard touchdown, that marked the perfect prelude to an afternoon when their evolving collaboration took a giant step forward.
Favre found Coles in this quarter for two more touchdowns, one slipping as an outside defender and the other 10 seconds before the end of the half.
“I didn’t put in a lot of effort,” Coles says about the passes that went to Coles.
"He's a super player.
We voted no matter what people think.”
While Favre and Cole were playing catch, defense quarterback Kurt Warner took apart.
Full-back Darrelle Revis intercepted an injured throw and turned it into a 32-yard touchdown.
Libero Erik Smith came to another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker David Bowens then caused a loss to Warner.
The last ball loss, forced at Bowens, was probably the craziest.
The Cardinals had captured the ball with 10 seconds left in the game when the Jets retook the ball and Jay Feely turned a 20 yard shot to 34-0 lead.
That was the most points the Jets had ever scored in a quarter.
When asked to describe the madness, Erik Mangini, the Jets' coach, replied "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
To both the answers, as the Jets allowed 21 points in the third quarter without scoring a single, Mangini said, "Believe me, I enjoyed the second quarter more than the third.
A lot of points were scored in a short period of time."
Retired Gebrselassie beats his world record
Haile Gebrselassie from Ethiopia has once again shown why some consider him to be the best long-distance runner of all time, after breaking his own record in the Berlin Marathon on Sunday and becoming the first person to make the 42.2-kilometer race in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With the victory on the flat course in 2:03:59, Gebrselassie improved his previous result of 2:04:26 by 27 seconds, which he had achieved last year in Berlin.
Gebrselassie, 35, has thus set his 26th world record in his versatile career, in which he has achieved at least one world championship title or set a world record on every track from one kilometre to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie skipped the Beijing Olympic marathon for fear that, in retrospect, the air pollution could exacerbate his asthma problems.
Instead, he signed up for the competition in Berlin.
In almost ideal conditions - in the sun and 9 degrees at the start and 13 degrees at the finish - Gebrselassie won with an average speed of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
Since track runners such as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat from Kenya switched to long-distance races, the record time for marathon in the last 10 years has fallen by more than 2 minutes, since Ronaldo da Costa from Brazil won in 1998 in Berlin with the result 2:06:05.
After his victory on Sunday, Gebrselassie told the press that he had cramps in his calf two weeks ago and therefore could not train for a week.
Obviously, he came back refreshed after a break and not rusted up.
“I’m so happy,” he told reporters.
"Everything went perfectly.
I resumed training a week ago and still had some concerns today, but in the end it was all great."
He has been criticized - especially in Kenya, Ethiopia's rival from East Africa - for orchestrating his races excessively, avoiding many of the world's best marathon stars in general, relying too much on the race leaders as if it were a track race, and setting world records above the competition.
But this criticism hardly harms the size of Gebrselassie as a long-distance runner.
Accompanied by four Kenyans on Sunday, Gebrselassie had reached the centre of the track in 1:02:04.
Two elite runners from Kenya, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, have continued to challenge Gebrselassie after the pacemakers had slowed down.
A little more than three miles before the finish, Gebrselassie made his last appearance to break away from Kwambai, who came in second in 2:05:36, improving his best time by almost 5 minutes.
Kamathi finished third in 2:07:48.
For women, Irina Mikitenko, originally from Kazakhstan and now German, has completed a remarkable year by showing the seventh fastest result of all time with 2:19:19.
The world record of 2:15:25 is held by Paul Radcliff from Great Britain.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko surprisingly won the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She missed the Beijing Games due to problems described as a back injury, but recovered to win in Berlin and improve her best time in her third marathon by five minutes.
She skilfully planned her run by having a quartet of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners pulled out at first, but overtook after 30 kilometers.
Askale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia came in second in 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop from Kenya came in third in 2:25:01.
The pride and hardships in the lives of the black population, in a city of a very special kind
Tucked away among the excesses of Orlando’s theme parks, a few miles from the glittering, loud, and gigantic hustle and bustle, lies a quiet city where the pride and complications of African-American culture emerge.
Eatonville, the first entirely black city in the country and the hometown of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as easy to describe as Hurston did in 1935: "the city with 5 lakes, three croquet places, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, more than enough guavas, 2 schools and no prison."
Today it is a pilgrimage site.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville to commemorate the most famous author of the Harlem Renaissance.
And yet, in many ways, the city that describes it – and that made it a tourist destination by including it in the Florida Travel Guide, produced by the Federal Writers’ Project at the time of the Depression – is and remains a place of the very special kind.
Eatonville is as independent, dignified, and private as it was in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural black communities in Florida often refused to share their true thoughts with the white man who "knows so little about us that he doesn't know what he's missing."
Even today, in a year in which a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, calls for an open conversation about race relations, many here continue to be fed up with being watched by outsiders.
"We are very concerned about how our story is told," said Hortense Jones, 59, from birth to a resident of the city and parishioner of the city's oldest church.
It has to be true."
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and struggle.
It is both a historical example of the black movement and a community of nearly 2,400 inhabitants, where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
It is, on the one hand, a stronghold of literature and, on the other hand, an example of the - sometimes condemned, sometimes praised - black culture of the rural South, which has its roots in American slavery.
Not surprisingly, residents here are both proud and on guard.
And so right the concerns about Eatonville's image actually started with Zora, as everyone here calls Hurston.
She introduced her hometown to the world in books that came from the heart and were written in dialect, such as "Mules and Men" (1953) and "Their Eyes were watching God" (1973).
Five paragraphs in the Florida tour guide changed the city, which is very close to Route 77, a road that leads through the often-forgotten center of Florida, to the scenes of black history and human drama.
Impudent as Oskar in both real life and literature, Hurston led readers to the store of Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then turned to more private matters.
"Off the road to the left," she wrote, "is the brown-white painted modern school, with its manicured gardens and playgrounds, which Howard Miller always cares about, though he can hardly read or write."
She also mentioned Dash's new husband, writing that Lee Glenn "sold drinks of any kind and whatever-fits-on-hours rooms."
In just a few hundred words, Hurston linked Eatonville to self-government, but also to illiteracy, second marriage, and sex.
This was certainly not a travel guide.
In fact, this was not a portrait appreciated by all.
"Zora described things as they were," said 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of the Johnson girls Hurston immortalized, citing the men who sang songs about her beauty that were full of sexual innuendo.
She added, “Some people didn’t like this.”
Hurtson is still remembered as a lively eccentric who returned regularly after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Augustus Franklin, 77, remembered that when Hurston came rushing into town, she usually did so without warning, in a noisy Chevrolet, smoking and dressed in trousers, in a city that even today imagines something of her venerable style of dress.
According to Mr. Franklin, most of the inhabitants were fascinated, whereas many despised them.
"People were always glad to see Zora," said Mr. Franklin.
But “she never stayed too long,” he added as he rocked in his chair, on a rear-facing terrace overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized.
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were out of print.
Along with most of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten them.
Although she was once a famous author, a contemporary Langstin Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an anonymous grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she lived.
In Eatonville there was no large memorial service, no large-scale public readings.
"I don't think they understood their contribution to the world or their heritage in the least," said Valerie Boyd, author of Wrapped in Rainbows, a biography of Hurston published in 2003.
The turn came in the 80s.
Orange County authorities wanted to lay a five-lane highway through the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the community's slow two-lane main road.
Orlando’s suburbs had already pushed Highway 4 through the western outskirts of the city.
The proposal was made when Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult period in its history.
Forced integration, among other things, had put an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the fight against racial miscegenation brought hatred to the community.
"In that time, a bunch of white boys often came and they threw oranges and stuff at the people sitting away," Mr. Franklin said.
“There was once a woman who was killed.
They threw a watermelon out of the car.”
In 1955, in a letter to the Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the Supreme Court's demand for integration, calling its decision in the Brown case against the school board "offensive rather than respecting my race."
Residents today say that although the lifting of racial segregation has been positive in some respects, it has weakened group cohesion in Eatonville and the self-confidence of its youth.
“Black kids were used to being hugged — I remember — hugging their teacher in the morning and hugging their teacher in the evening,” said N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and executive director of the non-profit group for the protection of the Eatonville community.
This could be maintained for so long, she added, until teachers and students stopped coming from the same place.
"You didn't hug his white teacher, because he was a white teacher - I mean there is a cultural divide," Ms. Nathiri said.
However, civil rights have helped make room for more Zora Neale Hurstons – black writers, actors and artists who defied prejudice, as they did, with positive self-confidence and statements like, “How can anyone deny the joy of my society!
I don't understand."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker made her way to Hurston's unnamed grave and began to fight for the revival of her fame.
Five years later, a much-praised Hurston biography of Robert E. Hemenway was to be found on the bookshelves, and again made it part of the American literary canon.
The highway project came at a time when Eatonville’s most famous daughter was once again in the public eye.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
The community began planning a Hurston Festival in 1988 to show what the district could destroy with the construction of the highway.
Thousands of fans came to the opening event two years later, and every January many return for the celebration.
A few years later, the district turned away from its road construction plans.
"The plans of a five-lane highway enlivened the city, accelerated the whole thing at top speed, aroused genuine citizen pride," Ms. Nathiri said.
Mrs. Boyd put it a little easier: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory against the highway project has contributed to a change in the city’s self-image.
There were more and more arrivals, such as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who has been going to church here since 1993, and locals began to re-appreciate the past.
Eatonville was added to the National Historic Register in 1998.
A new one-story library (named after Hurston, of course) opened in 2006 on the newly paved and beautified Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville is still a specialty in Florida: just 6 miles from downtown Orlando, it can sometimes feel like a back alley in the summer rain, as small as it was when it was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(It’s 90% black these days.)
Outsiders in search of Eatonville's history and its significance are often still treated with caution.
For most interviews, a permit is required in advance and certain things - such as the wall painting of Eatonville's oldest church, painted by a white man and depicting black men working in the field - are not allowed to be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, such as Mrs. Jones, a courageous, self-confident teacher with a penchant for dark red, still fear that her shielded community will be misunderstood.
And yet, at the same time that the Hurston Festival was getting bigger, an increased degree of home pride was also born.
Young people in particular tend to see Eatonville as Hurston saw her entire race: beautiful, with all its problems, neither worse nor better and just as proud, creative and hardworking, silly and mixed up as any other racial and ethnic group in America.
It is the sincere love for this city that can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin’s nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work in the city administration or with the police, who he says might need some help.
And even the younger ones, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, eleven-year-old twins from Winter Park, have learned to properly describe Eatonville.
“Most people who just drive through here will think, ‘Oh, this city is nothing compared to all the others,’ ” Alondra Kenon said the other day on a Sunday after church.
"But if you actually stop and look at its history for a moment, it's a very beautiful city."
Here in New York, people speak fluent financial Latin.
At first glance, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the newspaper stands and the massive television screens in Times Square, they wouldn’t even realize they were in the middle of a debacle.
They would never believe that above their heads, in the shoebox-like offices with the glass fa<0xC3><0xA7>ades, bankers and hedge fund managers who have the monopoly in New York, daily have the worst horror working day since the 1929 stock market crash.
Suppliers are still pushing metal tea carts along sidewalks with loud clatters and carrying trays loaded with muffins for breakfast sessions.
Latinos are still slouching between apartments, like human pack animals laden with around 50 ironed T-shirts hanging from a yoke-like pole on their shoulders.
Office workers are still waiting for their breakfast bagels at food stalls on the sidewalks, and it is still impossible to get a yellow taxi between 4 and 7 p.m. on a weekday.
It didn’t feel like a crisis at all until Thursday afternoon when I decided to open a new savings account due to all the doomsday talk.
Although I had decided to put my duty on the quiet late afternoon at my JP Morgan Chase branch, about 20 people were already in line.
Not at the cash desks to withdraw or deposit money, but at the customer service desk where regular customers order checkbooks, ask tourists for directions to Macy's department store and where new customers open accounts.
Most before me, I later learned from Starr, my “personal licensed bank clerk,” who was standing in line for the same reason I was.
Unlike me, however, they had already taken their savings from smaller banks, in places from where they commuted, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island.
They had withdrawn money from so-called thrifts (a bit like a building savings bank), cooperative banks, and those local savings banks that only have branches in one state, saying they treat their customers like family.
In the last year, 15 of these banks have gone quietly bankrupt.
Over the past few days, Washington Mutual, a $327 billion bank with assets, went into bankruptcy management, and when last Friday New Yorkers drove home over the weekend, Wachovia, another bank that owns $440 billion in savings, was looking for a bailout buyer.
Fearing another collapse, the office and shop assistants standing in front of me took their cash to a bank that is considered a safe haven, a bank responsible for most of the bailouts on Wall Street.
Quite ordinary New Yorkers have acquired fluent financial Latin in recent weeks.
A woman who spoke on the phone in my local Chinese supermarket referred with such familiarity to Lehman Brothers, the bankrupt bank, and its emaciated-looking CEO Dick Fuld, as if she were blaspheming about a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the 50-year-old uniformed concierge of my apartment block, has strayed from our usual entertainment topics about Brad and Angelina and my food delivery.
"I now have all my savings in money market funds," she told me after my visit to the bank.
"I changed, I'm not taking any more risks."
Muslim graves desecrated during right-wing slide in Austria
Heinz-Christian Strache, a left-winger of the Austrian right-wing Freedom Party, and Filip Dewinter, a member of the Belgian right-wing Pertei Vlaams Belang, take part in a demonstration in Antwerp on Thursday, 17 January 2008, to represent the organisation "Cities against Islamization".
They carry signs in the style of traffic signs on which a mosque is depicted, crossed out with a red line.
The police accuse right-wing extremists of desecration of the grave in a Muslim cemetery in Austria, the same weekend at the extreme right parties record significant gains in the parliamentary election of the country.
In the night from Friday to this morning, more than 90 graves in the cemetery in Traun near Linz were seriously damaged in an action, according to police.
The perpetrators sprayed Jewish symbols such as the David Stern on some of the graves, but criminal officials consider this an attempt to disguise the motive of the extremists driven by hatred of Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident is in any way related to the elections.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said they were “deeply shaken” by the news of the desecration of the tomb that took place as the religious month of Muslim Ramadan draws to a close.
At the same time, a round of conscience research is pending in Austria after the country slid to the right in yesterday’s parliamentary election.
The FP<0xC3><0x96> and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, the two far-right parties that received almost 30% of the vote, campaigned for a strict anti-immigrant law in their election campaign and some of their electoral slogans were criticized by opponents as xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, leader of the FP<0xC3><0x96>, who won 18% of the vote, campaigned for a ban on headscarves and burqas and even expressed his aversion to food that is commonly associated with Islam.
At his last rally in Vienna, he spoke of a “European brotherhood” to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties want to ban the building of mosques and minarets with the argument that these are political symbols of a continuous Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Polls and analyses conducted immediately after the election, which say that the extreme right is the strongest political bloc in the country, suggest that this new development is based on young voters who are worried about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter's International Travel Ban
Gary Glitter, the glam rock star convicted of child sexual abuse, has been banned from traveling to France and Spain.
Judges imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after he informed the authorities controlling him that he wanted to travel to Spain via France.
Kent police were granted a foreign travel ban last Thursday after they presented the judges with evidence of Glitter’s criminal record for child sexual abuse.
Glitter, real name Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at the Ashford District Court in Kent, but was represented by the law firm Corker Binning.
A Court spokesman reported: "On Thursday 25 September, Kent police at the Ashford District Court applied for permission to prevent Mr. Paul Glad's foreign travel to France and Spain by 25 March.
Paul Gadd was not personally present."
As required by the Register of Sex Offenders, Glitter, 64, had informed authorities that he wanted to travel abroad.
He must inform the authorities if he wants to travel abroad for more than three days.
He must also notify the police 7 days before his scheduled departure.
Failure to notify the authorities could result in a prison sentence of 5 years.
Police in Kent said they would not discuss individual cases or glitter's possible whereabouts in the country.
A spokesperson for Kent’s police force said: “The police in Kent will do everything necessary to protect children in this country and abroad.”
“In our view, it is easier to control someone who is in the UK because we have a comprehensive system to effectively prevent any potential risks.”
"It is a top concern of Kent police to protect Kent residents and we are working closely together to monitor the behavior of registered sex offenders in the country to minimize any risk that may exist to the population.
Glitter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abuse of 2 girls aged 10 and 11.
When he was released Glitter flew to Bangkok, where he was scheduled to take a flight to London.
But he said he did not feel well and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not let him through passport control and he flew back and forth to Hong Kong.
Chinese authorities also refused him entry and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and border officials insisted that he return to Britain.
Last but not least, he arrived at Terminal 3 in Heathrow on 22 August and stayed there while his lawyer, David Corker, went to the Uxbridge District Court in West London, as Scotland Yard had successfully sought permission to require him to register as a sex offender.
Glitter had previously been incarcerated in the UK for 4 months in 1999 for possession of images of child abuse.
According to the Interior Ministry, Interior Minister Jacqui Smith is reassured and satisfied that Glitter has been prevented from traveling to France and Spain.
<0x60>I receive the master behind the stage to capture his character', Günter Brauer, photographer.
No heels, no frills, no costumes for the performance.
The nature of the great flamenco dancers who give up concentration and devote themselves to interpretation to get a relaxed look as a woman or as a man.
On the one hand, artists
On the other hand, personality
I look into private life, into those moments that are foreign to the audience, I know when I can find the gesture typical of the personality, the depth of a stolen look or expressiveness of the hands that are worried because they will not enter the stage.
In his project <0x60>Flamenco-people', the German photographer Günter Bauer presents alternate theatricality of some productions on stage with singers, dancers and guitarists. From this side he was still little known to the artists.
With this proposal, the photographer creates a special iconography of flamenco representation on different levels.
The exhibition, which is part of the Flamenco Photography Month program, <0x60>reflects the international importance of Flamenco, which is growing day by day,' the artist explains and makes it clear that <0x60>Flamenco-people' can be any person, but when you look at the photos, the viewer realizes that there are no typical images of artists on stage.
Quite normal people in the portraits are artists who are able to convey on stage passion, sadness, joy and thus move the audience.
To capture the personality of these artists, you don’t have to take pictures on stage.
Their personality and character is in their hearts.
What interested me was to create a personal atmosphere that would allow me to capture with the camera the characters of the greatest flamenco masters'.
Inspired by the Cante de las Minas festival, Bauer embarked on a long journey in 1997 to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a digital camera.
Thanks to the camera's image sorting function and the existing material, images reminiscent of classic photography were created.
The application of various stylistic means destroys the classical basis of the image, giving the image modernity and the idea of how the farmer understands flamenco: <0x60>music with traditional roots that changes and surprises every day'.
These are not only the dance, the singing or the instrumental playing itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, who seduces the audience with his art.
The search for the essential, for a certain something that becomes visible in the form of hearing, of being, is and was the fixed goal of this work, which will be presented in the gallery of El Fot<0xC3><0xB3>mata in the near future.
Famous figures in flamenco include Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo and others, among the close to seventy artists photographed.
The project became an anthology of flamenco and will soon be published as a book, with all the portraits from the exhibition.
Bauer's passion for portraits led him to take up this idea again two years ago and to realize it as <0x60>portraits of the veterans of sport' (<0x60>SportARTproject').
Although the concepts of the project <0x60>Flamenco-people' are different, the photographer admits <0x60>I like to photograph people, to get to know them and to put myself in their state of life, whether for a short moment or a longer time.
I think that in the field of photography the portrait is the most difficult genre.
You meet or meet people, personalities you sometimes don’t know at all, or they leave you alone for a few minutes to take a picture.
Apart from these circumstances, as a photographer I always try to realize my ideas.'
The collection of contemporary flamenco portraits entitled <0x60>Flamenco-people' is on display in the gallery of El Fot<0xC3><0xB3>mata, which is located in the street called la calle de la Mata and runs parallel to la Alameda de Hércules street. The exhibition can be visited until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa admits that the Roma he is writing is “a madman’s audacity.”
He does not yet know where the plot of the novel takes place and what it is about, but Mario Vargas Llosa is persistently trying to advance the project he is currently working on, a novel with the protagonist Roger Casemant, a nationalist from Ireland, who lived in the Congo for twenty years and moved to the Amazon.
Yesterday, during his attendance at the Hay Festival Segovia, the favored Nobel Prize winner admitted that the project he is working on is “a foolhardy one” and “everything indicates that he doesn’t have to write the novel.”
“If I were sane, I wouldn’t have done it, but I will and I hope to finish the novel someday,” he concluded his participation in the festival, where the ideas, thoughts and words were exchanged. Within four days he has seen hundreds of writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people who were in Segovia.
The author of <0x60>La ciudad y los perros' was one of the most outstanding personalities at the third festival and made predictions.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival’s premium prize and who was voted by the majority, is compared to the old edition of Our mutual friend and can be seen in the Juan Bravo theatre.
He was introduced by Félix Romeo and found that he had an audience in front of him, who noticed that the Peruvian, who has a wonderful memory and great sense of humor, was not given enough time to go through it all again: how his vocation to literature arose, which forms out of <0x60>extraordinary adventurousness', from <0x60>joy of reading' and from <0x60>experiencing' many stories, <0x60>how to be inspired';
The Hispanic novelist admitted that there is “no way” by which to measure and how to know if books change lives, “but I refuse to believe that literature is pure entertainment, a fleeting experience,” stressed Vargas Llosa, who claims that it “makes effects” and “I don’t let people’s responsibilities get any more disjointed.”
At the festival in Pozoblanco, the weather did not play along: Bullfighting festivals were partially cancelled.
After the announced bullfighters realized that the ground of the course was in poor condition, the bullfighting festival, with which the festival was to be concluded in Pozoblanco, was moved to yesterday morning.
Thus, with the agreement of Ferm<0xC3><0xAD>n Boh<0xC3><0xB3>rquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez, the organizer has decided to postpone the bullfighting festival.
Thus, the festival was exposed to unstable weather, which is why two out of three celebrations could not take place.
On Saturday it rained, so the second planned bullfight could not be celebrated.
The group of matadors consisted of José Luis Moreno, Curro D<0xC3><0xAD>as and Juan Bautista, who gradually entered the bullring.
There was only one celebration on Friday.
The winner there was Daniel Luque, who cut and triumphed three ears, after which he left the passage with pleasure and aesthetics.
That same evening Alejandro Talavante met two horns and an ear of the bull, which he had succeeded more by galloping than by his bullfighting skills.
And even worse was El Juli, who passed through the Arena de Los Llanos without difficulty, but also without fame.
After fighting so badly, a large part of the audience responded in his second fight with boo calls.
In <0xC3><0x81>lava, two people wanted to escape the control of their car, which was loaded with two thousand kilos of hashish.
Tomorrow: five minutes to ten.
Traffic control in Ertzaintza, in the urban area of Armi<0xC3><0xB1>on (<0xC3><0x81>lava).
Two police officers asked the drivers of the car to stop, after which they fled.
It looked like they wouldn’t have to stop with the cargo of more than two thousand kilos of hashish.
The police tracked them down and arrested one of the drivers, the man who is 28 years old, known as A. A. J., as reported by the interior ministry of the Basque state.
The arrested person was accused of drug trafficking and falsification of official documents.
The incident occurred when the traffic police of the <0xC3><0x81>lava region had already completed traffic control on the N-1 and were passing through the Armi<0xC3><0xB1>on urban area.
They decided to stop a car to carry out the route control. The driver did not follow the instructions, suddenly increased the speed and tried to escape the control.
The police started the chase until the car stopped after a few kilometers at the edge of the road, and at that moment the drivers got out of the car to escape via a country road into a forest area.
In the car, an Iveco Daily, the drug traffickers transported 2,178 kilos of hashish, which was confiscated by the police.
The front part of the car was loaded with hashish bundles, which were later directed to other police departments for precise laboratory analysis and weighing of the bundles.
In addition, the officials found that the number plate was <0x60>doubled', so that it did not match the number plate given in the car papers, which is why there was an additional arrest for falsification of official documents.
Ertzaintza city police are continuing the investigation in order to arrest the second suspect, who, as already mentioned, was able to flee, but also to determine the origin of the seized drugs.
The 28-year-old A. A. J., who was arrested, was taken to a police station for questioning and will be brought before the magistrate in the next few hours.
Actress Heather Locklear was arrested for driving under the influence of an unknown drug.
Actress Heather Locklear, known for the role of Amanda from the series "Melrose Place," was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California, for driving under the effect of an unknown drug.
A witness had observed how she tried to drive out of her parking space in Montecito in a rather strange way, spokeswoman for the California traffic police told People magazine.
The witness told in detail that Locklear <0x60>pushed through the accelerator after 4:30 p.m. and made a lot of noise by trying to move her car back or forward out of the parking space, and as she drove backwards, she grabbed her sunglasses a few times.'
A little later, the witness, who at first had probably not recognized the actress, saw Locklear stopping on a nearby road and getting out of the car.
The witness was the person who alerted the emergency service because she was ‘afraid of living around Locklears’.
When the police patrol came, they found the actress sitting in her car, which was across the street, blocking traffic.
'She seemed disoriented,' so they took the police officers to a special drug and alcohol center to do a test.
According to a police spokesman, the actress was cooperative, excessive drinking was excluded from the first moment. <0x60>The first observations of the officials, we believe that Locklear was under the influence of an unknown drug,' said the spokesman.
Locklear was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of an indeterminate substance that could not be determined and taken to a local pre-trial detention facility around 7 p.m.
Two months ago, Locklaer was discharged from the hospital in Arizona, where she was treated for anxiety and depression.
Llamazares insists that the Andalusian Federation of the United Left be responsible for the Silva case.
Gaspar Llamazares, the main coordinator of the VL and a member of the United Left, has assured today that the regional association for education will be the one to make the decision in the case of the former City Council for Youth and Sports of the Seville City Hall, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after being accused of doing business with family members.
“In such cases, I am a great federalist, and the Andalusian organization will be the one to take responsibility for it,” Llamazares pointed out, pointing out what action the party must take in relation to the one who is currently sitting as a city councillor in the municipal council of Seville.
Nevertheless, the chairman of the VL defended the need for <0x60>transparency' in the possible investigations of the rule violations that Silva may have started: <0x60>The VL always insisted that such cases receive the maximum transparency'.
With regard to this issue, he stressed that education has ‘a strict ethical code for all public offices’.
<0x60>Sangre de mayo': Book of Heroes by Garci
Inspired by <0x60>Episodios Nacionales' by Benito Pérez Gald<0xC3><0xB3>s, José Luis Carci presents in <0x60>Sangre de mayo' the revised version of the famous uprising of the Spaniards against the French. This is an admirable film in filmography, with approximately 15 million euros investment for the shooting.
In this way, the cineaste has tried to ‘present a lot of personalities and social analysis’, which he has always admired in the works of the famous novelist, Carci explained today in the presentation of the film with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarr<0xC3><0xAD>a at the beginning of a long list of actors.
Sangre de mayo, with a film length of more than two and a half hours, will be shown in cinemas this Friday and later shown on Telemadrid as a four-hour miniseries.
José Luis Garci, a big fan of Gald<0xC3><0xB3>s’s literature, assures that thanks to this shooting, his <0x60>childhood dream' came true. He owes this to Esperanza Aguirre, who commissioned him three years ago from the Autonomous Community of Madrid to shoot a commemorative film for the second centenary on November 2 in Madrid. Especially because the story was based on <0x60>Episodios Naguirre'.
The total contribution of 15 million made by the autonomous community of Madrid for filming, Garci, as he added, offers the “unique possibility” of presenting, with the help of decorations and appropriate clothing, the image of “confused Spain, which chose the false leader for the struggle, because the people had been brought into arrears by the struggle for independence and under the rule of Ferdinand of VII.”
However, the Cineast regrets that the funding could not be expected as with <0x60>Alatriste' or <0x60>Los fantasmas de Goya' (twice as high as with <0x60>Sangre de mayo'), so some scenes from the script with Horacio Valc<0xC3><0xA1>rcel, with whom Garci worked almost his entire career, could not be shot.
For this reason, Garci, who was also film director in <0x60>Volver a empezar', has contributed through his usual way of working: he stood on the stage to the actors, with whom one must first rehearse before starting to shoot and for those who had not done a casting, he appeared <0x60>humiliating' and providing respect, <0x60>one part of the profession of the film director is to know, to help in the cinema', to know in the theater,
Many of the actors he encounters in Sangre de mayo have to repeat in front of his camera, as in the case of Miguel Rell<0xC3><0xA1>n, Carlos Larra<0xC3><0xB1>aga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garci, an Oscar nominee in four nominations (one of which he has won), believes that none of the three candidates representing Spain this year before the Academy of Hollywood represents a young generation of Spanish filmography, neither <0x60>Sangre de mayo', nor <0x60>Siete mesas de billar francés' and finally not the selected film <0x60>Los girasoles cie.
Garci does not expect any awards for this film.
“At first you think you’re working for the offspring, later you realize it’s just for the good of it, and now you’re happy if you’ve made a movie,” Garci explains after more than 30 years of working.
Isabel Bay<0xC3><0xB3>n recalls the memory of the dancer from Seville T<0xC3><0xB3>rtola Valencia
A flamenco dancer from Seville worships a dancer who also comes from Seville.
Carmen T<0xC3><0xB3>rtola Valencia: her father was Catalan (Floren<0xC3><0xA7> T<0xC3><0xB3>rtola Ferrer) and the mother Andalusian (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), she was born in the district of Triana and when she was three years old, her family moved to London.
She was a dancer and an expert in oriental dances.
She had an exciting life, she was one of the first fighters for the emancipation of women, such as Isadora Ducan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist, vegetarian, and advocated the abolition of the corset, which restricted the free female movement.
The life of this woman, who left her mark on the dance and aesthetic revolution in Europe in the period between the wars, fascinated Isabel Bay<0xC3><0xB3>n.
“I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she suggested this role to me, which seemed impossible to me.”
“We’re not trying to tell you about her life, but to preserve her wit,” said the flamenco dancer.
Her dance basics helped me a lot in Flamenco.
For example, “The Dance of the Butterfly” seemed to me like Guajira, or “The Dance of the Snake” like Tango.
Her dancing was sensual and I’ve been told that my dancing is also in this aesthetic realm,” she claims.
The production expects two extraordinary collaborations: with Miguel Poveda, who will once again sing for Isabel at one of her performances, as he did in <0x60>La puerta abierta'; and with flamenco master Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to work together with one of her ex-students.
Matilde plays T<0xC3><0xB3>rtola, a very mature personality.
I'm happy because she agreed to participate in my work, and I'm very honored."
The production also counts with musical composition and the guitarists Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s Torres and Paco Arriaga, with the vocals of Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Mor<0xC3><0xB3>n; with the percussion of El P<0xC3><0xA1>jaro, as well as the viola of Rafa el Viola and the collaboration with the actor Juanfra J<0xC3><0xBA>arez, he <0x60>takes on the role of the companion of the artists that Divas were always in love'.
In this work one also tells in a certain way about the life of this woman, who became known in places as far away as India, the United States or Russia and also throughout Europe, although she usually lived in London.
“I wanted to recall her, because I think she is one of those women who have an enormous influence on a certain era and whose works no one knows anymore and therefore appreciates her even less,” Bay<0xC3><0xB3>n claims.
The performance will take place today at 20:30 at the Lope de Vega Theatre.
The publication of the book <0x60>Diario de un poeta recién casado' also includes the Triennium
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of <0x60>Diario de un poeta recién casado' in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), in a place where Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Jiménez married Zenobia in 1916, provides a corresponding atmosphere to carry out planned activities on behalf of the Andalusian Council for Culture, to celebrate the <0x60>Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n's anniversary.
Thus, <0x60>the Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n' is completed with the new edition of this work, with the international congress held in New York, with the restoration of the house-museum of Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Jiménez-Zenobia and with the traveling exhibition <0x60>Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Jiménez' is now reached in the course of the international congress: <0x60>Aquel chopo de luz', which was presented in May in the Andusis and
The Andalusian Council for Culture has also received eight hundred copies of <0x60>Diario de un poeta recién casado', edited by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Pacobo Pérez-Enciso, with the aim of making the person and work of the Andalusian world poet better known.
The U.S. can’t imagine without Paul Newman.
“Sometimes God creates perfect personalities.
Paul Newman was one of them.'
This sentence comes from the actress Sally Field, who worked with him in 'Sensation Reporter', and from the then prevailing notion of American cinema, which was abandoned, from all over America to Newman came and followed with his inspiring notion.
Look what it cost her to give him the Oscar.
And when he retired in 2007.
And he knew he was very sick.
Nevertheless, it was a big blow for everyone.
“What one sometimes feels is far more than an expression, and now I have lost a great friend,” said Robert Redford, weeping, “my life and my country were the greatest trifles of his life.”
No one was afraid to ridicule or exaggerate.
As the ‘father’ of cinema and the fatherland, he died in a sad moment of fear of terrorists and market collapse, where the depressed self-esteem of Americans is on a hopeless quest for reasons to regain dignity.
If only a few people can be admired in this hard time without virtue, you don’t necessarily have to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For everyone, he embodied a Platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was the official enemy of Richard Nixon and suffered like various losses as well as profits: from the foundation dedicated to the fight against drugs and was founded in honor of his son from the first marriage, who died of overdose, to his own brand of homemade and organic products.
All this is a gift to the country, where it took a lot of effort to prevail against a deadly food culture.
A broad wave of wonder hits home high over Hollywood without regard to nationalities and nationality to take.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, confirmed that not only one person has died, but the whole era.
The Englishman Sam Mendes, film director and Oscar winner, said that working with Newman was no more or no less than the peak of his career.
Russell Crowe, the evil boy who came from Australia, dared to call Newman his greatest inspiration.
“We’ve been abandoned by the greatest of us all,” confirmed George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who dare to live the way Paul Newman lived today: maintaining high standards of integrity, leading a responsible private life, far from the cameras.
This is not always easy or even possible in today’s media jungle.
But there’s someone who tries, and Paul Newman was an example of that.
He divorced once and was then married for fifty years to Joanne Woodward, to whom he was loyal, although there were certainly many opportunities not to be.
“Why should I eat a hamburger on the street when I have fillet at home?” he often joked.
In heaven, he will be proud that on earth his daughters have the same opinion as his fans, which is not necessarily common in America.
“Of all the great roles he played, he was as proud of none as he was of the faithful spouse, the loving father, the attentive grandfather, and the philanthropist,” they say.
For the Olympic Games, the roads in Madrid are poor.
Yes, the dream of many of us is to host some Olympic events in Madrid, after the failure for 2012, it may well be 2016.
But I ask myself, ‘Are we prepared for this?’
Yes, we follow the example of the old streets, I say that it is not true!
It was described as a perfect road, and in my judgment, it was the worst road with all that there was.
Of course, this is a lot of nonsense, if you would pay attention to the evaluation and I could examine it, such a thing would clearly not have come through.
But, let's go through everything from the beginning.
The nonsense starts with getting the ticket that allows you to be the first to go.
It doesn’t seem bad to me either, but if they let you do it, then they should give you everything (including chip to avoid the traffic jams on the road).
I don't think so.
Here they only let you get the ticket (the first nonsense that consists of just going there for that) and (after an endless queue) there is the surprise! The T-shirt was only available in the size <0x60>S' (a second nonsense, because I need the size XL)
Where do we live?
Or is it that after the crisis it was decided to buy only small, much cheaper shirts made of less fabric?
All right, things like this are a small thing compared to the days on the road.
Apart from the fact that you have to go very early to get the chip, there is already a queue of at least 15 minutes and, besides, you have to leave the backpack.
The wait took more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible in the case of a road where 11,000 people are expected.
Finally, as it was to be expected, the road started and we had not left our backpacks in front of it, even if it had succeeded once, but getting them back would be more difficult.
In addition, in this 40-minute waiting time it looked like rain, so there was the temptation to organize a popular uprising and raid the house.
I think tomorrow some 500 people will certainly have pneumonia and some like me will not even show up in time for the classification because of this chip I got, I can already imagine that the output was misstamped.
Of course, if I were asked about a perfect road, that road would never come to mind.
So I think we will long dream of a city well prepared for the Olympic Games
Microsoft looking for a (virtual) receptionist
At the 'Emerging Technology Conference', hosted by MIT, Microsoft presented the progress of the new image recognition system and human interaction, a being of artificial intelligence without much intelligence, but capable of doing some primitive tasks, such as ordering a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, this is a route planner to move around the company's campus). The system pays attention to what it hears during the conversation.
Thanks to a camera and a shape and face recognition system, this ‘receptionist’ can recognize how many people are in the room, who they are and even remember how they were dressed, it can listen and understand the keywords of their conversation.
It can also place those present in the groups after the talks.
In the presentation video, “the receptionist” notices a third person, but she understands that this person is not part of the group that is having a conversation with her, and that neither is a company employee.
She asks if the person here wants to visit someone and replies that she will listen soon.
All without the blue screenshot
Impressive
This is certainly the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, for example, the next version of its Windows operating system.
This week we talked very superficially about Microsoft’s change of strategy.
Windows 7 will be faster and will not have as many embedded programs.
Steve Ballmer found that if the computers were equipped with the bare necessities, instead of filling them with the commercial garbage, they would work five times faster.
Everything is just a statement, considering that Microsoft added some function and <0x60>extras' in Windows versions.
The change of direction is worthwhile
The Microsoft is right, the operating system is gradually losing importance, just like the software.
When Google Chrome appeared on the web, that was part of the theory that it was Google’s first step to compete with Windows.
Cleverly, many pointed out that the browser is not an operating system.
The operating system, as an indispensable part, will always be necessary for hardware and software to work at the same time.
The operating system fulfills the function that can be compared to the function of his wife or husband when it comes to communicating something to his mother-in-law.
That's right.
The system will never disappear, but one must think of his “death,” not as an absolute, but as a relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week is confirmation of that idea.
People pay less attention to the operating system each time, but more to the web browser.
The computer is only started to run the Firefox, Explorer or Chrome and every day we spend more time surfing than in the environment of the <0x60>windows'.
What is the purpose of half of the applications present in the computer?
Less is more
And Windows 7 must be more compact, much more compact than Vista.
Lighter, not so exaggerated, less complicated.
Microsoft’s interest is more in integrating its online services, which can eventually become the alternative to Google.
In reality, they need it, no doubt, and I'll give you a little example.
I took the photo of this place in Redmond, in one of the recreation rooms for Microsoft employees at the beginning of the month.
A sign is attached to the soft drink machine: <0x60>Your search. Our future'. It prints out a request to use your own tool for online search.
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google for web searches.
By the way, last week it was also confirmed that the new version of Windows Mobile 7 has been delayed.
It will not be released at the beginning, but at the end of 2009, rather even in 2010.
Microsoft is looking for the opportunity to bring Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 to the market at the same time.
Every day the phone turns into a computer.
The Android and iPhone are already on the market, but the other delay will cost money.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso had it in Costa Azul, Leonardo di Caprio had this brand in <0x60>Blood Diamond' by Edward Zwick, just like Al Pacino in <0x60>The Godfather' by Francis Ford Coppola. At the same time, it belongs to clothing of a well-built pastor.
When we begin to enumerate the countless star performances, we can go back to the image of a very powerful man, with a pointed beard, who had lifted heavyweights in a travelling circus.
Basically, this is a typical male T-shirt made of cotton, sleeveless and waisted.
The English speakers call it <0x60>tank', but Lle Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles surpasses all other brands.
First, because of its great name, although it is called in the narrow circle <0x60>Marcel', the legend tells that the name formation is connected with sports and came from the boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
<0x60>La Marcel' excels all because of its excellent cotton, because of its distinctive unisex cut and is characterized by a small Belgian flag (barely recognizable) that these T-shirts have as a detail at the neckline.
And beware, the Belgian company does not only focus on the production of <0x60>tanks'.
They also have college sweatshirts, retro boxers, cardigans and cashmere, cotton pants, striped T-shirts, babies, mini shorts
Modeled and comfortable underwear.
Although, it is very unfortunate to use them as underwear.
They are very charming.
'I want to be a young mother; I don't worry about the candidate'
Her great demeanor with her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
M<0xC3><0xB3>nica Cruz is petite, but full of joie de vivre.
At the moment, the Gruz brothers are taking their new activities in fashion very seriously.
For M<0xC3><0xB3>nica this means much more than for some pretty and rich girls who keep their reputation.
She was in Paris at the promotion of the company Mango, moved there her residence and also makes the presentation of the most important premiums in fashion sponsored by the Spanish fashion house.
Compassionate and shy, winner on the short distances.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I have come to present the new collection for this autumn/winter season that my sister Penélope and I designed for Mango, and I have also attended the presentation of the second edition of <0x60>Mango Fashion Awards' and participated in the dinner in Valentino's honor.
A very intensive working time, which is exciting at the same time.
You work for the Spanish house, what is the basis of your new collection for the fourth season for Mango?
My sister, both I and I are fascinated by the cinema of the 50s and 60s; there we find many ideas.
I like to go through a city and watch women how they are dressed, how they combine their clothes, that’s what I do often.
Dancer, actress and fashion designer, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think so, but after all, everything comes together in one and these areas have a lot in common.
Ever since I was a little girl, I’ve been fascinated by clothes; I’ve always wanted to go to my grandmother’s to rummage around in my aunt’s wardrobes and see her clothes.
That was great, almost better than going to an amusement park.
Later, as a dancer, I always tried to pay attention to the clothes.
You know, we dancers like to have our own style in class and rehearsals to look in the mirror and feel good about ourselves.
As an actress, when you get the costume, you put yourself in the real acting role.
After all, everything is connected, it is so much respect for the costume designer and their professionalism.
Recently, you turned 30, did you not fall into a crisis?
I'm sorry.
I feel better than ever, as a 30-year-old I feel good.
I think the woman is mature, has experience and can enjoy life with fewer mistakes.
I am not afraid of my biological clock.
I did the things I wanted to do since I was little and that gave me a lot of inner joy.
So, you're thinking of becoming a mother, aren't you?
I’ve known for a long time that I’m going to be a mother because that’s what my body demands, and besides, I want to be a young mother; I don’t want to miss that.
As for the candidate, I’m not worried.
I will give my child great feelings of happiness and raise him with a lot of love.
As far as cinematic art is concerned, keep in mind the works that you participated in and that were shot last year.
That is the way it is and I very much want them to be presented to the public.
I, as a woman who comes from the theater, am very impatient and restless and want to have everything at once, which of course can not be immediately.
I very much wish that <0x60>La <0xC3><0xBA>ltima hora' and <0x60>En busca de la tumba de Cristo' will be performed for the first time.
Let's see how they like you
A couple of days ago, you showed up on the run with Naomi Campbell, right?
All right, don't say that.
It’s not that I went on the run to model.
Naomi Campbell, who I have known for some time, simply called me and invited me to London to participate in a parade for her organization’s charity event ‘Women for a Better World’ and the clothes we show. I know that two garments from our Mango collection were auctioned off to raise the money for Naomi’s NGO.
People don't know Naomi's good heart.
There's a lot of stuff being told about her, and I, as the one she knows, would tell you they're not right.
Nevertheless, I will support this good thing in which she is involved.
She asked me to participate in the parade for this generous cause, but when she comes and asks me to make a handstand, I will.
To support women in the Third World, which is also necessary.
Drivers who may relapse due to alcohol levels will have to install the <0x60>Alcolock'.
The authority orders that the driver, who has had three official penalties for alcohol levels, install this system in his car, which prohibits him from starting the car in a drunken state. If he is drunk, then the car does not start.
The initiative was announced last month in June and is already part of the Prosecutor General’s report, which she says is a pilot project that will last for a year.
The purpose is the resocialization of the driver, which is why he gets a course for the re-education of traffic behavior.
In addition to the Prosecutor General’s Office, experience has shown that the Ministry of Transport and the Foundation of the Technical Institute for Automobile Safety will also participate.
According to statistics, between 30-75% of drivers who were shown more than once due to driving under the influence of alcohol put themselves back in the driver's seat.
The <0x60>alcolock' would prevent this because it is a system connected to the car, it measures the alcohol content in the exhaled air and prevents autostart if the driver has taken alcohol test; or if an alcohol concentration is detected that is higher than allowed.
It costs more than 1 000 euros, the costs are borne by the person who imposes the sanction.
In this context, a study conducted in the U.S. in 2007 showed that cars equipped with these devices prevent up to 65% of rule violations in the first year after its introduction.
In Spain, it is estimated that 115 lives could be saved each year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to tackle this behaviour before it becomes a criminal offence.
And in order to facilitate their implementation, a lawful reform can be realized in the ordinary way, and yet a reform of the Basic Law, which is necessary for the prosecution process, is required.
The device is still available on the Spanish markets, in no store, although it has already been installed in some commercial vehicles and public transport vehicles.
Tomorrow, of all things, the House of Representatives will vote on the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party, which proposes to install this system in school buses, as has already been done in France.
In Mexico and without <0x60>peep-toes'
With British punctuality, at 17:40, at the time provided for by the program, next to the presidential hangar of the airport Benito Ju<0xC3><0xA1>rez de México DF landed the plane of the Spanish Air Force, with the Prince and Princess of Asturias traveling.
The sun went down, but their rays still forced them to use their hand as a parasol to see the royal couple getting out of the plane.
Right on the gangway: the Spanish ambassador and other authorities
A few hours before, I had asked a taxi driver on the street if he knew that the Prince and Princess of Asturias were visiting the city to formalize the official trip.
- Ah, very good, so, you can't take people at the airport at this time. You're from here or something.
No, she's the Spaniard, but she's lived here for a couple of years.
-Oh, very good.
But the Mexican press knows exactly who the Prince and Princess of Asturias are and know the importance of the journey.
There are many who wait in the hangar of the airport and on the red carpet, also military protection of 27 soldiers of the Navy, the salvo of honor.
The prince appears smiling, dressed in navy blue, and she, the princess, with long hair blown by the wind, without ordinary peep-toes, may have been told that a thunderstorm is expected in DF.
Before they enter the hall, they smile and are prepared for the photographers, where the official entourage is waiting.
At the door of the hotel where they are housed, one of the four largest in the city, a reporter from Mexican television who likes to joke is waiting for them.
The best premium in fashion
Probably there was no more suitable place in the world than Paris to present a premium of fashion and there was probably no substantially outstanding fashion designer and bon vivant than Valentino.
Mango presents the second edition of the fashion competition <0x60>el B<0xC3><0xB3>ton-Mango Fashion Adwards' to promote and increase international fashion talents.
This is awarded with a cash prize of 300 000 euros.
Ayer Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, saw her drawings yesterday in the shop window of the Mango branch on Boulevard Haussmann number 54 in Paris and almost cried because of the emotional excitement.
By the way, this is the second largest business of the company in Europe and has recently been opened. It offers a sales area of 1 335 m2.
The largest store is in London.
So many events have taken place that are connected to the fact that fashion designer Valentino is to be thanked for his presiding over the jury at the competition, and it all ended with a luxury dinner at Opera National de Paris.
In the surroundings of many famous people, the board table organized by Mango seemed spectacular.
Nati, with the heavy heart that was broken by the pain of his brother’s recent death, broke up. He put on the suit from the fashion house and wore some ELAH jewelry that were breathtaking. He held the arm of his son Luis, who is almost two meters tall, and accompanied Valentino at the dinner, in his honor.
Andik, the owner and lord of the House of Mango, welcomed the guests and was such a cavalier that he ended up with the Baron von Rotschild without jackets, because they lent jackets to the ladies.
M<0xC3><0xB3>nica Cruz, has hurried to the shop and had a pair of trousers and a shirt, which she modeled herself, and at dinner she wore a long, black sexy dress. On a night walk through the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us a room for ballet rehearsals, so she got excited, remembered the old times, grabbed a pole and made a kind of ply.
Inés Sastre, did not join the walk through the palace premises, but before that she had shown us the photos of her son on her mobile phone.
The next morning we could look forward to the presence of Oliver Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez, a personality who always evokes a stormy enthusiasm, and to Jon Travolta, who after his arrival (with his own bedsheets and towels) at the Hotel Internacional in Paris, asked in advance to have a room without smells.
The stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh la la, that's life.
1001 Advice against stress
There is not a thousand, but one more way to forget chaotic and fast-paced everyday life.
And even if there are only a few, they are all collected in a book that tells you how to relax. The book comes to the bookstores on September 30th.
The alarm clock is a punishment when it rings at 7 o’clock in the morning, but even worse seems the idea of getting back into the hectic rhythm that current life demands.
The office is called the tension and the computer that leads to the back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there is not one and not two methods to combat daily exhaustion and the problems of disconnecting from the world of work.
However, the number increases, no more and no less than 1001.
In addition to yoga positions, the classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott presents in the book the whole list of possibilities adapted to the taste and time of each individual.
The work against stress is called '1001 ways to relax' and so the peace that the book conveys comes into the bookshops of the publishers Pearson Alhambra and DK.
Anyone who thinks that it is impossible to achieve tranquility in areas such as the workplace with the help of personal contacts, this manual disproves such belief.
In addition, the methods are offered how to stay in contact with nature or the 100% natural recipes that lead to relaxation.
When the adrenaline in your veins no longer rises to restore balance to the body and the stress has become a problem, the time has come to sit down on the sofa, switch off the brain and focus on reading.
Talking in sleep
Some children talk at night
I do not mean those who wake up and tell us something that happened the day before, but the children who talk during sleep.
When it happens to you for the first time, at best, you will be frightened, but in reality it has no meaning.
This is a positive sleep disorder called speaking in sleep.
It is quite common, especially among children and young people.
Surely, more than one of you has been told that you have spoken at night.
This phenomenon can occur occasionally (once in life, for example, during high fever), or regularly (every day, once a week, once a month), the next day the child can remember nothing.
There is no single reason that causes this phenomenon.
Often, associations are sought with other phenomena in sleep, such as nightmares, panic anxiety at night, enuresis noctura (bedwetting at night), speaking in sleep, but there is no reason for this.
As we have mentioned before, it can be due to very high fiber, stressful situations or overloading.
In any case, this is a little researched phenomenon.
The frequency with which it occurs is very variable.
It may be that one speaks quietly in individual words, whispers or it may be quite the opposite (screaming, crying, long discussions ).
In cases where the expression is very intense, it is recommended to observe the child and seek advice from a specialist to check whether there is a problem that causes anxiety and in this way comes about.
We have said that it is a positive disorder, so it is not treated, be it, it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, with sleep apnea or with stress).
What you can do is to perform a series of simple preventive measures:
Try not to excite the child before sleep.
So, choose quiet game for the child and avoid stressful TV programs that are terrible and a little too wild.
In the nervous children who are recommended to relax, relaxation methods can be used to help them get a certain inner peace.
This will help the child to sleep well.
If speaking occurs in sleep, try to keep calm.
Remember that it is harmless to the child and the next day he will not be able to remember anything that happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake it up.
This is useless, because the child is unconscious, so you will tear him out of his sleep.
Although the child speaks, he sleeps, so he rests.
Remember, if it appears frightened after a couple of appearances, it is recommended to seek advice or find out what reason the child has for the fear.
When they understand what it says (which is not so common), the child does not put pressure to conduct an interrogation and get more information out.
So you will not be able to achieve anything with it, because when the child sleeps, it is unconscious and cannot think about it.
Besides, you will hear what it says, but you will not know what it dreams and why it says it, so be careful with the interpretation of the information and the conclusions you draw from it.
Perhaps, it does not tell the child that you hear this at night and know its secrets.
Not even as a joke.
This causes a lot of fear.
So, don’t worry, it’s nothing bad, it’s a moment that only takes a few minutes.
Illh<0xC3><0xA4>usern ... finally
After a long thirsty streak, Illh<0xC3><0xA4>usern is finally back on track for success on the pitch.
Without much effort, the yellow-blacks won numerous goal chances and managed to implement one of them, and thus win the game.
The pace of this encounter, in which the attackers struggled to show their skills, was not very high.
After a first attack by the guest captain Kauffmann, whose long-range shot passed close to the corner, Illh<0xC3><0xA4>usern was to dominate the game with ease, and it was alternately first Fonderflick with a long-range shot, then Brain with a high pass, and Romain with a shot with the tip of his foot, to challenge the defense of Denmark.
The opposing team blocked in the center of the field and only let the lively Riahi through at the top of the storm.
The start of the second half was to be decisive with first two goals by Riahi and Temporale, and immediately afterwards with the first goal for the Illh<0xC3><0xA4>user by Marais, which was just right to accept a ball again, which had been repelled by Diebold in a first attempt.
But the ill-housed scorer should not be able to enjoy his luck for a long time and about twelve minutes later be sent to the bench, as a result of which his team-mates had to continue to play in inferior numbers.
Denmark, however, did not take advantage of this and did not face any major problems with an ill-housed elf who only withdrew a little to ‘condense’ their defense, except in the very last seconds of the game, in which the ball passed very close to the bar after a big mess.
Sarkozy meets angry fisherman
Before flying to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make a detour to Brittany.
Given the determined attitude of the fishermen, who blocked the access to several Breton and Norman ports on Monday, the French president decided to meet with their representatives at the port of Guilvinec in Finist<0xC3><0xA8>re on Tuesday morning.
The latter promised to receive him ‘with a constructive spirit’ and hope that he would come with ‘concrete proposals’.
The President’s visit will take place at the same time as a general meeting of the crisis committee set up by the Breton fishermen to enforce measures in the face of the extreme increase in the price of diesel, which has reached a record value of on average over 1.14 euros per litre.
According to Elysée Palace press secretary David Martinon, “the president will discuss with them possible solutions to help their businesses become competitive again, and to secure job conditions and seafarers’ pay.”
Sarkozy is expected with determination by the fishermen.
Tuesday morning they led protest marches in the Morbihan and Calvados, which caused traffic jams of almost ten kilometers in length.
The sailing port of Quiberon was also blocked, but connections to Belle-<0xC3><0xAE>le did not break.
The peninsula of Quiberon was demarcated with a barrier.
Already on Monday, the sailors expressed their determination by burning tyres and pallets in front of the fuel depots of the ports of Brest and Lorient from the early morning, while demonstrations were held in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports of the Atlantic coast and the English Channel, such as Sables d'Olonnes, in Vendée, where the fishing boats did not leave, or Le Havre, where about twenty boats blocked the manoeuvres of the merchant ships.
In the evening, the fishermen of Turballe and Croisic in Loire-Atlantique dissolved the blockade of the important Total refinery in Donges.
Those from Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for the course of the meeting on Wednesday at the Ministry before deciding on possible measures.
In fact, the crisis committee in Guilvinec must decide on the reactions to the movement and on its participation in the discussion planned at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by the leaders of the National Fisheries Committee, which did not support their movement.
“The strike will continue, because ‘the fishermen will not give in at any point’ and ‘will not go to Paris,’ for example, announced Liliane Cariou, president of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
The professional fishermen, who pay no taxes on diesel, currently cost the liter about 50 cents, but they think that the profitability limit of a boat can only be reached with diesel for less than 30 cents per liter.
Paul Newman the Wonderful
The unforgettable actor from Butch Cassidy and the Kid died at the age of 83 from cancer at his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes said goodbye to the cinema legend and committed actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer keeps its delivery forecasts for 2008
The Brazilian aircraft manufacturer expects 215 aircraft to be delivered this year, despite the impending recession, as a threat to the global economy.
Embraer, the world’s fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer, is keeping its delivery forecasts for 2008 with 215 aircraft delivered, its President Fredrico Fleury Curado confirmed.
In the first half of the year, the aircraft manufacturer delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer expects a lot from the Chinese market, especially for its aircraft of the order of 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 machines to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would consider giving up more than 15% of its assets
According to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times, the insurer American International Group, which was financially supported by the U.S. monetary authority, is considering giving up more than 15% of its assets in order to repay the $85 billion that was pre-stretched to it.
AIG is ready to drive the sale of much of its business, beyond its international life insurance and retirement provision in the United States.
According to the FT, the board of directors of AIG met Sunday evening to review possible sales.
At AIG, no confirmation could be obtained.
Among the assets that AIG would potentially separate from is its aircraft leasing subsidiary International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% interest in reinsurer Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its real estate assets and investments in private equity, the FT further explains.
No final decision has been made on these sales, the FT continues.
AIG must quickly make the sales to repay the 85 billion loans it has been granted by the Federal Reserve, also at the risk of the American authorities receiving 80% of their capital and the current shareholders being lost to the same extent.
Analysis of Historical Paris of the session Historical Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange reported on Monday, after the House of Representatives rejected Paulson’s plan to bail out the banks, a historic fall in prices: The Dow Jones lost 6.98%, an unprecedented loss of nearly 800 points, and Nasdag 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) dropped by 777.68 points to 10,365.45 points.
As for the points, the strongest case in its history (684.81 points) had previously been recorded on September 17, 2001, the day of the trade decline following the September 11 terrorist attacks.
According to the final kill figures, the Nasdag index, mainly for technology, fell by 199.61 points to 1.983.73, and the widely used Standard&Poors 500 index by 8.81% (106.85 points) to 1,106.55 points.
After the unexpected rejection by the Chamber of Deputies of the plan to bail out the banks, which was intended to restore some stability in the markets, Wall Street collapsed, which had already been struck at the beginning of the quarter.
With 228 votes against and 205 in favor, MPs denied Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson the funds he had asked for.
Nearly two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
“Here is a bad picture circulating that presents Congress as incapable of adopting a plan,” Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial said.
“This shows how much the market counted on this plan,” she added, fearing that a project adopted in several days would come “too late.”
“If the project is in fact doomed to fail, it will quickly be up to the Fed and other central banks to get a grip on the crisis, which would limit credit conditions even more,” said Brian Bethune, chief economist at Global Insight.
And Miss Piegza stressed, emphasizing even more the sense of extreme urgency that “every day that passes brings with it the ruin of a financial corporation” in the United States.
Following Washington Mutual’s bankruptcy on Friday, the U.S. authorities planned to buy Wachovia’s banking business from its rival, Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis suddenly accelerated, leading to emergency measures in favour of banks in the UK, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, a sign that markets are facing “not just an American but a global crisis,” added the analyst at FTN Financial.
The market for basic necessities has grown strongly.
Revenues from the Treasury within ten years fell Friday evening from 3.632 percent to 3.827 percent, and revenues within 30 years last night from 4.161 percent to 4.357 percent.
Obama, winner after points in first TV duel
The first debate of the two candidates for the White House on Friday was followed by another to find out who came out victorious, John McCain or Barack Obama.
As expected, the QGs announced their own victory in the election of both Republicans and Democrats in this televised duel, which was to be watched by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen estimates that John McCain’s performance, while quite handsome, was not “brilliant” enough to allow him to stop his decline in the polls five weeks before the presidential election.
The Gallup Institute, which released an opinion poll on Saturday saying Obama is ahead by five points (49% to 44% for McCain), believes the Democrat is clearly the better figure.
Among the undecided voters, those who matter now, Obama emerged as the winner in the polls with 39%, while according to a CBS survey, 25% of them see McCain as the winner.
Obama should be able to confirm his lead on Thursday with the good performance expected from his rival Joseph Biden at first and only public debate with his rival Sarah Palin.
“It would be a mistake to underestimate them.
She has good instincts,” warned Bill Clinton this weekend.
Seventy-year-old McCain never stopped putting his indisputable foreign policy experience to the fore, clearly underscoring his opponent’s “na<0xC3><0xAF>vety” on these issues, which were the focus of this first television duel.
“Senator Obama doesn’t seem to understand that...,” he stressed several times.
“I don’t think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge to become president,” he said.
An attack point that has been preached since yesterday in the Republican election commercials.
Obama himself stressed that he represents the future.
He expressed himself briefly and precisely, without being upset.
He brought to the fore his ability to make good decisions and to renew the image that the world has of the United States.
“McCain still hasn’t understood, but Obama has,” he said in a Democratic campaign ad this weekend, accusing Republicans of not grasping the full extent of the crisis that weighs on the “American off the street.”
“During the 90 minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot of things to say about me, but nothing about you,” Obama said, denouncing 20,000 people who had gathered in pouring rain at an election event in North Carolina.
He didn't even mention the words 'medium-sized' or 'workers'. 'The financial crisis gives Obama, whom Americans think is best suited to saving the economy even on the edge of the abyss, a clear advantage.
“The coming week could be a decisive turning point,” said Senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic Rep. Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama’s “good economic instincts” to those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the current crisis is “the final judgment of an eight-year bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain.”
After stressing once again that he would probably even manage to cut taxes on 95% of Americans despite the fluctuations on Wall Street, the Illinois senator pointed out that creating a possible energy independence of the country and promoting renewable energy, along with the introduction of a health insurance system, was his top priority.
McCain, on the other hand, wanted to build a plant of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
The two candidates cautiously evaded the questions arising from the $700 billion (€470 billion) plan to save the financial market, which was passed by Congress last night and is extremely unpopular with the people.
“Have you noticed that an election was held in Minsk?”
Young people and opposition activists demonstrated on Sunday evening in the main square of the Belarusian capital, in order to reject the results of the parliamentary elections in advance.
A few hundred Belarusians have gathered on Sunday evening since the closing of polling stations in the Minsk marketplace to protest the fraudulent nature of the parliamentary elections.
Although no result had yet been announced, many young people had come to demonstrate against the power of Alexander Lukachenko: 'The dictator should resign'.
Some admit that they have not voted in the first place: ‘What good is that, if they do what they want with my voice anyway,’ says one youth.
They do not believe that the regime which has shown itself in the best light to the foreign observers in order to resume negotiations with the European Union is ready to take a democratic turn.
Sanctions, including not issuing visas to 40 leading Belarusian figures and claiming certain assets, could be lifted if these elections were deemed clean by observers.
According to the opposition, they were not.
“We were excluded from the electoral commissions and our observers were not allowed to participate in the count,” lamented Yuri Potemkin, press spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous grouping of twelve parties.
This is a cosmetic change, emphasizes Alexander Milinkievich, former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-Europe movement, because it matters who counts the votes, and with us that is the executive.
When opposition MPs enter parliament, it is because they have been appointed, and not elected.
But their entry into parliament can mean broadcasting time on television, meetings in the regions, and legislative proposals.”
The opposition is therefore guilty of interfering in the political game, because 'the dialogue with the European Union must be opened.
Because if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, enters a crisis and we do not reform, we run the risk of becoming a protectorate of Russia.
Well, we want to be independent.'
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has followed the electoral process, will not recognize the election as valid.
She stressed that the turnout figures appear to be too high, and that the increase of the vote in advance (26% of the voters of Minsk) has paved the way for any kind of manipulation.
“Have you noticed that an election has taken place?” asks Social Democrat leader Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
There was no one in the polling stations.
And there will be a maximum of five opposition MPs in parliament, and those who are most likely to conform to the government’s ideas.”
The silence of the night descends again over the Oktoberplatz.
On television, President Lukachenko and the members of the Central Election Commission congratulate each other on their success.
Talk - From the blood that became safe again
Hema-Quebec celebrated the 10th anniversary of its founding yesterday, and its president, Dr. Francine Décary, had every reason to rejoice, as Hema-Quebec has become one of the safest and most efficient blood banks in the world.
And above all, it has regained the public’s trust, which had been severely shaken by the scandal of contaminated blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
It is known that the national blood reserves administered by the Canadian Red Cross Blood Donation Service were contaminated with the HI virus and the hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In the face of this drama and public discontent, in February 1994, the Government of Canada launched a public inquiry, led by Judge Horace Krever, to shed light on the circumstances that led to such a tragedy, and to draw up guidelines to prevent another catastrophe of this nature.
While Judge Krever was still hesitant to submit his report, several provinces set up a committee at the time whose goal was to develop a new system for managing blood canisters in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee fulfilled this mission.
According to the reports of Gélineau and Krever, two blood banks were established in Canada: Hema-Quebec, which is responsible for Quebec, and the Canadian blood company to supply the other provinces and the two territories.
In 1998, when Hema-Quebec started work, barely 38% of people had confidence in the blood-conservation system in Quebec, recalls Dr. Décary.
The situation was discouraging.
Through the enormous efforts to improve the safety of blood vessels and through working in this field over the next few years, we have regained public trust,” she says, before proudly emphasizing that by early 2008, nearly 94% of the population of Quebec now had confidence in Hema-Quebec.
Dr. Décary, however, keeps in mind that “trust is something extremely fragile.”
Since its inception on September 28, 1998, Hema-Quebec has acted on the principle of caution.
At that time, we witnessed the occurrence of numerous cases of the human form of mad cow disease in Europe, a new type of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, this woman, who has been in charge since its founding in 1998, tells us.
“And we had not the slightest idea whether this disease could be transmitted through the blood.
So we invoked one of the main guidelines of the reports by Krever and Gélineau, according to which one applies exclusion measures if one does not know this and if a disease progresses only slowly, as is obviously the case with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which manifests itself through degeneration of the brain, which inevitably leads to death.
So in April 1999 blood was not taken from people who had been in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980.
Well, a few years ago, it was proven without any doubt that this disease is transmitted through the blood.
Thus, this event has shown us that the principle of prudence we used makes sense.
In 1999, a much more accurate technique for detecting HIV appeared on the market: the nucleic acid tests (NST), which make it possible to detect the presence of the virus itself directly in the blood of the donor, and not that of the antibody against the virus, as was the case with the tests used so far.
The NST made it possible to shorten the incubation time that takes place between the time when the person became infected and when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, explains the specialist.
This time could be reduced to a duration of less than a week.
Thus, the risk that certain donors could be infected without knowing it, and one could not detect it, was significantly reduced.
These improvements made it possible to significantly reduce the risk of transmitting AIDS through a blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people are at risk of receiving HIV-infected blood.
“In other words, you would have to distribute 12 million cans of blood before someone would be infected with HIV.
Because Hema-Quebec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 canned blood each year, it would take more than 24 years for a case where HIV was transmitted through a blood canned blood.
I believe that these days you can feel comfortable getting or prescribing a blood transfusion to restore health,” says the head of Hema-Quebec.
“Our challenge for the next ten years is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know which pathogen can enter the system.
Just last year, on the island of Réunion, the Chikungunya virus appeared, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted through the blood by insects.
We need to monitor continuously', Dr. Décary continues before she emphasizes that Hema-Quebec must provide adequate care in addition to a safe supply.
“The demand is increasing because the population is ageing.
Because cancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need new red blood cells or platelets.
The aging population also affects the blood donor network, which on average includes only 3% of Quebec’s blood-donating residents.”
Any healthy person who is 18 years of age or older and meets the eligibility criteria can donate blood every 56 days, i.e. six times a year.
On average, 14% of people who provide their blood are not accepted because they have AIDS or malaria, for example, and those who have traveled to a country where malaria is common are excluded from blood donation for one year.
“With these 3%, we manage to obtain an inventory that meets the needs of the hospitals.
Lack of supplies are very rare.
But you have to renew the members of this donor network as they get older and can no longer donate blood.
It’s hard to convince people to donate blood, but most importantly, to keep them and get them to become regular donors.
Life is so hectic these days that you rarely find the time to spend an hour donating blood,' regrets Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Quebec supplies not only blood preserves but also human tissues, including bone grafts, heart valves, eyeballs, and skin, which is used almost exclusively for serious fire injuries.
These tissues are examined, processed and frozen before being temporarily stored at Hema-Quebec, which also manages Quebec’s only public cord blood bank.
In the umbilical cord, which was formerly considered a biomedical waste, there is blood rich in stem cells that can serve to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
“A few weeks ago, we celebrated the storage of our thousandth umbilical cord blood sample, and we plan to lose more than a thousand annually.
“We should probably start making it available for transplants early next year,” explains Dr. Décary, who describes this umbilical cord blood loss program as very popular.
“Many mothers are convinced they don’t have access to it, because Hema-Quebec lacks the means to offer this complex and costly program in all of Quebec’s hospitals.
Soccer - Impact in the semi-finals
Montreal’s Impact qualified for the USL Premier League semi-finals yesterday, thanks to a 3-1 victory (4-3 with all goals) against Seattle Sounders in the second and final quarter-final series at Saputo Stadium, where the overall goal-to-go ratio counted.
Midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal in the 90th minute.
After a first half without a goal for both sides, the midfielders David Testo and Rocco Plancentino landed the other goals for the Montreal formation.
Roger Levesque was the only one who stood in the way of Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
Let’s remember that the first game of the pre- and return series on Friday Impact had the Starfire Complex in Tukwila in a suburb of Seattle a 2 to 1 loss.
In the semi-final Impact will compete with the whitecaps from Vancouver.
On Saturday night, Thunder was able to compensate for a 3 to 1 deficit in the return leg in Minnesota by a 4 to 3 win, but the Whitecaps still moved into the semi-finals with a total goal ratio of 5 to 4.
Impact will face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the game series will be determined today.
In short - Siegestor by Kovalev
The Canadian team’s number one trio is ready to tackle the season.
Last night, the unit formed by Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrej Kostitsyn drove the attack on the Florida Panthers with a storm fire, resulting in a 3 to 2 victory.
Kostitsyn, the star of the encounter, shot a goal, Plekanec provided two assists and Kovalev converted a pass in this victory game, the fourth of the tricolore in six pre-season games.
Kovalev scored the victory by shooting the only goal of the whole shootout.
“I’m not ready yet,” the Russian warned.
I need another game to make me feel comfortable.”
“He was too fixated on it in the first half,” noted Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he liked the end of the game.
He received stormy applause.’
Charest relies on the North
The Prime Minister does not rule out the possibility of holding elections before the end of the year.
As soon as the General Assembly of the Liberal Party was over, Jean Charest went yesterday to Jean-Talon in Quebec, where the new Minister of Health Yves Bolduc (left) is trying to be elected in today’s partial election.
'Moving the course of our last great border in the north': this is the long-term goal that Jean Charest presented yesterday by visual means at the General Assembly of the liberal party of Quebec in Levis, following entirely the guidelines..
During his lecture, a kind of picture mill was projected behind him.
On three huge screens, spectacular images of hydropower plants, mines, Quebec viewed in <0x60>Google Maps', maps, etc.
Great resources as during the election period.
Speaking to the press, the prime minister, by the way, refused to rule out that he would hold the elections this autumn, even if he announced that his schedule was very full.
The “Plan North” is the fourth element of a “vision” that the Prime Minister supposedly has for Quebec, namely that of a “new economic area” that provides for an agreement with France on manpower, an agreement between Canada and Europe, and agreements with Ontario.
Although it has been mentioned frequently in the Prime Minister’s speeches in recent times, the opening of the North – the northern area at the 49th parallel – has never been the subject of a presentation.
The Prime Minister, however, limited himself to explaining why the North was “a jewel with enormous potential” but did not mention a date, investment sums or precise priorities for the upcoming projects.
At most, there are some prospects for what could be done more: water energy, the forest, but especially the mining sector, favoured by the growth of emerging markets and the renewal of public infrastructures.
According to Mr. Charest's enumeration, the North possesses 'nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium and even diamonds'.
This 'area twice the size of France' is near us, is in Quebec.
It’s not just near us, it’s within us,” he stressed, as if to clearly show that he’s looking to realize a national founding dream.
Quebec has grown greatly through its connection with the North, he stressed: the road to gold in Abitibi, Quebec's engineering, the James Bay.
“It’s ours, it’s our future,” he added after taking a theatrical break to look at the huge map behind him.
The north, 70% of Quebec's territory, includes part of Labrador that Quebec has always demanded, the prime minister told the press.
“This is a traditional attitude that all governments have adopted.
There is a border line where there has been no agreement for a very long time, if the opportunity presents itself, I will take this stance again on behalf of the government," he said.
In addition, “with climate change, we need to rethink our vision from the north,” he explained, talking about the Northwest Passage, which will be navigable all year round due to the ice melt.
Against this new geopolitical background, the Prime Minister believes that it is downright an obligation to occupy this area.
And the inhabitants of the region, the aboriginals and the Inuit?
The prime minister said that the Quebec government would be very careful with them, and that they would benefit from this project, especially the young.
Two former ministers from different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former Pecist MP from Ungava) have already started consultations with some thirty communities.
A Committee of Ministers headed by Beno<0xC3><0xAE>t Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Mineral Resources) occupies an important place, has begun work.
The Prime Minister does not rule out a large gathering, ‘not necessarily a summit’, but an opportunity at which ‘one will create a common vision’.
Moreover, the development of the North will take place in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
Plan North will be ‘discussed, regulated and environmentally friendly’, he promised.
Jean Charest described this ‘vision’ as if it were a continuation of those of the liberal prime ministers who had been in office before him.
“Like the liberals who were in office before us, we rethought to turn the challenges into new opportunities for growth and development.
Incidentally, this was one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which opened on Friday with a large cocktail party to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage’s takeover of the party leadership.
One of the adopted resolutions envisages renaming the Beauharnois power plant as Adélard-Godbout dam.
“From Godbout, who created Hydro-Quebec, to Lesage, who achieved the silent revolution and nationalization of water electricity, to Bourassa, who made James Bay, our party always knew how to determine the future,” said Jean Charest.
To the press, he referred to another, this time conservative project, namely the ‘Roads to the North’ programme by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
Regarding the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric dam project, Mr Charest stresses that it is scheduled to be commissioned in 2012.
“That remains among us, but I intend to be there,” he confided to his party members, which gave rise to those cheers.
The Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008, and certainly also in 2009, has in fact not yet ruled out the possibility of holding an election this autumn, which is possible by law.
He stresses, however, that his schedule is full, mainly because of a mission of the Community Council in China and a summit between Quebec and New York.
This weekend’s General Assembly provided the Liberal Party leader with a platform of nationalistic plans, primarily “constitutional goals” that were readily adopted: the PLQ specifically calls for recognition of the “speciality of Quebec” in the constitution.
It also wants Quebec to appoint members of the Council of Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications and to have a veto on the decisions taken in Quebec.
On the part of the opposition, the guidelines of the Plan Nord were received with scepticism.
The leader of the Parti Québécois, Pauline Marois, has relaunched the policy for the development of North-du-Quebec, which the Landry government introduced in 2001.
According to her, when the Liberal government came to power in 2003, it refrained from applying it.
If she had done it, ‘we would have gone much further today’, judged Mrs Marois alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (where the election is taking place today) Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise Mercure.
The ADQ has advocated supporting the government’s adoption of a Plan North.
“But what we want is for this not only to be a big idea,” said Sébastien Proulx, the party’s leader, on behalf of Mario Dumont, who is returning from vacation today.
Letters - A dishonoured country
Mr. Vic Toews, ex-'Justice' minister (which irony) in Harper's cabinet, allowed himself last summer to say about Louise Arbour that she was a 'shame' for Canada.
This woman, who has waged an unending struggle for justice and deserves all our admiration for covering her up with shame, says as much about the people around the prime minister as she does about Stephen Parker himself.
We are dealing here with a government that is the only one from all the countries concerned that has not brought home its compatriot imprisoned in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that doesn’t even take into account that Omar Khadr was still a teenager when the things he was accused of happened.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, breaks its word and allows a child soldier to vegetate in inhumane conditions.
The only one who condescends to a judicial parody to assess the guilt of the defendant.
Let’s remember that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Association of Canadian Lawyers in particular are pleading for Omar Khadr to be brought home so that he can get a fair trial in Canada.
It is precisely this government that closes its eyes to torture: they have little interest in the fact that after so many years of torture, a young adult will certainly be mentally broken forever.
We are not yet aware of this, but we are experiencing an insidious curtailment of our rights, our freedom and our ‘democracy’, this word that Harper constantly carries like a flag in front of him, and which sounds so meaningless from his mouth.
So the time has come when there is no longer any morality: you can arbitrarily mistreat, torture and imprison a Canadian citizen, at the discretion of a head of government, who is still only supported by the minority (may he belong to the minority after October 14...).
Many voters believe that they can find their salvation with a party that preaches virtue, law and order, but they do not see that this government has renounced what constituted the reputation and dignity of our country.
The shame, Mr. Toews, lies in this renunciation, and nowhere else.
Free Opinion - Barrick Gold's Orwellian Speech
In its September 17 issue, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, Vice Director General of the Canadian Barrick Gold Mine.
This confirms, and follows an Orwellian logic, that the largest gold mining company in the world sought a libel suit of six million against three authors and a small penniless publishing house with the aim of opening a “public transparent debate.”
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, then they do not judge the truth, especially in the case of libel suits, but the law.
As expected, this fundamental difference was completely concealed by Mr Garver.
Because for Barrick Gold, the best way to have a public debate is to ruin anyone who dares to hold an opinion that is contrary to theirs.
Regardless of the outcome of the trial, the authors and editors of the book Noir Canada will have to spend considerable sums to prepare their defenses and use very unequal weapons to fight an army of lawyers who are paid out of the almost inexhaustible pockets of the gold mine.
The tactic in these unequal struggles, moreover, is often to ruin the defenders in order to force an amicable settlement that silences the opposing side and also deters anyone who dares to deal with the issue again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, she would have had to present her view of things to public opinion.
In contrast to what is common in many of the countries where Barrick Gold works, debates in Canada are usually conducted through the exchange of ideas and not through clubbing.
It would have been enough, then, if the gold mine had disclosed its books and files and opened up a real debate, through which newspapers, media, publications and the funding of independent audit teams could have shed light on this issue.
But Barrick Gold doesn’t seem to have confidence in public opinion, wiping aside petitions and letters in support of Noir Canada’s authors with a hand gesture.
Could Mr Garver explain how he can at the same time ask for a 'public' debate and disregard the opinions of this very public?
Apparently, in the vice president’s world, this word includes only the generously paid lawyers, and not the community of all Canadians; a pretty narrow view of the term.
In a democracy, even slanderers have the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold doesn’t understand — or doesn’t want to understand — is that the public that supports the authors and editors of Noir Canada is doing so primarily because they reject the gold mine’s brutal stance.
This public is willing to listen to and judge Barrick, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, and not in a framework that many perceive as a gag complaint (in the course of the ‘public debate’, Barrick Gold has just addressed a demand to the authors of Noir Canada in which she asks them to stop using that term...).
Apart from Mr. Garver’s surreal speech, Barrick Gold’s lawsuit is a direct attack on the freedom of academic research and truth-finding that is fundamental to any democratic society.
It completely denies the right to cite credible sources and discuss facts and interpretations that form the basis of intellectual work.
If in a country like Canada it is impossible to research and discuss topics that do not please the rich companies of this world, who else can do that?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, she could lead it by following the scientific norms used by the authors of Noir Canada.
She has a right to answer.
The university environment to which we belong has long been able to handle debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold’s disproportionate lawsuit clearly shows that, contrary to what she claims, she doesn’t want a transparent debate.
This is a loss for the university world, as well as for public debate, and it is time for governments to take action to limit this type of unjustified lawsuit.
Rescue for Wall Street – Democrats and Republicans understand each other
The Bush administration and senior congressmen, Republicans and Democrats alike, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the largest economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the $700 billion plan, designed to stop the financial crisis that has been rocking Wall Street for months, has yet to be adopted by the two chambers of congress.
The main contents are: better control of MEPs over the practical application of the plan, new mechanisms to ensure the repayment of the public funds used, new decrees to limit the number of houses seized due to arrears, as well as the right to monitor the salaries paid to the executives of the supported companies.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, Chamber of Deputies President Nancy Pelosi, and Republican Representative Senator Judd Gregg, who was present at the negotiations, announced the good news yesterday, a few minutes after midnight, after a two-day negotiating marathon.
“We have made great progress toward an agreement that will be effective on the market,” said Bush administration representative Henry Paulson.
“Everything was done to protect the real economy and the American people from the Wall Street price crisis,” she said.
“This is the fundamental point: If we don’t do that, the trauma, chaos, and turmoil in the daily lives of Americans will be enormous,” Gregg said.
Negotiations had accelerated over the last two hours, fearing the effect of another failure on investor sentiment.
The deadline that had been agreed was the market opening this morning.
The two American presidential candidates, who took part in the negotiations only late, were more likely to be in favour of the agreement, but without failing to express their dissatisfaction with the need to meet them in this extreme way.
Democratic Senator Barrack Obama insisted on the addition of certain provisions to the agreement, especially those intended to allow owners to keep their homes, and those concerning the salaries of senior executives of the state-rescued companies.
“If you ask taxpayers to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of certain persons, that is not something to be congratulated on.
But these measures are necessary," he said on American television.
When asked on another channel if he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent John McCain replied, “I’d like to know the details first, but I hope so.
<0x60>The guiding principles that I have read [show] that this is one thing that we will all have to digest, and with which we will be able to move forward.
The option to do nothing at all is simply not acceptable,” he said.
The $700 billion plan is designed to save taxpayers' money.
It comes 14 months after a crisis triggered by the bursting of a real estate bubble that first led to the collapse of high-risk mortgage loans (subprime), before it expanded to other forms of more widespread bonds (PCAA), and eventually resulted in a freeze of financial power and the ruin of banks and financial institutions.
It was a group of Republican MPs who failed the first attempt at settlement last week.
Since the Democrats have accepted that certain “toxic” assets of the societies in distress should only be secured by the government and not bought, it is believed to escape the impasse.
To round out the view for everyone in Congress, an order has also been added that if the government were to make losses with this program within five years, it could then levy new taxes to recover its capital employed.
The new plan provides for the payment of an initial sum of 250 billion, to which an additional 100 billion can be added if the President considers it necessary.
The payment of another $350 billion must be approved by Congress in a re-vote.
In return for his help, Washington receives shares in the supported companies that will pay dividends in the event of profits and that it can sell back when the storm has passed.
The federal government will have the option of halting the attachment procedures regarding the housing tied to the real estate loans affected by this plan, and will also set deadlines for repayment and severance payments paid to the executives of the affected companies.
The developers of the plan would like the Chamber of Deputies to vote on him today, and then the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will get the green light.
In fact, more voices were raised against this plan yesterday, both by Republicans and Democrats.
“Obviously, Washington doesn’t understand us,” Republican Scott Garett, a member of the Chamber’s financial commission, told his constituents.
“Yes, we have a big financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not the one that consists of asking taxpayers to pay.’
Democratic Rep. Brad Sherman, leader of a group in Congress called “the caucus of skeptics,” presents things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
“Four hundred distinguished economics professors, including three Nobel laureates, have written to tell us that we ask Congress not to be pressured and to consider carefully what path to take,” he said.
At the same time, we in Europe were once again shown that this is a global crisis.
At an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the banking group Fortis for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion US dollars).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it would refrain from buying up its competitor, which is in great difficulty since it lost 2 billion euros (2.9 billion US dollars) in the crisis due to the high-risk real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the twenty largest European banks and the ten largest insurers.
“This is not lost money,” Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said.
In order to compensate, we receive a right to vote and influence in the bank.
This is exactly what savers and households appreciate now that uncertain times are about to dawn.”
During this time, on the other side of the English Channel, the British government was in the process of nationalizing another bank distressed by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all current loans at Bradford and Bringley Bank, including over 41 billion (75.5 billion US dollars) from real estate loans.
Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it would buy the branches and customer accounts of the British bank.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank the British government has had to nationalize since the beginning of this financial crisis, after Northern Rock.
Paul Newman (19252008) - Death of a dedicated icon
His beauty with the azure blue eyes was for a long time his trump card, no one would say his weakness.
Had the American actor freed himself from the narcissistic mirror with the charming smile?
Yes and no.
His sensitivity, sensibility and obvious talent have probably also kept him away from a position of power that gives birth to the truly terrible monsters.
But what a great endurance runner!
Paul Newman, who died Friday at the age of 83 from lung cancer at his ranch in Connecticut, remains one of the last icons of American cinema of his golden years.
He was less monumental than Brando, whom he resembled and for whom he was a kind of rival on the screen for a long time, more careful in his acting, certainly also more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the blowing up of dramaturgical conventions.
Mixed blood often results in wonderful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, the son of a German Jew and a Hungarian mother.
From its European roots, one of the glorious faces of the American dream was to emerge.
Without excessive ego, extreme quality feature.
Because in him was reflected an entire country that was in love with the self-made man, the fighter who was wounded in combat in the Pacific War, who studied acting at Yale in the early 1950s and then visited the Actor's Studio in New York, before he had success at the theater, on television and soon also in the cinema.
The same man who fought for civil rights was also the driver who came second in the 1979 24 Hours of Mans race, and also a sex symbol, even though he lived in a showpiece relationship with actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
With him, the unknown facets of this mysterious, restrained, committed and hypersensitive to the glamour of the show business disappear, whose puzzles will never be solved completely.
A decent man, in the purest sense of the word.
The death of Paul Newman left cinema lovers reeling this weekend as all his big roles were played on the dark screen of memories.
More than half a century of American cinematic art in constant change is passing by with him.
The charming cowboy from "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" (1969) comes to mind, and the young man who rejects his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in The Cat on the Hot Tin Roof, filmed by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
A much shorter memory (1990) is evoked of his sensitive Mr. Bridge, who in his old age is disturbed by a wedding that did not fulfill all her promises.
There have been so many other Paul Newmans throughout history.
This criminal, stormy, violent and unforgettable boxer Rocky Graziano from Somebody Up There Likes Me by Robert Wise, a role intended for James Dean, was reprised after his death and made the Newman really famous in 1956.
This sympathetic crook in the outstanding The Sting, who was awarded the Oscar for Best Film in 1973.
As a bitter and vengeful billiard player in the wonderful The Hustler by Robert Rossen (1961),
That face through the ages, that was him.
Still him.
In his life, epochs unite.
Young people know him from the cult film Slap Shot by George Roy Hill (1977), as Reggie Dunlop, the little orthodox coach of an ice hockey team.
His fans found him in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen brothers.
In 2003, he played the role of the godfather of the Irish mafia in Road to Perdition by Sam Mendes.
Unlike several cinema legends who retired from the film world early enough, Newman was to remain in the saddle for a long time, betraying Hollywood, its fortunes, its pageantry, and its concessions.
French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier saw him, not without humor, as a living challenge to the ‘underplaying’, when he judged his all-too-expressive performances.
The profession was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman, to whom the roles flew for a long time.
However, he rarely played Sunnyboys as an outsider: neurotic, alcoholic, mean-spirited or desperate, with whose perfect presentation he reflected his slipping and rebellion.
As a director, Newman revealed unknown sides of his true sensitive sensibility.
His 1968 Rachel, Rachel (after the novel by Canadian Margaret Laurence) with his wife Joanne Woodward in the lead role, drew a subtle female portrait full of melancholy.
He, who lost his son Scott to an overdose, dedicated his 1984 film Harry and Son, a work full of sensitivity and sadness.
His close friend and former comrade in arms Robert Redford (who had played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said: “His presence has improved my life and this country.”
Generosity and joie de vivre were essential characteristics of the late actor.
Apart from his legendary career, a great advocate of civil rights, environmental protection and independent cinema, an opponent of Hollywood drift, is now also going to die.
We have often seen him standing with his foot in bowls full of vinaigrette, in sauces, pastries or other foods, and thought this to be quite tasteless, although we found it funny at first.
Nevertheless, the profits from his sales flowed into his foundation for children in need.
Instead of resting on his myth, Newman engaged to the shot.
He left a letter to his five daughters with these words: “Always and until the very end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was an honor to be here.”
And it was an honor for us to be able to follow the life of such an intelligent and generous American actor.
An exemplary citizen, in the narrowest and broadest sense.
What was produced in the invoice factory of Zuschlag &amp; Co.?
On 8 October, negotiations will begin in the criminal trial against J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Zuschlag and his accomplices.
In particular, the defendants are accused of involvement in organised crime, as well as grossly negligent damage and business fraud, and other criminal acts, including falsification of documents.
According to the public prosecutor’s office, the funds gained from the tenders were used for their own purposes, while the services provided were often provided with fake invoices.
State funds and subsidies from the self-government - a total of HUF 65 million - are said to have flowed partly into the coffers of the organization Fiatal Baloldal, partly into the private coffers of individual.
As the investigating authorities announced, fictitious invoices were submitted when the tender funds were received, and the clubs should not have fulfilled their obligations.
According to the indictment, most of the bills were falsified.
The invoice blocks were bought at the market of J<0xC3><0xB3>zsefv<0xC3><0xA1>ros, the round seals were made in Kiskunhalas.
The decision on which companies to issue the invoices to was made on the round trip north of Lake Balaton, to which Istv<0xC3><0xA1>n Lados was awarded by J<0xC3><0xA1>nos.
In the course of this "exploration tour" Lados was to find guesthouses and restaurants.
He demanded invoices for the consumptions in order to be able to issue invoices for the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, as well as the self-government of Budapest based on these templates.
These accounts are said to have been manipulated by the majority of Istv<0xC3><0xA1>n Lados and his accomplice, Andr<0xC3><0xA1>s <0xC5><0x90>ri, the latter, according to our information, being responsible for the constitution of the corresponding reports.
One of the goals of Lados' "exploration tour" was a beer bar.
As can be seen from two invoices issued by Zuschlag and Co in 2003, the restaurant business is said to have hosted the ninety-member group of the association Biztos Pont Egyesület.
Now, however, the head of the company says that such a large group would not have fit into the restaurant at once.
Another invoice, issued in the summer of 2002 to the Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért Foundation, later known as Együtt a Harmadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért, also showed serious errors in form and content.
A guest house in Badacsonytomaj, which only has three rooms and can accommodate no more than ten people at a time, is said to have accommodated 130 guests.
Nor were there any limits to the imagination of the counterfeiters when it came to the Pigal Kft., a restaurant business whose accounting records of the customers Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért and Hopp<0xC3><0xA1> do not even appear, according to the prosecution.
As Managing Director Gy<0xC5><0x91>z<0xC5><0x91> Farkas informed hvg.hu, it was immediately clear to him that they were fake documents when documents were submitted to him by the public prosecutor during an interview.
"Our company name and tax number were incorrectly affixed to the stamp".
And further: apart from form errors, the fact that the company is said to have accommodated one hundred people, after having a total of eleven rooms, which are impossible to accommodate so many people, was also wrong.
Food was also mentioned on the bill, the restaurant was no longer in operation for a long time.
The busy counterfeiters also failed to verify that the Budapest travel agency they were targeting only offered trips abroad, and so they reported Hungary trips on the cash payment invoice, which also contradicted the company’s accounting practices.
As it became known in the course of the investigation, they also cited VAT on the invoices, although travel agency services relating to a country outside the EU are exempt from VAT.
The total amount of VAT was incorrect on four invoices issued by Hotel Révfülöp Kft. to the Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért Foundation, as the company charged only 15 percent VAT instead of 25. In addition, only machine invoices are issued by the employees, but the falsified documents were handwritten.
Another mistake made by the "accountants" was that in one case they had indicated "goods transport" as a service provided, although this is not offered by the company specialized in investment consulting, the prosecutor's office said.
Further formal errors - wrong invoice format, wrong stamp - were due to the fact that the invoices issued to Együtt a Harmadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tv<0xC3><0xA1>ny, as well as to XXI. Sz<0xC3><0xA1>zadi Kultur<0xC3><0xA1>lis Egyesület and Biztos Pont could be exposed as forgeries.
Likewise in the case of Ravenna Bt. and the sports camp Kunfehért<0xC3><0xB3>, whose managing directors asserted that they had never issued the invoices.
Another "mistake" has been made by the counterfeiters at the HIB Kft. from Ny<0xC3><0xAD>regyh<0xC3><0xA1>za: this company was at the time (2001) precisely in dissolution, when the group of Fiatal V<0xC3><0xA1>rosért Egyesület is said to have eaten there - the mass administrator therefore stated that he did not have the bills issued himself.
Consciously faked
The other group of accountants are people who were well aware that they would have to file fictitious invoices.
At the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifj<0xC3><0xBA> Szocialist<0xC3><0xA1>k, the Esély Budapestért Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tv<0xC3><0xA1>ny Foundation issued invoices for the Együtt a Harmadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért Foundation, amounting to approximately HUF 4 million.
According to the indictment, the managing director of Collab Kft. was persuaded by one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi, to issue the fictitious invoices.
Biogate Kft., which is also currently in liquidation, is also said to have cooperated with Zuschlag and Co.: In 2003, the GmbH is said to have supplied the foundation Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tv<0xC3><0xA1>ny, as well as the associations Atlasz Egyesület and Vörösfeny<0xC5><0x91> Egyesület with forged invoices with the total value of HUF 5 million, which related to services not provided.
However, there was also no payment transaction, as the invoices were cancelled immediately after they were issued, which the parties concerned forgot to mention in their documents.
The third group of accountants includes persons who are directly associated with the defendants.
One of them is Iv<0xC3><0xA1>n Kubatov, the postman of the Ukrainian managing director of Delta Tri<0xC3><0xB3> Kft., a Budapest-based but undetectable fuel and vehicle trading company.
This company is said to have issued several invoices for the sale of computer components in the total value of HUF approximately 18 million between October and December 2005.
According to the investigating authority, Cash Investment Kft. from Kiskunhalas, which has been in liquidation since 14 September 2005, is said to have acted as the buyer of these invoices.
The managing director of this company was a Romanian, to whom the company documents were also to be delivered by Iv<0xC3><0xA1>n Kubatov, between 2002 and 2005.
According to our information, Kubatov confessed during the investigation to having issued invoices in the name of the GmbH to the associations Atlasz and Hopp<0xC3><0xA1>, as well as to Együtt a Harmadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tv<0xC3><0xA1>ny and to having collected their equivalent value himself.
The companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt. are said to have been founded by Romanian bricklayers at Iv<0xC3><0xA1>n Kubatov’s express request.
In truth, however, none of these companies were active, which, according to the defendant, was due to lack of orders.
Nevertheless, he was able to benefit from the companies: At the request of his accomplice, the lawyer Zsolt Szente, who was commissioned to prepare the company’s founding documents, he issued invoices on behalf of the companies to the associations associated with the contract, such as Atlasz and Y-Gener<0xC3><0xA1>ci<0xC3><0xB3>.
In total, Kubatov is said to have issued 15 invoices with a total value of HUF 14.2 million to the organizations on behalf of the companies Cash Investment, Delta Tri<0xC3><0xB3>, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade.
The prosecutor’s office assumes that Kubatov could have collected 10% of the invoice amount as well as the VAT.
Kubatov is even said to have misused the company Szi-Beri Bt. for the issuance of fictitious invoices - in this case, the invoices were enclosed with Biztos Pont's applications.
Y-Gener<0xC3><0xA1>ci<0xC3><0xB3> and Szövetség a Modern Magyarorsz<0xC3><0xA1>gért submitted their applications to the T<0xC3><0xA1>ncsics Mih<0xC3><0xA1>ly Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tv<0xC3><0xA1>ny ("TMA") non-profit organization of the Socialist Party in January 2006.
Both received 500,000 forints each, but have misused these amounts.
To cover this up, they have submitted five fictitious invoices from Works Team Kft. to the TMA.
Incidentally, these bills were secured during the search of <0xC3><0x81>rp<0xC3><0xA1>d Kemecsei’s office in the Ministry of Education.
During the negotiations, some defendants are now expected to make a confession about the procedure of forgery, as they have already been filed before the public prosecutor’s office.
A sensation could be if the main defendant J<0xC3><0xA1>no decides to make a comprehensive confession.
His statements so far were less detailed, and although he had already promised several times to report extensively on everything, his confession is still pending.
The question remains whether this is in his interest, whether the socialists have concluded a pact with him regarding the reparation of the bulk of the damage suffered by HUF 50 million, and whether he is willing to accept responsibility in return.
However, it is quite possible that Zuschlag now plays the "offender" after his applications for mitigation of detention and house arrest had fallen on deaf ears.
While other criminals who have done far greater damage with economic crimes and have not remunerated them, are at large, or at least under house arrest, this possibility is denied.
The Psychology of Exceeding – or Why We’re Ready to Pay More
In auctions, buyers tend to spend more and thus overvalue the bid.
Neurologists and economic researchers at the University of New York have now succeeded in discovering the neurological-economic foundations of this well-known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to a study published in "Science" magazine, people do not want to give themselves up in a competition, such as an auction on eBay, and are therefore willing to pay excessive prices.
The researchers have tried to explore the neurological scheme of this "game" with experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers was to play the lottery while the other participated in a playful action - in both cases, the active brain regions of the subjects were examined using functional magnetic resonance (fMRI).
In both games, the participants were able to win money, but increased activity of the striatum, a complex below the cerebral cortex, was measured in losers of the auction, in which the overtaking of the opponent plays an essential role.
Among many other functions, this brain region is responsible for the "self-reward" of the nervous system.
The researchers therefore felt that the price increase could be explained by avoiding an overreaction of the striatum.
To substantiate their thesis, the economists in the research group have additionally conducted investigations into the tracking of money.
In this case, three groups should compete against one partner under different conditions.
The control group was told the true value of the product, after which they made their bets.
Another group was also promised a $15 reward in case they emerged victorious from the game.
The third group received $15 before the auction, which was also lost in the event of a lost game.
The only difference between the two groups was that the emphasis was on winning while the emphasis was on losing.
As proof of the hypothesis expressed by neurologists, however, the members of the “against losing” gambling group were ready for higher stakes than those in the control or “profit” group.
"These results cannot be deduced from any previous economic theory.
These have so far only justified the behaviors observed at auctions with the joy of winning or avoiding risk.
The contradiction between these two theories has been resolved thanks to the imaging neurological procedures, so we now have a third explanation ready," said Andrew Schotter, professor of economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When to see a doctor?
Around half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary, this chronic liver disease is listed among the leading causes of death.
The number of infected is estimated to be one hundred thousand in Germany, but only seven thousand are treated, which is because patients often do not know that they are infected.
Hepatitis is the collective term for infectious liver disease caused by various viruses.
The symptoms are often similar - liver inflammation and jaundice are common, but the pathogens and diseases differ from each other.
Depending on the pathogen, the hepatitis viruses spread in two different ways: in the case of hepatitis A and E through the digestive tract (for example, through contaminated food or water), in the case of hepatitis B, C and D, the viruses can be transmitted through blood and other body fluids (such as semen, vaginal secretions or saliva).
Travellers are advised to vaccinate against viruses A and B in any case, there is no vaccine against virus C.
The symptoms of hepatitis A appear about two to three weeks after consumption of the contaminated food and are generally accompanied by discomfort, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea.
After that, jaundice appears on the skin and in the eyes, the stool becomes light, the urine dark, and recovery can last up to two-three weeks.
Worldwide, about 1 million people die each year from the much more serious diseases caused by hepatitis B, such as liver cancer and cirrhosis.
The main reason for this is that it is estimated that only one in ten people infected is on medication.
Hepatitis C can also have serious consequences: untreated, it can lead to cirrhosis of the liver and liver cancer.
Most infected people do not even know about their disease, as the pathogen insidiously destroys the liver cells - in many cases, the first symptoms appear after 20-30 years.
Therefore, timely prevention, such as regular check-ups, is essential.
There are three groups in which this disease is more common: those who underwent a blood transfusion before 1991, drug addicts, and tattooed.
Currently, the number of chronic hepatitis C patients worldwide is estimated at 200 million.
Since the disease can already be detected during a routine laboratory examination, it is advisable to visit the family doctor at the first signs of unknown origin.
Recognized in time, the disease is curable, the virus can be eradicated, eliminating the risk of infection and preventing the development of cancer.
September 30 is World Hepatitis Day, held for the first time in 2004 by patient representatives worldwide.
The aim of the action is to raise awareness of this chronic hepatitis caused by viruses, its development and the importance of early detection.
Do believers have less pain?
According to recent research, religious faith acts as a kind of “painkiller” that is said to have already facilitated the death of Catholic martyrs.
Scientists at Oxford University have conducted an interesting experiment: it was investigated to what extent the belief in God affects the sensation of pain in humans, reported the British newspaper "Telegraph".
In the course of the rather bizarre investigation, 12 believers and atheists each received electric shocks while studying a painting of the Mother of God.
As the results showed, believers were able to eliminate most of the pain.
Using a brain scan technology, it was even possible to prove that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain that is responsible for pain regulation.
The study was the first in a research project involving not only scientists but also philosophers and theologians from various departments of the university.
During the experiment, a sparkling device was attached to the left hand, which gave the electric shocks.
Participants were asked to focus heavily on two paintings: on the one hand an image of the Mother of God, painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century, and on the other hand Leonardo da Vinci’s “Lady with the Hermitage”.
The researchers hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary would evoke a kind of religious trance among the faithful while selecting da Vinci’s painting because it was hardly different from the other painting and felt reassuring.
The subjects each spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, and during this time received a total of 20 electric shocks in four stages, while they were to look at either the religious or the other painting.
Catholics reported feeling “safe” at the sight of the Mother of God, as if “cared for,” and feeling “calm and peace.”
While looking at the religious painting, they reported over 12% less pain than when they had Leonardo’s work in mind.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the experiment, said that similar effects could also be caused by other, strong-looking images in the atheists, one would just have to find the corresponding photo.
"We would have to find a picture that triggers very positive sensations, such as a mother or a father," says the psychologist.
Anglican Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
“Practicing faith should change our personality, and in many cases it does,” Wright said.
After these excellent results, the only question left is what effect a Madonna painting of Leonardo or another comparable painter would have on the pain regulation of the faithful.
Would the high-quality Virgin Mary achieve even better results?
You are what you say about yourself
On the occasion of her tenth birthday, Google can rightly claim: she can be found in people’s pockets as well as above their heads in the sky: she knows where people have spent their holidays, which specialists they go to, and what moves her.
And that’s still not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, one of the CEOs of Google.
In the direction of skeptics, who are plagued by Orwellian horror visions, he says: These would just overlook the essentials of Web 2.0.
In a recent interview with the Financial Times, Schmidt said Google’s main goal was to collect even more personal data about users, bringing it closer to the company’s original goal of “ordering all the information in the world.”
Schmidt said that after ten years of world-changing work, Google is still only at the beginning of information gathering.
Asked about the status quo in five years, Schmidt said he wished Google would be able to answer questions such as "What should I do tomorrow?" or "What job really suits me?", but software programs were not yet able to do this because they did not know enough about the users.
Not all Internet users are aware that in the course of their Internet searches, the search terms would be registered, as well as the IP addresses from which they were searched, and the pages visited.
For example, the "Personalized Search", introduced two years ago, allows the visitor to save his own search history and later access it, so that the hits can be generated much more precisely later, and the same logic is also used to base the so-called "Recommendations", with which the system recommends customized products and services based on the previous preferences.
However, users wonder what happens in the event of data misuse - "If you look at what I do" - some are concerned about the Google data monopoly.
In most cases, however, it is more the potential power represented by the company that is frightening, and less the sense of guilt or fear of punishment, the pursuit of freedom, or the revolt against the power that is met with rejection by many Internet users.
However, it is a proven fact that the search terms are not only stored, but are also passed on to third parties in the event of an incident, and in these cases there is no protection for the personal rights of the Internet user.
A prime example of this was the recent crackdown on paedophilia in Brazil, in which Google provided the Brazilian government with information collected by the community site called “Orkut” that also allowed the pedophilia to be identified.
However, users concerned about personal rights were able to breathe a sigh of relief in May, when Google, together with the civil rights organization EFF, successfully went to court against the FBI: according to this, Google can still in the future not be forced with any point of the Constitution to release information to the FBI on secret request.
(However, the Federal Government has successfully obtained the publication of 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms with reference to the Youth Protection Act passed years ago, but has been deprived of the list of individual users, or their web and search terms list, for two months retroactively.)
So Google’s image remains controversial: those who are reluctant to release their personal data because they fear the loss of their privacy and privacy through the use of Google services are lashing out at the company with the outrage due to the conservative companies.
However, the American “geek culture,” which is present in many countries and unites avid computer fans, activists and users, sees the next generation of “cool entrepreneurs” in them, as opposed to Microsoft, which is market leader thanks to Windows, even if both are fighting for the same goal.
One possible reason for this is that, unlike Microsoft, Google does not require its users to have identification codes, and provides its services for free, so an open, constantly updated source code and program package seems far more attractive, youthful, and cooler than the official practices of the software giant.
On the other hand, the geeks see through the problematic relationship between personal rights and the Internet in a razor-sharp way - a relationship that has come to the fore especially in recent years thanks to the term "Web 2.0".
"Web 2.0" is about nothing more than collaboration, that is, the users deliberately leave traces and use the available communication channels, and even if the dimensions are individually different, the main thing remains the same, namely to show themselves in public.
An average young person can simultaneously manage their profile on multiple community portals - from Facebook to Xanga, can connect them through other services such as Twitter, or music services such as last.fm, and can eventually incorporate all of this into a tracking system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. In addition, they can run blogs that automatically display the latest photo galleries posted on Flickr or Picasa.
And a number of other exemplary cases prove: When looking at the party photos of the previous night, the girlfriend soon finds out who her unfaithful friend was having fun with, or the employee is fired because he is all too honestly venting his anger about company management on his blog - one thing is for sure: The term "privacy" has now been completely reinterpreted.
Who lives an online life is what he reveals about himself - so one could formulate the basic idea behind the behavior of today's youth.
And those who try to keep something secret, or even bypass the Google monopoly, can do so - such as with Scroogle, a tool that accesses Google's search engine, but deliberately leaves no traces.
Quite a few people deliberately do not register on community pages so that they cannot be found, but also Google’s online applications, such as word processing and graphic tools and RSS feeds, can be handled with alternative versions that are not tied to huge server parks and therefore do not generate the best possible profile from the user.
Public opinion, however, is waiting until Google shows its true face.
With its current value of USD 156 billion, the company is even ahead of IBM (USD 140 billion), Intel (USD 124 billion) or Coca-Cola (USD 110 billion), AdWords/AdSense’s advertising space threatens the revenues of advertising agencies, and the ever-faster introduction of services is causing headaches not only for Microsoft but also for other software developers.
Critical observers, however, also find the disturbing opposites: For example, the company management has completely rejected a protest by the employees, after the fees of the company's own kindergarten were doubled, and the management said that the repeated feeding of the employees is too expensive. However, all this would seem to contradict the fact that Google in 2006 was even in the taste before the Chinese government went to the knee and agreed with an agreement.
The internal regulation of the group is that no new service will be advertised in advance, but only if it is already available. Nevertheless, the events of the coming months and years could turn things around again a lot: While some think that Google's book and magazine scanning or archiving project is now assuming dimensions that the company would soon have to deal with the Supreme Court of Justice, so others are worried about the situation because of the "health" system.
And the fact that Google is building a genetic database is already providing the stuff to the next generation of sci-fi authors - such as "Scroogled", the famous novel by Cory Doctorow describes in the best Orwellian way a future in which a human being becomes frighteningly approachable thanks to data obtained from Google.
Two teenagers help the double murderer of <0xC3><0x93>zd in the removal of traces
In connection with the double murder of <0xC3><0x93>zd, the police have now interrogated two young people who are suspected of having helped in the removal of the traces, said the spokesman of the police commissariat Borsod on Tuesday.
The young people were acknowledging, and they are currently being charged with the aid.
According to the MTI news agency, they are two girls who defend themselves on the loose.
Aid is threatened with imprisonment of up to five years.
The suspect of the double murder of <0xC3><0x93>zd, a 23-year-old local man, was taken into custody on Sunday.
The man is under urgent suspicion of having deliberately murdered several people out of greed for money.
In the course of the investigation, it turned out that the 23-year-old had owed a 53-year-old a larger amount of money.
However, the suspect did not want to pay his debts, so he lured his creditor to a site in <0xC3><0x93>zd last Wednesday, where he murdered him and his nine-year-old daughter.
According to the MTI, the man planned the crime long-term - this is also evidenced by the fact that he committed the murders with a weapon hidden at the scene.
Together with experts, the police are now investigating the weapon and the circumstances of its use.
Warsaw Stock Exchange submits tender offer for Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange has offered around 200 million euros, or 5 billion Czech crowns, for the one hundred percent purchase of the Prague Stock Exchange’s stock packages.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, reiterated the offer made by the Poles despite the fact that they were previously excluded from the Czechs as potential owners of their stock exchange.
The reason for this is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is entirely owned by the state.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which, however, wants to sell more than 60% of the papers in the coming months.
According to reports from the Czech daily E15, the offer from Poland includes the highest purchase price ever offered for the Prague Stock Exchange.
As the newspaper reports, so far the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse have made offers.
Petr Koblic, head of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that of all the interested parties, the Warsaw Stock Exchange would probably be the worst new owner, and he did not rule out that this could even lead to the closure of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange at 5-10 billion crowns.
According to the shareholders’ agreement, 90% of the shares could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is Patria Finance Investmentbank with a 25 percent stake, followed by Cesk<0xC3><0xA1> Sporitelna Bank with 14.7 and Tiger Holding Four S.a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis from the point of view of European newspapers
In their comments dedicated to the ever-increasing international financial crisis, some leading European newspapers on Tuesday already spoke of “the second of September 11”.
We owe the global financial disaster to the American president, for example, said "La Repubblica" - the president had not even been able to unite his own party for the bill behind him, which should bring some relief to the frightening situation...
Instead of a “new Pearl Harbor,” as billionaire investor Warren Buffett called it, it would be more appropriate to talk about a “second September 11.”
Parts of the press in Madrid also locate the scapegoat in Washington.
According to El Mundo, the lack of political leadership is due to the fact that the global economy is now on the verge of collapse.
The American financial system is in danger of collapsing more and more, and the whole world will suffer.
Bush’s plan was not perfect, but now, after the vote in Congress, there is the danger that Washington has no political means of managing the crisis.
The world economy is hanging in the air, just at a time when one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism is taking place.
One can no longer ignore the threat, says the Geneva "Tages-Anzeiger".
Still, some states could provide bailouts to their faltering financial institutions and save the banks from bankruptcy with taxpayers’ money.
However, if a domino effect is triggered and more banks go bankrupt, then neither further financial injections nor other immediate measures help.
In the long term, EU member states would have to step up their shadow and centralize control over the money markets.
On Monday alone, more than EUR 100 billion was paid out to weakening financial institutions, the Viennese "Der Standard" recalls. In addition, according to the newspaper, the concerns are increasingly realistic that, according to the Americans, European taxpayers now also have to dig a little deeper into their pockets to get out of the crisis.
So far, the EU has not seriously dealt with the crisis, which is now sweeping across the old continents like a tsunami.
The "saviors" would not have to "weave" with several hundred billion euros at once, but it would be advisable to maintain, in which case it would be reasonable to touch the taxpayers' money in order to avert even greater damage.
Intelligent car mimics the flight of the bumblebee
What would be the best method to develop new technologies for accident prevention, if not to imitate the obstacle sensors from nature?
For example, the bees.
At CEATEC in Japan, an amazing project was presented, in which Nissan engineers were inspired by bumblebees in creating new accident-avoiding systems.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built the BR23C biomimetic system, a mini-car equipped with the characteristics of bees, with the aim of supporting the development of a system that avoids any collisions.
In flight, each bee forms its own oval “private area” that is very similar to our own “protective shield,” Kazuhhiro Doi, product manager for technology PR and research development, said at the exhibit.
The compound eye of the bee, which can see in any direction and at an angle of over 300 degrees, plays an important role in this.
To mimic the function of the compound eye, the researchers took up the idea of the laser-controlled distance meter.
This identifies obstacles in front of the BR23C in a field of view of 180 degrees within 2 meters, calculates their distances and sends signals to the microprocessor on board, which immediately initiates the collision-avoiding process.
The obstacle is registered in fractions of a second, and the autorobot immediately changes course, similar to the movement of the bees, by turning the tires around the corresponding angle.
In contrast to previous systems, this maneuver takes place purely instinctively.
“If it wasn’t, the autorobot wouldn’t be able to react fast enough to avoid the obstacles,” said Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Laboratory and Autorobot project.
The system must respond instinctively and immediately, as this technology corresponds to the innermost and most vulnerable part of the shield - a layer within which accidents are currently still considered unavoidable.
The entire process must reflect the behavior of the bees as they dodge other bees.
And that has to happen in a fraction of a second.
However, in contrast to the bees, the dodging cannot take place up, down, or even diagonally - it can only be two-dimensional, and only in the direction of the manoeuvrability of the tires.
While there are endless possibilities for the bees to avoid other bees, the researchers were only able to use rotary motion, or acceleration and deceleration, in the autorobot.
The BR23C contains lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and more energy efficient, and therefore have a longer lifespan than conventional lithium-ion batteries.
Andoh explained that it comes down to the instinctive, intelligent response, and less to the processing of the data, and even less to the ability to store it.
This device only needs to process a few inputs per second and respond to them accordingly.
It does not have to store them, or produce an intuitive, logical response based on previous maneuvers, so that it requires only a handful of KB of memory on an ongoing basis.
There is no need for gigabyte and megabyte heavy memories.
This is the first step in the development of the immediate collision avoidance technology, which Nissan estimates will be in production as standard within the next ten years.
Another application could be the technology in GPS satellite navigation, by deliberately steering the driver around obstacles and thus leading him to his destination.
A name for the sinful child
Now the written version of the $700 billion bailout bill is available, which will be applied in several stages and aims to purchase the banks’ bad loans.
In the first round, half of the money will be spent.
In a meeting that ended on Saturday after midnight local time on the East Coast, Congressmen have come to terms with an agreement on the $700 billion bailout package after several days of debate, Reuters reported.
"We've made significant progress," said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic President of the U.S. House of Representatives, and said the deal only had to be put on paper.
The compromise reached on the bailout package was supported by both presidential candidates – Barack Obama and John McCain.
Finance Minister Henry Paulson said the program will be effective and efficient, but more needs to be done, Pelosi said, not to save Wall Street, but to take the helm of the economy.
The written version of the package was published before the opening of the Asian markets, i.e., Washington time on Sunday evening at 8 a.m. (Central European time on Monday at 2 a.m.), but did not trigger a high rise on the stock markets.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will first vote on the 2008 bill to stabilize the economy, then it will be the turn of the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke with Pelosi on Saturday night, and the White House also welcomed the news of the deal.
"We are pleased with the progress made at night and appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our markets and protect our economy," White House spokesman Tony Fratto said in a statement.
The program, however, deviates from the Bush administration’s initial recommendation that the $700 billion be spent at once to purchase rotten, credit-laden securities.
In a first tranche, a maximum of half of the $700 billion is to be spent, with $250 billion immediately available after Congress is expected to vote on the causa on Monday, which is to be spent on the purchase of credit-laden, bad securities, and the president is to decide on the additional $100 billion.
The program will be reviewed by its own commission, which also includes the President of the Federal Reserve.
The other half of the $700 billion depends on another decision by Congress.
In the sense of the law, the Ministry of Finance can also use a combined tactic: it can simultaneously buy bad loans, mortgages, and mortgage-loaded securities, or other "toxic" loans.
As reported by the competent persons of the Ministry, the purchase can be made both in an auction and directly.
The law allows the companies concerned to participate in an insurance program where the Ministry of Finance guarantees the funds of concern and the companies pay fees corresponding to the expected damages.
Henry Paulsen said: “The law defines the necessary funds in such a way that up to $700 billion can be provided as emergency aid to the American financial system, whether for the large-scale purchase of bad funds, their insurance, or the avoidance of a systemic risk triggered by the collapse of a larger financial institution.
We are taking the necessary steps to be ready to introduce the law as soon as it is signed, Paulson said.
However, the bosses of the banks, which are in trouble and now rely on state aid, can expect that their clearances, which are called "Golden Handshake" in the overseas slang salopp, will be shortened by the government.
Salaries will only be cut in certain cases, and these cuts will depend on how the Treasury helps each.
The cut essentially means that if the ministry purchases as part of an auction, the “golden handshake” will be taxed unless the disused bank chief is deported to the pension.
In the case of a direct purchase of the bad loans, the government will engage aggressively to ensure that manager salaries are not overstated.
The picture also includes the fact that the existing Golden Handshake contracts will not be changed - the restrictions only refer to new agreements, so that more people participate in the program.
This is the first case in American history that cuts in manager salaries are regulated by law, Democrat Barney Frank, chairman of the finance committee, commented on the measure.
The state gains ownership rights in the participating banks, so that the risk for the taxpayers decreases, as they can also participate, as soon as the economy and thus the rescued bank is better again.
The bill requires the president to submit to Congress over the next five years a proposal on how taxpayers should get their lost money back from the financial sector.
However, there were skeptics on both sides who expressed their doubts about the plan.
That’s not what the American people expect from us, the plan does not protect taxpayers’ money, according to California Republican Darrell Issa.
His Ohio colleague, Mary Kaptur, said: “The measures were driven by the same people who are also responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industrial prices continue to rise
Like the Central Statistical Office, domestic sales prices rose by 0.1 percent in August 2008 compared to the previous month, and by 12.9 percent compared to August 2007.
Export prices were 1.1 percent higher than in July 2008 and fell by 3.9% compared to the previous year’s prices.
Due to price changes in the domestic and export sectors, production prices were 0.7% higher than in the previous month and 3.2% higher than in 2007.
Domestic sales prices have risen only slightly, i.e. by 0.1 percent, compared to the previous month.
The selling prices of the manufacturing industry also rose only slightly - 0.1 percent - since July.
The biggest price increase in August 2008 was for leather goods (2.8 percent) - primarily for bags and belts - where the increase was 4.6 percent, and for shoes prices rose by 2.5 percent.
Higher prices for plastics and chemical raw materials significantly increased prices for chemicals and production (1.6 percent).
Price declines were recorded in crude oil processing (1.4 percent), electrical and technical equipment (0.9 percent) and wood processing (0.1 percent).
Prices in paper production, publishing and printing remained unchanged.
In other branches of the manufacturing industry, a price increase of between 0.2 and 0.9 percent was measured.
In the important domestic markets of the industry, such as electricity, gas, steam and water supply, prices rose by 0.3 percent in August, primarily as a result of the price increase in gas introduced on 1 July.
Looking at the domestic sales markets of the manufacturing industry year-on-year, prices in crude oil processing have risen the most (32.4 percent).
In the metalworking sector, a 13.2% increase was observed, while the increase in the production of food, beverages, and tobacco was 11 percent.
A drop in prices was observed in the textile industry (2.5 percent) and in electrical and technical equipment (0.3 percent).
The level of inflation in the other manufacturing industries was between 0.6 and 9.1 percent.
Overall, prices in the manufacturing industry rose by 10.2% last year.

In the domestic sales market, the highest price increase was recorded in the asset sector in August (0.7 percent).
In the consumer goods production sectors, prices rose by 0.3 percent, while they remained the same in the energy and processing sector compared to the previous month.
The largest price increase in August 2008 was observed in the energy and re-use sector (16.8%) compared to the same period in 2007.
In the consumer goods manufacturing sectors, a price increase of 6.8 percent was noted, while a price reduction of 1.4 percent was noted for the assets.
Industry export prices measured in forint rose by 1.1 percent in August compared to the previous month, but declined by 3.9 percent year-on-year.
The domestic currency weakened by 1.7 percent compared to the euro, the dollar by 7.1 percent, and compared to the August 2007 exchange rate, it strengthened by 7.5 percent compared to the euro, the dollar even by 15.9 percent.
No more visas to the United States from 2009 onwards?
Kinga Göncz sees good chances that the U.S.-Hungarian visa agreement will enter into force around January 12, as the foreign minister explained to the representatives of the Hungarian community in Chicago.
In her opinion, "everything now depends only on whether the electronic immigration or control system is introduced overseas in time."
However, she also stressed that there will be no entry permit in the new system, but tourists would have to register in advance.
The Head of Hungarian Diplomacy is conducting negotiations in Washington from today.
She meets Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who will present her with the “Middle Cross of Merit with Star” of the Republic of Hungary, and she will also hold talks with the foreign policy advisors of Democrat Barack Obama and Republican presidential candidate John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain support bailout package for banks
Barack Obama and John McCain, the two presidential candidates of the major American parties, on Sunday pledged their support for the $700 billion bailout package for banks, but there are also politicians who are calling for the resignation of the finance minister.
Congress and government officials have announced after days of marathon consultations on Sunday morning that they have reached an agreement on the bank bailout package.
The crisis of Wall Street, as well as the thawing of the frozen credit market became the central issues of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain – both claim to be better suited than their opponents to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to recent polls, Obama was able to expand his lead thanks to the economic issues, while McCain’s high, which gave him the presentation of vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin after the Republican convention, has melted away at the same time.
At a campaign event in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that Congress will quickly pass the bill on the $700 billion package.
He stressed that the plan also includes those passages of consumer protection that he has helped to support.
“We must act now, responsibly... your jobs, your savings, entire industries, and the stability of the entire economy are under threat,” he told 35,000 spectators.
He did not fail to describe McCain’s economic visions as “obsolete.”
In an interview with ABC, McCain said, “We’re all going to have a hard time squeezing this ... but doing nothing is definitely not an alternative.”
The Republican senator said the plan also prescribes the setting up of a control commission for the Treasury Secretary, as well as limiting clearances for top managers — something he had insisted on.
Obama told CBS that McCain had not played a definitive role in the negotiations, while he, Obama, was in contact with the minister.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Sunday that the House will likely vote on the bill on Monday.
Press review of the German-speaking world
The right-wing camp is intact, only the voters within the camp became more self-confident - so comments "Der Spiegel" the weak performance of the CSU in Bavaria.
In Austria, Haider and Co are ready to govern to prevent a red-black coalition.
The Mirror (Spiegel.de)
In the online edition of the left-wing German news magazine, Franz Walter analyses the reasons for the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article "Bavaria's Revolution annihilates its fathers".
According to the renowned political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo took over.
The Christian Socials have renewed Bavaria for decades - now it is precisely the modern citizens who are turning away from them.
The break of the epoch is at the same time a problem of Christian democracy, as well as for Angela Merkel.
The disaster of the CSU did not come as a surprise, but on Sunday something came to an end, which, however, was already quite exactly ten years ago: the undoubted hegemony of a state party.
Ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU landed at 47.7 percent, falling below the fifty percent mark for the first time since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 federal elections, i.e. in the much-cited Stoiber era.
The modernisation consistently pursued by the CSU in the federal state has finally destroyed its own mothers and fathers.
Sociologists had already predicted this 40 years ago, but at the same time underestimated themselves considerably in the pace, but without effect could not remain the secularization, the educational successes, the influx of East and North Germans into the prosperous regions of Bavaria on the loyalty of the CSU voters.
Modernisation is always accompanied by an increase in options. And this has political consequences.
The right-wing camp is intact - only the voters within the camp became more critical and idiosyncratic.
It is striking that in recent weeks, the classical citizen groups have expressed the greatest distance to the CSU: the liberal professions, the commercial bourgeoisie and voters with a high school diploma such as a university degree.
Here, the support of the CSU dropped to even below 40 percent.
The press (diepresse.com)
The conservative newspaper Wiener Tageszeitung reports in its article entitled "Who with whom? Party leaders restrained in coalition issues" about the chaotic domestic political situation in Austria after the new elections.
The SP<0xC3><0x96> wants to negotiate with the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
The <0xC3><0x96>VP prohibits the interference of the SP<0xC3><0x96> in internal affairs.
The BZ<0xC3><0x96> is open for talks in all directions, while the Greens do not yet want to commit themselves to a coalition.
The new elections are over, and now it is all about the coalition; in the debates on public television, the party leaders barely let themselves be seen in their cards.
SP<0xC3><0x96> leader Werner Faymann reiterated his desire to negotiate with the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
The SP<0xC3><0x96> wants to show that cooperation between both parties is very possible - this is already the case in some federal states and in the social partnership.
Faymann left open the question of whether he could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current <0xC3><0x96>VP chief as vice-chancellor.
As he said, the voters had voted out of the bowl-murderer course.
A repetition of this direction would be out of the question.
Molterer has, however, reacted cautiously to red offers.
The cooperation could not be fruitful, he said, if Faymann tries to interfere in internal concerns of the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
Whether his party goes into opposition or into the coalition is currently completely open, and these questions should be discussed internally by the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
BZ<0xC3><0x96> boss Jörg Haider was open in all directions.
"To prevent red-black, we are ready to take on government responsibility," Haider said.
J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka: The cycle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today in Paris, the European Summit on Equal Opportunities has started, which is being hosted this year by the EU Presidency country France.
In her speech to the plenary, L<0xC3><0xAD>via J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka, Fidesz MEP of the European People’s Party, drew particular attention to the segregation of education, which is one of the most serious violations of the rights of Roma children, and is also the biggest obstacle to their need for validity.
The high-level conference was opened by the French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, Xavier Bertrand, on behalf of the French Presidency of the Council, and Vladimir Spidla, EU Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Among the participants were representatives of governments, the European social partners, as well as the most important European legal protection and civil society organisations in the field of equal opportunities.
As reported by the Fidesz Press Office, J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka drew attention to the fact that, in addition to discrimination in job search, the Roma would be displaced from the labour market primarily because of their low level of education.
"The vast majority of Roma youth do not have middle school education, and thanks to poor primary education, only a small proportion of them can reach a university degree".
J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka also stressed that education is a fundamental human right, which plays a key role in the assertion of other human rights.
Investing in the early education of Roma children could strengthen the economy of EU member states.
In the opinion of the honourable Members, it is important that a wide range of people - Roma and non-Roma - become aware of these connections.
Because the earlier a Roma student starts school, the more his chances of becoming a productive member of the labor market increase; and through income tax and sales tax, they contribute to national spending.
"As citizens of the Union, Roma must be guaranteed the right to quality education - the bad and segregated education must be stopped," said L<0xC3><0xAD>via J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka.
As the honourable Member said, a common, goal-oriented and action-oriented approach by the European Union is necessary to speed up the process of desegregation in the education sector, in order to ensure that the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives are complied with correctly.
"We must break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation, and unemployment and give Roma children the democratic opportunities to contribute to the future of Europe as full citizens," J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka said.
Since the congress in Berlin last year, the summit has been held annually with the aim of creating a unique forum for advancing the goals of equal opportunities and non-discrimination at European and national level, in the sense of the "European Year of Equal Opportunities".
CSU: Mercy on Time
At the end of October, the fate of the fallen duo Huber-Beckstein will be decided
Despite the election debacle, no heads are rolling for the time being, at the head of the Bavarian CSU, the personnel debates were postponed.
Party leader Erwin Huber and Prime Minister Beckstein remain in their offices, the question is only how long this grace lasts.
The fate of the tandem after the catastrophic 17 percent vote loss will be decided at the extraordinary party congress on the last weekend of October.
The much reviled duo, however, already let it see that it does not want to stick on their chairs.
In doing so, they want to appease the angry faction and the party base, which demanded personal consequences a day after the "Bavarian tsunami" in the face of the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - admittedly, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber, who was at his peak in his career - the Christian Social Union reached 60.7 percent. Now, however, one year after the coup against Stoiber, they could secure only 43.4 percent of the votes.
For 46 years, the CSU was a “sole governor” in Bavaria, which generates 18 percent of Germany’s GDP.
Although the conservatives remain the determining force in the southern federal state, which is also important for the Hungarian economy, they will have to govern in a coalition in the future.
As a first sign of the party-internal restructurings, the potential successor of Huber, Vice President and Federal Agriculture Minister Horst Seehofer will also be involved in the exploration team, which is conducting exploratory talks with the liberal FDP and the right-wing "free voters" about a possible Munich coalition.
It is an irony of fate that with the list of "free voters" Gabriele Pauli enters the legislature, whose anti-stoiber appearance the Huber-Beckstein Duo first exploited, in order to then mercilessly serve off the determined politician.
The CSU leadership is now concentrating all its forces on stabilizing Beckstein.
Stoiber, the former prime minister and chairman of the CSU, called September 28 the "bitter day of his political career".
On Monday, Huber made some toxic remarks toward the CDU – in his view, the CSU would have deserved far more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a signal to the CDU and thus also to Angela Merkel.
If the CSU, which also contributed a lot to the success at the national level in 2005, is not put back on its feet with a joint effort, Merkel cannot become chancellor again after the federal elections in September 2009.
Merkel, who has made no secret of her disappointment with the fiasco, believes that the CSU’s loss of ground will not have a negative impact on the grand coalition in Berlin.
What is relative, however, is that the wounded CSU will not be easier to govern, and the crisis of the Social Democrats continues.
At 18.6 percent, the SPD achieved its best result in Bavaria since 1946.
Lukashenko opposition: 110-0
In the elections on Sunday, no member of the opposition made it to the Ukrainian parliament.
Russian observers believe this is due to the prosperity and stability in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, but the OECD suspects illegalities in counting the votes.
The OECD, which has sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the elections.
Although the legislature of the 10-million-strong state has been without opposition for decades, the opposition, assembled under the name "United Democratic Forces" (ODS), has seriously hoped before yesterday's elections that Lukashenko, who would renew his presidential mandate for the fourth time in the dirty elections and thanks to a constitutional amendment in 2006, "this time to allow some members of the opposition".
That is why the ODS has even distanced itself from the previously planned boycotts.
Ukraine is becoming more and more economically dependent thanks to rising prices for natural gas imports from Russia. Loans have even been taken out to alleviate price increases, and the country has also agreed to sell the Beltransgas, the owner of the gas pipeline leading through the country, to the Russians. Against the background of the opposition’s expectations, there was the hope that Ukraine would improve its relationship with the EU, after Lukashenko and other high-ranking politicians in the EU single-mocrat political system.
A temporary relaxation was provided by the evaluation report of the OECD elections, in which the emphasis was on the positive movements rather than on the shortcomings - such as the exclusion of a third of the opposition candidates from the elections.
However, as early as Monday, the OECD’s Quick Report criticised the campaign – meaning that opposition figures are unlikely to appear in the press – and in particular the fact that the opposition was not allowed to be present at the counting of votes.
Despite all this, the opposition is able to see an improvement in the political system: political prisoners have been set free, for example, and Minsk is even ready for minor confrontations with Moscow, continuing to deny recognition of the independence of the breakaway Georgian provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, although Russia, with which Ukraine on paper forms a federal state, has been considering the two territories as independent for a month.
"We have taken two steps forward and one backward, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun," Milinkevich said.
According to the opposition candidate of the 2006 presidential elections, a continuation is desirable, although "the powerful have become afraid to let even one opposition member into parliament".
The opposition is not planning any protest measures in view of the results, but rather tries to make the need for economic reform clear to the voters.
"We have many problems here - the oppositional newspapers have to be printed in Russia, the local authorities are putting stones in our way in the distribution, but still I see that more and more people are supporting the change, even the older ones" - said Milinkevich in allusion to the fact that not even the most supported layer of pensioners agrees with the Lukashenko regime, whose only merit is the production of social security.
"Thanks to the country's indebtedness and the increase in the trade deficit, it is only a matter of time before the "social security" that reminds us of the silence of a cemetery begins to crumble," said Milinkevich.
In contrast to the opposition politician, Russian observers have described the elections as democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, head of the Mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told the news agency Ria Novosti: "People believe in deeds, not words" The lack of opposition is therefore a proof of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on, breakfast will be served before work"
For the first time in the history of Palazzo Chigi, there are revolving doors for the entrances and exits of the officials.
From today, the measure will come into force against those who first stamp and then go drinking coffee during working hours.
The new "Anti-Faulpelz Act" was presented today by Renato Brunetta, Minister of Public Administration and Mauro Masi, Secretary General of the Bureau of the Council of Ministers.
“Rotary doors are a means of increasing work efficiency through a higher attendance rate and more services,” Brunetta said.
“Now a new era of responsibility and transparency is beginning.
This is reformism,” Brunetta reiterates.
With the Palazzo Chigi, the institution ends in all the buildings of the Presidium of the Council of Ministers.
Masi says: "the choice of rotating doors is also of great symbolic value".
There was no resistance on the part of the officials, the secretary-general assured: "This process was supported by all, cooperation came from all sides".
All in all, there is now no more breakfast during working hours; no more coffee or croissant.
Brunettas advises with a smile: "A good cappuccino at 7 o'clock works wonders".
During a meeting of the Superior Committee of Public Administration (Scuola Superiore della Pubblica Amministrazione)
of Rome, the Minister announces that "within three months the absences of officials have been reduced to 50%, i.e. 60,000 more people per year are present at work".
He added that it was necessary to strengthen the efficiency of the public administration of Italy.
"their wage dynamics - according to the minister - have been twice as large as the private sector and far above the inflation rate in the last 8-10 years".
In the meantime, thousands of civil servants have joined forces to counter the Brunetta decree in the context of the appeal supported by Codacons.
"While the Minister of Public Service profiles himself with figures on lower absences at work - writes the Consumer Centre - the people of 'active slackers' are constantly growing.
In fact, thousands of correct and valuable civil servants have come together to declare war on the illegal norms of the decree."
In particular, the Regional Administrative Court (TAR) is fighting for additional financial compensation for work-related illness, including the planned extension of the mandatory house arrest of the sick worker, during which inspection visits can be made, and other aspects of the Minister's innovations.
Napolitano: "Prevention against accidents at work is crucial"
Every day in Italy, 2,500 work accidents occur, three people die and 27 remain disabled for life.
For 2007, data from the Inail (Istituto nazionale contro gli infortuni sul lavoro) confirm that the fatal accidents at work were around 1200.
These figures prove the seriousness of a phenomenon that causes almost twice as many deaths as murders.
Today, in all the provinces of Italy, the Anmil (Associazione Nazionale Mutilati e Invalidi del Lavoro) will mark the 58th National Day for the Victims of Occupational Accidents, in order to draw the attention of social institutions and media to this dramatic situation.
"The worrying data disseminated by Anmil and the tragic news of these days confirm how crucial the question of prevention in the workplace is," affirms the President of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano in his communication to the President of the Amil (Associazione nazionale mutilati ed invalidi del lavoro) Pietro Mercandelli.
The head of state expressed his "great appreciation for the constant commitment to prevention in the workplace, to the protection of injured workers, to aid for the families of the victims and to raise awareness of public opinion".
"An outraged "Basta" has risen to this; understandable in tragedies that, measured by their magnitude, trigger some turbulence in the media and public participation. But everyday reality often confronts us with dramatic events that can even repeat themselves in their own dynamics".
Napolitano does not hide the fact that "there is in any case also a resource problem: it must be invested decisively in education and information."
The numerous initiatives for a more direct awareness in school settings on the part of young people who feed the world of work are of particular importance.
It is our duty to pay attention to this phenomenon and not to divert attention from its social seriousness.
For his part, the President of the Chamber Gianfranco Fini stressed "how the phenomenon of work-related deaths constitutes an urgent social emergency that offends the conscience of all of us and forces all institutions to work towards decisive rules aimed at putting an end to the problem".
"The data on accidents at work seem to indicate a slight improvement, but this does not rule out the possibility that the number of work-related deaths is much too high," said Anmil President Pietro Mercandelli.
"We don't want this "positive tendency" to mean less attention, which is what ultimately causes the tragedy."
"We believe that there is basically not enough action to counteract the phenomenon of accidents. You can fight against it through various actions.
In our opinion, stronger controls and inspections are necessary – according to Mercandelli; but also stronger measures to educate the workers who are already starting out in school.”
"A further effort is needed - he adds - in terms of communication and raising public opinion.
But above all, a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers towards a phenomenon that constitutes a social emergency is in demand".
Mercandelli went on to talk about “the progressive deterioration of protection for the victims of accidents at work” and denounced the “abolition of the welfare system that we have been fighting against in recent years”.
The aim is, therefore, to return to the worker a guarantee of insurance, so that the fate of the victim of an accident at work does not depend on voluntary or accidental donations decided from time to time by a legislator.
Mp3 player under indictment: risk of hearing damage
Listening to loud music over a longer period of time with portable music devices, such as MP3 players, can lead to permanent hearing damage.
This is reported by the European Commission, which in a report published today in Brussels quotes the opinion of the Csrseri (Scientific Committee on Current and Recently Identified Health Risks) of the EU.
According to the report, 5-10% of those who listen to loud music for at least five years a week for more than an hour a day on portable music devices risk permanent hearing loss.
"I am concerned that such a large number of young people, who usually place portable music devices and mobile phones at a high volume, will irretrievably damage their hearing without knowing it," Kuneva said.
"From the scientific findings - as the EU says - there is a clear risk that urges quick action.
What really matters is raising consumer awareness and making this information public.
In the light of this scientific knowledge, we need to re-examine the existing control systems so that they are fully effective and keep up with the new technology."
Brussels had commissioned the independent scientific committee in view of the widespread use of portable music devices among young people.
"Scientists - the EU Communication concludes - confirm that they are rightly concerned and that the EU Commission, together with the other EU members and those concerned, will now examine the necessary measures to better protect children and young people from the noise coming from portable music devices and similar devices ".
There is already a European standard that limits the level of noise from portable music equipment to 100 dB. Concern about the damage that could come from excessive noise pollution.
This damage can be very limited by resorting to solutions such as reducing the volume and the length of the noise exposure.
In its report, the EU Scientific Committee points out that if users of portable music devices only listen to loud music for five hours a week (less than 89 decibels) so that the legal limits that apply to the maximum noise level at the workplace are already exceeded.
Those who cross the border with music risk losing their hearing completely within five years.
This would therefore affect 5-10% of the users of such devices, the number of which can be estimated at between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Roma, Alemanno launch "Commission for the future of the capital"
We start today, in March it should be over, in June the balance will be taken.
This is the procedure laid down by the Capitol for the work of the "Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome" The Commission met this morning in the new headquarters behind the Caracalla Baths.
In six months, President Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will work out the guidelines for Rome.
Once the project is completed, the City and Municipal Councils will evaluate the analyses and projects to be able to present the strategic plan for Rome in June with the "official stamp" of the Capitol and the Lord Mayor Gianni Alemanno.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and has all the political, social and cultural opinions," emphasises Alemanno. "It will present proposals for a development plan for Rome, the political leaders of which will remain the city council and the municipal council.
There is no redistribution of responsibilities, only the will to have a place where one can develop a great project for Rome.
In March, their task will be finished and the Commission will dissolve again, as such a project must have a timed endpoint.
In June - the Lord Mayor announces - we will present the strategic plan in which we will use the work done by the Commission".
Anyone who questions the Commission's competence, since it lacks an opinion on its liability, says Alemanno: "It all depends on the work that the Commission will do and on the quality of its proposals.
If, like the Attali Commission in France, it delivers high-quality results – and this will certainly be the case in Rome – then its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often, politics deals with the day-to-day problems and emergencies that occur from time to time.
We, on the other hand, want to keep an eye on a longer period of time in order to work seriously on the development of Rome and the future of the city in a deeper perspective".
"This commission is neither a useless institution nor a wreck: it is absolutely free, it will not cost the Roman citizens a penny and it will make us think, it will employ the best minds of the capital".
According to Alemanno, "it is necessary to have a strategic plan that is neither hermetic nor static, in order to give our city a leap in quality - which it really needs - and thus take a common step into the future".
A future, says the mayor of Rome, which "will not only limit itself in the current municipal boundaries, but will look much further", not only in terms of Rome's role as the metropolis and political capital of Italy, but also as the future capital of Europe and the Mediterranean.
Obama – the first anti-American president? Here a statement
A well-known American politician, who cares a lot about being seen as independent, has written: “Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who through his decisions decimated the U.S. economy and maintained (and still does as a private individual) relations with the hostile Islam.
The attacks against Obama are becoming more and more violent, especially now that the elections are approaching.
A lady from Miami wrote on an internet site: “This person is full of ambitions.
Obama is very cheeky: he thinks he will get the highest office of a nation that has seen a total of two black governors and five black senators!".
Actually, however, these attacks don’t have much to say; they are racist attacks and they don’t answer the question of voters: will he be a good president? And then there are the polls; everyone says that Obama will win by a big margin.
Also in this case, there are people who talk to the heart and not the head.
A newspaper from Mississippi, in the deepest south of the United States, has written in its editorial: only in the voting booth will we know who the real American patriot will vote for.
Here comes a mentality of the USA, which was kept hidden until the last.
“Say what you want, and we’ll decide who we’re going to do our crawling for, whether it’s Obama or McCain.”
There are people out there who swear that if Obama wins, we will emigrate from America.
Something you’ve never heard before – only now that the success of the black candidate seems so certain.
In any case, despite all these considerations, the final weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
1500 people were asked: What mistakes did Bush make during his term in office? 89% answered: the war in Iraq.
America is changing.
The nation lost 50,000 soldiers in Vietnam and was sent back home with a kick in the ass.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers lost their lives and the Americans were not forced to pack.
Nevertheless, Iraq remains for the majority the weak point of Bush.
The one who will take his place is faced with a huge task.
USA. The financial collapse also leaves its mark on journalists: you can already feel the cuts in the newspapers. And many blame the Internet, the "murderer" of the printing press.
Five hundred American journalists were interviewed by the PEW Research Center about their situation and their mental control over the future.
Today, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
Nevertheless, they did not declare to those in charge of the information really concerned about the general credibility.
You don't feel as alone as you used to.
The problem for American journalists is money.
For these journalists, the crisis of 2008 is a crisis of an economic model that has been destroyed.
Added to this are the big problems caused by the cuts that hit the newsroom, i.e. the room in which the editors work to compile the newspaper.
It is a problem that must be solved – according to the interviewed journalists – if you want to prevent traditional journalism, as the large public understands it, from shrinking substantially.
A clear but complicated pessimism now fills the American journalist.
Six out of ten journalists and executive seniors in the printing press believe that journalism at the national level is on the wrong track.
In the local area, it is even up to 65% for the executives.
Printed vs. Broadcast.
It is not difficult for journalists to imagine in which direction the web is going.
The most important publishing groups are making their way to the Internet, which is regarded by many as the "killer" of the printing press.
The "economic pressure" felt by journalists has increased by up to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed have admitted to wanting to join the new technology, hoping “they bring something good to journalism.”
The biggest rift in American journalism today is between the editors-in-chief of the newsroom and the reporters who work for them.
56% of editors-in-chief at the national level are sure that their reporters share their values with them, while at the local level only 23% are.
Some think it has to do with “safety at work.”
Managers who are afraid of losing their jobs within three years are 47% at national level.
For journalists, it is 30%.
The topic of "safe work" in the team (our "editors" note) is always a current topic in the USA.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In a huge nation like the U.S., with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio and TV stations and internet operators, employers are offering what they like and so it becomes a question of take it or leave it.
The editor-in-chief often gets very high wages, while the editor can sometimes only get 10,000 euros per month, plus pension and insurance money.
As for holidays, things get complicated: a certain amount of days in the first year, so and so many after the third, finally reaching 15 days of holidays after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, as they themselves admit, often become “sick” over the course of the year.
It is a question of climate.
UNIPOL: COURT IN ROME: DANILO COPPOLA STAYS IN GROTTAFERRATA
Carmelo Rinaudo, President of the Second Criminal Chamber of the Court of Rome, has decided to reject the real estate agent’s request to be transferred from Grottaferrata to Rome.
It is being investigated against Coppola for bankruptcy in the context of the investigation into the counter-agreement in the case of the acquisition of Unipol-Bnl.
In the course of the trial against him during the last week, his release from house arrest was converted into a residency obligation in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella had asked to allow the real estate agent to be moved from the provincial city to an apartment in the capital.
According to the court, such transfers (which the public prosecutor’s office had spoken out against) could give him the opportunity to influence his society and to obtain evidence accusing him.
The elite is in danger.
The phenomenon had already revealed itself a few days ago, when the House of Representatives voted against the $700 billion savings package of the White House: A large part of Americans were and are more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
This is confirmed by yesterday’s edition of the New York Times, which reports how the crisis is gradually dividing the Republican Party, which is increasingly splitting into its old and moderate East Coast soul, which has always favoured state institutions and the business community, and those neoconservatives who are hostile to “those in Washington” and the financial world and win voters, especially in the south and the center of the states.
This part of the party owes its rise above all to the voice of the one I mentioned above.
This just mentioned example, however, is only a small part of the major changes that the current economic earthquake announces or even already represents: not only in the US, but also in the entire West and perhaps even beyond it will be affected by them.
Both in the States and in Europe, the crisis seems to accelerate the long-awaited events which are finally taking shape and coming to light under these new conditions.
The first of these phenomena is the rediscovery, the unprecedented renaissance of the state in connection with a kind of renationalization of the economy.
Indeed, the crisis means a decline in the banking and financial institutions, which have close ties to foreign countries and at the same time manage an enormous amount of the assets of private households residing in a single state.
This means a direct political problem for the governments: how to deal with the families concerned, which are also an enormous mass of voters.
The crisis therefore appears to be economically global, but politically it is almost purely national.
Political internationalism seems to have fallen into disrepute and lost its right to speak: the obvious proof of this has been given by the EU, which, due to its dichotomy in various national and international conflicts, is unable to find a common path.
Therefore, everyone now expects the intervention of their own state; rescue plans, new rules, and, above all, distribution of aid funds: Since the crisis became more and more serious, only the US is in the economic situation to save itself without foreign help.
And in addition to the means, they also have the legitimacy to use them: thus, two preconditions that cannot be overstated – under certain circumstances – which no international organization or market will otherwise be able to fall back on in a similar way.
Moreover, the new emphasis placed on the state-national element is in perfect harmony with the ever-increasing importance recently associated in the economy with a most closely related sector: territoriality.
Paradoxically, precisely when we were so convinced that we had long since entered a networked empire, a realm of ever-differentiated technologies, of the immaterial, that we suddenly have to determine how our future will depend more and more on the essential material things: water, harvest and oil.
These can certainly all be transported from one place to another in the world, but they are still connected to the utmost with a narrowly defined piece of earth – a territory.
Therefore, he who has such a territory has an advantage over another who lives in a cropless, waterless or oil-free area.
I now come to the second novelty, which, however, requires a short insertion.
Whoever says territory, whoever says government, whoever says politics, also says leadership.
In this sense, the financial crisis seems to produce two converging phenomena.
On the one hand, there is the knowledge of the need for respected leadership, that is, the need for someone who knows how to manage things.
On the other hand, there is now a wave of indignation over the existing leaderships, especially those of the economy, which have turned out to be inadequate and full of shadow zones.
Finally, there is a deeper and, in a sense, even more disturbing aspect: a loss of trust, an intolerance, a picture of inadvisability, a sense of distance, all of which is aimed at a whole class of managers in Western countries.
It seems to be the conviction among large sections of the population that it is not first the actions of the social elite, but already their world of ideas, their way of life, their culture in the broadest sense of the word, whose content presents itself to the majority as increasingly foreign and traditional.
The demand for leadership thus feeds underground a branched but powerful movement of disempowerment of the leading class and the conventional political establishment. This manifests itself in unforeseen "revolts" of the voters and in the sudden reversal of the collective state of mind of the right of the last time: starting with the rise of the conservatives in Austria and Bavaria, over the collapse of the Labour Party in Great Britain.
One gets the impression that the old elite, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, magazines, intellectual creditors, some would say their format, have more and more problems of understanding and therefore less representative value with regard to what is going on today in the lower social strata of the West and is being amplified by the financial crisis and driven to overdimensionality.
In view of all this, it would be simply exaggerated to speak of a "rebellion of the masses".
But keeping your eyes wide open is certainly not.
The super glue that lets go up on walls
Defeat the forces of gravity thanks to an adhesive and be able to climb walls like Superman.
This is the subject of four American research centers, one of which seems to have almost reached its destination.
With an adhesive applied to an area of only 2.5 square meters, the researchers succeeded in fixing a 100 kg body on a vertical wall.
The STUDIO – an American journal has published the results of researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the research team is a further development of the already used adhesives, which use a special carbon structure, called carbon nanotubes.
“The principle of glue can be thought of as a series of tubes arranged into a stack of spaghetti,” explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The scientists have been inspired by the feet of the geckos, which are covered by microscopic hairs that give the animal a perfect hold.
Tests using different materials, such as glass Teflon and sandpaper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times stronger than the reptile’s feet and at the same time “has no problem removing it from the wall,” said Liming Dai, a researcher at the University of Dayton’s Faculty of Engineering.
“This material could be used as a temporary adhesive,” Liming Dai adds.
Maybe, but the researchers are thinking of a less fascinating benefit, such as the connection of electrical devices, because the nanotubes are also conductors of heat and electricity.
Other areas of application could fall into the field of space travel.
So for now, the superheroes still have to wait.
THE OTHER TYPE OF RESEARCH – including the University of Berkeley, California, is dedicated to a new type of glue.
In an article by the American Chemical Society, the Californian scientists present an adhesive made of microfibers that clean themselves from dust like hair by moving on a surface itself, thus always maintaining perfect adhesion.
Medicines: never take with fruit juice
Beware of grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, which are consumed mainly in the summer due to their refreshing quality and richness of vitamins, can cause serious damage to health if taken at the same time with certain vital drugs, as they can have an extreme effect on the absorption of these by the body.
David Bailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, repeatedly points out the risk of packaged and fresh fruit juices in combination with medication. At the 236th meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he again raised the alarm: a glass of apple, orange or grapefruit juice is all it takes to reduce the absorption capacity of certain vital drugs to virtually eliminate them and thus endanger the health of patients.
Grapefruit juice was already suspected to be responsible for increasing the effects of some drugs such as antibiotics, anti-asthmatics, cardiovascular drugs, anxiolytic and neurological agents, up to toxic levels.
Medications in Danger – The same agency of the drug had warned doctors and patients in a report two years ago about the dangers of this mix, stressing to pay attention to what is drunk in conjunction with drugs such as diazepam or metadon.
IT’S NOT ONLY GRAPEFRUIT – According to experts, orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that can inhibit the drugs.
The list of active ingredients inhibited by fruit juices is long.
Therefore, the appeal of Michele Carruba, Director of the Universit<0xC3><0xA0> Statale di Milano: "Such results are usually immediately forwarded to the various international manufacturers, who are thus free to change the consumer information.
Therefore, it is advisable to always read the package leaflet and, if there are still ambiguities, not to be afraid to ask a pharmacist or doctor," emphasizes the expert of the Ansa agency.
Nobel Prize goes to Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences is awarded to Paul Krugman for his analysis of trade patterns and the settlement of economic activities.
The 55-year-old Krugman is a Neo-Keynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is known for his regular articles for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration’s economic and foreign policy.
A few months after the attacks of September 11, 2001, during the days of the Enron collapse, Krugman had claimed in a New York Times editorial that this second event was more crucial to U.S. history than the attacks.
A prediction that received quite a bit of polemics in response and was still held up to the economist years later, but today proves to be completely correct.
“I’m surprised and shocked at how quickly the memory of the scandals surrounding the collapses of Enron or Worldcom has disappeared from public view,” Krugman said.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is an “economist of great value,” but also a banalizer with a “very aggressive style, particularly against the excessive liberalism of the Bush administration.”
Open Office, the third version of the "Anti-Microsoft" package appears
The day of the release of OpenOffice.org 3.0 has arrived; the open source software, as a free replacement for Microsoft’s Office, is gaining an increasing number of users, both at home and in the office, among freelancers as well as in public administration.
After a year of intensive work by the voluntary developers, which is monitored by SUN Microsystems, the new Open Office presents itself with some novelties to the public: in addition to a revised and now more Spartan designed initial menu, now finally a fundamentally guaranteed compatibility with Apple's operating system Mac OS x, as well as the support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 format, i.e. the latest standard ISO version, is given.
Eight against was also the compatibility with Microsoft's Office 2007, whose new formats (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx) can be read by OpenOffice.
Also interesting are some new features, such as the one that makes it possible to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, which, for example, makes it easier to send via email, including the ability to import PDF files into graphic editing modules and at the same time preserve the original appearance of the page.
In this way, "hybrid" PDF files can now also be generated, which extend the typical graphic of the Adobe format by the elements of a table and a word processing system.
Collaboration is one of the most improved elements of the applications: tables can now be edited by multiple hands by different users, avoiding conflicts in case of changes; in the case of the word processing system, each editor is assigned a question to guarantee a better correction procedure.
Some companies are in the process of publishing various features of OpenOffice on the Internet (on the cloud), while the final result is to be made public in the coming weeks.
The Italian version is available for download at the following link: http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html. Thus, it follows the English version, which has been on the mirrors since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, the program is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request, the installation CD can be sent to your home or office.
However, if cost-free access can be an incentive for the distribution of the program in private households, it is also in the area of business, where OpenOffice could be the big hit: after all, various institutions of public administration and schools have already switched to OpenOffice.
In fact, there is not even a lack of a training offer, which means optimal help for small and medium-sized companies, and thus even opens up business prospects.
OpenOffice is made up of five main components: Writer, the word-appropriate text creation program; Calc, the spreadsheet program that aims to displace Excel; Impress, for creating presentations as with PowerPoint; Dbase for operating databases in place of the more familiar Access; and lastly Draw, a graphics module.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads – a goal that can easily be exceeded with 3 million and 600 thousand already achieved.
Also cabbage tested positive and thus the fourth doping case
A new doping case opens up in the framework of the last Tour de France: it concerns the Austrian sportsman Bernhard Kohl of the team Gerolsteiner, who is third-classified and winner of the jersey of the best climber.
The news was published by the newspaper L'Equipe on its website.
The 26-year-old Kohl from Team Gerolsteiner is the fourth driver to test positive for Cera, the third generation EPO, which has already been the case with the Italians Riccardo Ricc<0xC3><0xB2> and Leonardo Piepoli as well as the German Stefan Schumacher.
The analyses from Kohl’s blood samples are among those carried out in recent weeks by the Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry laboratories.
If the counter-tests now confirm the positive results on Cera, the Austrian will lose his third place and be excluded from the races for two years.
Pierre Bordry, the head of France’s anti-doping commission, confirmed the positive épotest and also notified the Austrian authorities, according to the Associated Press.
The 26-year-old Austrian climbed onto the podium behind the Spaniard Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans and also claimed the jersey of the best climber for himself.
THEME IMMIGRATION: THE NEW YORK TIMES QUESTION: IS ITALY RACEFUL?
Italy, "the former country of emigrants has recently become one of the preferred countries for immigrants" which are only reluctantly accepted.
Make this a nation of racists from the Belpaese? This is what the New York Times asks in a long article devoted entirely to the topic of racism in Italy, starting from the case of the young, Burkina Faso-born Abdul William Guibre, who was murdered a month ago in Milan after stealing a pack of cookies.
The case testifies to what the Times calls the “paradox of the North”: the northern regions are those where “most integration and work opportunities” exist, and yet “the highest degree of anti-immigrant sentiment and the greatest support of the Northern League can be found.”
As a confirmation of the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the Times cites further episodes of intolerance from Milan, Rome, Parma, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
And not just this.
The new legislation introduced by the League against immigration and the faster expulsion of illegal immigrants is also cited as a sign of climate change in Italy.
“Giorgio Napolitano, at a meeting at the Quirinal, asked the Pope to work together between the Church and the State to combat racism.”
Female students victims of high rents of up to 900 euros per room
The student housing market has no crisis.
According to the latest investigation by Sunia, the tenant union, a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome.
"This phenomenon has already taken on a very serious character, and so many students lose their right to study because their families are unable to support them at this level," said Laura Mariani, the head of the Sunia, "in these cities, the high demand from the students leads to a deformation of the market, which has also harmed the other inhabitants.
In addition, most rental offers include a number of violations: free contracts, missing registrations, no rent limit, unauthorized sublets.
For Sunia there is a need for extraordinary measures, which lead to lower rental prices through a revision of taxation.
On closer examination of the investigation, it turns out that in Milan a sleeping place in the Brianza district is needed about 450 euros; a single room starts at 650 euros (in the Nere district) and ends with 800 euros in the Lambiate, Udine and Fiera district or even 900 euros in the Vittoria district.
In Florence, a place to sleep costs on average 350/400 euros, a room 700.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in the neighborhoods around the university, 250/280 euros are needed for a sleeping place of 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome, the prices in the neighborhoods around the university are about 600 euros for a single room, 450 for a place to sleep in a double room.
The rents in the neighbourhoods around the other universities of Rome are only slightly lower: 550 euros in Ostiense and Cinecitt<0xC3><0xA0>.
Only those who dodge on the outskirts can save money: 300 euros for a place to sleep and 450 euros for a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar quarters.
In Naples you need 300-450 euros for a place to sleep, for a room the price is between 400 and 600 euros in the most expensive neighborhoods, the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminai.
In Bari a bed costs 250-350 euros, a single room at least 350.
In the smallest cities, prices are lower, but they have a greater weight in the urban economy.
In cities where the phenomenon of renting to non-European students is more common, such as Perugia, there is even another anomaly: a rent that is 25-30% higher than the average is demanded by foreign students.
Farewell to the old Paradiso cinema – the cities close their historic cinemas
The historical cinemas close due to the favoured multiplex cinemas.
“A city without cinemas is a blind city, like a face without eyes.”
This picture by the director Giuseppe Tornatore describes with effect what is currently happening in the major urban centers of Italy, and also in the provinces.
The process of exclusion of cinemas, which began with the birth of the large multi-room complexes in the periphery, means, in the long run, death for the one-room cinema in the center. A process that not only seems inevitable and irrevocable, but also carries the features of a cultural crime.
It’s like losing a friend with whom you’ve walked a street full of emotions,” says the director of the film “Nuovo Cinema Paradiso”, which won him the Oscar and the Cannes Grand Prix 20 years ago. It’s the story of a suburban cinema and its nostalgia, which consists of living in a world of cinema that is lost forever.
The figures provided by the Anec, the central trade association, speak for themselves: in the last five years, the enormous number of 316 traditional cinemas have had to close; this mine paid for the most part the cinemas in the major cities: 10 in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
The regions most affected include Emilia-Romagna with 82 lost cinemas, followed by Tuscany with 44 and Lombardy with 41.
This shows that the main culprits are the multiplex cinemas, because it is precisely these three regions in which the largest number of these modern cinemas has been registered: with 195 in the last 5 years, Lombardy leads the lists, 81 are in both Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
"The business has developed in an irrational way," said Paolo Protti, President of Anec, "it is useful that new structures also emerge, but first and foremost is the preservation of what already exists, because if a hall in the city closes, not all its regular customers are willing to go to a multiplex cinema in the periphery instead of the old one.
And here still remains the missing budget for the fund of the trade association outside attention: the debt burden recorded by the state is about 10 million euros.
It is a shame from an ethical and moral standpoint that the government does not comply with the existing laws.
In order to preserve the sector, between 16 and 18 million euros per year would be needed."
Interesting is the case of Bologna, the first Italian city to decide to protect the old cinemas by an agreement between the municipality and Anec; it is the first agreement of its kind in Italy aimed at protecting and supporting the traditional cinemas, both in the historical center and in the periphery.
Among the measures foreseen are tax advantages for cinema operators as well as benefits for the public in terms of local transport: it will be allowed to drive to the traffic-limited areas of the center and also to park at cheaper parking fees.
"It is a gratifying initiative," said Giuseppe Tornatore, "I hope that other cities will follow our example and also develop new concepts.
Of course, we also need better audio and video equipment in order to be able to do something against the superpower of multiplex rooms, because after all, the audience of today is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema has always been an important issue for me: the closure of the "Supercinema" of Baghiera, the place of my childhood and youth, was the decisive point that led me to found the "Nuovo cinema Paradiso", even though I had been playing with the idea for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years; when I pass the Rialto or the Quirinale in Via Nazionale, where I have experienced so many different emotions, I turn aside to avoid having to see the dusty posters.
The links between politics and 'Ndrangheta lead to the arrest of the mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was ready to adapt the decisions of the municipality to the interests of the mafia group Piromalli.
The accusations of the Calabrian anti-mafia law firm against Mayor Giorgio Dal Torrione and his deputy Rosario Schiavone of the Municipality of Gioia Tauro, who were arrested this morning for involvement in mafia business, are serious.
Gioacchino Piromalli, the elder intermediary between the clan and the public administration, as well as his nephew, was also handcuffed: the lawyer, who bears the same name as the boss of the clan, had already been sentenced for involvement in criminal associations of the mafia, at that time to a compensation sum of 10 million euros.
"Despite any kind of moral and legal norm," the lawyers write, "the two local administrations had decided to pay the lawyer Piromalli funds for consulting activities."
"In this way, the mafia group was made possible - according to the judges - to enter the town halls on the official way and to co-determine the policy of the public administration."
The president of the Calabrian Regional Committee Agazio Loiero does not deny that in his region "it is anything but an exception to encounter links between local administrations and organized crime." "There are places where the concentration of the mafia is greater than in others where such links are virtually inevitable.
But there are also local politicians who resist the pressure of the 'Ndrangheta: heroes who keep a white vest."
This morning's arrests follow those of last July, with which, according to the police, the clan Piromalli was beheaded.
Since the end of last April, Gioia Tauro’s municipal council had been dissolved, but in 1991 – and also at that time due to alleged links between organized crime and local administration – local politicians had been removed from their municipal offices.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, then mayor of the Udc, was elected head of the centre-right coalition after the May 2006 general election.
He screamed scandal when the prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
He referred it to Deputy Minister Marco Minniti, whom he accused of inventing everything for political and strategic reasons, but the judges, in connection with the arrest warrant issued this morning, said that the Piromalli clan had even dared to request a change to the A3 project.
An eavesdropping operation in connection with the investigations into the Dal Torrione case has shown a willingness to meet the wishes of an entrepreneur who is known to be a representative of the large group around the Piromalli – thus making the measures of public administration identical to the interests of this clan.”
When the energy comes from the waves, suddenly the big ones come on.
It’s a never-ending source of money covering over 70% of the planet’s surface, and only now do the world’s major energy companies seem to understand this.
Waves, currents and tides are the new renewable energy sources that everyone is now looking at and also looking to occupy, such as giants like Chevron.
The possibility of extracting energy from the motions of the sea has been under consideration and studied for 70 years; it is not by chance that these studies have intensified considerably since the first oil crisis.
When the price of oil plummeted around 1980, the idea of ocean energy was gassed, but now environmental organizations and the increased price of oil are pushing for new impetus in this sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimates that 15% of the world’s energy needs could be met by the energies generated by ocean waves.
This would be twice the amount of energy currently produced by nuclear power plants.
In addition, there are the currents and tides.
Giants in the attack.
The first company to focus on marine energy is Enersis, which signed a contract to build a power plant in northern Portugal in 2005.
When this news was published, it seemed to be a revolutionary step.
Two years later, more and more companies from the traditional energy industry are focusing on marine energy production.
“Chevron is exploring these technologies,” said the spokesman for a company known to the giant in the Wall Street Journal, “and is considering the possibility of working with us.”
It is about obtaining an authorization from the American Energy Commission, which is necessary to start a project off the coast of Alaska.
This is a not to be underestimated sign, especially considering that oil continues to be produced by the United States in Alaska and President Bush has only recently initiated plans for new drilling.
In addition to Chevron, the companies Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey are also investing in the new industry; if the details are not known, observers speak of increasing interest.
Technologies that need to be improved.
Experts speak of a technology that is still on the rise, not least because the last doubts on the part of environmentalists have not yet been clarified.
So far, projects such as those in Portugal and Scotland are of a rather small dimension and do not seem to cause any serious ecological problems.
However, large-scale energy production requires technologies that have a far greater impact on the environment.
Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of interconnected buoys.
The thrust of the waves, which moves the buoys up and down, is converted into hydraulic pressure within the floats via pistons and cylinders.
This drives a turbine, which in turn operates a generator.
The electricity is then sent to the coast via underwater pipelines.
So far, there are four planned plants of this type, which are only waiting for state approval. Part of the energy gained could also be used for military facilities.
Verdant Power is already producing energy for a department store and a parking lot using submarine turbines in the East River of New York.
The water movements during the tides drive the turbines, which feed the generator as a result of the resulting rotational movement.
According to Verdant, a long line of potential clients is already waiting for the necessary authorizations to use these energy sources.
First the waves, then the tides.
According to the Institute for Electricity Production Research, a particular interest is immediately deserving of the potential that lies in the tides.
Although it is also an irregular phenomenon, the tides are more predictable than wind currents, solar radiation and also the waves, and therefore a more reliable source of electricity.
It is precisely tidal energy that has led states such as New York, Maine and Alaska, as well as other coastal states, to invest $7.5 million in 2008 – up to 35 million are already planned for 2009.
