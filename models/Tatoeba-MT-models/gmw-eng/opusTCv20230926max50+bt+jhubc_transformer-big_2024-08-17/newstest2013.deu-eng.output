A Republican Strategy to Oppose Obama's Re-election
The leaders of the Republicans justify their policies with the need to fight electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Center considers the latter a myth by affirming that election fraud is rarer in the U.S. than the number of people killed by lightning.
In fact, Republicans’ attorneys have recorded only 300 electoral fraud cases in 10 years in the United States.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures partially undermine the democratic system of the United States.
In contrast to Canada, the US states are responsible for conducting the elections in the individual states.
In this sense, the majority of American governments have been promulgating new laws since 2009 that complicate the process for registration or balloting.
This phenomenon gained importance after the November 2010 elections, in which 675 new Republican representatives were registered in 26 states.
As a result, 180 bills were introduced in 2011 alone, restricting the exercise of suffrage in 41 states.
The new electoral laws require voters to present a photo ID and proof of U.S. citizenship.
In addition, these laws also shorten the time periods for early voting, invalidate the right to register as a voter on election day, and deny citizens the right to vote for which a court file is available.
Prior to the 2006 elections, no U.S. state required voters to show a photo ID.
Indiana was the first state to make such a claim.
The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of Indiana law in 2008.
The Republican authorities hastened to extend this practice to other states.
Over the past two years, they have promoted bills in 34 states that force voters to show a photo ID.
It is important to note that unlike Quebec, U.S. citizens do not have a universal identity card such as the health insurance card.
Indeed, 11% of U.S. citizens, i.e. 21 million eligible voters, do not hold a photo ID issued by any government agency in their state.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such an ID card.
However, there are often more than a hundred dollars to pay to get the required ID.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and low-income people.
In fact, 25% of African-Americans, 15% of those with an income of less than $35,000, 18% of citizens over the age of 65, and 20% of voters between the ages of 18 and 29 do not have the required photo ID.
This goes even further.
Students who are considered to be voters, who are increasingly voting for democratic candidates, are not allowed to use their photo ID issued by their institution in several states.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of fishing or hunting clubs who are more likely to vote for the republican side to use the cards issued by these clubs for elections.
Prior to 2004, no state required proof of citizenship for voting.
Arizona was the first state to introduce such a requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove their U.S. citizenship.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting Hispanic voices.
Because it is obvious that two out of three Hispanic voters prefer the democratic party.
In addition, in 2011, Republican lawmakers in eight states promoted legislation that abolished voter registration on Election Day.
In addition, you have limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to those voters who wish to register.
These limitations are not without consequences.
For example, the voter registration campaigns in the 2004 general election helped to register around 10 million citizens.
As a result of the measures adopted since 2009, the proportion of new voters registered in 2010 has decreased by 17% compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican lawmakers in five other states have passed laws aimed at shortening the time frame for early voting.
For example, in the 2008 general election in Florida, 33% of voters who voted in advance were African-American, even though they make up only 13% of the state’s voters.
The same goes for the Hispanic population.
The latter accounted for only 11% of voters, but 24% of citizens who voted in advance.
By contrast, whites, who represented 76% of voters, made up only 46% of voters who voted in advance.
Of course, Democratic lawmakers and their supporters have vigorously opposed the passage of laws that restrict voter registration.
Several bills have been blocked by the vetoes of Democratic governors.
The U.S. Attorney General has intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They were able to partially limit the damage.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states have passed laws requiring the display of a photo ID.
However, the new rules introduced in 2012 will undoubtedly make it more difficult to exercise the right to vote.
The democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the adopted laws and see in them the clear goal of influencing the results in the states decisive for 2012.
A 2011 Brennan Center report shows that those states that passed these laws make up 171 of the 270 votes required in the Electoral College to win the presidency.
It is too early to confirm with certainty that these legislative changes to the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential election.
But one thing is for sure: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures partially undermine the democratic system of the United States.
Early detection of prostate cancer: should the test be done or not?
In fact, the PSA test sometimes shows faulty results, with false negative or also false positive results, which lead to unnecessary medical interventions.
This leads to greater hesitation of the already indecisive men for conducting early detection tests.
Should the test be done or not?
We got the opinion of two specialists.
In the studies conducted in the USA, there were numerous confounding factors between the control groups, so it is difficult to interpret these data and make clear recommendations.
Another study, this time from Europe, concluded that there is a difference in the mortality of patients with and without early detection.
This study also showed that when followed after 12 years, the likelihood of metastasis formation is 30 to 40% higher if no early detection was performed.
Therefore, I recommend the test from the age of 50 years or 40 years if you have a direct relative who was already suffering from prostate cancer.
Men of African-American descent are also at higher risk.
The most important thing is to make the right decision once a cancer has been detected.
There are cancers that are aggressive and others that are indolent.
The patient needs to be made really aware of the extent of the risk of his cancer by pointing out the possible options in which prostate cancer can remain untreated if he does not impair the quality of life in the long term, and in these cases it is more likely to opt for active monitoring of the disease.
Today, many men who have been diagnosed with cancer do not receive treatment because their cancer is not aggressive and poses no threat to their lives.
They are suggested active monitoring and offered treatment as the disease progresses.
The criteria for deciding who should and should not be treated are being determined with increasing accuracy.
Therefore, I still recommend carrying out the test.
However, the most important thing is to talk to your doctor to determine whether or not it should be performed.
In collaboration with the International Society of Urology, Movember has developed a tool to assess the pros and cons of the PSA test.

Prevention of the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle cure to prevent cancer.
Despite advances in research, adopting a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of contracting it.
It is estimated that 30% of cancers could be prevented if everyone ate well and exercised enough.
“If there were no more smokers, this figure would rise to at least 50%,” said André Beaulieu, spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
However, it is assumed that about 10% of cancers are caused by heredity.
Several remain completely unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against tobacco addiction remains a priority, despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Smoking is responsible for 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for several other cancers.
It seriously harms people’s health.
"There are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec today," said André Beaulieu.
Encouraging data: 10 years after giving up the cigarette, the risk of dying from cancer is reduced by half.
The weight
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, overweight and obesity also promote the onset of the disease.
They appear to increase the risk of breast, colon, rectal, esophageal, pancreatic and uterine cancers.
“Research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against colon cancer,” he adds.
The Nutrition
The organization also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In too much, it increases the risk of developing cancer of the grimm or rectum.
Sausages should also be avoided.
The preservation of meat by smoking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
“The latter can damage the body’s cells and lead to the development of cancer,” he explains.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have investigated the link between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, their investigations are currently inconclusive.
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
While one study found the reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, another showed a more likely increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has also not yet been clearly demonstrated.
In addition, Mr Beaulieu stresses the importance of talking to his doctor about his concerns and his family predicament.
"Performing an early detection test does not lead to cancer."
Analyzing the Higgs Boson
The announcement of the probable discovery of the Higgs boson last summer has caused a certain stir, and for good reason.
Indeed, it is believed that this boson is involved in nothing less than the mechanism responsible for the mass of all objects in the universe.
And finally, it is the last particle whose existence has been predicted by the standard model – our best or “least false” explanation of nature and the behavior of matter – but has not yet been empirically observed.
But for the physicists, it is not yet completely certain that it is really the Higgs.
We know without a shadow of a doubt that we have a real new particle, and that it is very similar to the Higgs boson predicted by the standard model.
Moreover, this seems to be confirmed by new data presented at a major physics convention in Kyoto this week, but data is still lacking to be completely certain about it.
Nevertheless, let’s assume that it’s actually the Higgs, since there seems to be only a small risk of being mistaken, and let’s look at what it’s about.
There is an inevitable law in this world that makes it impossible for two objects to be in the same place at the same time.
It is not possible to violate this rule - and do not try too hard, as you will hurt yourself.
For even if particle physics is a really strange world, it turns out that such a law also applies to it: the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time when they are in the same "quantum state", this "state" being largely composed of some of their properties.
Starting from this, the physicists divide the particles into two categories.
In one corner are the good citizens, who are called Fermione and who obey the Pauli principle.
And in the other, the bosons are moving, an evil band of anarchists, to whom nothing is sacred - in any case, not this principle, which means that they can indeed be in the same place at the same time.
These bosons, according to the website The Particle Adventure of the Berkeley Laboratories (which by the way is absolutely amazing), are divided into two groups: the mesons that we will not treat here and the "power particles" through which the great forces of nature spread and with which the Higgs boson would be somehow related.
But it must be emphasized here that these bosons are not all such exotic creatures as one might think.
If you are able to read this chronicle, it is only thanks to a boson of extraordinary banality: the photon or "particle of light" that is the "messenger" of the electromagnetic force.
This is because when a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, the electromagnetic field is “disturbed” exactly at this location, much like a pebble thrown into a pond.
This "disturbance" creates an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.), and this wave is nothing more than a photon and thus one of the bosons "carriers of force".
More stable field
The same applies to the Higgs boson, with the difference that another field, the Higgs field, must be "disturbed" in order for this boson to show up.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the pathogen must reach very high energies, a little like a frozen pond whose surface could only be furrowed by a very large rock.
That’s why a huge particle accelerator like CERN is required – the Large Hadron Collider is a ring with a circumference of 27 km! – to reach such energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again helpful in explaining the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
In fact, not all particles and not all materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do this, but others do not - for example, a sheet of paper would never hold on to the refrigerator on its own.
Similarly, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that do have mass, while the others (like the photon, by the way) have no mass.
What can all this research be “good for”, Mrs Plamondon asks?
For science, they are used to verify the Standard Model (SM), and they also allow physicists to accurately investigate any discrepancies between observations and predictions of the SM.
By the way, there are numerous physicists who desperately hope that such deviations will be found, since the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physics" and stuff some holes of the model.
It must be said that the latter still has great shortcomings, as it offers no explanation for gravity (ups!) and dark matter, which makes up about 80% of the matter of the universe (again ups!).
However, such deviations have not yet been found at CERN.
Impact
The impact of this research on the general population is more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there were none.
By the way: in the early 60s, the pioneers of the laser in the Bell labs did not suspect that their work would trigger such a revolution.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle — who worked in the Bell Labs where the laser was invented in the 1960s, and who himself developed the first continuous-wave laser (the first were pulsed) in 1962 — has already told us that the laser was initially considered more of a “laboratory toy.”
Just imagine...
In addition, applications can also result from all the instruments that surround the research.
For example, Willard Boyle developed a small light sensor in 1969 during his work in optics.
Although it was not the original purpose, this sensor now serves as the "eye" of all digital cameras worldwide and earned it the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will inevitably change our lives, but it does mean that you really can never know...
Palliative care - the best way to die... <0x7C> Le Devoir
Québec recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life with its committee on “Dying in Dignity”.
The debate needs to resume soon, although a draft law is being prepared.
However, much remains to be done in this important area.
Le Devoir has tried to take a closer look at this.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. was still living alone in his apartment in the Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that consumed him had left him a period of two years.
"They gave me five years to live, I managed seven years," he said half-heartedly, lying in his bed at the home for palliative care Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil, where he had arrived the day before.
“It’s always a shock, you can’t be prepared for that,” he says.
The disease does its job: an immeasurable weakness prevents him from going to the bathroom alone and even eating on his own.
Sitting at the table before a delicious lunch, he resigns and agrees to be helped with the meal.
Courageously, he even manages to smile and talk to the strangers who are busy around him, bring him his medication, and offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
“My biggest wish is that you heal my diarrhea, because it’s humiliating,” he says.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this evil.
“In the course of our lives, we learn that a man pees standing up,” says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at Victor-Gadbois’s home.
Going back to childhood is an unacceptable humiliation for some people.
“That depends on the person’s ability to take a step backwards,” he notes.
Because according to several people who work in palliative care, major events take place in the midst of these regressions.
The patients admitted to the Victor-Gadbois palliative care home all suffer from cancer.
You have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage, the doctors and nurses who take care of them no longer shower them with so-called "healing" care.
For Ms. A., 89, the worst fear is to die "consciously and by suffocation."
But because of the illness, I really got to know my children.
“I have good kids,” she adds.
“I have no more wishes in life,” she says, before accepting that a mask will be put on to help her breathe.
In the next few days, however, she expects a final visit from her son, who comes from Italy.
In the Victor-Gadbois home, a group of volunteers provide personal care and food assistance.
Palliative care is used when there are no other options.
To make dying more pleasant.
In Quebec, there is a bed for palliative care for 11,700 inhabitants.
That is very little, considering that one day we will all die.
Here life is continued under the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the home.
Both at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
If desired, the dying person is given oral care with brandy or pepsi.
Diabetics no longer need to control their blood sugar levels.
Death is part of everyday life.
Last night we served Mr. X a beer that died over the course of the night.
This morning his son will drink the beer at the feet of the deceased.
“We help families and patients alike,” said Nathalie Savard, director of nursing.
In the home of Victor-Gadbois, no day is the same.
In addition to an old man of 93 who enjoys the last family gathering in the courtyard and is well supported by his pillows while toasting in his honor, a young man of 36 who is surrounded by his parents, wife and two young children dies tragically after trying everything to survive.
“For six months, three to five beds have always been occupied by cancer patients under the age of 45,” says Dr. Christiane Martel worried.
53% of the patients admitted to the Victor-Gadbois home come from their place of residence, 47% come from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, i.e., care that is intended to alleviate the suffering of patients when the latter have reached the final stage of their lives, whether at home, hospital or a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the Victor-Gadbois Home and the Greater Montreal Palliative Care Society, specialize more or less exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
It is precisely this great inadequacy in Quebec’s health care that causes several palliative care specialists to be concerned about the passage of a law regulating euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since the month of October, a manifesto has been in circulation, signed by prominent palliative care figures such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, to express their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec’s health care system is not efficient enough to ensure that all are entitled to quality palliative care before accepting euthanasia.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient who was in the emergency room for 14 days in great pain without any measures being taken to relieve her.
I fear that patients only want to die because they do not receive adequate health care.
And at the same time, several oncologists treat their patients, despite the worst prognosis, obstinately until the last day.
Hél<0xC3><0xA8>ne Richard’s chances of survival were already minimal when she stopped arduous chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was going to stop treatment, she replied that she regretted giving up the fight, she said.
She told me I was finished!
No omnipotent care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who have asked to die thank the nursing staff for not allowing this desire after their pain has been alleviated by a palliative care team.
However, it must be clearly stated that palliative care is not omnipotent in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, head of palliative care at the Greater Montreal Palliative Care Society, 8% of patients do not respond to pain treatment.
At the very end of life, doctors often resort to terminal sedation, which results in putting the patient to sleep either sporadically or permanently until the time of his death.
We can no longer pretend that we do not perceive this side of suffering.
Patients without pain relief will increasingly have the opportunity to resort to this terminal sedation.
Patients whose pain is not alleviated all say the same sentence: "I want to die."
But that doesn’t necessarily mean “I want you to put me to sleep,” but “I want my pain to be relieved.”
The implementation of this report was possible due to a journalism scholarship from Canadian health research institutes.
Large-scale property scandals in Quebec
Officials of the road construction office, major construction companies, fundraisers of political parties and specialists of the Italian mafia tell every day what they know about a great "system" in which construction industry, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists and mafioso are entangled.
An "industry" that was very expensive for Quebec taxpayers, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It's strange how the system has disintegrated since drastic measures have been taken," joked Jacques Duchesneau, a Quebec MP and former head of the Montreal police.
The scandal was exposed by him as a result of an in-depth investigation into the misappropriation of road construction contracts in Quebec, which the then prime minister reluctantly agreed to.
The "Duchesneau Report" established a direct link between industry, secret financing of parties and bribery of officials.
“Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010, the Ministry of Transport alone would have saved a billion dollars in the contracts,” he says, “because some curbed their instincts to get their share!
The Charbonneau Commission "has already brought down two mayors," he adds, hoping that it will succeed in "demonstrating the tactics behind the individuals."
A permanent anti-corruption unit launched in 2011
The permanent anti-corruption unit, which was established in 2011, also makes great efforts with its troops to auditors, investigators and analysts of the government.
In addition, the police officers of the Marteau force, which since 2009 has caused the Montreal "canalization cartel" to proceed more cautiously in the artificial inflating of the treaties...
In recent weeks, she has carried out a series of house searches and made accusations of fraud and corruption against municipal officials such as Frank Tampino and Richard Marcotte, who is mayor of a suburb.
Next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his post as mayor of Laval, Quebec’s third-largest city.
He is suspected of having repeatedly received bribes in exchange for public contracts.
Engineers from the Montreal road construction office, as well as entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito, were explicitly indicted.
The latter has caused a stir by explaining to the Commission how the "system" for obtaining public contracts works.
For several years, he himself paid 3% of the value of the contracts received in Montreal to a mafia-related intermediary who transferred the money to the Union Montreal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Throughout the 2000s, Mr. Zambito has had his hand in the game by giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially to the liberals who were in power at the time.
He also confessed to having organized an illegal fundraiser for former Liberal Vice President Nathalie Normandeau.
Sewerage contracts, the cost of which was artificially inflated by him
In Montreal, the “system” of corruption worked smoothly.
The former civil engineer Gilles Surprenant described this in detail before the Commission: in ten years he received gifts, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants and ice hockey games, as well as bribes in the amount of 736,000 dollars in return for sewer contracts, the costs of which he artificially inflated.
Other officials of the road construction office have admitted that they let themselves be lubricated by artificially inflating the bills with false additional benefits by 30-40%.
In addition, an organizer of the mayor’s party, Martin Dumont, has accused Mr Tremblay of deliberately overlooking a shadowy budget that filled his coffers with black money.
As a result of these revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned in early November, which plunged Montreal into a serious crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first Montreal deputies to raise the alarm.
As mayor of the Rivi<0xC3><0xA8>re-des-Prairies district, in the east of the island, she opposed the sale of a community property purchased for $5 million and resold for 1.6 million to property developers in the booming real estate market.
70% black money in election campaigns
Of the investigation, which is ultimately carried out, she says, she pulls “a thread that makes it possible to understand the functioning of the system infiltrated by ants in order to stop the evil and denounce the culprits.”
She says the procedure is “painful, but positive.”
We are in the process of clearing the wound, but we need a Montreal-only investigative unit and oversight to prevent a return to questionable practices.
How to clean.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau, for his part, notes that "officials stole several hundred million dollars" but is mainly concerned about the role of "mandate holders who are aware of the tactics" if they were not involved in the fraud!
Starting from a 70% share of black money in the financing of the election campaigns in Quebec, he jokes: "I was told that this was only a weak offshoot of reality."
The Quebec government is proposing to limit donations to parties to $100, which he said would not change the situation: “Until campaign spending is strictly limited, black money will be in circulation in politics.”
He recommends a complete overhaul of the system for public procurement and financing the parties: "We cannot fall deeper; by getting to the bottom of things with courage, we can rebuild the house on a more solid basis with more controls and laws."
If this story damages the international reputation of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau asks those who laugh about it to take a look in their own backyard...
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season, you have taken PSG to a new level.
How do you explain this progress?
It can be explained by a personal insight, but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Great players have come.
I make progress on their side every day.
The technical staff also gave me a lot.
These elements inspire me every day to improve my playing level.
And with a game, it’s even easier.
In football, everything goes very fast.
But I am not bursting with enthusiasm.
From my beginnings at the centre of the preparatory training of the INF Clairefontaine until my playing time at Saint-Etienne, I have always made gradual progress.
They thus take advantage of the competition introduced by Carlo Ancelotti...
This summer’s newcomers are used to playing games of very high levels.
You also know that every training session is crucial.
This means that a player like me has to stand up and do his best.
By the way, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot in terms of my playing position.
He is supported by coaches like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the right person for the job?
Of course. Of course.
Ancelotti inspires all technicians respect.
There is currently no comparable person in Ligue 1 and he is one of the best coaches in Europe.
He looks back on a rich experience and has won many titles with prestigious clubs.
He was in contact with big players.
I think he will win more titles in Paris.
In January, I had an encouraging conversation with him.
I had just recovered from a series of injuries.
The trust he has placed in me is also an explanation for my achievements.
What do you think about the first part of the PSG season?
In Ligue 1, Lyon took the place of the leader.
But we're lurking in ambush.
One of our most important goals is the Champions League: we qualified for the round of 16 in this way.
What is the goal of the association in this competition?
We will try to get as far as possible.
From now on, anything is possible.
However, we will have our say against very good European teams.
First of all, we want to be the first of our group before Porto, so that we can play the second leg of the round of 16 as a home game.
Can the PSG become a major European club in the short term?
He already has the budget...
To become a major European club, Paris must win titles and make a name for themselves in the long term.
This is not the case today.
Financially, the PSG gives itself the means for this project to take concrete forms.
Would it be a big failure not to win the title in Ligue 1 as it did last season?
Of course, this would be a big disappointment.
This year it is really important for us to mark this title.
Last season we were close.
In May, we were disappointed because we were strong enough to take the win.
We ended the season with a very strong performance.
We finished with 79 points.
Normally you should be a champion with 79 points...
But another team, that of Montpellier, has had an even better season.
I think this year is the right one.
Even though the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are competing for the title, I think we have what it takes to win it.
Do you think the media expects too much from the PSG?
Given what has been invested and the players we have, it’s normal to expect a lot from us.
We accept this completely.
However, if we win 4-0 in a home game against Troyes, and you still find something to blame, it’s certainly a bit frustrating.
You wonder what people expect.
We could never win 4-0 every weekend.
We are not FC Barcelona.
We're trying to come up with a game concept.
A team builds up over time.
In the Champions League, we have shown strength.
Consider Manchester City, a club that has not managed to qualify for the round of 16 for two seasons, and that has also made huge expenses!
With regard to the invested sums, you were believed to be 15 points ahead of the rest of the game!
This would mean that our opponents and the French championship would be disregarded.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not good last season, were "boosted" by this new PSG.
This shows that Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that in the month of May we will be the smiling winner and tell ourselves that we finally won it despite all the difficulties.
The PSG seems to be completely dependent on the achievements of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
All the better that one speaks of a "Zlatan dependency".
This means that Ibrahimovic is powerful and scores many goals.
That’s why he came and he proves that he is the star of Ligue 1.
Everywhere he has played, he has demonstrated that he is a great player and a world star.
Within the team, we respect both the player and the person.
He also respects the people around him.
What he has done is truly extraordinary.
This encourages others to improve their level of play.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also allows everyone else to make progress.
How did you experience the Euro 2012 with the French national team?
Like a disappointment.
It was my heart's desire to participate in this event.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from kicking out some game time.
I have seen things there that strengthened me.
Today I manage to make good games in the national team.
This has been my hope since my baptism with the "Bleus".
From what has happened in Ukraine, we have learned our lesson, and today we must show exemplary behavior.
What do you think about Didier Deschamps’ first few months at the top of the blues?
He has achieved promising results.
We have a good position in the qualifying group for the World Cup.
The national coach is strict, is close to the players and encourages them to win.
Just like Laurent Blanc did.
But I don't want to make a comparison.
Blanc had achieved his goal by qualifying for the European Championship.
I hope that Didier Deschamps will lead the "Bleus" to Brazil.
Is the draw (1:1) forced in Spain on 16 October a kick-off game?
This game has given us confidence.
Everyone has advocated for everyone else.
Before this meeting in Spain, I have never experienced a similar game in my career.
With Bitcoin it is possible to pay and sell without a bank
The opposite of the current monetary exchange based on central banks, identified transactions and processing fees between the participants.
In addition, as so often in these technologies, a political vision is tangible: the belief that the current monetary system, shaped by banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) is both a virtual currency (but convertible to dollars, euros, etc.) and a secure exchange protocol like BitTorrent, which allows the direct exchange of files.
With 15,000 computers on the network, about 200,000 transactions have already been recorded.
A few thousand websites accept Bitcoin as a donation or as a means of payment.
After Bitcoin’s price peaked at $30 in June 2011, it fell to $2 five months later before rebounding to around $10 today (the prices are listed on the bitcoincharts.com website).
Nothing particularly impressive compared to world trade of real currencies or financial products.
Nevertheless, the European Central Bank (ECB) has shown interest in this in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
She describes Bitcoin as “the virtual currency with the greatest success,” “competing with the dollar or euro,” and “similar to conventional currencies.”
Bitcoin is different from other types of virtual currencies like the “credits” used to advance in a video game that you can win or buy (and sometimes trade back) by playing.
The social network Facebook has also developed such a system.
However, each time the trade is controlled and processed by a central authority.
With Bitcoin, all network nodes are simultaneously custodians of the ledger, auditors, money issuers, as well as buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Every transaction between two users actually takes place between two email addresses in the form of an email.
With the difference that the user can choose a different address for each payment, which ensures anonymity.
A number of the data related to this transaction is electronically signed by a double encryption system.
This allows the network to verify the authenticity of the transaction.
With the help of the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the bitcoins traded are present in the public account ledger, which is spread throughout the network.
The crucial step is to enter this new transaction into this book.
This is done via a mathematical task that is started on the computers, with the winner, who is a kind of provisional central banker, having the privilege of adding that extra line.
It is a fragmentation of the file, i.e. the conversion of a large file into a shorter and unique electronic fingerprint.
The computers "take" the new transaction and add a number to it before the whole thing is "hacked."
The goal is to find the number that gives a special fingerprint (many zeros at the beginning).
If this number is found, the other nodes can easily check if it is the right one.
The transaction is thus permanently linked to the chain of all other transactions, and any modification would change the fingerprint.
If a user wants to pay for cheating twice very quickly (less than 10 minutes) with the same money, only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network and the other would remain without a link, as both have different fingerprints.
The computer that solved the problem will receive 50 Bitcoins.
To prevent inflation, this reward is regularly halved, probably before the end of 2012.
The bitcoins in circulation are thus limited to 21 million, but can be divided up to one hundred millionth, which leaves a certain margin...
In addition, the difficulty of the task is increased with each improvement in computing power.
The life of the network has already had ups and downs.
The websites that provide services for Bitcoin were attacked and the Bitcoin deposits were stolen.
“The vulnerability used does not affect the actual protocol,” assures Pierre Noizat, who has just introduced Paymium, which is a company for paying with real money and uses the network Bitcoin.
The ECB also reports on the possibilities of money laundering with the help of this anonymous service.
However, cash also has these shortcomings.
Important actors such as Wikipedia refuse donations of this kind.
They are accepted by others such as the WordPress blog platform.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizmann Institute in Israel analyzed the ledger and showed that almost 80% of bitcoins are not in circulation.
In November, a "Mega Closing Sale" was launched.
“Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged,” says Jon Holmquist, who works for the company Coinabul, which converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of a book on this currency, strongly believes in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
Its Paytunia system is equivalent to a credit card (with real money) or a contactless payment with a mobile phone, but uses Bitcoin to validate the transactions, which are thus cheaper.
In addition, the owner manages his identity and can thus remain anonymous.
The system can be easily implemented at the dealers, and the latter do not need to install new terminals or computer programs.
You just have to provide an address that can be "photographed and recognized" by a phone, Pierre Noizat indicates, who assures that he has thousands of users.
There is a general trend in which hierarchical systems are being rethought in favour of more horizontal systems.
“It will take some time for Bitcoin to catch on, but 2013 could be a tipping point,” he predicts.
Incidentally, the ECB’s report provides for a reassessment of the various risks that are now considered to be high in the event of this currency’s success.
We left Afghanistan.
And after that?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the US are expected to follow by the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain possession of its territory, and for the Afghan people to decide their future without expecting anything from us.
In particular, we punished the Afghan peasants by viewing them as terrorists.
And ourselves with our 88 soldiers killed, as well as the wounded and the injured.
The Taliban consists of foreign extremists, former leaders who have fled to Pakistan, but often farmers who refuse to have an armed foreign presence, as in the days of the Soviets.
They want to defend their centuries-old and archaic traditions, even if they are joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks and Tajiks.
Tolerated, sometimes supported by local insurgents, the latter will no longer be there as Western countries become more discreet.
The withdrawal of the French troops from the base at Nijrab, which I observed from a hill planted with almond trees and financed by French loans, took place properly.
Truck and tank convoys flown over by helicopters have reached Kabul without being attacked.
From the end of 2014, there will be no more influx of Taliban into Kabul.
Since their irresistible advance from 1994 to 1996, conditions have changed.
At the time, Kabul was empty and the country was overrun by war due to the struggles of the various rebel groups.
Their seizure of power at that time was seen as a kind of liberation and return to security.
The Afghan women have paid the price for the obscurantism of the farmers overwhelmed by the organization Al-Qaeda, but their situation has not improved to this day.
Former mujahideen, the Afghan government and current Taliban have a common desire to keep the women in a subordinate position.
The main figures of the anti-Soviet war came back to power in 2001.
They have turned into traders by seizing government land to sell as building land to refugees from Iran and Pakistan, taking advantage of massive U.S. subcontracting.
They have discredited themselves, and most of them were not themselves involved in the fighting.
As I have heard in the campaigns, people want a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave the country, just like those who have benefited from American grants: the flight of capital is considerable.
Young people are fed up with war and its ideologies.
During their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they have had contact with the modern world, and have enjoyed its advantages.
About 65% of the population is under 25 years of age; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, which is one fifth of the total population.
In the cities, state schools are full of girls and boys.
These young people, who do not want to return to the obscurantism of the former parties or to the corruption of certain leaders, will have to be provided with jobs.
Everyone, including the armed parties, is obsessed with mobile phones; television, with its Turkish series depicting a modern world, is watched everywhere.
There is an army now.
Are the authorities under whose authority it will be placed considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already trying to restore the militias in the province, which will escape the power of the central government.
Afghanistan, the land of mountains with strong local identities, should have benefited from some decentralization using the example of Western nations, but by abolishing the office of Prime Minister, which had existed since the 1964 Constitution, the US wanted to make it a centralized state with strong presidential power.
President Karzai does not want any foreign controls, especially on the occasion of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, his country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and long before that.
Industries have not been rebuilt, there are no functioning dams and important irrigation systems have not been repaired.
Everything is imported; apart from fruits and vegetables, nothing is produced.
The private initiative will be given priority.
In a country devastated by 30 years of war, state control of infrastructures would have been necessary.
The rumor was spread that Afghanistan possessed immense natural resources.
This reinforces the impression that the Western countries were only there to take possession of it.
Mining is not possible without energy to process the iron or copper ore on site, or without means of transport for export over the mountains.
The Chinese have already almost left the copper mine of Mes Aynak, let the international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) do their excavations on the huge Buddhist site and remain the main employers of the province.
One day it will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan, largely dependent on imports and exports, to re-establish normal relations.
The withdrawal of French combat troops was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the continuation of traditional aids: girls' and boys' gymnasiums, French Institute at the universities, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support of the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, a service of "civil-military actions" of the Ministry of Defense (Cimic), which was discontinued in 2012, has carried out numerous charitable works and measures for the rehabilitation of agriculture in dozens of mountain villages and has been carried out by a small French non-governmental organization in order to try to "win the hearts and minds" and achieve the impossible task of reconciling aid and offensive actions.
These works, which required a large number of local workers, have helped to quell the uprising: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increasing agricultural land.
What souvenir do we leave behind after military spending of two billion euros?
A much more modest budget will help improve local living conditions, which are very hard in these valleys, often at an altitude of more than 2000 meters.
The embassy has received dozens of written requests for small-scale agricultural projects from municipalities in Kapisa Province.
In order for farmers to free themselves from the insurgency led by foreign groups, which they say is their wish, it would be necessary to continue to provide less, more well-controlled and more direct civilian aid to them.
A constitution with the crowbar in Egypt
It is a new poker game by President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt remains more divided than ever in terms of the constitutional declaration, which temporarily grants it unlimited power, it has decided to put everything on a map.
To everyone’s surprise, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would adopt its final version the next day.
Just a week ago, the head of state had given this plenary two additional months to complete its work.
For almost two years now, Egypt has relied on a preliminary, multiple-amended text, which weakens institutional stability and leads to legal confusion.
This new initiative has only led to an even greater division of the country.
For his opponents, the president persists in his “autocratic delirium” by continuing to “break his word” and “kick the law.”
On the part of its proponents, it is assured that it is a way to end the institutional and political crisis as quickly as possible and to accelerate the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 14 days.
A very short period of time, forcing the brothers to abandon their plan of explaining the text to the Egyptians, section by section.
For the president, it is also a way of regaining his public and democratic legitimacy as the protest rages across the country.
According to a recent interview with Time magazine, Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote benevolently.
Especially since the Egyptian people are given an ultimatum with this recourse to a hasty vote: "Either you vote for my draft or I retain the unlimited power of attorney", the latter should supposedly come to an end after the adoption of the constitution.
85 mostly Islamist members of this constituent assembly passed the text yesterday in a strange atmosphere.
The majority of liberals have not complied with the request.
Shortly before the constitutional declaration in mid-November, they turned their backs on the idea that they had not been able to express their views.
Representatives of human rights organisations, religious minorities or civil society have acted equally.
To reach the quorum, 11 people, deputy members, were added in all haste yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
It is not surprising that most of the articles were adopted unanimously.
Commentators, by the way, found it entertaining that the only difference of opinion of the day... was expressed at the time of prayer, as some members of the panel felt that the clock of the constituent assembly was not accurate.
The text, which was adopted last night, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, which attracted all attention, ultimately remains identical to that of the 1971 Constitution, stating that "the principles of Sharia are the main source of law".
The Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is an important demand, had the hope of replacing "the principles" with "the rules", which would have made a stricter application possible.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not been changed is proof of their goodwill and respect for the other members of Egyptian society.
"Humility" the liberals, who see this only as a propaganda blow.
Because according to them, the Islamization of the constitution takes place through other articles.
In particular, they have in mind Article 220, which grants the University of Al-Azhar a consultative function, in particular with regard to the verification of conformity with the laws of Sharia.
According to Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier, this is troubling because “the people who are called upon to make a statement have not been elected and have no democratic legitimacy whatsoever.
Here we can see the first signs of a theocracy.”
The fears of the liberals are also fueled by the fact that the next rector of this university is likely to be far less moderate than the current one.
"At present, there is no concrete religious commitment.
With this constitution we remain within the framework of the bourgeois state.
Most of the lawyers who have worked on this text are not Ulema, but academics, some of whom have been trained in the French system," says Alexis Blouet, who is writing a doctoral thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
He acknowledges, however, that there may be an ambiguity with regard to Article 220, since the terms used are borrowed from the religious vocabulary.
One refers here in particular to the "Fiqh" [Islamic jurisprudence].
And in the future, the question could be raised to what extent civil judges are competent to decide on this."
In addition to its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday is heavily criticized for the far-reaching powers it confers on the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood argues that these are significantly reduced compared to the former regime.
Another point of contention: the powers of the army.
In accordance with the military’s wishes, the examination of the defence budget is not submitted to Parliament, but to a national defence council.
Likewise, there will be no ban on civil proceedings in military courts, as the human rights defense associations have called for.
The latter also share their fears about the text, which they consider to be a threat to freedom.
Blasphemy is being perpetuated, and insults are now banned, which could have serious consequences for the right to freedom of expression, especially for the press.
In addition, no article refers to the protection of women anymore, emphasizes Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
In her opinion, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by Article 36.
This word was not included in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian president had to speak on television last night, demonstrations are scheduled for this afternoon.
The supporters of the head of state will march on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists expect holy sites, the navel of the world and a sea of brine
The Promised Land combines the glory of biblical truths, modern comforts and unspoilt nature.
AIF gives you the top five reasons to visit Israel.
In front of the holy places
Visit the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that all who bathe in this river receive God’s blessing.
Galilee is the place where Jesus performed his miracles: the transformation of water into wine at a wedding feast, walking on the water, the stilling of the sea storm, and fishing.
It was here that Jesus appeared to his disciples after the resurrection.
However, most of the sanctuaries are found in Jerusalem.
Here, believers follow the Way of the Cross of Jesus Christ (in Latin: Via Dolorosa).
The path starts at the Roman fortress Antonia, Pretorium, where the court was, and leads through the streets of the old town to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre on Mount Golgotha, where the crucifixion site, the anointing stone and the tomb of Jesus are located.
According to the Christian view, this is the navel of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
The Monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem stands at the place where, according to Christian legend, the tree from which the cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus grew.
Jerusalem is also home to the most sacred site of the Jews - the Western Wall, the remains of a temple that was destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD.
Traditionally, people of different faiths leave notes with wishes, which are then fulfilled.
Take a trip to the top
The ruins of the fortress of Massada form the remains of the secret hiding place from enemies that Herod the Great had built for his family in 25 AD.
They are located on a rock face in the mountains at 450 meters above sea level.
Only mountaineers can reach the ruins on their own.
Everyone else brings an aerial cable car to this historic summit.
In the north of the country, at an altitude of 1600 to 2040 meters, there is the famous ski resort of Hermon, which attracts countless tourists during the winter months.
From the foot of the mountain, you can get there by shuttle bus.
The ski slopes have a total length of 45 kilometers.
According to ancient legend, pagan gods lived on the mountain top.
Visit unique museums
There are almost 300 museums in this country.
Not all of them can be visited in just one trip.
But at least the five most interesting of them should be paid a visit.
Among them is the Israel Museum not far from the Knesset (Parliament).
There, ancient Qumran manuscripts or Dead Sea scrolls found in rock caves in the Judean Desert are preserved, as well as about 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
The Museum of Art in Tel Aviv is also worth a visit.
There, the collection is exhibited by the Impressionists and Expressionists Monet, Pissaro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso.
In Akko you can visit the museum in Bad Al Basha, which houses several halls of old Turkish baths with sculptures of the former visitors and bath attendants.
In Caesarea, you should visit the unique private Ralli Museum, where you can admire sculptures of Dali and Rodin.
There are no museum guides or souvenir shops.
Admission is free and donations are generally refused.
The fifth museum, namely the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, tells of one of the most harrowing chapters in history.
The most poignant section is the Children’s Memorial, built to commemorate the 1.5 million children who were destroyed in the concentration camps and gas chambers.
Upon entering the room there is complete darkness.
Stars sparkle.
And the names of the Jewish children and the countries in which they died are resounding.
Ukraine is also mentioned there.
Doing something for health
The three main recreational areas of Israel are located on the shores of the Mediterranean, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
In each of the three locations there are swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and oceanariums.
Amazingly, bathing in the Red Sea is also done in the winter months, as the water temperature there does not fall below 21 °C and the air warms up to 23 °C.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and is where you can bathe all year round.
By the way, this unusual sea, located 417 meters below sea level, is the lowest sea in the world.
Its turquoise-blue water has a high salinity and therefore even carries non-swimmers on the surface without any problems.
The surrounding countryside is indescribably beautiful.
Visitors come here for treatments using salt water (natural brine) and healing mud, as well as for the treatment of skin inflammation, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes and to calm stressed nerves.
Touching the secrets of antiquity
These secrets are hidden in the old town of Tel Aviv, namely the city of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
Through this city passed the famous sea route that connected Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to tradition, Noah built his ark here, and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with which he led a long and happy life in this place.
Tourists like to stroll through the narrow streets, which are named after zodiac signs.
According to legend, Fortune is said to be held by all those who touch the walls in the alley with their zodiac sign.
In Jaffa, you can meet newlyweds from all over Israel and even other countries at photo shoots.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can stroll through the Roman theater and conquer the fortress of the Crusaders.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the most important city in Judea and the residence of the Roman governors, including Pontius Pilate.
The carefully restored theatre now hosts evening concerts and operas.
Watchlist for tourists
If you’re going to Israel, don’t worry about your poor English skills: About 30% of Israelis speak Russian.
The money in the journey is not taken in euros, but in dollars, which can be easily exchanged for shekels (current exchange rate: 1 dollar to 3.8 shekels).
In the city, you usually get ahead by bus, but in Jerusalem there is also a high-speed tram and in Haifa the only metro line in the country with six stops that connects the lower city with the upper city.
Actually, it's an underground funicular.
A trip within the city costs 6 shekels regardless of the means of transport, which is enough for a trip of up to 1.5 hours.
According to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is observed in Israel on Saturdays.
From Friday evening until sunset on Saturday, markets and shops are closed, and public transport is at rest.
And on Sunday morning, the work week begins.
Many cafés, restaurants and restaurants only serve kosher food, which excludes pork, seafood, fish without dandruff, and foods that contain both dairy and meat products.
Instead, you can choose from different dishes with mutton and beef, soups and desserts (prepared with coconut milk), traditional Jewish humus paste, various sauces, fried balls of pureed beans and peas (falafel), as well as fruits and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs in the streets of Israeli cities.
But there are many well-fed cats that roam the streets comfortably and unmolested.
In the evening you can even see them sleeping on the roofs of parked cars.
The cats like lively places and do not say no to treats.
Depending on the brand, a rental car costs between $37 per day (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
The insurance costs an additional $15 per day.
And bike rental costs 15 shekels per day.
Tickets for museums cost an average of 30 shekels.
In figures
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
Most adventurers and recreation seekers came from Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England, the USA and Ukraine.
From January to October 2012, 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists came to the Promised Land, an increase of 51% compared to the same period in 2010, prior to the lifting of the visa requirement on February 9, 2011.
'The Great and Powerful' Leads to Moscow: Migrants Save Money for Language
While MEPs and civil rights activists discuss the benefits of the law on mandatory language tests for migrants, criminals are already dealing with fake certificates
Every year, 13 million guest workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities in Russia.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money for the maintenance of the remaining families in the home.
On December 1, a law came into force requiring every migrant worker to take a test that certifies knowledge of the Russian language.
So far, this rule only applies to migrants who want to work in the service sector, in the municipal housing sector and in the retail trade.
However, over time, the tests are to become mandatory for all guest workers, according to the Federal Migration Authority.
In doing so, you have to take not only language tests, but also tests into Russian history and the foundations of the legislation.
Language skills must be proven both for obtaining and extending the work permit.
Exceptions apply only to citizens of countries where Russian is the official language.
Also exempt from this law are persons who have received their training certificates and diplomas before the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
Purpose, problems and protection of rights
The total number of examination centres will be under the aegis of the Pushkin Institute for the Russian Language, the Russian University of Friendship of Peoples, the Moscow State University, the St. Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
The migrants can take the tests in all cities; more than 160 centres have already been opened in Russia.
The initiative to introduce the tests was supported by the deputies of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Authority.
Civil rights activists, on the other hand, posed the following question in the press several times before the law came into force: What does the whole thing actually mean?
What changes does the requirement to have language skills bring, both for the Russians and for the guest workers?
Above all, counter-speakers of the migration authority, the aim is to reduce the number of forced labourers.
“Many are now talking about protecting the rights of migrant workers,” said Viktor Sebelev, head of the Federal Migration Agency’s representation in Tajikistan.
However, your rights must be protected before you leave.
Only an organized recruitment will solve 90% of the problems of foreign workers.
Migrants without a job, education, language skills and medical expertise encounter problems.
Sebelev is convinced that a future migrant without language skills will inevitably encounter people with evil intentions who, under the pretext of help, will put him in a dark, narrow barracks where he will endure with dozens of his peers for months without food and documents and work 12 to 14 hours a day.
We receive a lot of complaints from our migrants.
"At home, you are promised one thing, and on arrival you will be cheated, your passports will be taken away and you will not receive the promised wage," confirms the head of the head of the labor migration department of the Tajik Migration Authority, Tolib Schwaripov.
Don't yell at me, boss!
Nevertheless, many citizens of the Central Asian republics, who want to earn their money in Russia, admit that they not only do not master the language of the target country, but also can hardly express themselves in writing in their own language.
Of course, this is not so much their fault, but rather the evil: only a few Turkmens, Uzbeks and Tajiks can afford even a reasonable primary education.
Because in their families there is not even money to feed the children, let alone to buy them decent clothes, shoes and school supplies.
As teenagers, these children immediately seize the first opportunity to earn money.
“It’s difficult without language skills,” they admit.
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
Civil rights activists stress the following important aspect regarding the law.
Only migrants with legal status are required to take the test.
If you do not have this status, there is no examination and therefore no official work.
Meanwhile, the majority of guest workers remain illegally in Russia.
"Welcome" or "Access for Unauthorized Persons Prohibited"
Many migrants confirm that it is not easy to obtain official status in Russia.
The reason is bureaucratic hurdles and, of course, the linguistic difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
A fake registration can be done quickly and only for one and a half thousand.
The staff of the Russian police know that our documents are mostly fake and we are not registered, and then cases of extortion arise.
"They want one or two hundred rubles for cigarettes and tea," Tajik Umed Hushkadamov told journalists.
"Just don't shy away from the cost of false papers"
Already on the day the law came into force, it turned out that not only the registration documents of the migrants can be forged.
Some fake certificates certifying the completion of the language test have already been seized by employees of the Federal Migration Authority.
The forged papers were printed with an ordinary color printer.
Of course, the new owners did not receive these in vain: every migrant who hoped to be able to avoid the tests thus paid seven thousand rubles for the document.
This is more than twice the cost of the official test: it costs one migrant worker three thousand rubles.
The fact that the most important immediate task is to protect the system from corruption, so that the certificates can not be easily purchased, both officials and civil rights activists agree.
For the moment, the authorities can only promise guest workers who fall through the test the first time that they will get time for a basic language course.
In addition, new arrivals without language skills are offered positions in areas where no active communication with people is necessary.
Home Office Ignores Illegal Weapons Market
Proportion of legal weapons in crime extremely low
The Russian Interior Ministry is planning to tighten the gun laws for private gun owners.
The authorities are reacting to the latest events: injured in shootings at weddings and seven dead in the shooting of Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov.
The police want to ban the carrying of non-lethal weapons in public and raise the age for possession of firearms from 18 to 21 years.
The proposal was supported by the chairman of the Duma Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption, Irina Yarovaja, and promised that the amendments to the Arms Act will be submitted to the Duma shortly.
Not everyone is satisfied that the Russian authorities want to combat the problems by “attracting the screws”.
An open letter has been published on the Internet, whose authors - representatives of various arms associations - demand the authorities to refrain from "meaningless intensifications".
The percentage of crimes with registered weapons is very low, said the criminal lawyer Vasily Lesnikov, the Russian service of the BBC.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, 142 crimes involving the use of registered weapons were committed in the course of six months in 2012, while a total of 1.168 thousand crimes were recorded for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that tightening the law for private gun owners will not stop criminals from making use of the black market.
At present, according to the authors, any weapon can be found in Moscow for little money.
Meanwhile, the Interior Ministry emphasizes that the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from factories to officers
The weapons reach the black market through several channels.
There are five such main channels, says a former Colonel Viktor Baranez, who worked for ten years in the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot of a website that accepts gun orders
The first channel is the army or military, i.e. weapons that were stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
“The weapons were stolen by both Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves,” Baranez said.
On the second channel come illegal weapons, the law enforcement are stolen by criminals.
Baranez explains that this includes weapons stolen both from police armories and directly from law enforcement personnel.
Other illegally sold weapons come from military stockpiles.
There were frequent explosions at many military camps.
"There is evidence that some cases involved arson to cover up the lack of weapons," the former military official said.
According to Baranez, the weapons manufacturers also make a contribution to the black market.
“Today, there are countless private armament factories that do not withstand international competition and therefore waste their weapons under their hands on the black market, such as in Moscow,” the expert reports.
Another channel of the black market is smuggling.
Especially many pistols and rifles come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is a production of its own, sometimes artisanal, as well as a mafia that organizes the smuggling," explains the former military personnel.
Where did the weapons come from?
Experts calculated what approximately each of the five channels has in the supply of illegal weapons to the black market.
In 2011, a report was prepared by the Center for Problem Analysis and State Administration.
The experts analyzed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and the Federal Service for State Statistics, criminological literature and publicly accessible data on portals on the topic of weapons.
According to investigators, the vast majority of illegal weapons come from the army and the legal protection authorities.
Half of all weapons on the black market are there because of the “guilt of those responsible for their work with weapons,” according to the report.
According to the researchers, 17% of weapons come from conflict zones, 14% are stolen from weapons production, and 5% come from illegal excavations.
A sales consultant at a weapons store, who doesn’t want to be named, assures that weapons found during illegal excavations haven’t been bought for a long time, as they are outdated.
According to him, it is more common for traders to get supplies in a weapons warehouse.
An ensign buys a weapon, such as a TT pistol.
The weapon is issued and handed over through the fence.
"The dealer brings the gun to the city and sells it there for 900 euros a piece with two magazines," he says.
"The police, of course, know about everything and therefore, if they cannot comply with the plan to expose crimes, periodically carry out control purchases from dealers who offer illegal weapons," the sales consultant adds.
"Like in a luxury shop"
Buyers and sellers find each other most often through acquaintances.
I had looked at websites and blogs when someone noticed me and suggested to come to the station "Begovaya", where a person would wait for me, who would take me to a certain place where we could then negotiate the price.
The price of the gun was there.
Military commentator Viktor Baranez
"To get a gun, I need an acquaintance who has contacts," says the sales consultant. "I have such an acquaintance, but I don't trust him."
There are traders in the markets, but you have to go there and agree on a code like "by Ivan Ivanovich, who tells you that the daughter has lost a tooth".
I'm even getting to some knuckles right now about an acquaintance I trust.
He also delivers me the knuckles only because he knows I don't whistle him.
Newcomers look for weapons in different ways.
The former military member Viktor Baranez tried himself as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he wrote an article on the subject.
According to him, the schemes have not changed.
He got a photo album in which "everything possible" was pictured.
"I felt like I was in a luxury shop," the military official recalls.
According to Baranez, the buyer does not get the cat in the bag, but can try everything.
As a potential customer, I do not just buy, but drive with the seller into the forest, and there we set up a target.
"I can shoot there, and if I am convinced that the gun has a good shot, we will negotiate with each other," he said.
Shopping from the sofa
Internet search engines show search results for websites and groups in "Vkontakte", where weapons are offered "for various purposes".
No papers are required and there are no personal meetings.
"You only need the right amount of money," says the advertisement on the website "Buy a gun or a rifle".
There, users place their orders and make requests.
Is it also sold to minors?
"Of course without a license", asks user "Iwan" (literal quote).
"Buy a TT. Moscow" is the laconic question of "Fedorenkov".
The Federal Security Service recently switched countless fake websites, and buyers who want to buy weapons are flocking to the service.
People come to feed like hungry fish and then land in Siberia and are allowed to shovel coal
Military commentator and former military member Viktor Baranez
I have heard of the following scheme: The website is usually registered abroad, and Russian laws do not apply.
The responsible parties accept the orders.
The buyer transfers the money via an ATM.
"In response, he receives a photo and a description of the hiding place of the weapon," reports the press officer of the non-profit organization "Pravo na oryzhie" Dmitry Kislow.
Viktor Baranez emphasizes that in the end you can go out empty and get behind bars if you place a request on a website.
The Federal Security Service recently switched countless fake websites, and buyers who want to buy weapons are flocking to the service.
“People come to feed like hungry fish and then end up in the Siberian labor camp and are allowed to shovel coal,” he says.
A Makarov for $100
According to experts, when buying illegal firearms, prices are expected to range from $100 to $900.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the organization Pravo na oryzhie, you can buy a Makarov-type pistol for 100 to 300 dollars.
You have to wait up to a month and a half.
The weapon is issued in military arsenals by mid-range wardens.
According to official statistics from the Ministry of Interior, the number of illegal weapons offences across Russia decreased by 7% to 22.9 thousand in the period from January to October 2011, while the number of detected cases of theft and extortion related to weapons, munitions, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8%.
Fast Food and Supermarket Workers Strike in the U.S.
One in four U.S. youths sits behind Mc Donald's cash register at some point
In recent days, there have been massive protests across the U.S. against low wages in Walmart stores and restaurants of popular fast-food chains such as Mc Donald’s, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy’s and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
No one can yet predict whether the protests will continue to swell or whether they will run out of air again soon.
The protests are supported by unions and several left-wing non-profit organizations.
In addition to raising the modest wages of ordinary Walmart and fast-food workers, the organizers of the protests aim to found unions.
So far, this industry of the economy is hardly organized by trade unions.
46 cents a year?
Protests began last week after Thanksgiving, called Black Friday, where sales were taking place in the U.S., which attracted millions of customers, sometimes leading to handcuffs.
On that day, some Walmart employees, of whom there are 2.2 million worldwide, laid down their jobs and, along with unions and left-wing activists, attacked branches of the chain targeting low- and middle-income individuals.
Walmart sells everything from diapers to hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
Walmart stores average between 8 and 27% cheaper than large supermarkets.
That’s why many of the low-paid Walmart workers only shop at their own jobs.
The prices and product range made Walmart one of the largest companies in the United States.
According to critics, Walmart can often sell the goods so cheaply only because the employees are poorly paid.
The latter also complain about heavy working conditions, for example missing forklifts or hand scanners.
Participants in the “Black Friday” protests called for wage increases and expressed anger that the contribution to the company’s health insurance had increased from $30 to $100 a month.
A typical Walmart employee who earns $9.5 an hour cannot afford this increase, they said.
Researchers at California University in Berkeley prove that if the company raised the average wage to $12 per hour, it would cost Walmart $3.2 billion.
That’s about 1.1% more than they’re now donating to Wage.
If Walmart were to completely allocate the wage increases to customers, each purchase would cost them only 46 cents more in the future.
For them, that would be more than $12.39 per year compared to today.
Supporters of Walmart note with satisfaction that there were only protests in nine states and that they did not cause any losses to the company.
Black Friday lasted in its store from 8 p.m. on Thursday night to midnight the next day, and during that period Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
In total, Walmart cashiers carried out nearly 100 million transactions on Black Friday.
The company’s spokesman, Dan Fogelman, claimed in an interview on the left-wing Huffington Post website that a total of “less than five” Walmart employees were quitting work and the protest was merely “another PR ploy” by the union organizing the protests.
"Free cash!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where their target was not Walmart stores (which are not wanted in this progressive city and are therefore so far non-existent), but McDonald’s and other low-cost restaurants.
McDonald's says the company sells billions of servings, and yet they don't grant you sick days, and you don't get paid for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, member of the New York City Council
Currently, the minimum wage under federal and New York law is $7.25 an hour.
In fast food restaurants, the minimum wage is gradually being raised, but not too much, and on average, their basic employees in New York get $8.90 an hour.
No one deserves less than her in this expensive city.
How it is possible to get by with so little money in New York is incomprehensible to me.
There was a time when almost a quarter of all U.S. teenagers were behind the counter at McDonald’s after school, but the teenagers were still living with their parents.
Hardly anyone saw it as the main source of income or planned to stay there longer.
Now, in interviews with McDonald’s employees, I constantly encounter people who complain that they get along with this wage and sometimes even have to feed their children.
On the other hand, there is a comment in the Wall Street Journal forum, whose author notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know how to feed them.
Participants in the protests, which began at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday in front of McDonald’s on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and chefs from fast-food restaurants receive a $15-per-hour minimum wage, more than doubling the current minimum wage.
They continued to demand the formation of unions in the fast food industry.
U.S. law prohibits corporate management from standing in the way of this goal and from admonishing or dismissing union members.
On the other hand, corporate governance does not make it easy for them.
However, the formation of trade unions in the fast food industry is also difficult for objective reasons.
The most important reason is the high staff turnover.
Unsatisfied
There were loud protests that day in front of many other fast food restaurants in Manhattan.
The high point of the protests was a meeting at noon in front of McDonald's in Times Square, where some local Democrats spoke, including city council member Jumaane Williams, who said, "McDonald's says it sells billions of portions, and yet you are not given sick days, and you are not paid for your honest work!"
The protesters were also backed by other prominent New York Democrats, for example, mayoral candidate Bill De Blasio, who said that “we should collectively support the fast food workers so that they can get a fair wage and achieve the economic prosperity that every New Yorker deserves!”.
According to the New York Times, this was the largest action of its kind in the history of the U.S. fast food industry.
However, only a few hundred people were on site, not all of whom are by far employed in the fast food industry, where tens of thousands work in New York.
It is not yet clear whether the spark of these protests will mobilize entire masses.
"The brain can only be outsmarted moderately so far"
The augmented reality theme, popular with fans of modern technologies, has recently been commonly perceived through the lens of special glasses.
First, Google presented a working model at its annual conference in the summer, then in November it was announced that Microsoft had also filed a corresponding patent.
Speaking to the head of the group for interactive 3D technologies at the Microsoft lab in Cambridge Shahram Izadi, it becomes clear, however, that the glasses were only a transit station for the company’s scientists.
It appeals to the possibility of manipulating virtual objects in the air with bare hands and creating virtual open spaces.
- Please briefly describe what research your group is doing.
- We deal with the interaction of man and machine, but we want to expand the boundaries of this interaction.
So far, humanity has largely been stuck in the phase of working with pixels on flat screens, which are sometimes also touched.
However, we want to look 5-10 years ahead and anticipate the radical changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors are an advancement, and nowadays, no Xbox is sold without Kinect, as everyone is interested in motion control.
- What awaits us in the future?
- Although Kinect has taken the interaction to a physical level, a lot of it still takes place on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information (the system receives more data) could be improved, the output so far not decisive.
We are trying to change that, working on real three-dimensional representation systems based on different technologies, including projections.
We must release the computer world into our physical world and make it more comprehensible.
For this purpose, however, it is necessary that not only the user but also his environment is recognized.
Then we could add virtual objects to the real world much more easily.
And first of all, we should get rid of these stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think about Voice Control?
It's popular, but isn't it overrated?
- It is certainly not the all-purpose solution, since it raises questions about privacy, because you do not always want to inform all bystanders about his actions and intentions.
Actually, any kind of interaction with computers is good, but each in its particular niche.
For example, in the field of controlling objects in public places, we worked on a project in which we experimented with short and concise, rather than expansive gestures.
The gestures were not recorded by the object camera, but by a bracelet that recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is still relatively large, but could theoretically be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
But overall, the future belongs to mixed control types, such as gestures and speech.
- Like that?
For example, we'd like to ask you to pass me this can of bubbly?
They say it and at the same time point to it.
- I usually just say it.
- Oh, that would be very hard to see.
- Does that mean you want the user to adapt to what a machine can and can’t do at any given time?
- Not necessarily, but this is about a mutual rapprochement.
I think that in the near future we will have to work mainly on the development of new types of sensors that make it possible to capture people’s reactions more accurately.
These can be laser sensors, for example, because they offer good resolution in depth, which is very important.
- What are your demands on modern cameras based on your work with the Xbox Kinect sensors?
Is there a lack of resolution, depth or something else?
- The current generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the field of three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, 8 megapixels with a speed of 1000 fps would not be bad.
But the main thing is not the megapixels themselves, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
From this point of view, all current technologies are not good enough for us, as the developers of the algorithms have more work to do.
It is necessary to take into account not only the resolution along the X and Y axes, but also along the Z axis.
The speed and the number of images per second are also important.
Human movements are extremely dynamic and frankly, the current 30 fps are too low, especially for gestures.
Stephen Betishes developed a touch sensor in our lab in Redmond with a controllable processing delay between 1 to 100 milliseconds, with today’s commercial sensors closer to the second value (60 to 100).
Not everyone understands how much this affects the interaction between humans and machines.
For my work I needed just such a device, only without touch control and with more images per second.
- Shouldn't the number of cameras be increased?
- Kinect currently works with three "cameras", one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the second is a receiver for the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually an ordinary RGB camera.
It is not used to calculate the object depth.
More cameras could possibly solve the problem...
Or increase the problem, as more calculations would be necessary.
Nice would be a flexible, Kinect-like system where we could play with different camera angles to see how that helps us determine a position three-dimensionally.
- If I remember correctly, unlike Google, Microsoft did not present its glasses to the public.
Don’t you think that in terms of applying augmented reality technology in everyday life, glasses have the best prospects?
- Of course, it is not pleasant to always hold a smartphone in the raised hand on the go, but I think this: the most amazing variant would be a "changing" augmented reality, where we could switch from glasses to the smartphone via a cloud,
The glasses are a personal gadget and therein lies their strength (private things only you can see), but at the same time also their weakness, because an augmented reality with glasses prevents you from working together with others on virtual objects.
- Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holograms in the air is accessible not only to Tony Stark from Iron Man, but also to normal mortals.
There is a problem that critics of this idea often point out: there is no tangible reaction!
The hands feel nothing at all!
What answers does your group want to give to this objection?
In my lectures, I often speak of augmented reality as the seventh breakthrough in human-machine interaction.
I think the eighth breakthrough could well be the integration of tactile perception.
An interesting method at the moment is the use of the second hand as a somewhat unusual projection pad.
She perceives pressure very well!
However, there are also technologies that are actually designed to give the "images in the air" something tangible, for example, the interference of some directed ultrasound beams at a certain point where the finger is located produces a feeling that is currently, however, as weak as someone was blowing over the palm of his hand.
There are also ligaments for the wrist that act on the nerve endings in the fingers, also this is a potential direction.
- Did you try to outsmart the brain?
Make it think that it feels what it should feel when it is seeing something?
- That's a good idea, so we haven't tried it yet.
Here is another task that we will have to struggle with for a long time, namely to make a person who is physically in an enclosed space believe that he is instead in an open, practically infinite space; here we are working on concepts with treadmills (other than in gyms), movable platforms as well as large balls.
So far, the brain is only moderately outsmarted, and there are still many years of hard work ahead of us.
This is what makes working in the field of virtual reality so attractive for a researcher: we are only at the beginning of many topics.
Own taste instead of culture - rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt continues the project "Petersburg Avant-garde", which is dedicated to city dwellers who form the avant-garde of art and culture.
On the exquisite list, high-ranking representatives of the Petersburg art scene have already landed, whose successes go beyond the city’s borders and who often find recognition in Europe without being known in the rest of Russia.
The new hero of Rosbalt is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, the bearded man dressed in red, who you sometimes find at the Russian Museum, sometimes at the summer garden, sometimes at scene meetings or on vernissages.
Wherever Kirill Miller’s paintings are exhibited, they attract large crowds.
Kirill Miller is one of the typical Petersburg social-philosophical artists who create new myths.
Kirill Miller is a shining personality of the Petersburg avant-garde in the late 80s and early 90s.
He is also a man of the city and, by his presence on the street, puts a smile on the faces of his fellow citizens and makes them feel good about themselves.
Recently he grabbed a barrel organ and became a Petersburg barrel organ player, as he finally felt ready for this difficult role in terms of his artist life, his philosophy and his image.
- Kirill, why are you always in red and not, for example, in yellow or turquoise in the city?
I have chosen the color red as a fashion designer, who deals with the look and the image.
In this world, red is the compromise between artist, image consultant and society.
In society, anything that deviates from the gray norm causes aggression and bad behavior.
But I want to get into conversation with people through my provocations.
Each of my past provocations was an invitation to a conversation.
- When did you know you had to be a painter?
- At an exhibition in the Palace of Culture Nevsky, where my works were exhibited.
I realized I had to go this way.
Then the time of the old free painters came to an end, but not officially recognized at that time, and new and free painters like me were incomprehensible.
I became friends with the painters of the new generation, that is, with the representatives of the "Gazonevschina", from which "Pushkinskaya 10" came to an end.
I’m attracted to theatre, fashion, music, anything but literature.
- And all this came together in your art clinic... - It was important to me to be at the center of the Petersburg culture, where the best creative artists would gather.
In 1995 I occupied a room in Pushkinskaya 10, and until the renovations there was a musical-artistic club for the Boheme, the house of the Petersburg Boheme.
Many were born there: N.O.M., Tequilajazzz, and I also remember how cord got there with his project "Ucho Van Goga".
Schnur and his friends sang simple songs for playback, wore tight jerseys and among them was the now popular composer Igor Wdowin.
When the group started playing live, it became "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg hosted many programs before the time of "Halli-Galli".
We gave them Trachtenberg, and it began his great career, but he learned the basics with us.
Also the gallery "D 137" or the club "Griboedov" have their origin in the Art-Klinik.
That’s where our staff and regular guests went.
I am a hero of the last century, when culture still meant something.
In the year 2000 there was a survey in the press, which was about the award "Personalities of our city".
I won in the category "Artist of the Year", and so I had reached the climax.
It is not easy to work according to old rules in new times; I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
Nowadays it is easy to become famous, but culture and popularity are not the same: you can be famous without making a cultural contribution.
- Your works have an unmistakable style.
- Many of my pictures are real pearls and clearly express the topicality and sharpness of the thoughts.
I will have an exhibition with the theme "The Russian Museum as Clowns".
Clowns are timeless.
I used to be social, but now it hurts and scares me to be like that.
In a clown, this blurs everything and loses its tragedy.
I love the grotesque, and I have grotesque ideas.
For example, let’s save the world by prescribing that everyone has to dress up completely.
Now everyone pays attention to the clothes and is oriented to the outside and not to the inside of the person.
But maybe you can't shake a man's hand, you should spit in his face.
The deception disappears through the disguise.
We recently saw you play the role of the city's barrel organ player, and a cultural city should have a hero like that.
Who, if not me?
Can commercial art be beautiful?
- Nowadays, commercial art must be careful, considerate and flattering.
We see the disintegration of cultures.
In the past, people formed large groups: the bohemians loved the one and the common people loved the other.
Now there are micro-communities, and it’s hard to please everyone.
I'm not a one hundred dollar note that everybody likes.
Now you have to think about who you will like.
Now each cult star has about 100 followers.
- The performances of Stas Mikhailov, however, come several thousand!
- Abandoned women come to him, where the sexual-social sphere plays a role.
For cultural reasons, 300 people come and not 10 thousand, so there is less management, money, and everything goes to waste.
I have followers, and the most important thing is not to cheat them and not to destroy what has been achieved.
In my youth I painted such paintings, which even hung in a series with the works of Falk and Larionov.
I started with pictures that usually don’t come until the end of my career.
Nowadays, there are often misunderstandings.
It is called: spiritual culture and consumer culture.
Consumption has no culture at all, that is something completely different.
I am a person of the past culture and grew up with artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty and refused money in order to be able to paint.
This is the culture I support.
- Kirill, what's missing in Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
They say: servant of culture.
But not all of them can deal with culture.
It was different with the real Czars, because the Czars may not understand much about culture, but they understood that real experts are necessary.
There are good advisors in Moscow at the moment.
In Petersburg, we have some who could be experts, but they are blocked from the way, because it needs higher-ranking experts who properly evaluate the former and clear the way for them.
Now all that matters is your own taste.
The same applies to Erarta, but with the difference that they honestly say that they do not accept all contemporary art and some painters therefore have to look for other museums.
- What's Petersburg to you?
- St. Petersburg is not the Capital of Culture; there is much more culture and culture in Moscow.
Art is difficult to grow on our stones.
We need a cultural breeding ground, because, for example, we now have more writers than readers, and that’s not right.
In Europe, there are many curious people who visit exhibitions or concerts.
With us, that is much less.
Art must be modern again, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project is funded by grants from the City of Saint Petersburg
Birth in space
Earth in danger.
Global Warming or Collision with Killerasteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with Earth-dwellers on board set out in search of a replacement planet.
In order to save humanity, the important question arises as to how we can reproduce in weightlessness or on the replacement planet?
In my opinion, there are not many choices.
In fact, there are only two real planets that we could at least hypothetically inhabit.
"It's called Mars and Venus," says the research assistant at the Sternberg Institute of Astronomy, Vladimir Surdin.
However, while conditions on Mars are comparatively life-friendly, there is a temperature of 500 degrees on the surface of Venus.
Life would only be possible at high altitude or in the orbit of Venus, i.e. in space.
The researchers first addressed the question of reproduction in space with regard to flora.
Already half a century before, experiments with plants were carried out.
The fourth generation of peas bred in orbit did not differ in the least from the terrestrial species.
This was followed by the breeding of insects, more precisely of tiny fruit flies (Drosophila), in orbit.
In 1979 quail eggs were sent into space to explore how microgravity affects embryo development.
It develops a completely normal chick.
But then the problem begins.
"The problem is that the chick has to be able to stand on its feet and start moving," said Vladimir Sychev, head of the Institute of Medical-Biological Problems at RAN.
Without solid ground, the chicks overcame wildly.
Ten hours later, the instincts of the newborns completely blunted.
The chicks did not react to light and sounds.
Four days later, they simply died.
"Two times we let chicks hatch and then stopped the whole thing, because it is simply impossible to work with them there," says Vladimir Sychew about the failed experiment with the chicks in space.
The last incubator with animals flew into orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in the spring of 2013.
However, only same-sex species will be found on the biosatellite "Bion".
There was an experiment with rats that had already been sent into space in fertilised form.
In principle, nothing special was found.
"This was just with the biosatellites, but again it was just a single experiment, and the research must be continued," notes Vladimir Sychew.
After the landing, the space rats got offspring.
So far, the problem of reproduction directly in space has not been solved.
The task is difficult.
Animals torn from their natural habitat simply cannot follow their reproductive instinct.
Unlike animals, humans can do this in principle.
Homo sapiens is capable of abstract thinking and can create a similar emotional background.
For ethical reasons, such experiments are not carried out.
But women have been flying into space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was with Tereshkova.
The most valuable thing that humanity possesses is the female organism.
Our seagull flew away, and no one on Earth could have answered the question: Will it survive space flight?
Will she be able to give birth after this flight?
"Finally, no one answered this question," says space veteran Wachtang Watschnadse.
In June 1964, just one year after her space flight, the first female cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, gave birth to a daughter.
The child's father, Andrijan Nikolayev, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman in space, Svetlana Savizkaja, who was in orbit twice and even worked outside the spacecraft, gave birth to a son.
Nevertheless, there is still a risk.
We have very few cosmonauts, in which everything went well after long flights and they got healthy offspring.
"The more dangerous it is, even when flying in orbit," concludes cosmonaut Valeri Polyakov, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of the Russian Federation.
And yet, humanity must look for new paths in biotechnology, radiation protection and the generation of artificial gravity.
The hydro lab in the cosmonaut preparation center is a mandatory station during flight preparation.
Here in a suspended state, the cosmonauts gain routine for work in open space.
The water represents weightlessness.
Even if adults find water pleasant, it is a strange environment; but infants perceive water as a natural element.
It is as if the little ichtyanders bear witness that life on land rose from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that a child is in the mother’s belly in amniotic fluid for about 9 months, and the fact that it is easier for them to get used to water.
In principle, this is logical, since only 2 weeks pass from birth to the first swim.
“This is too little time to forget something,” says baby swimming teacher Marina Aksenowa.
So while for a newborn child weightlessness is a much more natural state, the woman does not get along without gravity.
In the state of weightlessness, the abdominal and pelvic muscles recede enormously quickly and thus also the ability to squeeze the child out decreases.
All right, let's get around this through birth-initiating aids.
For example, the birth could also take place in a special chamber to squeeze the child out.
"But what happens then?" is the not insignificant question of Valery Polyakov.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without feeling the attraction to the earth, the organism cannot form the skeleton and muscles.
A newborn child cannot be put in an exercise suit in orbit like an adult for training.
He will simply lack what is of elementary importance for his life.
"This experiment, which we are conducting together, namely the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will result in the birth of a disabled person, a completely inappropriate person," predicts the head of the Bioethics Commission of the Institute for Medical-Biological Problems RAN, Igor Pestow.
So far, the birth of children in space is a mere theory.
At some point, however, it becomes a reality when Earth’s inhabitants in their spaceships set off for a distant planet that will be the home for their space-born offspring.
NK<0xC3><0x9A>-Chef: Control of the black system fails due to fault of the politicians
The Czech Republic has good control bodies and adequate laws in connection with public contracts, but falls behind in their application.
Speaking for Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz, Miloslav Kala, Vice President of the Supreme Control Office (Nejvy<0xC5><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1><0xC3><0xAD> kontroll<0xC3><0xAD> <0xC3><0xBA><0xC5><0x99>ad, NK<0xC3><0x9A>) said this.
"A law is never perfect, but it has to be applied correctly - and I don't think that's the case with us," Kala said.
A similar result appears to be achieved by joint control by Czech and German auditors.
As a negative practical example, he cites the attitude of Prime Minister Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as to the so-called "black system".
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS would not bother the entrepreneurs with controls - is the system now banned or allowed?
"A law must have its validity, and if something is prohibited by law, then it cannot simply come from the head of the government, and the control office, whose duty is to control compliance with the law, impede its activity," Kala notes.
At the meeting of the Control Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, you spoke about a joint Czech-German project, in which the laws of both countries regarding public contracts were compared.
What exactly was it about?
This is a parallel test that we started about two years ago.
To put it simply, it is a matter of the European legislature defining how public contracts are to be handled. This is the basis of national legislation. And finally, there is the actual practical application.
We have compared all this and although the test is not yet complete, we have found very interesting differences. In general, the laws are perhaps even a little more "strict and perfect" with us, but the actual application is better in Germany in some parameters.
This confirms that it is not enough to draw up new and more precise rules again and again, and that it is also necessary to deal with the actual application of the law.
How can the project help you? What results from this project for you?
It is precisely such joint control that could help us to stop constantly striving to perfect the laws and to lower and balance thresholds, if this does not seem to have a particularly positive effect.
Profitability means to acquire a thing at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price) and to rule out unlawful enrichment or even criminal acts.
But lowering thresholds for orders does not guarantee that we will achieve this goal.
Perhaps it is even the case that in this way we burden the system only with excessive "paperwork", and those looking for gaps in the system have it much easier to exploit the system than if the thresholds remained higher.
They talk about the problems in the practical implementation of the Czech Procurement Act.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there a similar authority here as our NK<0xC3><0x9A>, or does the system work differently?
As far as the authorities are concerned, the German counterpart to the NK<0xC3><0x9A> is the Bundesrechnungshof (Federal Court of Audit), which is structured in a similar way to ours and also has a college that is only formed slightly differently.
The competences are also comparable to a certain extent, although Germany is a federal state, i.e. these audit institutions also exist in the individual federal states - this is where the German system differs from ours.
The BRH may only control federal funds, which corresponds to our state funds.
Public funds, which are managed by us by the districts and municipalities, are subject to the control of the state courts of accounting.
As far as German legislation is concerned, is it easier than ours?
In general, I would not like to compare this without concrete information. Nevertheless, Germany is often referred to as a model in some respects, but one can certainly not say that Germany is better in everything.
Is it because the inspectors are better?
Certainly not, but as I said: I do not like such comparisons very much.
It should also be noted that those countries that set an example for us also have problems.
Otherwise, they wouldn't have any cooperation with our agency, would they?
As far as Czech legislation is concerned, what significance did the amendment of the Public Procurement Act have for your authority, do you already feel any impact?
Considering that this amendment is only in force for a short time, it has not yet had any effect on our examinations.
Since our checks are carried out retrospectively, we have to expect a certain delay here.
We have so far been more affected in the preparatory phase of future controls - for example, we have introduced the new control instrument "Recognition of risks of uneconomicity" and with this almost 14,000 public contracts are examined and analysed - here the changes will of course have an impact, as the thresholds change, the conditions for certain types of tenders have been modified, etc.
Do you see the adoption of this law rather positively, or is the system burdened with further bureaucracy?
I think that this law is definitely a step in the right direction and hope that this assumption is confirmed.
However, the problem may arise that the rules become "stricter" and can no longer be adhered to.
Already under the previous rules, the persons subject to an audit are accountable to the institution (for example, in the case of an operational programme of regional policy, the Regional Council) to the effect that any non-compliance with the procurement law amounts to a breach of budgetary discipline.
Does it make sense to make the law even stricter?
I do not think that way.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse the system, and not punish those who have committed a formal error that does not affect actual decision-making.
Such a system only puts the bureaucracy under even greater pressure.
Where's the way out?
First of all, let’s say which path is not effective.
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS would not bother the entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called "black system" - what exactly does that mean?
Is the black system now prohibited or allowed?
A law must have its validity, and if something is prohibited by law, then it cannot simply come from the head of the government and obstruct the control office, whose duty is to control compliance with the law, in its activities.
He can say, "We change the law and allow the thing," but he can't say that we're pretending to be nothing.
The Public Procurement Act contains relatively strict rules on the formal execution of certain transactions - and this is also correct for the protection of public competition.
On the other hand, it is also tragic if the bidder with the best offer is excluded due to formal errors alone.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be properly applied - and that is what I think is missing from us.
On the roads there is occasional ice, but mostly they are dry.
On the roads of the Czech Republic there is partly snow and ice smoothness.
Most of the roads, however, are easily passable, sometimes increased caution is required.
Karlovy Vary
In the Karlovy Vary district, the roads were easily navigable this morning, with occasional snow and ice.
The temperatures dropped to -5 to -10 °C, during the day it should be a bit warmer.
It is no longer snowing in the region, and only a thin blanket of snow remains in the lower altitudes.
On the ridges of the Ore Mountains, however, there is about 30 cm of snow.
According to the district road guard, there was limited visibility due to fog.
The R6 expressway and the traffic routes of the first road class in the region are currently fully passable.
However, attention is required, for example, on bridges on which the roadways are sometimes icy and smooth.
Also passable are all traffic routes of the second and third road class, including the mountain roads.
However, sections of iced or extended snow residues remain on these roads.
Increased attention is therefore required, especially at the higher altitudes.
Districts Pardubice and Hradec Kr<0xC3><0xA1>lové
On some roads in eastern Bohemia there is a risk of ice loss, in higher altitudes and in the mountains there is still an extended layer of snow on the roads, informs the road and motorway management on their websites.
The road authorities warn drivers of ice, which can occur especially at higher altitudes in the district of Pardubice.
Ice smoothness can occur in particular on second and third-class roads in the districts of Lan<0xC5><0xA1>kroun, <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Orlic<0xC3><0xAD>, Poli<0xC4><0x8D>ka, Svitavy and Vysoké M<0xC3><0xBD>to.
Roads I/43 and I/34 at Svitavy are chemically treated.
Snow lies especially on the roads in the Giant Mountains and the Orlické hory mountains.
An extended layer of snow lies at altitudes on the roads of the districts of Rychnov nad Kn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE>nou and Trutnov.
In eastern Bohemia, it is mainly sunny or sunny today, and it remains largely rain-free.
The temperatures are between -3 and + 1 °C, there is a weak wind.
Plze<0xC5><0x88>
Today, the roads in the Pilsen district are easy to drive on, but local attention is needed and the driving style has to be adapted to the weather.
This is frosty in the morning, with temperatures between 3 and 9 degrees below freezing.
Since it has snowed before and the temperatures subsequently dropped, it can come to ice smoothness on the streets.
Locally, fog is also to be expected, although visibility will improve during the day.
This information comes from the District Roadmasters.
The D5 motorway is practically unrestricted, but increased attention is recommended by the road authorities between the 80th and 131st kilometres.
The roads of the first road class are mostly dry, but frozen through.
In the south of the Pilsen and Tachov districts, however, there may be sections of ice.
The roadways of the second and third road class are damp, and therefore the indication of possible icy sections applies here as well.
Drivers should be especially careful mainly on the less frequented roads in the Bohemian Forest area.
Olomouc
Today, drivers who are heading towards the high altitudes in the Olomouc district have to reckon with slush.
After the use of spreading vehicles, slush remains on the <0xC4><0x8C>ervenohorské sedlo pass and on the road towards Videlsk<0xC3><0xBD> k<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0xBE>.
Nocturnal snow drifts forced the road authorities to use the snow, in the district of <0xC5><0xA0>umperk fell about 3 cm of fresh snow, according to the road administration.
In the other areas of the district, the roads are usually unrestricted.
"In the <0xC5><0xA0>umperk district, there are still remnants of snow in the high altitudes.
On the <0xC4><0x8C>ervenohorské sedlo pass, drivers have to expect slush in the direction of Jesen<0xC3><0xAD>k," an employee of the <0xC5><0xA0>umperk road administration told the agency <0xC4><0x8C>TK today.
Her colleagues in Jesen<0xC3><0xAD>k County also had to go out at night, according to her, the roads are free and wet to the high altitudes after chemical treatment.
In Olomouc County the roads are unrestricted, but in <0xC5><0xA0>ternberk County the drivers have to drive carefully in forest sections, as the roads are still wet.
<0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem District, Liberec District
In northern Bohemia, the road authorities report several difficult-to-pass road sections.
In addition to several places with snow or ice, the mountain road from Telnice to Kn<0xC3><0xAD>nice in the district of <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> n.K. is closed, according to the traffic police.
Temperatures remain below zero even at lower altitudes, so that snow and ice will remain on the roads. However, no problems are reported from the lowlands, especially southeast of the Bohemian Lowlands, and the roads there are usually dry.
No traffic disruptions have been reported so far.
Ice smoothness is reported in particular from the vicinity of <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>t<0xC3><0xAD>.
According to meteorologists, there were ideal conditions for this at night - during the day rain and melting snow, at night cloudless sky and frost.
Bad traffic conditions are reported from the main lines as well as from road I/13 on the border of the districts of <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> n.L. and Liberec.
The closure of the road between Telnice and Kn<0xC3><0xAD>nice was necessary due to branches pressed down to the road from the snow load.
<0xC5><0xA0>imon Ornest: We want to gather positive energy at our concerts
What do you think is going to happen in less than a month?
This is one of those disaster reports that we humans are so eager to jump at.
With our band The Tap Tap, we are more likely to make fun of it and say that we are the only band in the world that can gather enough positive energy to stop or prevent the end of the world.
In December, you will also realize a unique project with three concerts towards the end of the world.
Can you introduce the project to our readers?
It’s a nationwide benefit event that we’ve been planning for two years.
For this we want to use the marketing potential of the Mayan calendar, the end of which is forecast for December 21 at 11:10 in the morning.
The day before, i.e. on 20 December, three concerts will take place simultaneously from 21:00 in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
The end of the concerts is supposed to be around the time when the Mayan calendar ends on the Pacific island of Kiribati, which is 12 hours ahead of us in a time zone.
Who did this idea come from?
Originally probably from me, then we developed the idea together with our graphic designer Honza Augusta.
Not only do we want to gather enough positive energy to prevent the end of the world, but we also want to think together with the public about the state in which we once handed this world over to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar, we have also developed a unique collection of shoes, t-shirts, bags and key rings against the end of the world, with which people can also support us with their purchase via www.e-tap.cz.
The band The Tap Tap together with other performers also recorded the so-called anthem against the end of the world with the title "Weltunterfall falt aus".
The anthem is already very popular on YouTube. Will it also be heard at the benefit concerts?
Of course, and at the very end, provided that everything works out and the end of the world does not take place...
The anthem is to be sung by all performers at all three concerts at the same time.
In addition, the anthems will be broadcast live together in a direct broadcast from Czech Television.
The lyrics of the anthem come from Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Han<0xC3><0xA1>k, who also plays the main character of Jesus in the video clip, Xindl X also sings with...
How did you come to collaborate with both?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, which is related to the fact that we realize many charity events and concerts...
We try to involve these people intensively in our projects.
It has been shown that most people are interested in working with us and enjoy it.
What is the purpose of the proceeds of the concerts against the end of the world?
For the establishment of the accessible education center Studeo, where we have been working for six years together with the association Tap in the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute.
The students of the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute are regularly supervised by lecturers who help them with various leisure activities.
Since the students themselves do not have the means to visit the editors, we want to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute, a separate building is to be built, which we will then move into with this project.
Several groups and performers perform at each concert.
On what criteria did you choose them?
We wanted to put together a program that would appeal to all generations, including children.
In Prague, for example, Chinaski, Support Lesbians, Illustratosphere with Dan B<0xC3><0xA1>rta, The Tap Tap, Mari<0xC3><0xA1>n Bango and Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Such<0xC3><0xBD> perform.
You can find out more on the website www.kpks.cz.
Are similar "big events" also planned for the future?
In May we perform for the first time at the Prague Spring, and for this concert we are preparing an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to perform at the Czech House in New York, and I personally - when we are in the USA - would like to combine this with performances in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not very small, so far you have performed in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
However, The Tap Tap is a group made up of people with disabilities.
How do you manage these trips logistically and organizationally?
It’s not as bad as it might seem at first glance.
Five of our members are wheelchair users, i.e. the wheelchairs have to be transported in the luggage compartment. In addition, of course, we have to carry a lot of instrument cases and other luggage...
Nevertheless, it has always worked without problems so far, <0xC4><0x8C>SA and British Airways were always very well prepared for us, that I have sometimes already wondered.
Even in Moscow, where we were recently, there were no problems.
Through your trips abroad you have a comparison, what it looks like in the individual countries with accessibility, how to deal with disabled people there, etc.
How have you experienced these things so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities where everything works better than in Russia, we have seen that everything in the East is still in its beginnings.
Moscow is absolutely not handicapped accessible to Prague, where it is still unusual for someone to be in a wheelchair in the city centre alone.
It is not even self-evident that a wheelchair user can be left in the elevator, for example.
Fortunately, there are also associations there that try to point out the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what way do we have to catch up with the more developed countries?
There are still a lot of things we hang on to...
However, it should also be noted that an improvement in the situation always depends on the efforts of those affected.
In London and Madrid, it is absolutely common for people with severe disabilities to be able to move around independently in public spaces, go to the museum, use toilets, etc.
But it is not exactly common that a larger group of disabled people actively participate in social events there, in which we are a little ahead of the West with the band The Tap Tap!
Respect in public and accessibility is one thing, but it is only when significant athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers come out of our ranks that things really start to change.
So far, these are only isolated cases of particularly strong-willed personalities.
The Tap Tap is very popular at the moment, but if we go back a few years, what motivated you to start a band in 1998?
At that time I started as a supervisor at the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute, where I met many young people who were interested in doing some intensive work.
And since I am a musician myself and play saxophone, I founded a music company together with a colleague.
Well, and over time, as our presenter, L<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8F>a Angelovi<0xC4><0x8D>, used to say, this has gotten a little out of control (laughs).
But the band has only been known in recent years, or am I wrong?
It is true that working with well-known singers has helped us; we have also started to actively promote ourselves.
We have become aware that if one does something and this is not visible to the outside, one’s own performance does not exist in a certain sense.
Thanks to the EU funding, we can also afford good proofreaders, high-quality equipment and the like.
Was it your goal to make it this far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt the potential to do things differently.
In show business today, one often copies the other.
This is logical in its own way, since everything new is viewed with caution and accepted only after a long time.
There are few truly unique things, and I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression that the viewer usually has is, of course, pity; this is only natural...
But this compassion is absolutely superfluous, because people with disabilities are not lonely and abandoned beings that we would have to regret.
They are people who live a full life and can develop, provided they have the necessary means to do so.
I always say that if people with disabilities succeed in something, it is not only progress for themselves, but for the whole of society.
Was it also helpful for this success that you are a strict boss, as you hear from many people?
If you want to do something well, you must not compromise in many things and also have to demand a certain discipline.
However, I think this is perfectly normal.
Some come to us with romantic ideas, and when they find that they have rehearsals twice a week, have to complete preparatory phases and spend a lot of time on concert tours, then enthusiasm quickly goes out for many.
But this is how it works everywhere, in every band that wants to work seriously and achieve something.
Currently, The Tap Tap has twenty members.
How many of them have been there since the beginning, since 1998?
Only one: L<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8F>a Angelovi<0xC4><0x8D>.
We're an open group. People come and go. You can't stop that.
Who has the will and the desire to participate, is always welcome with us.
Takes place the day before the predicted end of the world, Thursday the 20.12.2012 at 9 pm
Venues are: Incheba Arena/Prague, Fléda/Brno and Plynojem/Ostrava; 12 Czech bands and other musicians
All three venues will be connected to each other via live circuit and there will be a joint interpretation of the anthem "Destiny Falls Out" by the band The Tap Tap.
The aim of the concert is to raise the funds for the equipping of a multifunctional disability-friendly educational center, which will be built under the name STUDEO at the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute in Prague.
Admission costs 400 CZK, children up to 12 years old are free of charge, tickets are available in advance at Bohemiaticket.
Poland and space.
Last week, Poland became the 20th member of the European Space Agency (ESA) at a meeting of the Council of Ministers, making it the second member country from the former Eastern Bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became ESA member on 12 November 2008).
Poland began a close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and participated in several ESA projects in the following years.
Poland’s way into space, of course, began much earlier.
Even before the Second World War, Polish cosmos enthusiasts were engaged in space travel, although they did not always come across understanding.
I recall, for example, the lecture by A. <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld of 6 December 1933 at the Warsaw Observatory, at which the author presented thoughts from his pioneering work "Entry to Cosmonautics".
However, the ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) left the audience cold, and after years, <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld still remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski had shown interest in his work.
<0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld won the Prix REP-Hirsch, donated by Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch, in 1934 for "Entgang zur Kosmonautik".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899-1966) later became an important advocate of astronomy and space travel.
In Polish journals he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski’s globally recognized contribution to the development of space travel has been recognized, among other things, by the fact that one of the craters on the moon’s remote side is named after him.
Already in 1925, a railway draisine was built in Poland, for which a rocket drive was planned.
Unfortunately, the author of the draft and the details of this project remained unknown.
It is not even clear whether the rocket should be used to start or to brake the draisine.
The information on this comes exclusively from the contemporary press.
In 1933, the Polish infantry began to deal with rocket-powered missiles.
The research was conducted by the Kom<0xC3><0xB3>rka Techniki Uzbrojenia Institute in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi.
From the documents handed down, it can be seen that the research had progressed to the stage of practical tests.
Research was then interrupted by the invasion of the German Wehrmacht.
In 1937, a draft of a photoelectric hunting missile by Ing. Rohozi<0xC5><0x84>ski appeared in the trade press, and the following year the work "Rakieta - torpedoa powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" by the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocky appeared.
Both projects dealt with the military use of rocket propulsion.
Shortly before the war, all projects for the military use of missile technology were coordinated by the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy).
The committee was established in 1937, but after two years of activity, its work was terminated from the beginning of the war.
Other articles on space travel appeared after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Space Agency (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne) in the Polish press.
The first mention of this society is made in 1954 in the November issue of the magazine Problemy, in which four extensive articles are devoted to space travel.
The article by Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal for the establishment of a space company.
At that time, there were already the first projects on satellite technology, and it was foreseeable that the exploration of space would have a future.
From its beginnings in 1956, the Polish Space Agency (PTA) sought to join the International Federation for Space, founded in 1951, and in fact, the PTA became a full member in the autumn of 1956.
The following year, the first PTA Chairman, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became Deputy Chairman of the International Federation for Space.
He held this office until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA has been instrumental in the development of the highly successful meteorological rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish rocket for scientific research.
The first type, the RM-1, was completed in 1957, the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
The rocket with a maximum altitude of 1800 m was about 80 cm long and did not weigh quite 5 kg.
Later, an improved version, the RM-1A, was built, and in 1959, in the B<0xC5><0x82><0xC4><0x99>d<0xC3><0xB3>w Desert, flight tests began with the two-stage RM-2 rocket.
The rocket was 1.4 m long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
Another stage of development should already be able to do real scientific work - the RM-34 rocket should reach a flight altitude of up to 14.5 km and be used for the observation of high altitude winds.
In 1962, however, further development was discontinued.
The first RM-type rockets were succeeded by the Meteor 1 rocket, which was developed between 1962 and 1965.
The rocket was designed as a two-stage rocket, its total length was 510 cm and the take-off weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types of this rocket were developed (Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which differed from each other in the size of the transport space for scientific instruments.
The Meteor 1A rocket had a transport space with a capacity of 0.4 liters, Meteor 1B over 0.34 liters and Meteor 1C over 0.62 liters.
The maximum altitude of all three types was 37 km.
From 1965 to 1968, the Aeronautical Institute developed the Meteor 2 rocket, the first flight tests of which began in October 1970.
Meteor-2 had a take-off weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a payload of 10 kg to an altitude of about 60 km.
After that, the versions Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 were built.
It is also worth mentioning Poland's accession to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960, which was followed two years later by the creation of a national COSPAR committee.
Poland also participated in space exploration with Soviet satellites as part of the Intercosmos program, and in 1978, Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after the Czech Vladim<0xC3><0xAD>r Remek.
The repeal of the law on charitable works is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court repealed the Law on Non-Profit Work.
This decision sparked a lively public debate.
It is certainly interesting to look at the issue from a broader perspective.
The liberal-oriented economic systems in the EU and in the globalised world are based on the principle of unregulated economic competition.
In the end, this means that the individual economies are in permanent conflict with each other.
The reason for this is the principle of free trade and the free, unrestricted movement of private capital, which goes hand in hand with rampant financial speculation.
Due to the large differences in the value of labour (wages), there are price tensions.
This term is to be understood as a condition in which the producer tries to compete economically by importing favourable goods, by "undercutting" the competition in order to capture a greater market share and increase its profit.
On a large scale, this means for most companies to move their production abroad or buy cheaply, or to give up their business. The result is high unemployment in countries with comparable high labour costs.
Since private capital bears no social responsibility and thus no responsibility for the unemployment it causes, government spending necessarily increases.
This situation is aggravated by the fact that the gentlemen entrepreneurs are absolutely unwilling to pay their taxes and thereby compensate for the social and economic damage caused by them as a whole.
This situation is well known, so that concrete statistics are superfluous at this point.
The ruthless practice of private capital creates a situation in the individual economies in which governments are forced to compete with each other in order to artificially lower the social level of their own population and thus attract foreign capital into the country.
In other words, governments deliver their own population to private capital regardless of the social consequences.
This is reflected in particular in changes to applicable laws.
The aim of these measures is to force the own population to accept the dictates of private capital, especially in the wage sector.
This is done, on the one hand, by economic coercion in the case of long-term unemployment, and, on the other hand, by the curtailment of workers' rights.
The result is growing poverty, as well as ever greater differences between rich and poor.
In Germany, there have been public food delivery points for the poor for several years, who are no longer able to feed themselves through their own work.
The number of people affected is already in the millions.
In the course of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, there are regularly cases in which employees receive such a low wage that the state must increase their income to the minimum subsistence level.
Such a scandal was also uncovered in the case of aid workers employed in the German Bundestag.
The austerity measures of virtually all EU southern states will no doubt amount to the same condition in which people are forced to emigrate (as was the case in the 19th century) under the pressure of a catastrophic fall in their social level, or to starve for a hunger wage on the margins of society, hoping that eventually private investment capital will flow into the country.
This naturally raises the question of where this capital comes from?
If it comes from another EU country, only poverty migrates from one country to another; or the capital remains the same, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco or Egypt or Africa in general, the employees work for a fraction of the European wages.
This applies to the whole of Latin America.
Liberal theories and the media claim, to the point of exasperation, that the state cannot participate with capital in its own economy, and that the planned economy leads to economic disaster.
Private capital insists narrowly on its position that the state must not intervene in the economy.
But then one has to ask oneself whether private capital does not influence or even direct politics and thus the entire state in its own selfish sense.
Here is the clear answer: Yes.
The proof of this is the existence of a virtually all-powerful lobby that is omnipresent in all states.
The result is a desperate situation in the field of corruption, mutual preference, legislation in which virtually everything is criminal, but nothing is punishable.
In Germany, the situation is such that, due to a lack of finances, a state ministry commissions private legal companies closely intertwined with industry with the drafting of bills.
These bills will then be passed in the Bundestag.
All violence then no longer emanates from the people, as the Western constitutions proclaim, but from strong financial groups that prefer their own interests.
Obviously, the liberal democracies are rapidly falling into a situation, as Appian describes in his work on the crisis of the Roman Republic in the time of Caesar and Pompey: "The state had long been in disrepair, and the offices were occupied by force.
Against bribes, by unlawful extortion of advantages or with stone and sword.
Corruption grew unrestrained, and the people went to the election with votes already bought" ... "People of character did not apply for office, so that the state did not have a consul for eight months as a result of this decline" ... "One really began to talk about that the only medicine in this difficult situation is a strong democracy, and that then a strong man must be elected permanently"...
As it turns out, today’s society, as in ancient times, is based on the reckless preference of one’s own advantage, without paying attention to the interests of society as a whole.
Private capital is by its very nature incapable of recognizing and enforcing the advantage for society as a whole.
The result, as it did then, is an unprecedented decadence of the elites who are not in the least interested in deeper reforms.
The cause of the rise of fascism and communism must therefore be sought in the ruthless liberalization of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
From today’s point of view, the demise of these regimes in favour of liberal democracies can be seen as a certain pause at which the next round is already looming.
Particularly catastrophic is the fact that today’s elites are in complete ignorance of the potential future loss of hundreds of thousands of lives, the humanitarian and social disasters to which we are already witnessing today, as well as the crimes against humanity as we know them from older and more recent history.
The repeal of the law on charitable works is not a solution here, at least not a permanent one.
Under pressure from global and European economic competition, the Czech Republic will be forced to continue looking for ways to push down the social level of the population.
This trend is systemic.
The only solution is targeted political-social reforms, which increase the state’s participation in the economy, increase the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society in favor of the state.
Israel: Laboratory of Chaos.
"...that nothing arises out of violence, or could ever arise" sings Sting in the song Fragile, whose most important verse in the chorus is "...so that we do not forget how fragile we are" .
“If my sons did not want wars, there would be none,” says the dying Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in 1849.
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, there were, as always, a myriad of reactions.
Some stand behind Israel and argue with its right to self-defense, while others call the Palestinians terrorists; others support the Palestinians, argue with the racism of the Israeli state, with the genocide perpetrated on the Palestinian Arabs, and call the state of Israel terrorist.
I do not want to write at this point about who is guilty and who is the victim in these recurring waves of killing; ultimately, the present inhabitants of Israel, including the self-governing areas, were born into the current political situation and did not experience the beginning of the violence itself.
It is my aim to give readers a behind-the-scenes look at who the 95 years of tension (counting from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in the small country in the Middle East are especially useful for.
My thoughts are partly based on accessible historical facts, others are derived from these and emerge from my own understanding of who or which group of people significantly influences the events of modern history.
The history of mankind is first and foremost a history of the struggle for power.
In every epoch we can make out an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is less obvious is the question of whether it was really always these personalities themselves who determined their steps autonomously, or whether behind their throne stood someone who directed their actions toward a predetermined goal.
We must admit that we live in a time when the wealth of the world is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals, and that this concentration of money and the resulting power has not arisen within the lifespan of a generation.
Among these astronomically rich families, one particularly stands out, which could be called the head of the octopus (I don’t know if anyone else stands above them, but I don’t rule this out) – the Rothschilds.
Not much is written about them.
Understandably.
The first press agency (Reuters) was bought by the Rothschilds as early as the 90s of the 19th century, in order to prevent the connection of their name with highly criminal acts, in the background of which always stood the consolidation of their power, the increase of their wealth or both.
The Rothschilds are involved in almost all the central banks of the world, and against the countries where they are not involved in the central banks, they wage wars or prepare for them (before the invasion of Afghanistan there were 7 countries, after the invasion of Iraq there were 5 countries, after the fall of Gaddafi there were only four, Russia in the meantime has subordinated its central bank to the Russian government).
Whoever tried to oppose this family had to pay with their lives.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of Rothschild’s Bank of America as a central bank, began issuing his own (i.e. state) banknotes during the Civil War, and was murdered in a theater in 1865.
J.F. Kennedy began issuing his own banknotes and wanted to abolish the Fed – he was assassinated in 1963; MP Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the Fed for triggering the Great Depression in 1929.
In the years 1859-1871, the Rothschilds’ global lust for power led to the formulation of a plan to unleash three world wars by Albert Pik, a Freemason of the 33rd and thus highest degree of knowledge.
The first war had the aim of eliminating the great monarchist states of Europe, the second war was in particular to break the colonial rule of Great Britain, and the third war is to reduce the world population to about 0.5 - 1 billion people (such a number would provide for their comforts and their luxury and would also not consume so many resources), create a universal religion (ecumenism here is nothing more than the apron) and finally to the takeover of absolute power.
The method by which the group of the richest families works with the Rothschilds at the top is to trigger a crisis and then offer a solution (order ab chao - order out of chaos).
However, these solutions are wrong and always lead to an exacerbation of the situation (see founding of the Fed, so that crises like the one they triggered in 1907 do not repeat).
After they succeeded to trigger World War I by the murder of the Habsburg heir to the throne Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed the Russian tsarist empire by the revolution of the Bolsheviks.
The First World War ended with the sudden, militarily and economically unfounded capitulation of Germany (the war was no longer necessary for the destruction of the Russian tsarist empire), followed by the dissolution of the Central European great power of Austria-Hungary.
In order to make the Second World War easier to ignite, the bankers also let politics create a latent conflict situation by subjecting Germany to gigantic war reparations; thereby they created the condition of impoverished masses, so that they had to cheer the Germans only a sufficiently strong leader, who named the guilty and offered simple solutions; another factor was the creation of a multi-ethnic state Czechoslovakia, a strong minority, and a strong factor in the creation of a multi-ethnic state Czechoslovakia.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds initiated the founding of the Zionist movement, in which a branch sought to establish a Jewish state, if possible in the historical territory of Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The aforementioned Balfour Declaration created the conditions for the mass immigration of Jews into Palestine; it led to initial clashes with the resident Arab population.
There were terrorist attacks on both sides.
The Second World War broke out, and whether Hitler broke free from the chain on which the international bankers had initially held him, or whether everything went according to plan, it is difficult to estimate, in any case, the suffering of the European Jews in the concentration camps created the prerequisite for the recognition of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was founded in 1948, and just as the war reparations against Germany prepared the ground for World War II, the proclamation of the State of Israel represents the creation of the focal point for World War III.
If the international bankers succeed in unleashing this war, the Jewish people will, like in the Second World War, become victims in the front line of battle, this time together with the Arab or Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of strife and chaos, not only in the country itself, but also internationally (just think how sharply the people divide into supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is the culprit and who is the victim in the conflict between Palestinians and Israelis, where injustice only triggers injustice in an endless spiral of violence, starting with the greed of individuals and their pursuit of global power?
It is necessary to distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and their leaders, since the international bankers in Israel, as well as in our country, the people, exclusively put their own candidates to the vote.
The current prime minister of Israel, the falcon Netanyahu, is a typical example of a politician prone to fascism, loyal to the international bankers, who is doing everything in his power to ignite a war with Iran, which in the face of Iran’s membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), could quickly lead to a global conflict, which could lead to a global catastrophe, and in which, due to Iran’s control of only 2 miles of the world, the Strait of the world.
As David Rockefeller said in 1994, “The only thing we need is an all-encompassing crisis, and people will welcome the new world order.”
In their conception, the New World Order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the human population serves a small group of financial aristocrats.
A world in which every newborn is implanted with a chip at birth to subject this being to total control.
And he causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to be given a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads, that no one may buy or sell, except he that has the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.
Here is wisdom: let him that hath understanding consider the number of the beast.
For it is the number of a man, and his number is six hundred and sixty-six.”
The film Argo: When it's worst to call Hollywood
In November 1979, a mob of protesting Islamist students occupied the U.S. embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
For their release, they demanded the extradition of the toppled Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who had fled to the US after the revolution, who had been patronizing his regime for decades.
For the American government, there was no positive way out of this situation - it could not afford to throw the Shah overboard, as this would have massively damaged the trust of its allies in other countries.
At the same time, it was unable to enforce the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution resulted in the establishment of a theocratic regime.
It was a severe blow to the reputation of the United States, and the subsequent fiasco in the violent attempt to liberate hostages only made things worse.
The captured diplomats were finally released after 444 days, after negotiations had been brokered by the Algerian government.
The fate of the hostages caused a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiments at home.
The debacle in Iran contributed significantly to the defeat of Jimmy Carter against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film Argo by director and actor Ben Affleck describes an episode of this story that gave the US a small partial victory.
Immediately before the occupation of the embassy, six embassy employees managed to escape.
This ended after numerous complications in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
The CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities, succeeded in bringing the refugees out of Iran, helping them with an extravagant story to cover up their true identity – they traveled with Canadian passports disguised as members of a film staff who allegedly visited locations in the country for a science fiction film.
Combination of genres
The plan, developed by exfiltration expert Tony Mendez, also necessitated Hollywood’s cooperation.
For the camouflage to be credible, articles about this film project appeared in trade journals, press conferences were held, and the fictional production company had a real office.
The details of this operation have been kept secret for a long time. The film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck's film is a special combination of several film genres.
On the one hand, he is a realistic political thriller, but at the same time a so-called "Caper Movie", i.e. the story of a successful hussars piece such as the film Ocean's Eleven.
As a result, the mood levels alternate in the film - on the one hand the documentary scenes from Tehran (in the title sequence iconic contemporary photographs are shown, and also in the film version of the same situations there are no major differences).
On the other hand, the loose passages from Hollywood, which are ironic and slightly exaggerated.
And then there are the scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions - men in suits at the meeting table, in the hallways, on the phone...
Ben Affleck has made a remarkable new start to his career with this film.
A ridiculed actor has become a respectable director, and even as an actor, he is no longer the target of ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film after the thriller No Child's Play (Gone Baby Gone, 2007) and the thriller City Without Mercy (2010).
At the same time, it is Affleck’s first film not set in the director’s native Boston.
The sense of the atmosphere of the place was one of the characteristics that set this director’s previous films apart from the standard of Hollywood.
Affleck, however, also proves this sense in Argo, where Tehran is "played" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film take place in the streets and show the reconstruction of events that have really taken place - the opening sequence of the storming of the message is very impressive in its clarity, and yet conveys the feeling of confusion and unpredictability that occurs when history moves somewhere.
Affleck and his team also achieve a similar effect in fictional scenes (the false film staff at a bazaar in Tehran).
Too much action in too many places
The director also had to deal with the fact that the story actually does not offer many exciting scenes in the filmic sense.
However, he works quite successfully with the few, sometimes helping the reality somewhat - which then does not always seem so elegant (the scenes in which the impending crisis at the airport in Tehran is averted by a phone call in America, or even the chase on the runway, seem somewhat contrived).
The weakness of Argo is its all-too-wide spread, which is due to the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in their roles as Hollywood employees, but their characters would have earned more space, and thus they are far from alone in the film.
As a result, Affleck’s film loses some traction, and it is a film that can be followed with a certain amount of interest, while at the same time gauging the design and the retro style reminiscent of a thriller from the 70s.
However, it is difficult to arouse enthusiasm.
However, it is sufficient as a reminder of a piece of history that is still alive to this day in a certain way and as proof of how exaggerated the ideas of the all-powerful and all-knowing secret services are.
Guidelines for inflating balloons, bananas and circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which annually announces a survey about the most absurd bank fees, has this year decided to organize the competition "Absurdest regulation or idea from the EU workshop".
“This was the idea behind the EU’s recent plan to introduce a 40% female quota in the management of large European companies,” Patrik Nacher, who is responsible for organizing the survey, told Pr<0xC3><0xA1>vo newspaper.
Among the nominated absurdities is, for example, the judgment of the European Court of Justice on the standardisation of insurance rates for men and women.
Until then, women enjoyed an advantage in life insurance because they objectively represented a lower risk to the insurance companies.
"Further incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The actual vote will then take place until the end of February 2013," said Nacher.
Controversial EU regulations include the mandatory addition of bioethanol to fuels, which in turn is harmful to nature, the ban on reliable mercury thermometers simply because they contain a relatively small amount of this dangerous substance, and the directive on the size of chicken cages, which made eggs much more expensive this year.
In the past, criticism also reaped the de facto ban on the use of the term "butter spread" or the ban on the sale of conventional light bulbs.
Bananas must be 14 cm long
The EU apparatus often decides under the pressure of this or that lobby from trade and industry, whose demands in Brussels are usually represented by one or more member countries (for example, the Czech Republic is currently trying to enforce the demands of Czech banks with a veto threat).
Lobbying interests were also behind the fact that bananas of the highest commercial class in the EU must be at least 14 cm long and must not have a "curvature anomaly".
The European Commission defended itself by arguing that it was merely harmonising the inconsistent national standards that would hinder trade.
The standards on fruit and vegetables have already been softened by the EU against the resistance of some countries with the indication that the previous directives would lead to a waste of food.
A candidate for victory in this survey may be the EU regulation of last year, which according to balloons on sale must be provided with the indication that children under eight years of age are not allowed to inflate the balloon without the supervision of an adult.
The EU cited an American study, which balloons say is the leading cause of suffocation in children.
A similar restriction already applies to children up to 14 years of age when using fairground fleas.
Curious ideas are also available at home
A directive that concerns European officials themselves is also relatively absurd - anyone who plays an official role in the EU is not allowed to use the name Macedonia because of the sensitivity of the issue to Greece and must instead say FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The server Bankovn<0xC3><0xAD>poplatky.com nominated in cooperation with the Association of Liberal Economists Laissez Faire in addition to the above-mentioned absurdities also the EU regulation on the extent of food stocks in the territory of a member country.
The EU set the maximum food stocks allowed to be on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the EU.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the fixed volume for canned mushrooms, for which we threatened a high fine.
The organizers of the survey were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive money for not having a sea, or by the idea of giving subsidies for applications for subsidies.
These ideas, of course, did not come from Brussels, but from Prague.
"We are disadvantaged by the fact that we do not have a sea.
We will apply for a refund to the EU," said then Agriculture Minister Jaroslav Palas (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) in autumn 2004.
As an argument, he argued that the grain harvest was very high and that the state warehouses were overcrowded as a result of the so-called intervention purchases.
Since the Czech Republic has another route to seaports, the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros, according to Palas.
The European Commission finally met the Czech Republic to the extent that it organised an invitation to tender for the purchase of cereals from countries that do not have access to the sea.
Funding for applications for funding was offered to the municipalities by the Ministry of Regional Development under the direction of Minister Pavel N<0xC4><0x9B>mec (US-DEU), specifically with regard to funding for the preparation of applications for funding to Brussels.
EU: Bizarre regulations are the exception
While regulations are easily the target of criticism in the member states, the EU's efforts to regulate and thus also to ensure the effectiveness and development of the entire European Union are, in the opinion of some experts, rather worthy of recognition.
According to these experts, a more serious problem is rather the EU funding for projects that have nothing at all in common with the deepening of European integration, but which were forced by individual member states in the budget negotiations.
Emotions are also evoked in this country by the fact that the Czech Republic, like other member countries in Brussels, has to fight for the right to use specific names of traditional products and does not always win this fight.
Although the Czech Republic was able to defend the name "Olomoucké tvar<0xC5><0xAF><0xC5><0xBE>ky" after a six-year battle with Germany and Austria, the Inl<0xC3><0xA4>nderrum (Tuzemsk<0xC3><0xBD> rum), whose tradition reaches back to the 19th century, our manufacturers had to rename it "Tuzem<0xC3><0xA1>k".
The term rum may only be used for products of sugar cane distillate, not for products of sugar beet.
In the official list of products registered in the EU, the company of the world-famous cheeses Feta and Gorgonzola, the Marzipan of Lübeck or the Parma ham now also includes the Carlsbad Zwieback, carp from Poho<0xC5><0x99>elice and T<0xC5><0x99>ebo<0xC5><0x88>, or the Saaz hops.
The Pardubicer gingerbread or the Ho<0xC5><0x99>icer rolls can boast of an EU brand.
"People want me to save the Republic, but I'm just an amateur," claims Okamura.
Senator, how do you come up with the idea of running for president?
I'm not interested in being a senator or president.
If everything in our country worked without any problems, I wouldn’t be running anywhere.
But I can no longer watch the Republic being looted for 20 years, as thieves run free, while people’s taxes and retirement ages are being raised.
I had no ambition to become a politician.
But when I see something I don’t like, I try to suggest a solution to change it.
And since I'm already over 40, and I'm independent and non-partisan, I have no other way of influencing things than to run for the office of a senator or president.
You made it to the Senate and then immediately made your way to the castle.
Do they not turn their backs on their constituents?
I've been telling myself all along that I'm going to take up the fight for the castle after the results of the Senate elections.
Later, I specified this and said that I would run for president if I were elected senator.
But my goal is not the function. The function is an instrument with which I can realize my visions.
For this, I need as much influence as possible and a mandate that is as strong as possible.
The difficulty, however, is not only that we as a people scold in the pub and in front of the TV, but that we kill anyone who wants to change something.
In addition, there are the media who want to rob you of honor and confuse the freedom of the word with the freedom to lie.
For example, it was said about me that I would bribe journalists or that I was an advisor to Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Paroubek.
Let’s talk about your visions.
You have taken up the fight for the castle with the thesis of the material and criminal liability of politicians as well as with retrospective declarations of assets over 20 million crowns.
To do this, you need to change laws.
As president, you have no powers in this regard, and only the Senate as a whole can bring in legislative proposals.
How do you want to solve this problem?
As a simple citizen, I worked to ensure that the travel guide remains a free trade, and this could be enforced.
The problem is the small-minded politics - if someone comes from the right or from the left with a good proposal, it is deliberately rejected, and that only stops the population.
As an independent non-partisan, I have far greater potential to gain support from all parties represented in Parliament.
My advantage is that I can take away from any party what is best for our country, without any box-thinking and party dogmas.
Do you see yourself as a person in politics rather on the right or the left?
From a Czech point of view, it seems to me that people tend to see me on the left.
For me, this right-left thinking is completely unimportant.
For me, it is important that we move forward.
It is not a question of whether someone belongs to the left or the right camp; I want to unite people.
I always publicly support any good solution, even if it comes from KS<0xC4><0x8C>M or ODS, and I will also oppose bad ideas.
You don't like it when someone calls you a populist.
But don't you confirm that by what you just said?
When you create a business plan in a company, you also have an ideal goal and a vision.
And they want to get closer to that.
You can call this populism because of me, but all the proposals I have spoken about are already working in the world, or they have been discussed by important experts.
But without support in Parliament, you are left with nothing but buzzwords.
And you won’t get far in politics in the long run.
Or do you think that if you only talk to people long enough, you will succeed, for example, in enforcing material and criminal liability?
I have no other choice.
Convince politicians, journalists and the public and try to bring them to our side to enforce these goals.
As President, it would not be a problem for me to ask the leaders of the parliamentary parties live on television to enshrine the substantive and criminal liability for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors.
And those who have spoken to them will have to say why they refuse to do so.
A strong personality that points to grievances can put pressure on the political scene.
Take only once the direct election of the president, which was a merit of public pressure.
I say quite clearly that I am an amateur; I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
I try to find allies for my views and visions.
I have just started politics and am trying to find the support of the majority for my programme.
I always try to judge things myself; and if it doesn’t work out, then I’ll go back to the private sector in six years.
That sounds a bit like Okamura was supposed to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a saviour.
I know that I alone am not achieving anything; therefore I have spoken to several well-known personalities about whether they would like to run for the Senate as well.
I spoke with Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, for example, but he refused because of work overload.
I also supported investigative journalist Jana Lorencov<0xC3><0xA1>, who exposed the fraud in the light fuel oil trade.
I began my candidacy on the premise that people are deeply unhappy, but now I am not sure.
Sixty percent of eligible voters did not go to the polls at all, and those who went mostly elected representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate, we are just two independents.
People have chosen such a Senate composition that changes will be very difficult to enforce.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my visions, e.g. for the direct election of the mayors and district governors.
Are you thinking about starting your own party?
I haven’t thought about that yet, because I don’t have time to check the past of every potential party member, and I don’t even have the money for it.
I don’t even have money for the presidential campaign; in my transparent account there are only 20,000 CZK.
You have no money?
You talk about declarations of assets, what would yours look like?
I estimate my personal wealth at about CZK 60 million.
In Prague I have a plot of land worth 25 million, an apartment worth about 10 million, another one for 8 million, an art collection worth about 10 million, an Aston Martin worth 3.5 million and a <0xC5><0xA0>kodu Superb worth about a million. And then I have a few more million in my account.
The Aston Martin was a childhood dream by the way - James Bond always liked how he drove in the car, was gallant to women and at the same time fought against evil.
You drive an Aston Martin, have a net worth of 60 million and have no money for your campaign?
You say you want to change the Republic, but you don’t want to invest your own money in it.
That's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Should I go into debt?
I've already put $2.5 million into the campaign.
The fact that I don’t have sponsors shows that my program probably doesn’t arouse too much interest.
And I am not obliged to contest the campaign from my own resources.
The cost of the campaign is basically covered by my salary as a senator.
But I could not live on the senator's salary alone; so, for example, I could not finance my son's English school, which costs 30,000 a month.
If I just wanted to make money, I wouldn't run for anything.
So, do you continue to work as an entrepreneur to have your livelihood?
Didn't you say you're going to reverse these activities?
But that's not related to the amount of salary.
As promised, I have partially cut back on my activities.
For example, my deputy will be managing director of the travel agency in the spring.
People want to see me as a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
But I also have to live on something.
What monthly income were you used to as an entrepreneur?
About 200,000 to 400,000, and that continues to be the case.
As president, however, I would completely cease my activities.
The full interview can be found in the Saturday edition of Pr<0xC3><0xA1>vo.
The MVRDV architects prove that the real adventures are not just in the head - using the example of Spijkenisse and the recently built Bücherberg - 2 photos
"I find the building funny, it looks futuristic, and finally there is something interesting to see again," says Lisette Verhaig, a passer-by at the roadside.
And Stefan Spermon, an IT technician in a nearby large company, says: "Yes, it's beautiful, the house."
But I wonder why we still need a library today.
All have internet, iPad and e-books.
No one goes to one of these old-style libraries voluntarily today, right?
Spijkenisse, a sleepy city that hardly needs a visit at the gates of Rotterdam, is a curious record holder.
The 80,000-strong community has the lowest education rate in the Netherlands.
In order to counteract this stupid circumstance, it was decided a few years ago to contribute to general education and to recreate the seven fictitious bridges depicted on the euro notes as nicely painted reinforced concrete miniatures.
The success of the educational offensive was limited.
And so the city fathers realized that there was only one way to master statistics: a library had to come here!
Winy Maas from the Rotterdam architecture firm MVRDV, master of the foolhardy bar charts and producer of funny, often cynical buildings, took the matter with familiar composure and appeared for the competition hearing in 2003 with five books under his arm and a grin on his face.
And while the jury looked around in amazement and shrugged its shoulders, the cheeky Maas piled his exquisite souvenirs in size to a pyramid and finished his actionist-backed speech with the words: "Dear Stadtgemeinde!"
So this is it, my proposal for the Book Mountain of Spijkenisse, for the so-called Book Mountain!
Nine years later, the 30 million euro mountain has been raised.
It is part of a revitalization project that also includes underground parking, supermarket, post office and a few adjacent residential and townhouses with a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, the Bücherberg was awarded the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
The project has also been nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
Thus, the faceless small-town retorts, which up to now had nothing more to offer than a postmodern pedestrian street and a stunnedly ugly town hall, behind whose white facades one would be inclined to suspect a dairy factory, to enrich a piece of contemporary architecture.
But above all, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in the history of its existence.
The long road to the book
The first impression: book Eldorado under cheese bell.
Although there is a lift that leads through the middle of the mountain massif, the true joys of space and reading are revealed when climbing the topography on foot.
The all-glass interior is bright and clear, the burnt clinker floor and the elegant street lamps speak the language of a public city square.
The urban environment is perfect.
You are already looking for park bench, dog and football-playing boys and girls.
And everywhere books, books, books.
“Usually, the bookshelves are placed along the facade, and in the middle is a large, dark room, which is usually uncomfortable and impersonal,” says Winy Maas.
We turned the classic room configuration upside down and turned the reading area from the inside out.
The interior of the Buchenberg is cleverly used: in the middle are offices, internet library, chess club, environmental center and building technology center.
A special pleasure are the black bookshelves, which are sometimes wall cladding, sometimes parapet, sometimes railings.
Optics, haptics and smell are foreign.
Even die-hard architects and civil engineers shake their heads at the unknown building material.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials here," explains Joop Trouborst, project manager at the municipality of Spijkenisse, at the request of the standard.
And so we came across a suitable waste product from agriculture one day in a Friesland farm.
For many years, a millimetre-thin plastic fleece has been used as a root pad in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands.
This is cheap and time efficient.
The thin textile lasts one or two seasons, after which it is ready for bulky waste.
For the library, the fleece was pressed - for the first time in these quantities - into four-centimeter-thick plates.
Under the influence of heat and pressure, the so-called agricultural plastic (KLP) turns into a dark, homogeneous, load-bearing material that smells like a new car and a sports shoe.
After 105 steps you reach the summit.
At the end of the almost 500 meter long hike, the Literature Café not only offers a fantastic view of the city, but also rewards you with Dutch croquettes and potted ficus trees.
They provide an atmosphere, but above all the right humidity in the literature mountains.
Donations for the New Soul
“You wouldn’t believe it, but this house is a showcase project in terms of ecology, despite the many glass surfaces,” says Trouborst.
It is heated and cooled with geothermal heat.
Although the Buchenberg is under a glass lintel, the sun shines only briefly inside on sunny days.
The wide wooden glue binders, which are transverse to the glass fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade, serve as shading and absorb a large part of the sunlight.
The room climate is very pleasant.
The rest is done by fully automatic blinds.
Stefan Spermon, the initial skeptic from the IT industry, already ventured into the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was already there.
And also the TCM teacher Cynthia Bogarde, who even describes Boekenberg as Spijkenisse's "long overdue soul".
The reason: At the opening a few weeks ago, each resident was invited to donate a book from his personal holdings.
For the time being, this is intended to fill the optical gaps in the not yet fully equipped library - currently 70,000 pieces.
The concept has taken off.
The shelves are filled to the top.
“Nothing is worse than a half-empty library,” says architect Winy Maas.
"I think, thanks to our invitation, every resident now has a certain relationship with this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
And if it's just for decoration.
In this way, MVRDV has succeeded in achieving the supreme discipline that is called the Identity Foundation in technical jargon.
Spijkenisse has written literary history.
As young and uneducated as she may be.
This is finally a starting point for identity.
Szabo: "Germans must play a bigger role"
Germany abstained in the vote on the inclusion of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on US-European relations, Berlin is balancing on a narrow diplomatic level.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany had first signaled that it would vote against the request for an observer status of the Palestinians at the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained.
What's up?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis did in Gaza.
Now, however, Germany has to be careful because of its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I don’t think it supports the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence – but not be too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it came to establishing a no-fly zone.
This was eventually enforced by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on important international issues?
Yeah, that's right.
This is because it is changing its foreign policy away from a policy managed by the US, so to speak, to a German foreign policy.
To make matters worse, Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy.
The Germans, therefore, find themselves between the fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they are still groping for their role, but they are on the way to a more "normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy such as that of France or Great Britain.
What does a "normal" foreign policy mean in concrete terms from the German point of view?
It shows the willingness to take positions on national interests that are independent of those of the US or European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, i.e. by exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany’s economic interests are to a certain extent different from those of the other great powers and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests had an impact on the attitude in the Middle East conflict and the vote in the UN?
On the one hand, Germany has large sales markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf states.
Therefore, it must be careful not to offend the public, but also the elites, in the Arab countries.
That definitely plays a role.
But I wouldn’t want to put too much weight on this either, it’s not a completely one-sided relationship.
But it definitely plays an important role in German considerations.
Has Germany damaged its relations with the US by abstaining from important decisions, such as the vote on Palestine?
I think there is a great understanding of the German position in Europe and even in the USA.
Therefore, I do not believe that this was such a dramatic break as in the Libyan question.
Perhaps Germany will even gain some respect with it.
After all, it signals that as an international player, it must be taken seriously and its interests must be taken into account.
There are different opinions in Europe about the Palestinian initiative.
The United States, on the other hand, has clearly called for a veto.
Are there differences of opinion between the United States and many European nations?
Because of American domestic politics, these differences have always existed.
I believe that the Obama administration secretly has quite a lot of understanding for the European position.
But due to the political situation here, the government cannot publicly take this position.
I believe that the actual differences of opinion are not as great as they always seem.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is not so enthusiastic about Netanyahu’s policies.
Is it difficult for Germany to agree on its close relations with Israel and the US on the one hand, and the position of the main partners in the EU on the other?
I think that’s what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
It would, of course, be a little easier for the Germans if there were a coherent and uniform European policy, which is not the case at present.
So they can’t be part of a broader line and instead have to push things out of their own position.
This is exactly what they are doing with the euro.
I believe that in the future Germany will play a leading role in pushing Europe towards a European position.
Of course, this is not easy for Germany, especially because of its relationship with Israel.
This has always been a sensitive issue.
But I think it is clear to the Germans that they need to play a more independent role.
Does Germany see itself in the role as an important international player - does Germany want to take on a leading role at all?
Or does Germany still find leadership difficult?
Germany is not yet used to it, which is still unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, the country still finds it difficult to play a bigger role.
If we look at the euro crisis, for example, every time Germany assumes a larger role, various anti-German feelings become free.
This does not make it easy for the Germans.
That’s actually the old problem: you don’t want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It must be receptive to various neighbors and opinions and that is not easy.
Now the influence of the US in European politics is steadily decreasing, but the EU is not filling this vacuum at the moment, who else is left?
The Germans will simply have to play a bigger role.
Even if they don’t like it, it makes them uncomfortable and makes them even more unpopular – c’est la vie!

‘Brand Protection’ in China: When Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is a world-renowned brand, as is Polo Ralph Lauren.
What is Armani Polo?
This is a name that is officially registered in China, but has nothing to do with the original companies.
Yet it enjoys protection as long as the actual namesakes do not complain.
And even then, it is not clear if they are right.
“It is becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their trademarks in China,” says Thomas Pattloch, an attorney at Taylor Wessing, a law firm specializing in property rights violations in the Far East.
Every week a new case lands on my desk.
A few additional letters are enough for the imitators to be allowed to register their trademarks.
So Gucci becomes simply Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada you let Prada-Kny enter.
German companies are also legally copied in this way, such as the sporting goods manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens a folder with registrations of the Trademark Office in Beijing.
On 14 September 2010, a Chinese company had the trademark Zegna DF Puma protected, an art name that was also used by the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
It is well known that the Chinese are world champions in copying and in injuring intellectual property.
In the big cities, there are multi-storey department stores that sell almost exclusively counterfeits.
However, Pattloch’s cases are different: on behalf of his clients, he opposes the fact that Chinese companies are officially granted the right by the Trademark Office to use a designation that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Mingpai", a passenger brand.
The word is derived from "Bang Dakuan".
This means women who fish for rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt
"This is business-damaging, you have to fight it," Pattloch demands.
"The brand is watered down, the uniqueness disappears, the image damage is enormous."
The financial failures and the legal costs of the affected industries are in the millions, especially for expensive flagship products.
According to the market research company CLSA, China is the third largest market for luxury goods and the fastest growing, with a volume of 15 billion euros per year.
However, deletions of dubious entries in the trademark register are difficult to reach and go into the money.
The procedure can take up to nine years, with an uncertain outcome.
Pattloch reports on cases in which the court dismissed complaints because, after the long duration, the disputed name had become a "market reality".
If the plaintiff is unlucky, he even has to pay the plagiarist money because he violated his trademark in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes the law of the jungle prevails here.
Famous cases also concern graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal battle with the construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the company that recently took over the German concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
The Chinese are therefore still allowed to use an emblem that resembles the Mercedes star.
The Volvo buyer Geely originally used a blue and white logo reminiscent of BMW; the dispute was settled, Geely had to change it.
The fashion manufacturer Lacoste lost in China against imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore, who made the famous crocodile look the other way.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
The CTMO trademark office in Beijing admits that there were shortages there in 2010 due to insufficient personnel and space.
In the past year, however, people have returned from the “emergency situation in the workflow to normality”.
For example, the number of unprocessed opposition proceedings had fallen by 22 percent.
Nearly 57,000 such cases have been closed, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
Nevertheless, 81,500 appeals are still awaiting execution in the office.
Dealing with it costs a lot
As so often in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year, CTMO received more than 1.4 million trademark applications, almost a third more than in 2010.
This is a record and means that China is leading the list of new applications around the world for the tenth time in a row, the authority says.
This also applies to the stock of all valid trademarks, a total of 5.5 million pieces.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan in fees were collected.
Simplified, this means that each registration costs an average of 1280 yuan or 160 euros.
To tackle this costs a lot, as the case of the German family business Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the company has been fighting against a Chinese plagiarist.
Although the Germans were able to achieve that its illegal manufacture of imitated motor vehicle parts was excavated.
However, the copycat continued to secure Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand.
They themselves have failed to do so, as family names could not be protected in Germany, says Hanno Wentzler, Chairman of the Board of Management of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CTMO trademark office rejected the objection of the Munich authorities.
In the next two instances, Freudenberg got right, but the opponent continues to fight to this day.
You have to be hellishly careful
The matter is now before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident of bringing the matter to a good conclusion and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says, “The procedure is extremely time-consuming and takes a lot of time, money and nerves.”
The internal costs could hardly be quantified, the company archive even had to look through 100-year-old files to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg offered the other side a "high six-digit euro amount" for settlement in vain.
“You can see how much this is worth to us,” Wentzler says.
The dangers in the Far East are even threatening to sweep back to Europe.
That’s when impersonators secure unprotected marks.
For example, a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather.
The Group has long since abandoned this business area, but was nevertheless able to avert registration.
“You have to be careful,” Wentzler says.
Both he and the lawyer Pattloch advise German companies to be very careful when doing business with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark rights, rather the foreigners should "apply everything that is somehow worthy of protection, also in China," as Wentzler says.
This can be much more expensive than registration.
In fact, if Freudenberg was subject to his trademark drama in the last act, then you would probably have to pay the other side royalties for his own name, explains Wentzler.
Or we will be forced out of the market in the segment in question.
World Aids Day: stamping, singing, helping
In Heidelberg, the choir rehearses Imbongi - and in Swaziland, AIDS orphans are happy about it.
The story of a connection that spans far more than 8,733 kilometers.
First there is the pounding: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, women's pumps and men's slippers are looking for the beat on the parquet floor, find it quickly.
One-two-three-four.
Only then do the voices of the singers slowly swell - alto, bass, tenor and soprano - crowd, beguile and chase themselves.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor, almost lifts it out of his fabric shoes when he brings them together with his supple wild gestures.
It is Monday evening, in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the choir Imbongi rehearses a new song.
About fifty singers have come, between 23 and 69 years old, from the human geneticist to the houseman.
"Om'Obani" is not a simple piece, every choral voice has a different text and this also in a very foreign language: Zulu, which is spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in parts of Swaziland.
Help for self-help
There are around 34 million HIV-infected people worldwide, according to Unaids, the United Nations’ HIV/AIDS prevention program.
23.5 million people live in southern Africa.
There are 245,000 AIDS orphans in Swaziland.
More than 40 percent of the population is now HIV-positive.
Voices for Africa has found godparents for 180 orphans in the village of Esitjeni in Germany.
Seventy of them attend secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros a month you can take on a sponsorship.
It guarantees the child school fees, school uniform and a hot meal daily in the Gogo Center.
On Zulu, Imbongi means storyteller or praiser.
The Bantu language fluently can speak in this room no one, but sing.
For almost ten years, the choir has been practicing songs in this foreign soft language and occasionally bringing them back to where they originally came from: to the south of Africa.
Because 8,733 kilometers as the crow flies from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is the village of Esitjeni, which depends on the vocal power of the German choir.
Forty percent are infected
About 2000 people live there, some still in simple clay and straw huts, a large part of which are children.
More than 300 of them no longer have parents because they have succumbed to the HIV virus.
In Esitjeni, the small details of what is causing the disease in Swaziland are revealed: highest HIV infection rate, lowest life expectancy worldwide, according to UNICEF.
Circumcisions of the male foreskin, which have been shown to reduce the risk of infection by half, are hardly accepted by the population.
More than forty percent of people in Swaziland carry the immunodeficiency virus, dying in their mid-thirties is not uncommon.
During a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir discovered the village, but above all, the Imbongis saw many children on the streets, who not only lacked parental care, but simply everything: food, clothing, education.
Without high school, you have no chance in a poor country.
Initially, it was the private commitment of individuals to send a child to school for a few euros a year and to allow him a warm meal a day.
But a year later, the choir founded the association "Voices for Africa", which since then has been taking almost professional care of the AIDS orphans in Esitjeni.
Facts about Sexually Transmitted Infections
What are the main sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial STI includes syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea.
Common viral STIs are HIV, human pappilomaviruses, genital herpes, or hepatitis.
Lice and scabies belong to the parasitic STI.
Who are the main affected groups?
Syphilis and tripper are especially common in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute estimates that at least four out of five of all reported cases of syphilis in Germany are transmitted through sexual contact between men.
In heterosexual adults, chlamydia infections, trichomonads, candidiasis (fungus), trippers, and human pappilomaviruses are common sexually transmitted diseases.
The prevalence of HIV among heterosexual adults in Germany is comparatively low - nevertheless: This group accounts for around 20 percent of new HIV infections.
Among adolescents, chlamydia infections are much more common than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three-quarters of all infections affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25.
In this country, human pappilomaviruses are also common in adolescents.
How has the number of infections developed?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are reported.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections has more than doubled from 1697 in 2001 to 3698 in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has been declining since 2007.
In 2011, there were about 2,700 cases.
That’s about a tenth less than the year before.
What symptoms indicate an STD?
The infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, discomfort during urination, discharge, lower abdominal pain as well as blisters or warts.
However, they often do not cause pain or other symptoms and therefore go unnoticed.
How to protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but they do not provide 100% protection.
In some cases, pathogens from sexually transmitted diseases can also be passed on through smear infections and close physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend regular examinations, especially for frequently changing sex partners.
Early diagnosed, most STI can be cured and late consequences avoided.
Through sponsorships, donations and last but not least the fees that the choir sings all over Germany, a lot comes together.
“Overall, we have already sent around 200,000 euros to Esitjeni,” says Annette Lennartz, the chairman of the association.
In the village itself, Zodwa Dlamini, a self-confident and assertive woman, manages the funds from Germany.
She also makes sure that the orphans are well accommodated, with one of the grandmothers, for example.
The Gogos, as the old women on Zulu are called, are the pillars of the village.
Some of them have taken in up to 14 orphans, giving them a roof over their heads and making sure that the children in their uniforms show up on time for school every day.
Those who have no one left will come to the shelter of Khanyisile, a single woman who is paid just as much by the association as the two cooks who cook for more than 200 hungry children every day.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" has created a sewing school, built two chicken houses and organized together with the American health organization PSI that many in the village have taken an HIV test.
This is not a matter of course, because as obvious as the disease is throughout the country, it is preferable to keep silent.
A king with 14 wives
“AIDS is an absolute taboo,” says Annette Lennartz, “because it has to do with sexuality.”
In a country where the king officially has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
Among other things, it is also due to this state-sanctioned form of life that the HIV virus has spread so quickly in recent decades.
But also the many migrant workers who carry the virus through the country.
There are free condoms on every corner, says Annette Lennartz, “but they’re barely used.
The culture is different - flesh to flesh."
To promote cultural exchange, the Imbongi Choir travels together every two or three years through the south of Africa and sings songs full of melancholy, fighting spirit, confidence and black self-confidence, which many on the southern tip of the black continent still know from apartheid times.
A bus full of white people singing songs in a black language - so much recognition not only brings mood and joy, but has also wreaked some tears on some grim border soldiers.
The journey always leads to Esitjeni, where the singers visit their godchildren.
Even if you can hardly find the small village on maps, in the valley of the Ezulweni River it is more than known.
"Go to Esiteni, there is the light," people there say.
And when you return the 8733 kilometers as the crow flies to Heidelberg, to the stomping singers in the rehearsal room on Bergheimer Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e, then you see it shining there as well.
NASA discovers ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice sheet should possibly be up to 20 meters thick.
The U.S. space agency NASA has proven the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is closest to the sun, there is also frozen water there, according to three studies published in the journal "Science" on Thursday.
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is an ice sheet in the permanently shadowed region of the planet.
This should be at least 30 centimeters and possibly even up to 20 meters thick.
The water probably came from comets or possibly even asteroids that have crashed on Mercury.
No one is linking the discovery of ice to the existence of life on the planet, said messenger probe chief scientist Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help clarify how water and other building blocks of life have reached other areas of the solar system.
Unnoticed by Earth citizens, probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix are exploring the depths of space.
From time to time they send pictures to Earth: small peepholes into infinite expanses.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which orbits the Sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not a "planet" according to the International Astronomical Union's 2006 new definition of the term.
This image from an infrared image taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars can be seen as blue dots, and the pink "new-borns" in the Starry Hall are harder to identify.
This star-forming region — unromantically named W5 by scientists — has been discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the constellation Cassiopeia, at a distance of 6,500 light-years.
This iridescent glow of a dying star has captured NASA’s Spitzer telescope.
The donut-shaped ring is made of material that the star ejected during the dying process.
In the huge Trifid Nebula, 5,400 light-years from Earth, new stars are formed from gas and dust.
NASA’s Spitzer telescope took this photo of the galactic birthing room.
The Pleiadian star cluster, also called "The Seven Sisters", can be seen with the naked eye at night.
With the telescope, however, the colors come into their own.
Like a red age, the helix nebula in this infrared photo looks towards the viewer.
It is located 700 light-years away in the Aquarius constellation.
Its resemblance to an earthly continent earned this nebula the title of North America.
A combination of normal and infrared photo ensures the spectacular color scheme.
This baby star could only be captured in its full beauty by the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope.
Saturn and its rings: how they formed is one of the great mysteries of astronomy.
They may be the remains of a Saturn moon that disappeared without a trace 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the Hubble Telescope's largest and sharpest images: The Whirlpool Galaxy
Depending on the color scheme, images of spiral galaxies become true works of art.
The image, published by the European Southern Observatory, shows the Trifid nebula in the constellation of Sagittarius, which is several thousand light-years away.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word trifidus (divided in three, split in three), as dark streaks of dust divide the glowing heart of the star birth place.
In the constellation of Serpent Bearers, astronomers have photographed the harbinger of a cosmic carambolage: 400 million light-years away from Earth, the cores of two merging galaxies race towards each other and will inevitably collide.
This star birth was recorded by the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
If technical abbreviations do not lie, she may call them by her nickname Southern Fire Wheel.
The Hubble Space Telescope image shows a section of the Iris Nebula in the constellation of Kepheus.
The 1400 light-years distant nebula consists of dust grains that are ten to a hundred times smaller than ordinary house dust.
This image was assembled from optical and X-ray images of various telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes, 430 million light-years from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, picked up the Hubble Space Telescope for NASA.
The larger spiral galaxy is called UGC 1810.
This nebula contains the brightest group of young stars in the Milky Way.
The Sternenwiege always produces new youngsters.
This star cloud, connected to the Rosette Nebula, is also constantly producing new baby stars - 5,000 light-years from Earth.
In this brightly shining galaxy with a small black hole, there is still no dust, only gas.
Researchers suspect that it was only formed shortly after the Big Bang, when hydrogen was predominantly found in the universe.
Our Insights into Space: The Most Important Telescopes
The telescope is said to have been invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608 - even before Galileo Galilei used it a year later for star observation.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have been getting bigger and bigger – and the insights they provide are getting deeper and deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope at Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror, here in the picture, had an average of five meters.
The Large Binocular Telescope is located in Arizona, USA.
It allows views into space via two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior of Gran Telescopio Canarias on the Canary Island of La Palma is huge - the mirror alone comes to 10.4 meters in diameter.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented - to save costs.
Nevertheless, it reaches a diameter of about eleven meters.
Disadvantage of the favorable design: The telescope is fixed in its height angle - and thus limited in its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed in the elevation angle.
Its special feature: the high light collecting power.
This is because, despite a comparatively small mirror diameter, it is close to that of the world's largest mirror telescopes.
With the help of a radio telescope in Arecibo (Puerto Rico), researchers listen to the universe for extraterrestrial signals.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
With the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI), every computer owner can help by providing computing power.
View of the observatory of the European Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope - which lives up to its name.
With its total of four mirrors, the telescope can also illuminate the mid-infrared spectrum.
The European Extremely Large Telescope is also planned at ESO’s Chilean Observatory.
Its main mirror will be a whopping 42 metres long and will be assembled from almost 1,000 mirror elements.
However, images are to be expected at the earliest in 2018.
Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
They offer two mirrors with an average of ten meters each.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which, in addition to them, looks into the sky with the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF.
On Mauna Kea, too, a new, huge telescope is to be created - with a mirror average of thirty meters.
Here it is to be admired on an illustration.
However, the most important impressions from space are provided by the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, it has been providing images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been looking for extrasolar planets, primarily those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011, NASA announced that 1,235 planetary candidates had been identified since the mission began.
The last preparations for the launch of the Kepler space telescope are documented in the image.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be launched into space in 2018 on board an Ariane5 rocket at the earliest.
The primary mirror of the space infrared telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope is to search for light from the first stars and galaxies after the Big Bang.
Scientists believe that ice also exists at the south pole of Mercury.
However, there is no reliable data for this, as the messenger orbits far closer to the North Pole around the planet.
Radar measurements have suggested for decades that there is ice on Mercury.
With the Messenger probe launched in 2004 - the first to orbit Mercury - the scientists now have certainty.
Drink butter every day - and live to be 168 years old
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach a biblically old age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A search for traces in the country, where 97-year-olds are still comparatively young.
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach a biblically old age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A search for traces in the country, where 97-year-olds are still comparatively young.
The drive through the Talysh Mountains is wildly romantic.
The minibus rumbles along the winding road, past densely wooded hills, rushing rivers and simple farmhouses.
Everything is green and juicy, you might think you are in the Black Forest.
But this is the deepest south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
Here lives the Caucasian ethnic group of the Talysh, of which not much is known, except that it speaks perfectly Persian as well as Azeri and is very durable.
The final destination is Lerik.
The small town shows off its massive architecture from Soviet times, which does not want to fit into the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe hardly come here, the arrival of Azerbaijan’s capital Baku is too difficult.
For the 323 kilometers it takes eight hours, because the road is only one lane.
The fabulous wealth that the country owes to its oil in the Caspian Sea has not yet arrived here in the province.
But Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has what it takes to be a tourist attraction.
“Baku became famous in May with the Eurovision Song Festival – and next year we have a festival of the oldest people in the world,” says Fatulayeva.
She is the director of the Museum of Longevity, probably the only one in the world.
Here is the vita of about eight dozen Talysh from the area documented, older than 100. Fatulayeva points to a black and white photo.
This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
At the age of 136, a child was conceived.
But the controversial star of the museum is the shepherd <0xC5><0x9E>irali Müslümov, who is said to have reached the age of 168.
There is no birth certificate.
And in the face of the oldest documented man, who turned 122 years old, Müslümov’s age seems extremely doubtful.
"He was born here in the region in 1805, he died in 1973," explains Fatulayeva.
The man was married three times and had 23 children, at the age of 136 he is said to have had a daughter.
So did <0xC5><0x9E>irali Müslümov settle for a few decades at his age?
But Rembrandt Scholz, age researcher at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has also heard of the elderly in Central Asia.
“A striking number of high-aged people also live in some areas of China, in Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan,” says Scholz, “extremely many very old men also live in Sardinia.”
Due to the lack of documents, however, no scientific proof of age had to be kept, especially since civil status registers were missing.
Melted butter every day
The fact is, however, that the people of the region around Lerik strikingly often reach a biblical age.
There are currently 20 people older than 100 years.
So why are there so many elderly people here in the South?
The Azerbaijani travel guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this with the special genes of the Talysh.
Museum director Fatulayeva, on the other hand, believes that it is due to nutrition.
But the fact that the high-calorie food of the Talysh should be so healthy, who love meat, bread and especially dairy products and many of whom drink a glass of melted butter every day, does not seem exactly plausible from a nutritional point of view.
Or is it the original way of life that keeps people young? In Cengemiran, a tiny settlement not far from the city of Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
At 97 years old, she is still comparatively young for these latitudes.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
She sits on the floor with a butter keg that untiringly rolls her back and forth.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of Mirzayeva’s sons and a daughter, both of whom have long been grandparents.
Two small children are also jumping around.
Tea is prepared in the kitchen, served in the typical belly-shaped Armadu glasses.
Mirzayeva's white teeth stand perfectly in line, under her headscarf she hides long, dark-blond braids, which her son proudly reveals to us.
I always washed my hair with milk, so they never ran out and kept their color.
“I never used shampoo,” says Mirzayeva.
Monthly Retirement is Enough to Live
She always ate only what came from her own farm, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
All my life, I have not bought food in the supermarket once.
Then she tells about her husband who was in the army.
The worst was after the Second World War.
But everything got better when the "beloved father" Heydar Aliyev took the helm.
The propaganda sounds strange from the mouth of an old woman.
But the cult that is driven around the father figure of the nation, who ruled his country like a dictator, knows hardly any borders in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, when his son Ilham took the helm.
After all, there is no need among Azerbaijan’s elders.
230 manats (about the same amount in euros), Mirzayeva receives monthly as a pension, for local conditions an amount from which one can live well.
And perhaps Mirzayeva's long-awaited son is right: "The elderly are highly respected in our culture."
They live in the middle of the extended family, are loved, cared for and are happy.
If that's not a reason to stay alive as long as possible
The word "human rights" is missing from the constitution
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Rival rallies in Cairo reveal the deep division of the country.
The future constitution with Sharia law as its basis is highly controversial.
The Egyptian president did not spare with pathos.
We have to make the transition.
"And that he succeeds is my responsibility, before the people and before God," he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to the whole people, but above all to the Christian Copts, the liberals, enlightened Muslims and seculars.
Because all of them, so far hopelessly divided in a confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a state of God on the Nile by the graces of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
He said, almost apologetically, that he had temporarily curtailed the powers of the Constitutional Court and expanded his powers “to save the revolution.”
But what the 61-year-old engineer, who holds a doctorate from the American University of Southern California, really wants to save, the Egyptians are concerned about, the world is not quite clear.
Should the judiciary be abolished?
In fact, the 234 articles whipped through by the Islamist-dominated 100-member Constituent Assembly in a nocturnal, 15-hour parforce ride are partly of concern.
As in previous constitutions, the draft also states that the jurisprudence is based on the "principles of Islamic law".
But what do we mean by "principles"?
This was and is a matter of interpretation and it is to be feared that the Islamists will use the spongy formulation and the accompanying legal scope for a stricter interpretation of Sharia law.
This is at least suggested by a newly added article: Al-Ashar University, the country’s most important Islamic institution, must be consulted on all matters relating to Sharia law, with great significance in all Sunni Islam.
This does not have to be, but it can mean that the clergy supervise the legislation, which would de facto result in the disenfranchisement of the judiciary.
Much of the draft constitution is a matter of interpretation
Also problematic: Civilian military jurisdiction should continue to be maintained.
During Mubarak's reign, these courts were used to suppress oppositionists.
After the fall of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were in military custody.
According to the draft, the state should also “protect the true essence of the Egyptian family and promote its morality and values.”
This is legally so vaguely worded that state institutions could even control the content of film art and literature with the help of this article.
In plain language, this means nothing more than censorship.
By the way, no article explicitly stipulates equality between men and women.
For this, another forbids insulting or slandering the Prophet Muhammad and his Messengers.
But what an insult is and how it should be punished remains unclear.
Equally dubious seems the formulation that "insulting people" is forbidden.
Is a caricature of the president enough or a joke at the expense of a legal scholar?
A matter of interpretation, as is the case with so much in the draft, which Morsi has signed and which, in his words, will be presented to the Egyptians "very soon" for a referendum.
“The revolution has returned.”
The opposition has been forming for weeks against the superiority of the Islamists.
Tens of thousands gathered in unusual concord on Friday night in Cairo’s Tahrir Square, vowing to bring down the Charter before it can enter into force.
“The revolution has returned and we will win,” said Hamdin Sabbahi, third-placed in the presidential election.
Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed El-Baradei said the draft constitution “belongs to the garbage mountain of history.”
Via short message service Twitter, he accused the followers of Morsi, to want to lead a "coup against democracy".
“If he calls the referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him,” said opposition leader Jasser Said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers has not yet been purged," Egyptian media quoted Chaled Ali as saying.
And several judges announced that they did not want to monitor the referendum, which would invalidate it.
"The Koran is our Constitution"
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood, for its part, blew to the counter-demonstration, but as a precaution not in Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other bank of the Nile in front of Cairo University.
Many veiled women and followers of the Salafists took part and shouted, “The people demand the application of God’s law.”
They demanded of Morsi: "Cleanse the land!" and asserted: "The Koran is our constitution."
A battle for sovereignty over the symbolic Tahrir Square, where everything began, would have evoked conditions similar to civil war.
Morsi’s supporters obviously didn’t want to risk that.
The Muslim Brotherhood said both opponents of the draft constitution and supporters had spoken out loud and clear.
Now is the time to let the people at the ballot box decide in which direction the country should go.
A majority for the draft of the Islamists is considered safe.
"The word human rights does not even occur"
Hafez Abu Saeda is furious about this forced constitutional process, which should have gone until February and involved all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) defended the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in prison or on trial under Mubarak.
Not because he would share their worldview, but because human rights are indivisible to him.
For this he was beaten, condemned, imprisoned.
“And now the word human rights is not even in the new constitution,” he laments in an interview with the “Welt am Sonntag”.
Morsi’s extension of power to all three powers in the state caused the lawyer to resign.
These measures are blatant violations of democratic rules and will lead Egypt into a new dictatorship.
“Instead of strengthening civil society, the president de facto overrules it,” Saeda laments.
But without civil society organisations, a democracy could not work.
Saeda feels left alone, also by the international community, which looks at the ideological battle of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and suspense.
This could be revenge.
A protester on the Tahrir warns: "You give birth to a monster that you can no longer control."
Rakfisk from Norway: Is this the most foul-smelling fish in the world?
Norway’s five million inhabitants enjoy one of the highest standards of living – not only in Europe, but around the world.
Could the country’s secret of success have anything to do with the local appetite for rather foul-smelling fish?
Take a selection of overripe cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a pile of dirty, wet sportswear.
And leave them there for a week.
It’s about the nose-numbing smell of Rakfisk, one of Norway’s great delicacies.
I am in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There’s snow here, spectacular scenery – and that stubborn smell in the air that just doesn’t want to disappear.
Rakfisk is trout sprinkled with salt, which - depending on how stinky you would like your fish to be - is fermented in water for up to a year.
When the darkness comes over the country in Norway and the weather gets colder, Norwegians flock to a festival here in Fagernes, which is dedicated to this, well, really very impressive specialty.
"You eat it raw and then rinse it down with a glass of aquavit," says Havard Halvarsen, who actually works at the local fire station, but also hosts the festival as a so-called "Rakfisk general".
Around us, people eat small fish cubes and drink large amounts of alcohol.
“Some people like the Aquavit more than the Rakfisk,” says Havard.
The spirit can supplant the smell.
I'll have a few bites.
If you avoid bringing the rakfisk close to your nose, it is not bad - like sushi, which has a fairly long bus ride behind it.
Rakfisk is the product of a very different, much poorer Norwegian era, when there were no cooling options and fish was soaked in airtight saltwater barrels in autumn.
In the deepest winter, it was then taken out after long fermentation and, no doubt with the help of alcohol-steamed senses, consumed.
A generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work and mainly emigrated to the United States.
Today, the population is growing rapidly – more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by a thriving labor market, high wages and comprehensive health care.
Even from Sweden, the old rival, who was much richer than Norway not so long ago, immigrants are pouring in.
Rakfisk is considered to be something important - an essential, though strictly smelly, part of Norwegian history.
It is one of the more expensive dishes that can be bought here.
But actually everything is expensive here - a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs a proud 10 euros.
Norway doesn’t make it into the world press often, and most people don’t seem to mind that.
Here you still hate to call Anders Breivik by his name - the racist right-wing extremist who shot and killed 77 men, women and children last year.
Instead, it only refers to the “July 22 incident.”
Norwegians have a hard time accepting that someone in their peace-loving country is capable of such brutal killings.
Since the early 1970s, Norway has been responsible for the growth of one of the largest oil and gas industries in the world.
“But oil isn’t the only reason we’re doing so well,” says Anna, our waitress, who distributes round trays with mature rakfish and embodies the Nordic ideal with her long blonde hair and piercing blue eyes.
We are, as they say, a prudent people.
Your English, like most people here, is flawless.
We are not very boastful, we do not like boasting.
Norway has handled its oil wealth very carefully – a large part of the industry’s earnings is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
When, in the years leading up to the Great Depression, everyone was throwing money around that they didn’t even have, Norway kept its wallet tightly locked.
“As long as we can ski in the winter and go hiking in the summer, we’re happy,” says Anna.
"And, of course, eat rakfisk," she adds with carefree laughter.
I’m standing in the snow and I’m standing up for another dish – I’ve had enough of Rakfisk.
A moose burger is definitely something else. The juicy meat feeds me.
But in the evening, the smelt fish is again on the menu.
The hotel I stay at is one of several venues that organize a rakfisk dinner where guests can vote for the best – or perhaps the most olfactory – fish.
There is a live TV circuit to a fly-clad showmaster surrounded by plates with rakfisk.
The show is similar to the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What score do you have up there in the mountains for the best fish, Thor-Jürgen?"
"Here's our points, Havard".
You clap and laugh.
A man falls from his chair, possibly overwhelmed by aquavit.
But maybe it is the harsh haze of the whole fish.
Mexico's Enrique Pena Nieto faces a difficult start
As Mexico’s future president, Enrique Pena Nieto, prepares to take office, BBC’s Will Grant analyses the challenges ahead and the mixed feelings of his people.
Currently, traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad.
Even on better days, this is a constantly clogged city, but on Monday a ring of steel was built, blocking several important traffic routes into the capital and causing chaos on the streets.
The goal, however, was not to disrupt commuters on the way to work, but to prevent protesters from reaching parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico’s new president, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidential tie and take over the leadership of the nation.
He faces a complex task.
Under the outgoing government of Felipe Calderon, Mexico has proved economically successful, but the country is in the grip of a drug war that has already cost 60,000 lives in the last six years.
“My administration is deeply committed to reducing violence,” Pena Nieto told U.S. President Barack Obama at the Oval Office earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy to achieve this goal.
Prior to joining the U.S. government, Pena Nieto served as governor of his home state of Mexico.
In this densely populated, sprawling part of the country that surrounds the capital, opinions about the new head of state are divided.
A direct man
In the remote town of Valle del Bravo, for example, people like to remember him.
Residents of the resort attribute to it the development of tourism and the construction of infrastructure.
To reach the city, you can drive on one of the highways that Pena Nieto built and which represent a great improvement over the brittle, bumpy roads that once existed here.
Plaques bearing his name also hang outside a modern sports centre and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We expect him to make real and lasting changes," said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, who works as a congressman for the Pena Nietos party, the PRI.
In particular, when it comes to security and the economy, we hope for an interesting and real change that our country so desperately needs.
After 81 years in power, the PRI was replaced by Vicente Fox in 2000.
Congressman Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, the party has high expectations for Enrique Pena Nieto.
The accusations of the opposition, the new president is lacking in substance, he rejects.
He is a very direct man, very committed and has big plans for the country.
He is an excellent statesman, but above all he is also someone who can listen.
But on the other side of the state, not many people share this view of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast to the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
Tucked away under highway overpasses, it is in many ways a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the community are of a crucial urban nature.
Earlier this year, the military was called in to fight drug gangs operating in the neighborhoods, and violence against women is a particularly acute problem.
In a patch of fallow land near a large landfill, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been left behind in the past two years alone.
During the reign of Governor Pena Nieto, more than 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico – a statistic that surpasses even that of the city of Ciudad Juarez, which is notorious for its violence and the murders of innocent women.
The critics of Pena Nieto believe that he at least did not adequately address the problem of women’s murder during his term in office.
But in the worst case, his government has closed its eyes to the problem.
In a concrete building, typical of the rundown neighborhood, Irinea Buendia struggles with tears when she shows me photos of her deceased daughter Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the events, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
But her family believes she was murdered by her partner.
“When I arrived at her house, it seemed as if her body had been washed,” recalls Senora Buendia.
There were signs that she had been beaten, and the body rigidity had already set in.
As her mother tells her story, a picture of Mariana looks down at us from the wall, next to a cross bearing a single word: justice.
But this, according to the family, has been denied to her until now.
The authorities have treated me as if I were a chatterbox, a troublemaker, a troublemaker.
They want you to just accept their judgment and keep your mouth shut.
“But that’s not possible if there were so many form errors and omissions,” she says.
When President Pena Nieto receives the presidential bond on Saturday, he also assumes a great responsibility.
Tens of thousands of Mexican families have been affected by violent crime over the past six years, and the new president has promised to take special care of this issue during his term in office.
“I hope, as president, he is as he was as governor,” said PRI congressman Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
But this is precisely what the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza are most afraid of.
Attorney General Says Bradley Manning Didn't Complain About Abuse
Prosecutors disagree with Bradley Manning's allegations that he was abused in prison
The hearing focuses on Manning’s time in military prison in Quantico, Virginia
The defense seeks to dismiss the indictment on the basis of harsh conditions of detention
The U.S. Army’s private is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents
Prosecutors on Friday tried to establish that Army Libertarian Bradley Manning — indicted for the largest disclosure of confidential information in U.S. history — missed several opportunities to complain about the abuse he allegedly suffered in military custody.
During a cross-examination of Manning during a pre-trial hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Maj. Ashden Fein explained that documents on weekly visits made by prison officials during Manning’s nine-month term in Quantico, Virginia, did not raise any complaints about his treatment.
One day before the cross-examination, which was held as a result of a request by the defense to dismiss the charge - Manning had already been sufficiently punished by the hard time in prison - Manning had testified that he had considered suicide in prison.
The U.S. Army intelligence analyst, who was arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents during his time in Iraq.
The material was then published on the Internet by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed Manning as the source of the information.
In Friday’s hearing, Fein and Manning went through the forms that officials had filled out after their meetings with Manning during his detention at Quantico Military Prison, where he had been incarcerated under increased detention conditions from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers asked Manning questions and wrote down his answers.
When Fein questioned him about the forms on Friday, Manning admitted that he had judged the treatment by his guards to be “excellent” and the treatment by the facility overall to be “very professional.”
The forms, Fein said, contained no complaints of abuse, even though officials had directly questioned Manning about his treatment.
Manning replied that he had expressed his concerns orally and the officials had discussed them with him and indicated that they would deal with them, but they had not been logged.
“They wrote ‘no problems’ (after discussing the concerns), and that didn’t necessarily mean I didn’t say anything at all,” Manning said.
The judge, Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he did not complain about his treatment when he met with a committee in January 2011 to investigate the suicidal ideation he had mentioned on a form a few months earlier.
Manning responded that his intention during this meeting was to downgrade his observation status to “prevention of injury.”
The military said it had assigned him this restrictive status — which is one level below the suicide risk — to his and the protection of others.
"I wanted to convince employees that I was doing well, and get rid of the observational status for injury prevention (...) in order to achieve a higher quality of life in my view," Manning said.
Manning testified on Thursday about his arrest and transfer to Kuwait, where he was detained for nearly two months before being transferred to the Quantico Naval Base prison in Virginia in July 2010.
He said he had considered suicide in Kuwait and had once become unconscious due to the heat.
Not being able to know what was going on with him or in the outside world was a burden.
“My world shrank at Camp Arafjon, on this cage together,” Manning said.
I thought I was going to die in this cage.
When he was transferred to Quantico, Manning spent most of his days in a small cell—at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours—and without company.
They only allowed him a mattress, a blanket, flip-flops, clothes and his glasses.
Manning said he had tried to keep moving because during the day it was forbidden to sleep or even to lie down.
He always had to sleep with light that entered his cell from the outside.
If he had turned around at night and guards could no longer see his face, they would have woken him up so that he would turn back.
In January 2011, Manning's lawyer formally objected to Manning's treatment.
In April 2011, Manning was transferred to the military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
On Friday, Judge Manning also questioned an accusation he had made in his statement on Thursday — for example, he had to sleep naked in his Quantico cell one night and stand naked in front of guards and other prisoners at a morning count.
Manning had testified that he had never had the opportunity to wrap himself in his blanket during this count.
At the interview on Friday, Manning said he had concluded from an order from his guard that he should drop the blanket he could have used to cover himself with, but admitted that no one had asked him to do so.
On Thursday, Manning testified that he had been forced to sleep naked the previous night and had previously tried to show an official that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning told the official that he could have used the waistband of his underpants or flip-flops to hurt himself, but did not.
That night, Manning said, his underpants, flip-flops and glasses had been removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that the judge will at least consider his detention experiences and drastically reduce his detention if he is convicted at his trial in the military court, which is scheduled for early next year.
The defense has stated that Manning will plead guilty to lesser offenses, while other charges that are considered too extreme will be challenged.
The continuation of the hearing is scheduled for this weekend, and the public prosecutor's office is expected to justify the conditions of detention.
The Pentagon maintains its position that Manning has been detained in accordance with the provisions that apply to all detainees held under the highest security precautions at Quantico.
The charges against Manning include favoring the enemy, unlawful disclosure of intelligence on the Internet, the transmission of national defense information, and the theft of public property or documents.
If he is found guilty on all charges, he faces a life sentence.
My Mexican-American Identity Crisis.
Many people are forced to leave Mexico due to lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to blame the emigrants - they remind them of hard times, he says
Navarrette believes Mexican Americans are trapped between two worlds
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had just crossed the hall and had arrived at passport control when perplexity spread within me.
Signs refer to two queues: one for "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans"), another for "Extranjeros" ("foreigners").
I stood there for a few seconds, unsure of what to go to.
I grew up in central California and have been called "Mexican" all my life.
An ethnic abbreviation - just as my friends in Boston call themselves "Iren" or my friends in New York call themselves "Italians".
Later, I decided to go for "Mexican-American".
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather’s home, there was no need for hyphens or hyphens.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, at least good enough to assert myself in that language at both ends of an interview.
But I don’t have the vocabulary of a native speaker, and I don’t get rid of my American accent either.
So I took my American passport and stood in line for extranjeros.
I was thinking about that moment this week when future Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
On the agenda were all the topics that one would expect when the heads of these two countries meet: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto was also very interested in talking about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one reason why Mexicans today are just as likely to stay in Mexico rather than immigrate to the United States.
He wants to ally himself with the United States and Canada and create a North American trade bloc modelled on the European Union.
And Pena Nieto vowed to continue Mexico’s war on the drug cartels, even if he did not give any details about it.
Mexico’s relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resentment.
Most Americans probably never waste a single thought on the fact that the United States invaded Mexico in 1848, forcing the leadership of the country under held gun to give them more than half of their territory.
But for Mexicans who think in centuries and not minutes, memories of this event are not to be missed.
So as soon as a U.S. government official makes even the mildest criticism of Mexico, one hears complaints - in the Mexican press and among the country's elites - about how the Americans are pressuring the sovereignty of their neighboring country.
And the children of Montezuma go on the path of war.
And yet, Mexico’s biggest challenge lies in the truth in its relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
Want to talk about resentment?
There is more than enough.
Mexico has winners and losers, people for whom the country offers opportunities, and others for whom it does not.
The only reason so many people of Mexican descent live in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver, or San Antonio is because at one point in our family tree, a person — perhaps a parent or grandparent — was offered no chance in Mexico and migrated north.
And in most cases, this person corresponded to a profile - dark-skinned, uneducated, from a poor village, etc.
We are the descendants of these people, and our loyalty is to them.
Not Mexico.
And while we may now be living the American dream, attending good schools and getting good jobs, we must never lose sight of the fact that it is the American dream that we are living – not the Mexican one.
Our identity may be blurred at times, but as far as our loyalty is concerned, this is not the case.
This clearly applies to the United States.
In addition, we are aware that many members of the Mexican leadership do not like us.
This is based on reciprocity.
They see us as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and look down on us because we are not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico will never be strong enough.
In their opinion, our existence is a symbol of failure.
If our families hadn't failed in Mexico, they wouldn't have left.
And then we wouldn’t see ourselves trapped behind the silk curtain now—with a pleasant life in the United States, but somehow lost.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and legally immigrated to the United States as a child, reminds me that tensions exist between Mexicans and Mexican Americans because Mexicans have a clearer idea of who they are — and Mexican Americans resent them for doing so.
While she is a U.S. citizen, she sees herself as part of two countries.
But many Mexican Americans I know feel they belong neither to one country nor to another.
We love the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
One enjoys the best of both worlds, but is not rooted in any of them.
In Mexico, we are seen as Americans.
And in the United States, we are seen as Mexicans.
How I should learn during my trip, there is something that makes this relationship even more complicated: Some Mexican leaders and parts of the educated middle class want to resume their connections to the diaspora.
They want to use Mexican Americans as provisional "ambassadors" for Mexico, who represent their interests in the United States.
We should tell our American colleagues about how great a visit to this country is and put pressure on the political leadership to intensify their ties to Mexico.
Well, now.
That's not gonna happen.
Too many hurt feelings.
And given the unfair distribution of income, rampant corruption and drug violence, many of us are not so sure if this is really a great country.
I'm afraid you'll have to go through this alone, amigos.
That's fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not yet willing to forgive the United States for dealing with Mexico a century and a half ago, they must also accept that some Mexican Americans harbor resentment for how their family members were treated not so long ago.
- Hmmm.
Maybe we're more "Mexican" than I thought.
Old Battles, New Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could prove to be an unexpected cornerstone for peace
Can there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The latest bloody events seem to nip such hope in the bud.
Amid the usual blames, countless buildings have been laid in ruins, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis killed – and for the first time rockets have been fired from Gaza near the Israeli metropolis of Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But while Israelis and Palestinians seem trapped in their historical conflict, the Middle East is changing around them.
The Arab Spring has created a new, uncertain situation, and whether they like it or not, Palestinians and Israelis have become part of this turmoil.
Perhaps this will only lead to more bloodshed.
But there are reasons to believe that the fatal stalemate could finally come to an end.
A war that is neither lost nor won
At first glance, optimism in view of the current situation seems to be anything but appropriate.
Even if the ceasefire agreed on 21 November continues, this week’s fighting has strengthened the hard-boiled on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has controlled the Gaza Strip since 2007, will claim to have pushed back the Israelis, even though its group itself suffered great losses.
Although several Hamas leaders are killed and the 1.7 million residents of the Gaza Strip are crammed into one of the most desolate and densely populated corners of the planet, Israel has so far failed to annihilate Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, which is controlled by the rival, moderate Palestinian group Fatah.
And the Hamas leaders may come to the conclusion that they have time on their side.
Just as Islamists have gained influence in the Arab world, Hamas has been able to draw powerful and rich friends to its side.
Turkey, a resurgent regional power once considered Israel’s closest Muslim ally, has sided with Hamas – just like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf states.
Cheering Hamas supporters believe that an Islamist crescent is forming around Israel – from Lebanon in the north, where the militant Hezbollah has power, to Syria, where rebels of an increasingly Islamist character could face the overthrow of Bashar Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
And in particular, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt – by far the most populous and most important Arab country – on Israel’s southern flank has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his overthrow in 2011, had little time left for Hamas.
In contrast, the Brotherhood is intertwined with Hamas and its leaders are more dependent on popular views.
In future diplomatic negotiations, Hamas could turn out to be an actor that cannot even be pushed out by Israel and the United States.
The Israeli hardliners, on the other hand, allow an opposite conclusion to be drawn.
From a military point of view, Hamas is no longer a threat.
The Israeli missile defense system, "Iron Dome", has proved its worth and many of the Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
At least for a while, Israel will be able to sleep more peacefully.
From a diplomatic point of view, the United States remains steadfast in its position, and many European countries have blamed Hamas for the latest escalation of violence.
Israel has been doing well in recent years, especially under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets from the Gaza Strip have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, the country has remained relatively free of suicide bombers, not least thanks to the blockades that extend into the West Bank and thus into the bulk of any Palestinian state, which protect Jewish settlements, which were declared to be in violation of international law but are still being expanded.
Netanyahu is doing well and his Likud party has allied with an even more militant group in the run-up to the January 22 elections under Avigdor Lieberman.
Why coddle these insidious Palestinians and leave them a state of their own?
If they actually had control of the West Bank, wouldn’t they be firing rockets just like their fellow Gazans?
No, it is better to keep them behind the wall in check and punish them if they dare to raise their heads.
Perhaps the hardliners will be able to prevail, but the Arab Spring could put a stop to them.
Even if the Islamists, now in power in Egypt and other countries, have little to do with Israel, they will initially focus on the difficulties at home.
Israel’s defense budget is larger than that of its four Arab neighbors combined.
A war with the local superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments in the restoration of their economy.
That pragmatic President Morsi teamed up with Barack Obama to reach a ceasefire could be a promising sign – and perhaps symbolize the beginning of a new era.
Israelis should also think longer-term.
While the rest of the Arab world is taking tentative steps toward democratization, Palestinians continue to be deprived of their right to self-determination – a powder keg that will undoubtedly one day explode in the Israeli-occupied territories, just as a bus exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
Suppression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state, and with the growth of the Arab population, this situation will only worsen.
Bloody missions to push Hamas back in the Gaza Strip will increasingly take its diplomatic toll over the years.
Both sides need a push from the outside
The correct answer is that represented by the more reasonable representatives of both sides, most of the rest of the world, and by this newspaper: two states where Israel cedes territories for security purposes.
The hope - small for the near future - is that the ceasefire will give outsiders more influence to enforce this solution.
Egypt, together with Turkey and Qatar, must now stop arms shipments to the Gaza Strip and is better positioned than ever to convince Hamas of the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, supplemented by territorial exchanges and a common Jerusalem.
Foreign Arab nations should also persuade Hamas and Fatah to reach an agreement.
This would do more for the creation of a Palestinian state than with the upcoming application for UN observer status.
Obama must also do his part to get Israel to negotiate.
During his first term in office, he failed to present his own peace plan.
Far away in the White House, it seems as if he is equally averse to participation.
But that is an unfortunate, short-sighted perspective.
The United States has a major interest in a stable Middle East.
And that includes a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australian Uniform Cigarette Packaging Laws Enter Into Force
Health warnings and diseased body parts on neutral green packs that are the same for all tobacco brands
The world’s first uniform cigarette and tobacco packaging laws have come into force in Australia, replacing brand logos and colours with neutral, olive-green lids, which are also printed with dramatic images showing sick body parts and infants and children suffering from cigarette smoke.
Apart from the different health warnings and pictures, the only difference between the packs in the brand names, which are printed in identical, small letters, will be from next Saturday.
This means that Australia is introducing the strictest regulations for tobacco packaging in the world.
The Australian government wants to discourage young people from smoking by removing the glamorous image of tobacco use.
Studies have shown that people who haven’t started smoking at the age of 26 are 99% likely not to start smoking after that.
"You can already see in children at a young age that they understand the message that tobacco companies are trying to promote with their brand image," says Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that have shown, for example, that children associate the crown of a logo with the idea of a princess.
Although Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and the changes will have only a minor impact on the profits of multinationals, other countries are already considering similar steps.
The tobacco lobby fought hard against the laws.
It was said that the laws would favour the black market trade, which would lead to cheaper and more accessible cigarettes.
“The laws will lead to serious, unintended consequences,” says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Chinese and Indonesian counterfeiters will offer far larger quantities of these products on the streets of Australia.
Others, on the other hand, say that the laws have boosted their business.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, notes that the demand for cigarette cases and silicone lids to cover the intolerable packaging has increased enormously since the British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco companies failed two months ago at the Supreme Australian Court with their challenge to the laws.
Zico has sold up to 6,000 units to wholesale businesses and is awaiting new inventory.
This is a good deal for us.
According to experts, the catch in the popularity of social media lies with exactly the population group to which the plan is aimed.
A number of Australian laws have banned tobacco companies from TV advertising, banned them from acting as sports sponsors, and forced most retailers to stop interpreting cigarettes in stores. Now tobacco advertising has switched to the Internet.
The Australian government has banned internet advertising by local businesses and sites, but has no influence on international sites.
“Anyone who markets tobacco and only has a small area left to promote their products can’t get around the internet,” says Becky Freeman, a healthcare researcher at the University of Sydney.
On social media such as YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook, Freeman has seen a surge in testimonials on brands written by “quite normal people.”
One has to ask oneself the question: Is this just a private person who likes Marlboro cigarettes so much that they even record a video for it - or does a marketing agency have to do with it?
British American Tobacco Australia says that instead of marketing, the industry is focused on dealing with the new laws.
It has even gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new regulations – those countries complain to the World Trade Organization about unfair trade restrictions, even though none of the countries engage in greater trade with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected in mid-2013.
According to Plibersek, the government has held talks with other countries that are considering similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to issue photographic warnings in 2001.
Meanwhile, these have been expanded to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Tougher laws are being considered in the UK, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many Australian smokers are reluctant.
The pictures do not affect me.
I just ignore them.
"You just take a dump and put the box away," says Victor El Hage when buying a cigarette box, on which a photo with a mouth tumor is printed.
Honestly, there's only one reason I'd stop, and that's my little girl.
James Yu, operator of the tobacco trade “King of the Pack” in downtown Sydney, says the uniform packaging has made it difficult to replenish its shelves.
“It used to take me an hour to sort a delivery, now I need four,” Yu says.
"The government should have just banned cigarettes completely - then we would have said okay, that's it, we're closing," he adds visibly enraged.
In a constantly electrified world, it’s nice to be bored.
This Thanksgiving I unexpectedly spent five hours at the airport when our plane failed due to mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane.
So I had plenty of time to think about boredom.
I don't want to lie.
Waiting half a day at the airport for a flight is pretty upsetting — even when books, magazines, and iPhones (and, of course, tax-free shopping) are available.
But more and more academics and child development experts are citing boredom as something positive.
When it comes to them, it’s okay for us — and our children — to get bored on occasion.
This forces the brain to get lost in interesting thought processes, which may encourage creativity.
And because most of us these days are almost constantly staring at one or the other screen, the benefits of boredom no longer benefit us.
So should we welcome boredom with open arms?
Yeah, yeah.
And no.
I'll come back to that.
Like many people, I have always assumed that boredom is a relatively recent phenomenon that has developed with increasing leisure time.
But Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011) doesn't see it that way.
“In fact, boredom has a very long history,” he says.
Pompeii’s house walls are decorated with Latin graffiti about boredom dating back to the first century.
And then there is the question of how we actually define boredom.
According to John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada, the problem is that boredom has been defined and discussed in many ways.
After a long reading of research literature and presenting the idea to a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues concluded that boredom can be defined as the experience of “wanting to perform a satisfying activity but not being able to do it.”
Boredom differs from apathy in that the person is not busy but wants to be.
In the case of apathy, on the other hand, there is no urge to do anything.
The key experience of boredom, he says, is a “disruption of the attention process, coupled with a bad mood and the feeling that time is only passing slowly.”
Boredom can almost sound like depression.
But Professor Eastwood believes that although these two conditions may be related, bored individuals see the problem in their environment or the world, while depressed individuals see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we think we’re bored, even if we’re just having trouble concentrating.
In their study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", which appeared in September in the journal "Perspectives on Psychological Science", Professor Eastwood and his colleagues point to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a volume on which a person read a magazine article.
Some groups listened to a loud TV program from the neighboring room that had nothing to do with the content, others listened to it at low volume so that it was barely noticeable, while the third group did not hear these sounds at all.
The people who heard the barely audible television reported feeling more boredom than the other two groups – they had trouble concentrating, couldn’t find a reason for it, and attributed their difficulties to boredom.
When trying to focus on a difficult or strenuous task, disrupting attention can lead to boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the study’s authors.
If, on the other hand, you are engaged in a monotonous activity - "like searching for faulty products on a factory conveyor belt, music can distract and help you not to feel bored."
In fact, he says, we now know that fidgeting and scribbling, often interpreted as a sign of boredom, can actually combat it by keeping people more physically alert.
"Studies have shown that children who are allowed to bounce around learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to sit still," said Professor Fenske.
We all get bored at some point - my delayed flight, a booming speaker, a particularly tiring movie.
But some people get bored more easily than others.
To measure these differences, researchers in the 1980s developed a "scale of long-female susceptibility."
On the scale are statements such as "Many things I have to do are repetitive and are monotonous" and "I have so many interests that I don't have enough time for everything".
Using such scales, researchers have found that boys get bored more often than girls, according to Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida - particularly when it comes to the need for more and a greater variety of external stimuli.
But in general, teenagers are a pretty tight-knit bunch.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents with a pager seven to eight times a day.
He found that 32% of adolescents were bored at school and doing homework, while 23% reported being bored when they were not in school.
However, only 3% of parents reported feeling bored.
Professor Larson says today, 21 years later, he doesn’t know whether the percentages have risen or fallen in terms of boredom.
However, he is certain that "youth is perceived as particularly boring", mainly because children and teenagers do not have a major impact on their everyday lives.
So back to my original question: is boredom healthy?
Sometimes not, because in extreme cases, it causes people to take extreme physical risks and fall into gambling or drugs to relieve them - studies have shown.
On the other hand, many philosophers and authors are investigating the relationship between boredom and creativity. This is the opinion of Professor Vodanovich, who has been researching the topic for more than two decades.
“With boredom, the brain wants to tell you that you should do something else,” says Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain doesn’t always know what to do best.
If you’re bored and you use that energy to play guitar and cook, you’ll be happy.
But while television can bring happiness in the short term, it will disappear in the long run.
So if you give your bored child an iPad, you can take it away from boredom, but it has not taught them to entertain or control themselves, says Professor Fenske.
And he adds, “Self-control transfers from one situation to another.”
The child not only learns to converse, but also gets more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we should celebrate boredom.
Nor should we be too critical of them.
Instead, our goal should be to feel comfortable away from the constant activity and technology rush.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
“It sounds like we need to be bored more often, but boredom is the agonizing, relentless desire to do something meaningful,” he says.
He believes that people are really just looking for a way to shut down and relax.
“In an environment where we’re constantly overstimulated, it’s hard to keep busy once the noise has stopped.”
In Colorado, there is no clear guideline for the new marijuana law
19-year-old community college student and soccer player Anthony Orozco is facing trial in southeastern Colorado for a misdemeanor that will soon be legal in that state: owning a few marijuana chunks and a pipe he used to smoke them.
According to Orozco, he and some friends were traveling by car in Lamar near the Kansas border on a September day when they were stopped.
After the police officer found marijuana in the car, Orozco was subpoenaed for possession of drugs and drug paraphernalia — cavalier offenses, each with a $100 fine — and given a court date.
"We are treated like criminals," Orozco said.
But is he also one?
In the uncertain weeks following the state’s decision to legalize small amounts of marijuana for personal use, the answer to hundreds of minor drug offenses depends less on the law than on the location.
Hundreds of marijuana-related misdemeanours are already being dropped here and in the state of Washington, which approved similar measures.
Police agencies will no longer prosecute adults over the age of 21 for small-scale possession, which is permitted by law as soon as the new laws come into force in the next few weeks.
But prosecutors in Colorado’s more conservative districts have announced they will pursue existing marijuana offenses and are still quoting people in court.
At the same time, several cities, from the suburbs of Denver to the Western Mountains, are voting to block new, state-licensed marijuana stores from opening in their communities.
“This situation is evolving so fast that I don’t even know what’s going to happen next,” said Daniel J. Oates, chief of police in Aurora, just east of Denver.
Regulators in the state of Washington are also scratching their heads.
They are waiting for guidance on setting up a licensing system for the production, manufacture, distribution and sale of the drug - and have a deadline until December 1, 2013.
In Washington, it is believed that Colorado is definitely ahead of most states when it comes to regulating marijuana, where the drug was first legalized for medical purposes and then for personal use.
“Colorado has a more regulated market, so the state is well-suited for orientation,” said Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the liquor regulator in Washington State.
But Smith also admits that no place or system can do more than serve in the sense of a rough guide.
"We don't have a real precedent that we can follow," he adds.
The Washington law, called I-502, comes into force on December 6, and thus also forms the endpoint of a gray area, in which the state licensing system does not yet exist, but the possession is legalized.
And unpleasant practical questions need to be clarified during this time - such as how the government's requirement of "adequate access" to licensed marijuana should be agreed with the ban on cannabis shops within 300 meters around schools, parks, playgrounds and childcare facilities.
“Nowhere will it be harder to find a location for a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, particularly in the metropolitan area of Seattle,” said Ben Livingston, spokesman for the Center for Legal Cannabis, a recently formed research group.
On November 21, Chief Oates sent an email to his staff in Aurora stating that the prosecutor would no longer prosecute minor marijuana offenses in persons over 21 years of age, and that police would not seek criminal charges for these offenses “from now on.”
Chief Oates added that the police will continue to enforce city regulations on medical marijuana growers and will continue to persecute drug traffickers.
In Weld County in northern Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck takes a stricter view.
After the vote, he said his agency would continue to pursue cases of marijuana possession, mainly to get consumers to withdraw.
Currently, 119 people have to answer for possession of about 50 grams or less of marijuana in court, although many have also been charged with other offenses.
“Our agency has a duty to prosecute violations that were crimes at the time,” Buck said in a statement.
Reactions are ambivalent even in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative.
Police in Grand Junction, the county’s largest city, no longer report adults for possession of small amounts.
District Attorney Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, but also decided not to drop all pending possession proceedings.
“I don’t think I’m wasting my time enforcing the law until it changes,” he says.
Although 55% of voters in Colorado supported the measure, it was clear from the start that it would not be easy to reconcile personal marijuana use with the complexities of government and the legal system.
And the conflicting reactions across the state fostered a deep-seated rift among local officials over the great green experiment.
District attorneys are a “cultural barrier,” says Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents defendants on trial for marijuana offenses and acts as a spokesman for the national marijuana law reform organization on the ground.
“They’ve spent so much of their lives prosecuting people for not being able to accept legalization,” he says.
As the first states to treat smaller amounts of marijuana such as alcohol, Colorado and Washington are being treated as national model cases for drug legalization.
While advocates and state officials are preparing for an era of legal sales, they are also nervously waiting for instructions from the federal government, which wants to continue to treat the sale and cultivation of marijuana at the federal level as a crime.
Advocates of the legalization movement hope that the Ministry of Justice will give in.
Despite several sensational arrests of consumers and sellers of medical marijuana, the federal government has largely allowed the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington, and 16 other states.
Kevin A. Sabet, former drug policy adviser to the Obama administration, believes that while criminal investigators are unlikely to enter doors to confiscate smaller amounts of the drugs, they are likely to resist tolerating legal, state-regulated marijuana deals under the new legislation.
Several cities in Colorado aren’t even waiting for federal agencies to act.
Even before Election Day, some local councils approved moratoriums on new marijuana businesses, though these could only open in about a year.
Last week, Montrose, a city to the west, decided on a six-month ban, which is expected to be passed next week.
"We don't want to get into a position where we license someone and then face a big problem at the federal level," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council.
Our community voted against this amendment.
We focus on what the community has chosen, not on what the state has chosen.
There are still many questions to be answered.
Petronella Wyatt: I was bullied out of Oxford because I'm Tory
Not only university students of today are being attacked for their views
It has always been my biggest dream to get a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had attended the university that I once thought was the greatest temple of knowledge in the world, a modern Greek symposium that promoted the great pillars of civilization - free thought and tolerance.
But within two weeks of moving into Worscester College at the end of the 1980s - where I had planned to study history - I had packed my bags again and thus caused the first scandal of my life.
My father broke down in tears.
My friends were confused.
The Evening Standard said I left because I had a problem with fellow students having sex in the neighboring room.
Author A. N. Wilson mischievously declared that I had left university because I was forced to drink from damaged cups.
But the truth was less amusing.
I ran away.
Yes, I ran, because I suffered from systematic bullying and threats.
Not because of my rather unusual name, or because I came from a private school.
I had only been harassed for one reason - one reason that seemed all the more narrow-minded and cruel in this alleged cradle of enlightenment: my late father Woodrow Wyatt had been an important adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I was a supporter of the Conservative Party.
Why am I mentioning this right now?
Well, according to current reports, a new generation of moderate-right students is suffering from similar persecution.
The organized and rising hatred of Tory students in Oxford has now developed such dimensions that a group of them last week called for the same equality protection that benefits gay, disabled and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of Corpus Christi College’s Junior Common Room (JCR) say they are “often actively isolated, personally attacked, and declared undesirable” because of their political views.
They demand a place on their college’s equality committee to ensure that their opinions can be freely expressed.
Their situation was exacerbated by a recent documentary about political students on BBC Two, "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right", portraying Tories as eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
Among others, it showed graduate Joe Cooke, former president of the conservative student association of the University of Oxford, who drove in a Rolls-Royce and flaunted with a silver suit and silver-studded walking stick.
At other universities, conservative students say they are considered “scapegoats for introducing higher tuition fees.”
Twenty-year-old Luke Black, vice president of the University of Nottingham’s conservative student union, said in a Sunday paper: “There is a growing tendency to the left in universities.
“People think we’re like the Bullingdon Club without even getting to know each other.”
Samuel Roberts, 21 and history student in Corpus Christi, who initiated the application for greater protection, believes such a climate is “unpleasant.” 19-year-old Stephanie Cherill, president-elect of the Oxford Conservative Student Association, says she has observed a growing rejection among JCR members of students of the moderate right.
“This poses a threat to intellectual discourse and the well-being of members,” she says.
In my first few weeks in Oxford, I was part of such a minority.
As an incredibly shy 18-year-old I arrived in September 1986.
Hatred of the Conservative Party had reached its peak.
Last year, the university voted not to award an honorary degree to Margaret Thatcher - a former student - due to cuts in higher education.
The atmosphere would have even alarmed Stalinists.
In the first few days of the freshman week, when new students got to know each other and the tutors, I got a taste of what would happen in the future.
I found that the tutors not only tolerated the taunting of Tory students, but even enjoyed participating.
Political issues such as the miners’ strike, privatisation and the government’s rejection of sanctions against South Africa’s apartheid regime made their way into the tutorial’s wood-paneled rooms.
At my first of these events, I was supposed to translate 18th-century French texts into English, and I was not prepared for what was to come.
"Miss Wyatt," said tutor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."
I tripped over it.
Pitt was a little man with a face like cake dough, and quite spiteful.
“Do Thatcher followers refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?” he asked.
The other students giggled.
In my eyes there were tears.
“I suggest they take a few French lessons in your spare time — so if you’re not too preoccupied with your social activities,” Pitt growled.
I returned to my room with my head hanging.
That night, I was sitting alone at dinner in college when someone lightly tapped me on the shoulder.
It was a second-year English student named James who introduced himself as a member of the Conservative Student Association.
“I know who you are,” he said kindly.
Unfortunately, it is as it is.
Anyone suspected of being Tory will be harassed.
It's bad enough for me, but they know your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's gonna be worse for you.
Most Tory freshmen pretend to be Labour Party supporters.
In a local pub, I later tried to pretend.
I insisted that I disagreed with Mrs. Thatcher on all points.
This trick should prove unsuccessful.
A freshman in philosophy, politics and economics who had ironically attended Eton College, which is considered conservative, said to me, “You are the daughter of a fascist pig.”
You're dirty.
Other students shared his opinion.
I was perverted and dirty.
“How do Tories have sex?” someone asked me.
They beat each other, right?
I felt like homosexuals must have felt before the more liberal legislation of the United States.
Would I ever be able to live a normal life at Oxford University?
Would I be able to meet like-minded people only after dark?
Should I turn to the Labour Party and suppress my natural inclinations?
The three years that lay before me stretched before my mind’s eye to a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only tutor who openly identified himself as Tory was Norman Stone, a professor of contemporary history, who was based in my college.
He was hated not only for being a conservative, but also because he had advised Thatcher on foreign policy and written speeches for her.
He was rarely there.
He hated the place, found it provincial and petty and rejected it for its Marxist-determinist historical perspective.
In 1997, he accepted a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
“You’re not going to be happy here,” he told me.
I began to commute between Oxford and my parents’ house and found refuge with more open-minded friends and family members in the city.
I told my father I hated Oxford and why I did it.
He seemed incredulous.
During his time in the forties, all political views were accepted.
“But it’s the best place in the world,” he said softly.
They would never do such a thing, not in my city of dreaming spires.
Even my communist friends always showed impeccable manners.
His wet eyes were clouded.
Give the whole thing a chance.
I'm sure they're just teasing you.
It would break my heart if you left.
Exhausted by my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance weakened.
One of my male friends, also Tory supporters, had given in to the pressure and renounced his beliefs.
During a tutorial the following week where another history tutor had seriously claimed that I was “an enemy of the people,” I decided to do the same.
Although I was secretly crushed with shame, I admitted that my parents had “brainwashed me” and called her “old jerk.”
The relief lasted only a short time.
It was my father who put the last nail in the coffin of my Oxford career.
At the time, he was writing two columns a week in the Murdoch press.
My door was locked.
I hid in my room, and after five minutes, my bunnies gave up.
When they left, I packed a suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never came back.
You are welcome to call me a whiny cock.
But no 18-year-old should ever have to suffer from such intimidation and malice in an educational institution.
And even more tragically, it was Oxford – a university that not only produced 14 Tory prime ministers, but still hides behind an undeserved call for equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to celebrity"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino - Master of Couture", which opened this week in London, ABC talks with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of the Italian fashion maker.
Somerset House, the former residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
This was acknowledged by the designer at the opening of "Valentino - Master of Couture", a grandiose retrospective, for which more than 130 haute couture dresses were put together, created by his "maison" over the last 50 years.
“I love this palace,” he says with his unmistakable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story whose only protagonist is "il signore" Garavani, but which could not have been written without his distinguished clientele.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the stuffy and distant world of nobility.
In the first hall of this exhibition, which will be on view until March 3, there are a large number of private letters and photographs with the signature of the most exquisite aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margarita of England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino shows these personal memories as trophies of his social rise from the humble fashion designer in the town of Voghera in northern Italy to the idol of the international jet set.
To be in love with the nobility does not have to be a disadvantage.
“At least they don’t kick their butts out on your gorgeous carpet like some beautiful pop celebrities do,” says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 60s and 70s, the two lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular, generous and elegant host.
"We were all delighted when we were invited to his house in Gstaad," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, close friends with forgotten beauties such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred the elegance of celebrity.
And yet he is a star.
Valeria Mazza, in a dress by Valentino
Even the Argentine model Valeria Mazza does not forget the charisma of the fashionmaker.
Many years ago, after a fashion show in Piazza di Spagna in Rome, we went to his home for dinner.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
At every detail of his apartment, the decoration, the food and the music, one recognized and felt his influence.
“All invited guests felt important and loved,” recalls the “top model” who began her career at the 1995 Haute Couture week in Paris.
“He never goes out of fashion because his designs are works of art,” she concludes.
Fashion show of origin
The life of Garavani is not a story of obsession, but rather of mutual affections.
He likes people with good education and the highest titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries at Somerset House has been transformed into a glorious 60-meter-long catwalk, which suggests a roll-up: the user takes the model's place and walks down the catwalk to admire a dreamlike "audience" wearing masterpieces by Valentino, such as the dress that Jackie Kennedy wore for her wedding with Arist<0xC3><0xB3>teles Onassis, the dress that was worn by the Viist<0xC3><0xB3>tele.
In this audience of fashion dolls, names such as that of Sibilla de Luxemburgo, Gloria of Thurn and Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sof<0xC3><0xAD>a of Habsburg shine.
Naty Abascal and the Fashionmaker, 2006
Many of these customers say that the first Valentino is like the first love, "unforgettable".
I can still remember perfectly.
It was a pants, a shirt, a vest type "gillette" and a jacket from the autumn/winter collection 1971-1972.
“It was a gift from him,” says Naty Abascal, one of the designer’s muses.
"I prefer him to everyone else because of his great love for women and because he highlights our beauty," added the ex-duchess of Feria.
I like the colors he uses very much; they have a lot of light and underline the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Also the princess and opinion leader in the fashion Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg can't forget the first time she wore a Valentino.
When I lived in Italy as a teenager, I dreamed of finally having the age and opportunity to wear one of his evening dresses...
At the end of the 90s it finally happened.
I bought my first Valentino dress for a party in the castle of my cousin, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress with a flying skirt and a draped top with a cleavage that lives up to its name.
"It was a dream come true," says Rodrigo d'Arenberg's widow.
“Valentino does not depend on fashion, his obsession is timeless,” explains this Italian aristocrat who lives between Par<0xC3><0xAD>s, New York and Buenos Aires.
The Princess D'Arenberg keeps her evening dresses of the fashionmaker "with absolute care", "because a dress is not only a dress, but also the memories associated with it".
The "King" of Fashion
The grand finale of the exhibition at Somerset House is Marie-Chantal Miller’s wedding dress for her wedding to Pablo de Grecia in 1995.
Four months of work and 25 "ragazze" (as the fashion designer called his seamstresses) were necessary to make this ivory silk dress with pearls, twelve different embroidery and a four and a half meter long tail.
According to the journalist Suzy Menkes, the supreme authority of the trade press, this dress was a milestone in haute couture at the end of the 20th century, "the return to the customers of the supreme society".
For years, marred with the "savoir-<0xC3><0xAA>tre" of the elite, Valentino is now their best specimen.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest award of Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, awarded with the Legion of Honor, accumulates Garavani as many honors as any of the husbands of his clients.
"I have always noticed his refinement, his calmness, his well-groomed and perfect appearance," admits D'Arenberg.
I last saw him at a gala dinner at the Museum de Orsay a month ago.
He was sitting at the table of Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a very good friend of mine.
"He was flawless; time leaves no traces on him".
And this is what a princess says...
The most difficult profession in the world: the human work animals of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the carriers of the Indonesian volcano risk their lives and their health if they carry 70 kilos of sulfur over the steep, stony paths.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and others literally work in hell.
This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn their lives by extracting sulfur from the Kawah Ijen volcano in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
To do this, he must descend every day to the bottom of his crater, where the sulphurous gas flowing out of the earth solidifies in contact with the air.
After breaking out large sulfur stones, which can weigh up to 70 kilos in total, he transports them in two bamboo baskets on his shoulders over the sloping stone paths.
While it’s only 250 meters to the top of the volcano, which rises to a height of 2,386 meters, the exhausted carriers take more than 40 minutes to climb at turtle speed, keeping balance and carefully taking their steps so they don’t slip and fall.
They know that every step can cost their lives, as happened to a French tourist who crashed years ago on the steep slopes of Kawah Ijen.
Kawah Ijen miners earn 5 cents for every kilo of sulfur they mine.
Once at the top, they make their way between the tourists who photograph them like circus monkeys and walk with the tiringly heavy baskets three kilometers to the scale that a mining company has set up a little further down at an altitude of 1850 meters.
The company is PT Candi Ngrimbi, who has been exploiting the occurrences in the volcano since 1960 and (never better) its workers, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 eurocents) for every kilo of sulfur.
They then sell it to the petrochemical industry for 10,000 rupees (83 eurocents) each, because this mineral is widely used in everyday life and is used for the production of matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even for bleaching sugar.
"Since we normally carry 70 kg, we receive about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each route," explains Anto, who normally makes three routes a day.
For each route it takes three hours, after which it is completely done, but at the end of the day it has 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) together.
What seems like a miserable reward for such an inhuman effort, however, is three times what he would earn from field work.
"The daily wage of the miners here, where 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) are paid per day for the coffee harvest and the average monthly income is two million rupees (167 euros), is very high," explains the porter, who previously worked as a bricklayer on the tourist island of Bali.
There he earned 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day, and the work was not so hard, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village nearby, for a reason as important as sulfur in Indonesia: "I married a girl from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I took her to Java to convert her to Islam".
Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs frequently and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases.
27-year-old Anto has been risking his life at Kawah Ijen for three years, whose sulfur has already left its first traces on him, although he covers his face with a mask and special glasses.
Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs frequently and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases from the volcano.
This is the price he has to pay to achieve his dream.
"I'm going to work here for two more years because I want to open a shop or learn Spanish or French," he promises in a more than just acceptable English.
This sympathetic and intelligent but life-punished young man could work as a tourist guide, waiter, or receptionist of a hotel, but instead he does the work of a carrying case.
He shares a dirty wooden hut with other carriers and gets up every morning at two o’clock because the sulfur also flows out at night, where its characteristic yellow color shines bluish in the darkness.
Challenging the shadows, he climbs into the crater in the light of a small headlamp on his helmet, which he has bought from his own money.
About 400 carriers load the baskets with sulfur on their shoulders at the crater floor.
Despite its large profits, the mining company has not mechanized sulfur mining to save costs, and does not supply any equipment to carriers who work on their own account and are paid by weight.
You will also not receive a share of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) surcharge per camera, which the guardians of this nature park together with the entrance fee of 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) require from the tourists who come to photograph the volcano and the human carrying donkey.
"This work is for the animals and not for humans," protests Madrusin, a stocky, 42-year-old carrier who has been working on Kawah Ijen for three decades since leaving school.
He is able to carry up to 110 kg and assures that he will carry on "as long as possible" because he needs the money to raise his three children between the ages of 10 and 18.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano was my whole life.
Even if the sulfur burns the throat and itches the eyes when the wind suddenly turns and traps the miners in the thick columns rising from the crater, the men are so hard that no one complains of serious illnesses... of course except the usual breathing problems, osteoarthritis, pain in the knees and blisters on the shoulders that have deformed from the weight of the baskets.
With the basket on his back, Unainik is only able to carry 50 kg at the age of 53.
Every day, he and his companions break 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which are transported by three trucks over a goat path between the bushes to the camp in Tamansari at a distance of 18 kilometers.
"I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano has been my whole life," Unainik explains, opening his mouth wide, missing some teeth.
Of his five children, the oldest also works as a sulfur carrier at the age of 30.
Time passes, but poverty persists generation after generation in one of the toughest professions in the world: that of those who work as human donkeys on Kawah Ijen.
Singapore Needs Babies to Save the Economy
Singaporeans blame the lack of children on the career, stress and cost of real estate and child rearing.
"The population of Singapore needs to grow."
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife: let us fulfill our civic duty and create life!
It seems unbelievable that the verses are part of an advertisement for mints, but nevertheless – or precisely because of this – they became a viral video on YouTube in Singapore at the beginning of this year.
The sentences are part of a rapper's song that features local sayings such as "Sliding will put a "bao" (leaf) in the oven to make fun of the low birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising company BBH, who shot the video, maintains the hope that the commercial will reach out in a fun way to draw attention to the problem.
Her creative director Douglas Hamilton says he wanted to use the power of music to get people to fulfill their “national duty.”
This is something just for the internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
This is the biggest problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world when it comes to reproduction, so we realized it was a topic we had to deal with.
We knew that the government had tried a lot, such as marketing perfume with pheromones or organizing speed dating nights (fast flirting).
It is possible that many of these ideas were creative, but they did not necessarily lead to success.
So we thought, why not do something as creative as possible to address this problem, such as composing a rap?
1,2 Children
Anyone who does not take this issue lightly is the government of Singapore.
Each year, she spends $1,300 on policies to encourage citizens to have more children.
A government package for married couples and parents grants up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave, and distributes tax benefits.
But so far everything has had little success.
Singapore is a rich, high-tech city-state in Southeast Asia that is also known for the conservatism of its rulers and its strict social controls.
According to its national population authority, the birth rate is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time this rate was above 2 — which is also known as the replacement rate — was in 1976.
So why don’t Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of marriage and family policy at the national population agency, says this is due to “better education” and “greater career opportunities.”
“This has allowed people, other than getting married and forming a family, to have significantly more options in terms of life goals and setting priorities,” she explains.
These changes in social conditions have contributed to the increase in the number of single people and the delay in marriage and births, the result of which is the reduction of the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy aimed at a drastic increase in immigration to counter population decline has led to resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites where the barely veiled xenophobia is flourishing against many new immigrants, especially the Chinese, who are criticized for keeping wages low and not integrating.
The rise in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why Singapore’s ruling party achieved its worst election result since independence last year.
Since the elections, an attempt has been made to correct the problem with higher contributions and levies for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the falling birth rate has the known impact on a nation’s economic growth, tax revenues, health care costs, and immigration policies, the example of Singapore also shows unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to ensure that not so many small apartments are built.
It also has an impact on the housing market.
The city development authority has begun to control the number of small apartments known as "shoe boxes" that can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a living space of 46 square meters and show a great sales success.
However, there is a concern that they can promote the lifestyle of the single person, and that they will discourage construction companies from building large apartments for families.
But Lim Yew Soon, general manager of real estate company EL Developers, says his “shoe boxes” can be sold much faster than larger housing units.
They are so popular, and the units are sold out by days and even weeks faster than the larger housing units.
As a result, they are much better for our cash flow.
He admits, however, that the new standards give developers clearer orientations, which were previously put in the way of obstacles if they wanted to build too many small housing units within a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city-state.
Even if these new rules could pave the way for a rise in the national birth rate, conversations with Singaporeans working in the financial district suggest that they will not have much impact.
"People are very stressed, the apartments and education are expensive, which is why it is postponed by many," says a young manager.
The children can get others.
“It’s important for me to have my own money and time,” says another, about twenty-year-old man.
Men and women cite their careers, stress, and the cost of property and education as reasons for not being able to have children.
That’s why Singaporeans have the last word when it comes to having children – there’s still so much the government can do.
The offline Private offline is online private
Privacy policy
According to the dictionary, this is the private property or "that area of private life where you are entitled to protection from any kind of interference."
What is private for someone under the age of 16?
How is this definition applied to his everyday life and social networks?
Does he understand the dangers that he exposes himself to when he makes public on the Internet situations that he would not share in real life?
El Peri<0xC3><0xB3>dico interviewed five young people between the ages of 10 and 15 who are often on the net.
In four of the cases, they linked the term to “something very personal” on a personal level and to “the password and the user” when they applied it to social networks.
“I wouldn’t reveal my deepest secrets in a post,” says 10-year-old Jorge while trying to explain the importance of “private” in websites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had accounts for two years.
"These are very confidential secrets, my mother may know them, but not the whole world," he confirms.
On FB I upload nice pictures or pictures of games.
I also spend my time with friends.
“I wouldn’t share a photo that isn’t mine, or someone doing the fool thing,” he says.
The boy is aware that it is wrong to publish obscene photos, of nudes, of crimes, or to write insulting or violent comments.
Jorge assures that he knows 35 friends he has on FB and nine followers on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
Including the mother who has the password to one of the accounts.
I signed up on Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if anyone is answering me, I'm just uploading them," he adds.
"The social networks are entertaining, I can quickly talk to relatives in the distance or with friends," he states.
When asked, he replied that he would never accept an invitation from an unknown person.
Even if someone recommended him a stranger, he would ignore it.
The case of 14-year-old Jose is different.
The teenager has user accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space, and Ask, and in Ask, he admits not to know 20 of the people he added to his friends list.
"That doesn't scare me because we have something in common, like music," he says.
According to the boy, no one gave him hints or asked him for his address or phone number.
"If someone is harassing me or demanding it from me, I just remove him from my user account," he admits.
José contacted Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The boy is not unfamiliar with experiences that are now known as cyberbullying.
A friend of mine was blackmailed on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He never knew who it was," he assures.
According to José, the victim did not close the user account.
“He just did it privately.”
After that, he explains a number of steps to securely configure a user account.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yeah, I'd do that if he's unsympathetic to me or I want to wipe him out.
"But I know this is cyberbullying," he explains.
Key questions
Marielos Porras, an English teacher with a university degree in education and learning, believes that in order to orient children and young people, it must be understood that it is the purpose of social networks to inform.
“The Internet was born as a medium for searching for information, but with the appearance of these pages, the rules of the game have changed,” she says.
Porras explains that academic Marc Prensky, who holds a master’s degree in pedagogy at Yale University and author of the work “Digital Natives and Immigrants” shaped these terms to explain the phenomenon.
The digital natives are they, the children and young people who have grown up with this technology.
"We are the digital immigrants who are supposed to teach them, while we are still learning ourselves," he says.
He explains that this is a complex issue, “because we require them to have a defined criterion about what may be disseminated, published or said, and this at an age where maturity is not sufficient for it.”
“They should also be picky when it’s most important to them to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences,” he adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to teach children and young people what privacy is is is to ask them questions that make them think.
“Telling them not to do it doesn’t work,” he says.
Porras then gives some options: There are things you wouldn’t tell a stranger. Then why do it on the Internet?
Or: Would you like to publish a photo of you, like the one you posted from a friend?
Do you know what others are posting about you?
Have you asked the other people’s permission before when you’ve labeled photos of celebrations?
And one more question: Do everyone need to know what you’re doing in each moment?
Another point is to let them understand that they need to trade online as they do offline.
They are the same rules.
“Someone outside the Internet acts with respect, morality and other principles, and the same must apply to social networks,” he explains.
Surveillance
Estuardo Guardia, university professor, primary school teacher and educational advisor, comments that it is essential that parents carefully read the guidelines of social networks.
When they understand all the sections, they have a solid foundation to talk to their children about the importance of opening a user account on the Internet.
"For example, age, or what you can share or publish," he explains.
According to Guardia, the children must be reminded of the lesson "You shall not speak to strangers".
Conclusion of the Unasur Summit without publication of the Lima Declaration
The 6th Summit of Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without publication of the Lima Declaration, which was previously announced and theoretically to be signed by the seven present leaders.
Efe repeatedly tried to gain access to the signed document at the Sixth Ordinary Session of the Heads of State and Government of the Unasur. Sources in the State and Presidential Chancellery initially announced that they would hand it over after the closure, but then stated that it would be published at some point on the website of the Peruvian government.
When asked about the text, they stated that the content was presented by the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, with brief statements to the press.
Journalists’ access to information about the summit was limited at all times.
During the day, only the image of the presidential meeting without sound was transmitted in the press room with the message "private session, limited audio".
The little information circulating among the journalists was received by the press officers of some of the Unasur governments present at the meeting, but not by the Peruvian press officer.
The only document that was circulated during the day was the list of participating presidents, which caused discomfort among the hundreds of journalists from different national and international media outlets demanding more information.
After that, the Peruvian presidential office sent an e-mail to the media with the "final statement" of the summit, but it was the Humala statement and not the official document for the conclusion of the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the Third Summit of South America - Arab States (ASPA), and even on this occasion, despite strong calls from the press, the so-called Lima Declaration, which had been announced earlier, was also not published.
On the official website of the ASPA, you can convince yourself that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities stressed that the information systems for journalists were in place, but they greatly limited access to information.
The summit also ended with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to accept a ruling by the Court of The Hague that settles a border conflict between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebasti<0xC3><0xA1>n Pi<0xC3><0xB1>era, met during the regional meeting and confirmed that they would accept the ICJ’s decision, which begins Monday in The Hague, in the process that Lima initiated against Santiago to hear the pleas from both sides.
“We will follow and execute the judgment on the differences that we are currently making to this international court,” Humala said along with his Chilean counterpart.
“Chile has been, is and will continue to be a country that adheres to international laws, seeks peaceful solutions to disputes, makes agreements and submits to international courts,” Pi<0xC3><0xB1>era added, greeting Humala with a handshake in front of the flags of both countries.
The confirmation by both presidents that they would submit to the ICJ came after Colombia, following a decision on the maritime borders with Nicaragua, which it considered a grave mistake, brought an action against the Bogot<0xC3><0xA1> Agreement, in which it agreed to submit to the judgments of this international court.
The summit was attended by the Presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, Venezuela, Hugo Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, which has been excluded from the Unasur since 2011 after the removal of its President Fernando Lugo, did not attend the meeting.
Host President Ollanta Humala opened the talks in the morning and concluded the summit meeting shortly after noon in Lima.
The head of state read out the final document, in which it announced that 16 decisions had been taken and that the lines of action for 31 projects between the South American countries had been set for an investment of a total of 17 billion dollars.
Regarding the decisions taken, he said that the Unasur countries "will take significant steps towards the goal of a South American citizenship, to which we extend the decisions on residence rights."
He said that measures would be taken to "improve cooperation in the fight against urban insecurity and organised transnational crime, as well as measures to improve access to medicines and the Internet at low prices in all areas of South America and to act jointly and efficiently in the event of natural disasters."
With the crisis in Europe, “economic consolidation (in Latin America) must not take on triumphant traits, but should serve to expand our production output and show our peoples a better future,” Humala added.
“We have decided to give priority to a series of 31 emblematic projects aimed at improving spatial connections in South America and especially in rural and border areas... thus uniting our countries and opening up new economic forms,” the president said in a statement.
Among these projects are five Peruvians, who were on the cross-axes of his territory from the coast to Brazil, and two of which are supposed to provide a better connection with Ecuador, although he gave no further details.
The final document also referred to the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve for its resumption in the Union of South American Nations," from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain an integrated region of prosperity and peace, with good neighbourly relations, was another aspect highlighted at the summit.
In this sense, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before starting his participation in the regional meeting that he expected to meet with his counterpart from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico, to treat the maritime conflict respectfully after a judgment of the ICJ questioned by Bogot<0xC3><0xA1>.
“I may meet with President Daniel Ortega tomorrow (Saturday),” Santos said.
"We will review all these routes - they are not exclusive, and the agreement with Nicaragua also requires talks with Nicaragua," he said.
"I hope to be able to tell President Ortega that we will treat this matter as civilized and respectfully as possible," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega will meet on Saturday in Mexico, where they intend to be present at the inauguration of the new president of that country, Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto.
As part of the summit, the bloc’s defence ministers also met in advance to adopt the 2013 action plan to strengthen dialogue and consensus on the defence of the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are members of UNASUR, although the latter country is currently excluded.
Peru is presided over by the regional bloc.
"South America must learn to integrate its citizens," says Rafael Correa
Ecuador’s President Rafael Correa confirmed today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal, with “South America can actually learn something from Europe.”
Correa, who attended the 6th Summit of Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) held in Lima, explained to state television in Peru that Europeans "killed themselves in World War II and other conflicts" and "are practically a homeland today."
In this sense, he defended the project of creating a South American citizenship that will drive the member states of Unasur forward.
“Free movement of citizens and workers in all South American countries must be achieved, as is already the case in the Andean community; however, there are still reactionary sectors that seek a return to the past,” he warned.
The President of Ecuador also supported the reorganization of the Organization of American States (OEA) with the aim of reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states and taking into account those who signed the San José Convention on Human Rights.
Those who teach never commit themselves to anything, and in return we South Americans always sign everything.
“It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is based in Washington and funded by the United States,” he said, referring to Ecuador’s political asylum granted to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa assured that he did not regret this decision because he did not betray his principles, but rather lived up to his “deep democratic values and views on human rights.”
He added that there were “reasonable suspicions at the time that Assange would be extradited to a third country and that his proceedings would not be followed.”
He also criticized the Swedish judiciary, which had asked him to be interrogated on his territory for an alleged sexual offence, while "Swedish jurisprudence allows this by means of a video conference that could have been carried out through the Ecuadorian embassy in London."
Correa explained that there was a risk that Assange’s health and mental health would be affected.
“I have not spoken to him since he was in our embassy, but the ambassador has informed me that he has a slight lung problem, but not a serious one,” Ecuador’s head of state said.
However, there is a risk that he will take physical and psychological damage because he is trapped in a narrow room and cannot perform physical exercises outdoors.
“That would affect the health of any person,” he added.
Correa stated that the solution to the asylum granted to Assange since June at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London was to grant him a free pass to travel to Ecuador, and that it was in the hands of the UK, Sweden and Europe’s legal authorities, stressing that talks had been held with London to find a solution for the imprisoned WikiLeaks founder.
We do not deal with human rights, we do not use this word in this case, but there have been constant discussions.
“The solution to this problem is in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe because Assange’s lawyer, Baltazar Garz<0xC3><0xB3>n, leads a number of proceedings in various European instances,” he said.
And “if Britain grants this carte blanche tomorrow, I think it’s done.”
And if Sweden interrogated Mr. Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London or via Skype, as Swedish justice allows and in other cases was done, the problem is solved.
Correa took the opportunity to confirm himself as a defender of press freedom, saying that what he does not tolerate are “the mediocrity, the evil intent and the lie that defy free speech.”
“The biggest enemies of press freedom are not the evil and perverse politicians, but bad journalists who aspire to profit and blackmail,” he said.
With this in mind, he congratulated Ecuador for no longer being dominated by such journalists “nor by the bankers or hegemonic and petty bourgeois countries,” and foreshadowed that in a re-election he would “deepen the revolution to continue the path in this right direction.”
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto against Paraguay in the Unasur at least until his next elections, arguing that the organism "must remain hard and not allow any opportunism and no coup d'état disguised as legal" because it "destroyed the legitimacy of democracy in Paraguay."
The President of Ecuador also considers the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, now and after the judgment of the International Court of Justice of The Hague, which favoured the maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime borders between the two countries, "absolutely justified."
At present, this judgment is not being implemented.
It is a problem between a South and a Central American state.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome in the pursuit of a common path.
They need to be treated comprehensively so that they can be overcome and looked forward.
He also relied on a good conclusion of the disputes over the maritime borders between Peru and Chile before the same court, saying that "it is right for Latin America to call international instances if both countries commit to accept the judgment, even if it is very hard."
Regarding the possibility that he will stand as a candidate for the next presidential election in Ecuador to achieve his third consecutive mandate, he stated that he sees this possibility "with a lot of optimism and joy, although sometimes it is also very difficult."
Correa assured that if he lost the elections in February 2013, he would withdraw from political life.
Power has never interested me personally, but under such unjust circumstances as in Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
"My political movement had the belief that it was I who guaranteed this likely victory, so I have to live up to this responsibility," he said.
If I win, it will be my last period as president, after which I will retire from public life.
The same applies if we lose.
“This is decided,” he said.
Correa also referred to the treatment of the health problems of the President of Venezuela, Hugo Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez, in Cuba.
I just spoke with the Vice President of Venezuela, Nicol<0xC3><0xA1>s Maduro, who told me that he had travelled there for planned, routine treatment and that he would be expected to be able to travel back to Cuba after the election campaign.
"In no case does it mean a relapse in the state of health of President Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez," he said.
The head of state of Ecuador took part in the 6th Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) in Lima today, which ended with a call for greater regional integration to ensure sustainable progress, equality and security.
Cause of death due to AIDS is now a too late detection
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed to be HIV-positive.
“It was like a bomb hit,” he says of the moment he received the diagnosis, which the doctor tried to “weaken” without any discernible success.
He hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness on his own and began to inform himself about it; and this with such dedication that he was just celebrating his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients of the HIV unit of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), where he came after several fights in 1994.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, which was hard to imagine at the beginning of the 90s, when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigma.
At the time, even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye “because it led to a cul-de-sac.”
At the time, AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome even with quality of life.
However, many people still come to the clinic who do not know about their illness and in which the virus has already caused damage and exhausted their immune system, and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the appearance of AIDS in the world, i.e. after the appearance of the first reported cases, "the great success today means that the survival of a patient who receives treatment in time and the survival of the general population are exactly the same," explained the head of the HIV unit of the HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, saying that this information had been supported in April of this year by a respected scientific publication.
Infectious diseases and HIV/AIDS expert Andrade Villanueva commented that since 2008, scientists have concluded that while AIDS is not a death sentence, years of survival and quality of life depended on the degree of impairment of the immune system of individuals at the start of treatment, and that those who are not drug-dependent have greater chances of counting: up to 30 years at a count of 200 CD4 and up to 30 years at a count of 200 CD4.
Simply put, the above statements mean that those who receive the diagnosis HIV-positive at the age of 25 can, in this sense, "easily live to be 75 years old as long as they are under control," explained this expert.
In order to be able to classify this progress correctly, it must be remembered that the life expectancy of Mexicans today is on average 76 years.
Even if mortality has decreased significantly in recent years (in Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS has decreased from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (ONUSIDA annual report), it is still true that 60 percent of the patients recorded in the national database have died since the appearance of AIDS.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and by the month of May of this year there have been 187 deaths; however, it is assured that universal access to antiretroviral medicines has been available since 2005.
- So why do people still die from it?
- In my opinion, the problem is not access to treatment.
This is my opinion, and so is in our hospital.
At least in the past 12 years, we have not had any supply problems with the drugs. The problem is that people come in a far advanced state because they do not know their state of infection, i.e. at very late stages of the disease.
He makes a striking statement: "Nine out of ten patients come to us if they already have an accompanying infection. In order to be able to influence global mortality, earlier diagnoses are required, which is why massive detection tests must be offered to all persons who need them."
This proposal is endorsed by the experts and officials of the Consejo Estatal de Prevenci<0xC3><0xB3>n del Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) (State Committee for the Prevention of AIDS in Jalisco) and also by patients such as Fabrizio, who had his test carried out at a private laboratory, and this for the only reason, because it had made a friend of him, who, despite his young age, was already in the AIDS-type of Kaphase.
Everything is different when you know you have AIDS.
Some think they are going to die and don’t want to hear anything.
"If I have to die, I'd rather burst three times," they say in my case.
The change was to improve, I eat well, exercise and take the medication.
Today his parents only know that he had cancer.
I live a normal life, just like everyone else.
"I work, do a lot, have an active but responsible sex life, I pay attention to my health and that of the other person," enumerates Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimate details with MILENIO JALISCO to animate with his testimony those who are afraid today as part of the global AIDS Day.
They should take the test if they belong to the risk group, the sooner they know if they are HIV positive, the better, and if they already know the diagnosis, they should learn how to live responsibly like everyone else.
His message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
There are big holes between the health programs and the ordinary citizen, explains Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara, who has taken on the cause of HIV.
And the most important thing is prevention.
In the designated places, "the distribution of condoms has actually been increased; previously they were given out individually, now they give us packages with a hundred pieces, which is already good, but there are still people who do not have access to a condom," he said.
Young people are at risk for new infections.
"Why do you need them?" is a common taunting question from social workers, orientation staff in schools, employees in pharmacies and in the health system, who do not want to expose themselves to adolescents, the correspondent assured.
He suggested reorienting this inefficient distribution; the condoms should not only be located behind the counter, but in dispensing devices in public toilets of facilities that are frequently visited by young people.
It does not promote promiscuity.
They should not be paid for the beer and motel, as the governor Emilio Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez responded to the question of whether conservatives would be distributed under his administration.
“Sexuality doesn’t look like that; it’s best to bring condoms closer to those who already engage in sexual activity,” he said.
Key Data of Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The state is ranked 4th nationally in new and cumulative AIDS cases, and 13th in terms of HIV.
92% of the infections are through sexual intercourse, 6% through the blood and 2% perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV because there are 4 or 5 people who do not know for each registered case.
After the United States Court of Appeals upheld a judgment that does not recognize the restructuring of the liabilities of the Vitro Group, which was reached through a trade bankruptcy in Mexico, an ominous precedent is set for any national company with branches in the neighboring country that has payment problems.
So you could say that the procedures for the survival of the companies that allow Mexican laws are not valid in the country of stars and stripes contrary to international agreements.
In practice, the June 15 recognition of Judge Harlin Hale’s ruling at the Bancarrotas Court for the Northern District of Texas leaves Mexican companies helpless in the confiscation of their property across the Bravo River.
However, the decision opens the door to the largest glass manufacturer in Mexico to appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States for three inconsistencies.
While the judge of the case points out that creditors must be subject to United States bankruptcy law, the Court of Appeals of the Fifth Circuit, based in New Orleans, first says that the main proceedings are the trade bankruptcy dealt with in Mexico.
The first point would mean that international cooperation in insolvency proceedings of companies with a cross-border profile is not known.
In fact, for this purpose, the United Nations Model Law for the Unification of International Commercial Law was created, using the American Law Institute as a mediator.
Secondly, the judgment provides that, without the votes of the companies, the majority required for the restructuring of the liabilities would not have been achieved after the recognition of the liabilities in the bankruptcy estate held by Vitro’s branches with their parent company.
However, this possibility is recognized by Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro is not the first case where this scheme has been approved.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose liabilities among group companies have been confirmed by the Instituto Federal de Concursos Mercantiles.
It is also true that, after deducting the votes of the branches, the creditors of Vitro, the creditors who sued Vitro in the courts of the United States, i.e. the vulture funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have achieved a majority.
The vote would have been 45 percent against 37 percent.
This is not taken into account by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, Vitro is to blame for his difficult situation as of 2008 in the context of the great economic crisis in the United States, which gave the country blows.
For this reason, the Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez Sada family appeals to the same Court of Appeal so that the vote will be taken in plenary, i.e. by all judges, because only three of them voted.
If this is not granted, the Cerciorare objection is filed, which demands the review of the proceedings by a higher court, in this case by the Supreme Court of the United States.
The weighting of this case is that the court set aside a document sent by the Government of Mexico under the Figura amicus curiae (Friend of the Court), which describes the proceedings conducted by Vitro under the Trade Bankruptcy Act, and which states that it had strictly adhered to the agreements signed by both countries in order to comply with Chapter 15 of the United States Bankruptcy Act.
It is also noted that the country has submitted to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the established rules on cases of cross-border insolvency, which guarantee the equality of debtors and creditors.
Two-banded carambole: a blow for vitro and for the country.
General balance sheet
After several months of non-progress in the aeronautical complaints filed by the Mexican trade unions against former owner Gast<0xC3><0xB3>n Azc<0xC3><0xA1>rraga Andrade, accused of fraudulent administration, the Asociaci<0xC3><0xB3>n Sindical de Pilotos Aviadores (Association of Pilots) has finally made progress.
The application, led by Carlos D<0xC3><0xAD>az Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez Morineau, has now filed a criminal case against the National Banking and Securities Commission, which is accused of obstruction of justice.
Accordingly, the supervisory authority systematically refused to inform the head office of the Republic of a transaction carried out by the entrepreneur in order to withdraw 198 million pesos from the fiduciary account F/589 of Bank IXE to the name Mexicana de Aviaci<0xC3><0xB3>n.
These funds were used for the acquisition of shares of the Administradora Profesional de Hoteles (professional hotel management).
As you know, Azc<0xC3><0xA1>rraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
Dragon Mart is surrounded.
At a weekend meeting at a University of the Caribbean forum, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, academics, entrepreneurs and general members of civil society decided to create a broad front to oppose the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Canc<0xC3><0xBA>n.
As you know, we are talking about a huge sales and distribution center in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean with products from the country beyond the wall, supplemented by a living area for the employees of 150 companies.
In advance, the Canacintra (the national chamber of the manufacturing industry) has managed to unite the governors in the southeast to oppose the monumental institution, which partially destroyed protected areas and is the mother of all threats to the industry.
ACTA is dead.
Because the government has failed to comply with a request from the Senate to explain the conditions and circumstances under which the Mexican ambassador to Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known by the English abbreviation ACTA, the matter has already been archived, according to the Mexican Institute of Intellectual Property.
As you know, these measures took place despite the fact that the Senate had disregarded the possibility because it considered them to be a violation of freedom of expression on social networks.
Homex long term
In an effort to pay long-term liabilities without affecting short-term liabilities, the construction company Homex is launching stock exchange certificates worth over 500 million pesos.
The issue is the first of four similar issues that promise an interest payment every 28 days.
Foundation of Competival
Formed from the companies NYCE, e-Qu<0xC3><0xA1>lity and Kernet, leading companies in information technology, a group of companies was founded under the name Competival, whose objective is the service market of the software clusters in Central and South America.
The corresponding investment is over $1.5 billion.
Héctor "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
The globetrotter of basketball, Héctor "Hetin" Reyes, has been associated with basket sport for more than 60 years and has traveled the whole world.
Few in Puerto Rico have such a large intellectual collection of the history of the country's basketball as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
Before being tied to a wheelchair by a stroke in 2008, Rexes was part of this sport for 6 years, be it as a lower-class player, player of the first national league, proxy and leader in the BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayam<0xC3><0xB3>n or president of the basketball federation.
"All my life, I put on many hats in basketball, even several at the same time, when I was president of the BSN, chief executive of the national team and president of the association in the 90s," Reyes recalled during a visit of Primera Hora at his home in Bayam<0xC3><0xB3>n, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes does not exaggerate with this statement.
The walls of his house are almost all decorated with photos and memories of his long career and testify to them.
Bayam<0xC3><0xB3>n in the heart
The most emotional memories are those that recall his time with the Vaqueros from the mid-1950s as a player until 1982, when he celebrated his 15th anniversary as co-director or managing director of the club.
"These were my best years, which I enjoyed the most, because I was allowed to be part of eight championships of the Vaqueros since 1967, be it as managing director, co-manager or coach.
There have been many fulfilling years, including the five successive championships from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye with a championship in 1981, the year of Jerome Mincy’s debut at BSN.
From then on, "Cuco" took over Ortiz, who was a very good administrator," says Reyes.
I remember Gene Bartow, who worked here as a coach and was employed at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), told me: "I have a very strong and 2 m tall player.
Do you want him?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico has ever had.
Bartow then recommended free throw specialist Raymond Gausse, who was naturalized and one of our best throwers.
I remember him saying that if Mincy had allowed one championship for Bayamon, Gausse would provide another.
The championship of the Vaqueros with Gausse was granted to him, but already from a distance, because in 1988 he was already at the top of the association.
At that time, he preferred to enjoy his executions and those of Mincy in the national team.
I remember when we first won the pre-Olympic tournament in Mexico against the USA.
After that came the 1990 World Cup, where we took fourth place, which should have been bronze, if not for this Canadian referee who let us repeat the last turn for the second time, Reyes said.
Was this group of the 1990 World Cup the best national team you’ve ever seen?
She is one of the best, as well as the one who won at the 2004 Olympics against the Dream Team.
My favorite, however, is the team at the 1991 Pan American Games in Cuba, where we won gold and offered a fight to the USA team, as they did when they won bronze against us at the World Cup.
Not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico L<0xC3><0xB3>pez and "Picul<0xC3><0xAD>n" (Ortiz) were back with the team, but also the young players (Javier) "To<0xC3><0xB1>ito" Col<0xC3><0xB3>n and James Carter, the brothers Le<0xC3><0xB3>n (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not be there because of a knee injury in 1990.
A team that was perhaps not the best in terms of personalities, but with which we won a gold medal and which gave us great pleasure, was that of the pre-Olympic tournament 1995 in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner as a substitute for the suspended players because of the events at the Pan American Games in Mar del Plata, we won the gold medal against any prognosis.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
That was without a doubt Picul<0xC3><0xAD>n Ortiz.
His numbers at the level of international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated this level as much as Picul<0xC3><0xAD>n.
And this, without taking into account his career in the different leagues in which he played.
Who was the best coach in Puerto Rico?
This is a difficult question.
We had a number of good coaches like Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
I like the work of Leo Arill.
What do you think is the best thing you have achieved in the band?
I was part of the most successful era of the national team from 1988 to 1995, which included the BSN at the beginning of the 90s up to 17 teams in one season.
What do you have left to do?
There are things I would have introduced, such as the regionalization of the lower categories.
That the boys in Ponce, for example, only play in their area and only meet teams from other corners of the island in the national playoffs.
Today, the children make unnecessary trips and games.
At least I see the result of the prescribed training and courses for coaches, table officials and referees.
I'm proud of that.
What are you doing today?
I like to listen to music, watch videos of music of my time on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and occasionally I go to a basketball game.
And of course I enjoy the company of my wife Isabel, who was always by my side.
Larry Hagman is dead.
Born in Forth Worth, Texas, on September 21, 1931, Larry Hagman became famous worldwide for his role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R." in the television series "Dallas", where he played a ruthless, insidious and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as oil magnate J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of the greed of the 1980s, has died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who came back this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas," died Friday afternoon due to cancer complications, according to a family news release to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., producer of "Dallas."
“Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, where he once again played the iconic role he liked the most,” the family said.
Larry’s family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for the Thanksgiving celebrations.
Linda Gray, who played his wife’s role in the original and follow-up series, was with Hagman when he died in the Dallas hospital, her publicist Jeffrey Lane said.
He brought joy to all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, funny, loving and talented, and I will miss him very much.
"He was an original person and lived life to the fullest," Gray said in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992, and he admitted that he had been drinking heavily for years.
In 1995, a malignant tumor was detected in his liver, and he underwent a transplant.
In the years before "Dallas", Hagman became known on television as a nice guy in the years 1965 to 1970 with the sitcom "Adorable Jeannie" of the television station NBC.
There he played the astronaut Tony Nelson, whose life is turned upside down when he meets an attractive "jinn" (played by Barbara Eden) who will live at his home.
He was also a performer of two short-lived comedies, such as "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His cinematic work included critically acclaimed roles in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his masterful interpretation of the enchantingly despicable J.R. that made Hagman a superstar.
The dramatic series of the CBS television chain about the Ewing clan and other characters in their environment was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The ad slogan "Who shot at J.R.?", which was supposed to create expectation for an episode full of emotions where Hagmann's character was nearly killed, led to international speculation, and millions of dollars were wagered in betting houses.
This set the series a viewing record at the time.
When the answer became known in a chapter in November 1990, it was seen by an average of 41 million viewers who turned "Dallas" into the second most watched entertainment program since the end of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million viewers.
It was Kristin, the sister-in-law of J.R. (interpreted by Mary Crosby) who had shot.
J.R. had impregnated her and threatened to portray her as a prostitute if she did not leave the city, but others had reasons for wanting to see him dead.
Hagman interpreted the role of Ewing as a corrupt, insatiable man with a charismatic smile: a sneaky businessman and unfaithful husband who aspired to have his alcoholic wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), assigned.
"I know what's on J.R.'s gravestone," Hagman said in 1988.
It should be called "Here Rests the Honourable Citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only business he hasn’t won.
Victoria Principal, co-star of the original series, recalled Hagman on Friday as an “enormous personality on and off screen.”
It is unforgettable and irreplaceable for millions of admirers in the world, and it remains in our hearts for those of us who have been fortunate enough to know and love it.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with great success on the television channel TNT.
The recording of five chapters for the second season was completed, and a sixth chapter was just filmed, the station informed.
There was no immediate explanation from Warner or TNT as to how the loss of Hagmann would be dealt with in the series.
Born in Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who played classic works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when she got Larry during her marriage to attorney Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck on the theatre stages in New York in the early 1950s, after which he served in the Air Force in England from 1952 to 1956.
There he met the young designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in the Californian city of Malibu, where many celebrities live.
In 2001, he titled his memoir "Hello Darlin: Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
“I didn’t write anything that I believed could harm someone or affect them in any way,” he told the Associated Press at the time.
After the liver transplant, he campaigned for liver donations and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to help anxious patients.
"I advise them, give them courage, I meet with them when their operations are imminent and afterwards," he explained in 1996.
I want to give them some comfort, such as "don't worry, it's a bit uncomfortable the first time, but you'll be fine".
He also campaigned against smoking and participated in several campaigns.
Beginning of the course that studies the "end of the world"
Each week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, virus and germs, and global warming.
Every semester, when the professor of religion decided to hold a course on the end of the world, he knew he had an irresistible fishing hook: the end of the Mayan calendar’s “long backwards count” on December 21, which many people believed meant the end of the world.
But Charmé had no idea what to expect over the next two months: the destructive hurricane Sandy, which some have called "Deudarmaggedon," as well as a growing conflict involving Israel, the place Christian theorists believe the apocalypse begins.
"I didn't realize that this will be the most apocalyptic semester ever," Charmé told students at Rutgers-Camden University (New Jersey) this week.
If someone were to analyze what happened in the world today as if we were thirty days away from it, this would be a really good period.
And he reminds us that the bad is good for those with an apocalyptic mentality.
And he’s not the only professor who offers courses on the “end of the world” this semester, which should actually be the last in history.
In Temple, Professor Barry Vacker gives the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World."
Each week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, virus and germs, and global warming.
“We analyze why these ideas spread over time,” he said, as well as the way hypothetical scenarios are offered that lead to a particular human behavior.
If nuclear material gets into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month, the students analyzed films with apocalyptic content and looked at how they compare to real life.
"I've been trying to inform students about what's possible, likely, credible, and impossible," Vacker said.
On the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, Professor of Latin American History Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an attending Professor of Art History and Anthropology, formed a team to offer a course called simply “The End of the World.”
“We don’t pick up 2012 so we always have the option to hold the course again in case the world doesn’t go down,” Restall said.
Despite the "prominent doom," students must study, create projects, and take part in final exams.
In Penn State, the final exam is held on the eve of the apocalypse, which is why students have no other chance than to “continue working until nightfall, where the world is supposed to end,” Restall said.
The courses were very popular.
“In two hours, there were no more places,” Restall said of his course for high-average students, which filled with 35 students.
For weeks before the start of the semester, we received e-mails from students asking if there were still places available.
Students, for their part, assure that the course is one of the most interesting.
“It’s fascinating to see what people are doing to comfort themselves,” said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student in Rutgers-Camden for religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey.
The apocalyptic sect or religious mentality is actually only a matter of consolation or its absence.
25-year-old psychology and nursing student Will Wekesa said he had seen all the apocalyptic films.
"I have never heard of a class where this is being taught," he said.
I'm enjoying it.
But none of the students surveyed – and less so a professor – declared to believe in the last date of December 21.
“Our first project dealt with the prophecy of the Mayans, and in a certain way we discredit them,” said Julie Zeglen, a student last year at Temple, 21 years old and from West Chester.
The Mayans never predicted the end of the world; it’s just a key point in the calendar, Restall said.
He notes, however, that there is an apocalyptic fear in Western society that dates back several centuries when people reacted to changes in their environment by predicting the end of the world.
The internet has increased this speculation.
“People elsewhere don’t think that way,” he says.
This is mainly the case in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the University of La Salle, who is teaching in the Philippines this year, quickly responds to the question of whether he would know a course on the “end of the world” there.
"The Philippines does not participate in the end of the world," he wrote as a hint of an exception from a higher authority.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall pointed out that over the years many days have been spoken of by the Last Judgment, saying that if nothing happens on December 21, “people immediately think of a new date” or philosophizing about it, that December 21 was the beginning of a seven-year period after which the end of the world would come.
Students and professors take this date lightly.
Several said they would like to go to celebrations about “the end of the world.”
“Maybe I’ll call a few friends so we can laugh together,” said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
