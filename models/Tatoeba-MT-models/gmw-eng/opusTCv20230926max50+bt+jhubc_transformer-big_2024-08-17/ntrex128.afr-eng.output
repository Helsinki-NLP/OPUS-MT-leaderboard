Members of the Welsh Assembly are worried they're going to look "as silly"
There is consternation among some assembly members over the proposal to change their title from AM'e to MWP'e (for Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This was caused by plans to change the name of the meeting to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of across the political spectrum are afraid that it could provoke a mockery.
One Labour Party member says his group is concerned because "it rhymes with Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means stupid and pwp means feces.
A meeting member of the Plaid Cymru party said the group as a whole was "not happy" and suggested alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said his group was "receptive" about the name change, but noted that it was a short speech jump from MWP to Muppet, the British equivalent of fool or fool.
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced like the Yorkshire-English pronunciation of the letter u.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the name changes, said: "The final decision on any descriptions of what are called Assembly members will, of course, be a matter for the members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of public consultation on the proposals that received generous support for calling the meeting a Welsh Parliament.
As for the AMs' title, the Commission preferred Welsh Parliament Members or WMPs, but the MWP option received the most approval in a consultation with the public.
AM's are apparently proposing alternatives, but the battle to get consensus could be a headache for chairman Elin Jones, who is due to table a bill on the changes within weeks.
The legislation on the reforms will also include other changes to the working methods of the meeting, including rules on disqualification of AMs and the design of the committee system.
AM'e will get the last say in the question of what they should be called when they debate the legislation.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday whether to change their country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia."
The plebiscite was organized in an attempt to settle a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which itself has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has been insisting for some time that the name of its neighbour in the north represents a claim to its territory and has repeatedly objected to its applications for membership in the EU and NATO.
Macedonia's President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the plebiscite on the name change, said he would ignore the vote.
Supporters of the referendum, however, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells are ringing because churches in Harlem are struggling
"Historically speaking, the old people I spoke to said there was a bar and a church on every corner," Adams said.
"None of them are there today."
He says that the disappearance of Kroeger is understandable.
"People are socializing in other ways these days," he says.
"Croatia is no longer the family rooms where people go regularly."
As far as churches are concerned, he is concerned that the money from asset sales will not last as long as leaders expect, "and sooner or later they are back exactly where they started."
Churches, he adds, can be replaced by apartment buildings with condominiums full of the type of people who won't help the neighborhood's remaining refuges.
"The vast majority of people who buy units in these buildings will be white," he says, "and will therefore bring the day that these churches completely close even closer, because most of the people who move into these condominiums are unlikely to become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis - Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved away in the 1930s.
A black congregation that worshiped nearby took over the building's title.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers in 125th Street, a main shopping street in Harlem, which did not want to hire or promote black people.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but while Father Johnson's members were making plans to rebuild it, they ordered the carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the carillon "the poor people's bells."
The expert who played the carillion in July called it something else: "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first carillon in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather says that Saint Martin's did not replace him.
What has happened at St. Martin's in recent months is a complex story of architects and contractors, some brought in by the lay leaders of the church, others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The church council, the congregation's governing body, which consists of lay leaders - wrote to the diocese in July with concern that the diocese "will try to transfer the costs" to the church council, even though the church council was not involved in the appointment of the architects and contractors who sent the diocese.
Some parishioners complain about a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark injuring 13-year-old on crayfish dive in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday when he dived for lobster on the first day of the California lobster season, officials said.
The attack occurred shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was diving with friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy scream for help and then rowed with a group to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel says he first thought it was just the excitement of a first lobster catch, but then he realized "that he's calling, 'I've been bitten!
I'm pissed off!'
His whole collarbone was torn open," Hammel saw as he reached the boy.
"I told everyone to come out of the water, 'There's a shark in the water!'
The boy was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where his condition is described as critical.
It is not known which shark species is responsible for the attack.
Lifesaver captain Larry Giles said at a media briefing that a shark was spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim sustained traumatic injuries to the upper part of his upper body.
Officials have closed beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and safety reasons.
Giles notes that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to expand into UK beauty market
Sainsbury's says Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams are battling with department store-type beauty aisles staffed by specialist assistants.
As part of a major expansion in the UK's <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion beauty market, which continues to grow as sales of fashion and homeware decline, the larger beauty aisles will be tested in 11 stores across the country and if successful next year will be taken to more stores.
The investment in beauty occurs as supermarkets look for ways to fill shelves once used for TVs, microwaves, and homeware.
Sainsbury's says it will double the size of its available beauty products to 3,000, which will include brand names such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline, and Burt's Bees will also gain more space with brand-specific areas similar to those seen in stores like Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its Boutique grime range so that the majority of products are vegan-friendly - something that more and more younger shoppers are insisting on.
In addition, perfume retailer The Fragrance Shop will test concessions in two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened last week in Croydon in South London and a second which will open later this year in Selly Oak in Birmingham.
Internet shopping and a move to smaller amounts of food purchased daily from local convenience stores means supermarkets need to do more to persuade people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, the CEO of Sainsbury's, said the stores are starting to look more like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to fight back against the discount stores Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and also launched a number of Habitat outlets since it bought both these chains two years ago, which they say has boosted grocery sales and made the purchases more profitable.
The supermarket's previous attempt to renew its beauty and pharmacy departments has failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the relationship ended after an argument over how to split profits from the pharmacies within its stores.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281 store pharmacy business for <0xC2><0xA3>125m to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, three years ago.
It says Lloyds will play a role in the plan by offering an extensive range of luxury skincare products, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's' trade director, said: "We have transformed the look and feel of our beauty aisles to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be on hand to offer advice.
Our range of brand names are designed to meet every need and the enticing environment and convenient locations mean we are now an imperative beauty destination that challenges the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones 'angry' after Holly Willoughby withdraws from <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones walked away "angry" after TV presenter Holly Willoughby withdrew from a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with his lifestyle brand business to focus on her contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their home clothing and accessories brand, Truly.
The couple's business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand name.
The This Morning presenter, 37, announced on Instagram that she was withdrawing.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons Den star Peter Jones enraged by withdrawing from their lucrative lifestyle brand business at the last minute - to focus on her own giant contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "enraged" when TV's golden girl announced at a tense meeting at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire on Tuesday that her new opportunities - worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million - meant she could no longer spend enough time on their homewear and accessories brand, Truly.
The business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand name and would have doubled Willoughby's estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11 million fortune.
While Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones climbed onto a jet and traded Britain for one of his holiday homes.
A source said: "Holly's top priority was by far.
It would be her long-term future that would carry her through the next few decades.
Her decision to leave her was completely unsettling.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, it was so close to the launch.
There's a warehouse full of goods at Marlow headquarters that's ready to be sold."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the This Morning presenter, one of Britain's most money-making stars, could drive the firm millions out of the bag due to the sheer investment in products ranging from cushions and candles to clothing and housewear, and the possibility that its launch could encounter even more delays.
This could be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for 10 years.
Willoughby co-founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
The couple are on vacation together and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm a Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We will not comment on his business affairs."
Hard words: "We're falling in love"
He ridiculed criticism he was going to receive from the news media for making a comment that some would consider "unprecedented" and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in his "newsreader's voice."
"I didn't give up anything."
He mentioned that Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump described their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
But negotiations on nuclear disarmament have stalled.
North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday, more than three months after the June leaders' meeting in Singapore, that the North did not see a "corresponding response" from the U.S. to North Korea's early disarmament activities.
Instead, he noted, the U.S. continues to face sanctions aimed at sustaining the pressure.
Trump has taken a much more optimistic stance in his assembly speech.
"We are doing very well with North Korea," he said.
"We were on our way to start a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
We have this wonderful relationship."
He says his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results - this has ended rocket tests, helped free hostages, and caused the remains of U.S. soldiers to be brought back home.
And he defended his unusual approach to descriptions of relationships with Kim.
"It's so easy to be presidential, but instead of 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded arena, we would have had almost 200 people just standing there," Trump said as he pointed to the crowd right in front of him.
Typhoon wave and earthquake in Indonesia devastated island, killing hundreds
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were told they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population has been uprooted, no national disaster has been announced, a prerequisite for catalyzing international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they were very clear that they were not asking for international aid, which makes it a bit difficult," Sumbung told me.
Although Save the Children is busy putting together a team to travel to Palu, it is not certain whether foreign personnel can work on the ground.
National Disaster Agency spokesperson Mr Sutopo said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the assistance effort.
Given the ongoing earth-shaking that Indonesia is enduring, the country remains woefully ill-prepared for the wrath of nature.
While tsunami shelters were built in Aceh, they are not a common sight on other coastlines.
The apparent lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu probably contributed to the loss of life, even though it was a warning of force.
It is at its best challenging to travel between Indonesia's numerous islands.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has made improving Indonesia's patchy infrastructure a focal point of his election campaign, spending money on roads and railways.
But Mr. Joko's administration is plagued by funding shortages as he faces re-election next year.
Mr. Joko also faces pressure from sloshing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of the faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands displaced as Christian and Muslim gangs with machetes, arrows and bows, and other primitive weapons fought in the streets.
Watch: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge kicks good equaliser against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss to Chelsea on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London with a goal in the 89th minute.
Xherdan Shaqiri surrendered to Sturridge when he was about 30 years out of the Chelsea goal and his team 1-0 behind.
He tapped the ball to the left before kicking far to the goal post.
The attempt sailed high over the frame as it hovered to the top right corner of the net.
Finally, the ball tumbled over a jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
"It was just trying to get into that position, to get on the ball, and players like Shaq always play forward as much as possible, so I was just trying to create as much time as possible for myself," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming and tapped once and didn't think too much about it and just kicked."
Chelsea were 1-0 ahead at half-time after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a goal in the 25th minute.
The Blues' goal kicker played back to Mateo Kovacic in that playing space with a back kick before tossing near midfield and narrowing into the Liverpool halves.
Kovacic quickly received and reported in midfield.
With a beautiful forward kick, he then led Hazard into the frame.
Hazard overtook the defence and ended up with a left-footed kick past Liverpool's Alisson Becker in the farthest goal net.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy on Wednesday at 3 p.m.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
Death toll rises to 832 after Indonesian tsunami
The death toll in Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami has climbed to 832, the country's disaster agency said early on Sunday.
It has been reported that many people have been trapped under the rubble of buildings that collapsed the earthquake, which struck at a magnitude of 7.5 on Friday, causing burns of up to 20 feet, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Palu, with its more than 380,000 people, was littered with the rubble of collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after woman was stabbed to death
A murder investigation was launched after the body of a woman was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old was found knifed in Grayson Mews on John Street at 7.55 a.m., and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police urged people in the area who had heard or seen anything to come forward.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is at an early stage but I would appeal to anyone who has been around John Street in Birkenhead who has seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I also call on anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have caught anything on dashcam footage, to contact us as they may have information that may be indispensable to our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a Birkenhead resident and that she was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who believe they know the woman arrived at the scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
Investigations continue as police say they are in the process of informing the victim's next of kin.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews had just tried to return to his apartment but was told by police that no one was allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
Residents are now told it will take hours before they are allowed in again.
A police officer was heard to tell one man that the entire area was now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared in tears at the scene.
She kept saying, “It’s so horrible.”
At 2 p.m., there were two police cars inside the cordon with another car just outside.
A number of officers were left inside the cordon to monitor the block apartments.
Anyone with information is asked to call <0x40>MerPolCC to DM, 101 or to call Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 with log 247 of 30 September as a reference.
Parliament's Cromwell Statute Becomes Latest Commemoration Hit With 'Rewriting History' Twist
His banishment would be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious artefacts performed by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as "foolishness" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Association, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate over the removal of statutes that the figure of Oliver Cromwell would become a target outside the Palace of Westminster.
The iconoclasm of the English civil wars was not yet carried out by Cromwell's orders.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the deeds of his ancestor Thomas in the last century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent portrayal of Cromwell is evidence of 19th-century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure that many believe is still memorable.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case of course the monarchy.
Whether this is a completely accurate depiction is the subject of ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid-17th century gave form to the later development of our nation, and that Cromwell is an individually recognisable figure representing one side of that separation.
His success as a patron is also worthy of celebration and commemoration."
The murder of a Chinese farmer
According to local media reports, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in southwest China.
The man, identified only by his van, "Yuan", was found dead with a torn artery covered with blood near a cage at the market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer prepared to inject pigs with vaccines at a pig farm in Xining of Qinghai province, China.
He reportedly traveled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and found a door open to a neighboring pig farm.
He said there was a large male pig in the cage with blood on its mouth.
A forensic examination confirmed that the 550-pound pig had bitten the farmer to death.
"My cousin's legs were bloodied and torn," the cousin, who was named on his van, "Wu," said, quoting the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed the man does not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening New that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking someone else, while police collected evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and the market authorities are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although strange, cases of pigs that attack humans have been reported before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man with critical injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 650-pound pig strapped a Welsh farmer to his tractor until his wife deterred the animal.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBS News that pigs were not normally aggressive but that the taste of blood could act as "faster."
"It's just playful.
They're cocky, very curious... they're not out to hurt you.
You just have to show them the right amount of respect," he said.
Rest of Hurricane Rosa is going to bring widespread heavy rain to southwestern U.S.
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it moves across the cooler waters of Mexico’s north coast.
Rosa, however, will bring torrential rain across northern Mexico and the southwestern U.S. over the coming days.
Rosa had easterly winds of 85 mph, a Category 1 hurricane, on Sunday from 5 a.m., and was positioned 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a trough over the Pacific Ocean is beginning to take shape and move eastward to the west coast of the U.S. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will start to propel heavy tropical humidity northward into the southwestern U.S.
Rosa will bring rain of up to 10 inches in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, in response to the approaching trough, tropical humidity will bring widespread heavy rainfall to the southwest over the coming days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous flash floods, waste flow, and possibly landslides in the desert.
Heavy tropical humidity will cause spot-spot rainfall rates of up to 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
As much as 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in parts of the southwest, especially over the largest parts of Arizona.
Flooding is possible with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
It would be extremely unwise to venture on foot into the desert with the danger of tropical rainfall.
Heavy rains can cause deep gorges to hit raging rivers, and thunderstorms will bring fierce local winds and dust clouds.
The approaching trough will bring some local heavy rain to parts of Southern California's coastline.
Rainfall totals of more than half an inch are possible, which can cause minor waste flow and smooth lanes.
This will be the region's first rainfall of the wet season.
Some scattered tropical rains will approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday before the rains become more widespread late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rains will spread to the Four Corners on Tuesday and last until Wednesday.
October can see intense temperature fluctuations across the U.S. as the North Pole gets cooler, but the tropics remain very hot.
This sometimes leads to dramatic temperature changes over short distances.
A good example of dramatic temperature differences across the central U.S. is on Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of nearly 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the summer heat will rise and expand again.
Large parts of the central and eastern U.S. are expected to begin hot October, with widespread 80s from the Southern Low Plains to parts of the Northeast.
The city of New York can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a higher chance of above-average temperatures for the eastern U.S. for the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watch Brett Kavanaugh trial
More than 20 million people watched the sweeping testimony of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and Christian Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of a sexual assault that allegedly occurred in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political deadlock has continued, with broadcasters interrupting regular programming for Friday's on-the-riddle turnout: an agreement brokered by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent sure Kavanaugh was groping her intoxication and trying to take off her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a passionate testimony, said he was 100 percent sure it didn't happen.
It's likely that more than 20.4 million people watched it on Friday, Nielsen reported.
The company has counted average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Figures weren't immediately available to other networks that showed it, including PBS, C-SPAN, and the Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen sometimes finds it difficult to measure people watching in offices.
To put it in perspective, it's an audience the size of one for a decisive football game or the Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose opinion hosts strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, had all the networks ahead by an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day-long trial, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Interest has always been high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that he was going to vote in favor of Kavanaugh, he was caught Friday morning on CNN and CBS where objectors yelled at him as he tried to take an elevator to a Judicial Committee.
He stood for a few minutes with his eyes down as CNN vividly visualized how he was being maligned.
"I'm standing right here in front of you," one woman said.
"Do you think he's telling the truth?"
It was said to him, "You have power while so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office issued a statement and before the elevator door closed said he would have more to say at the committee hearing.
The cable and broadcast networks all covered live hours later when the Judicial Committee would vote to promote Kavanaugh's nomination to the full Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he would only do so with the understanding that the FBI would look at the allegations against the candidate for the next week, as requested by the Democrat minority.
Flake has been partially convinced by talks with his friend, Democrat Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators afterwards, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice was powerful because it was obvious that Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
UK’s EM May accuses critics of ‘political game’ over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "political play" with Britain's future and undermining national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May arrives for the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview alongside the one with her on the front page of the newspaper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson continued his attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying a proposal that Britain and the EU should collect each other's tariffs was "totally ridiculous."
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson in LSU player's death
Police have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and arrested on a charge of second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the scramble.
Police recovered the glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, CBS affiliate WAFB reported.
After questioning Simpson, police said he had admitted to shooting Wayde dead.
His bail was set at $350,000, the lawyer reported.
East Baton Rouge Parish's judicial coroner's office issued a preliminary report on Friday saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head at the neck.
The department praises the Louisiana State Police's fugitive task force, the state police's crime lab, Southern University police and area residents for their assistance with the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU athletics director Joe Alleva thanked area law enforcement for his “zeal and pursuit of justice”.
Sims was 20 years old.
The six-foot-six forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
His average last season was 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "flattened" and "shocked" over Wayde's death.
"That's what you're worried about all the time," Wayde said.
Volcano spits like in Mexico City
As spitting out of the Popocatepeti volcano reached the southern neighborhoods of Mexico’s capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity picked up in the crater and registered 183 releases of gas and ash in 24 hours.
The center monitored multiple thumpings and shakings.
Images on social media showed thin layers of gas covering car windshields in neighborhoods of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists noted an increase in activity at the volcano, which sits 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital since an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.1 struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo," has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists to commemorate independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police, joining thousands in anti-government protests to commemorate the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarizing vote for secession.
A group of masked pro-separatists held back by riot police bombarded them with eggs and threw powder paint that caused dark dust clouds on streets usually teeming with tourists.
A stud also broke out later in the day and the police had to use their batons to keep the fighting in check.
Over several hours, pro-independence groups sang "No Forget, No Forgiveness" in one tone in confrontation with the unionists' cry of "Long Life Spain".
Fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries sustained in the marches, the local press reported.
Tensions are still running high in the independence-minded region a year after the October 1 referendum was deemed illegal by Madrid but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
Voters overwhelmingly voted to become independent but participation was low, with those against secession largely boycotting the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police attempted in violent clashes to prevent voting at polling stations across the region.
Pro-independence groups camped overnight on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The protest continued but was forced to take a different route.
Narciss Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist demonstration with his wife, said he was no longer hopeful for the prospect of Catalonia gaining independence.
"Last year we had one of the best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy because they could vote, but now we are stuck," he said.
Despite a vital but messy victory in regional elections last December, Catalonia's pro-independence parties struggled to maintain momentum this year, with many of their best-known leaders either in self-imposed exile or in custody for their role in organizing the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the demonstration on his phone in support of the police, said the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more and more stressful," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial detention since late last year, announced that he would stand in European Parliament elections next year.
"Standing as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to disapprove of the deterioration in democratic values and the oppression we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after car against house vasry
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car repeatedly crashed into a house in Londonderry.
The incident unfolded on Thursday at about 19:30 BST in Ballynagardsingel.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said damage was done to the gates and the building itself.
A crossbow may also have been shot at some point after the car.
Menga goal gives Livingston 1-0 victory over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secures victory
Promoted Livigston stunned Rangers to transfer Steven Gerrard to just his second loss in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's goal was proof of the difference when Gary Holt's team moved with Hibernian to second.
Gerrard's team remained without a win in the Premiership this season and will face the forerunners Heart next week, who are eight points ahead of them.
Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston extends their unbeaten run in the division to six games, with head coach Holt still not enjoying a defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston squanders chances against bot visitors
Holt's team must have been in the lead long before they scored a goal, with their busty nature that got Rangers into all sorts of trouble.
SR broke through, but slid in front of the goaltender, then AL could only play wide after coming closer and meeting CH's header across the goaltender.
The hosts were content to let Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could get the visitors with death spells.
And so came the decisive goal.
Rangers gave up a free kick and Livingston created an opportunity, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson together giving Menga the chance to kick and score a goal from the center of the frame.
By then, Rangers had dominated possession but were unable to penetrate home defense and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was largely unconcerned.
That pattern continued in the second half even though Alfredo Morelos forced a backlash from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was dismissed by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow tipped wide to avoid still open play from Livingston.
Crossings repeatedly reached Livingston’s frame and repeatedly stopped, while two penalties – after Halkett’s challenge from substitute Glenn Middleton and one for handball – were turned away.
‘Phenomenal’ by Livingston – analysis
Alasdair Lamont at the Tony Macaroni Arena
Fantastic game and results for Livingston.
Up to the last man was excellent; they still surpassed expectations on this upward trajectory.
Their style of play and teaming have remained virtually unchanged since their return to first-class, but a great deal of credit has come to Holt for the way he has strengthened the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Hackett was huge with his magnificent defensive ranking, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their toes all the time.
The Rangers were short of inspiration.
As good as they were at times under Gerrard, they could not maintain those standards.
Their final ball was missing and only once they were able to pass through the home team, which is somewhat of a wake-up call for Rangers, who find themselves in mid-division.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an receives mixed reception in Cologne
There were smiles and blue skies on Saturday (29 September) when leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which had to restore relations between NATO allies.
They have had a fallout on issues that include human rights, press freedom and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdogan is set to open a new mosque in Cologne.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police cited security reasons to prevent the 25,000-strong crowd from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters showed up to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters – many of them Kurdish – have also raised their voices, condemning both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him into the country.
The fighting protests reflect the divisiveness of a visitor hailed as a hero by some German Turks and hailed as an autocrat by others.
Deptford road accident: Cyclist dies in collision with car
A cyclist has died in a collision in London involving a car.
The collision occurred around 10:15 BST near the junction of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford in the southeast of the city.
The driver of the car stopped and paramedics were present, but the man died at the scene.
The collision comes months after another cyclist died in a hit-and-run in Childers Street, about a mile from where Saturday's accident occurred.
The Metropolitan Police said officers were working to identify the man and notify his next of kin.
Road closures and bus bypasses are in place and motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Detainees Injured in Riot
Six guards were injured in a riot at a high-security manslaughter prison, the prison office said.
The riot broke out around 9:30 a.m. on Sunday and is still underway at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire.
Specialist "Tornado Guardians" were called in to deal with the riot, which included eight inmates and was limited to one wing.
The guards were treated at the scene for minor facial injuries.
A prison service spokesman said: "Specially trained prison staff have been deployed to address an ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members are being treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and make it clear that those responsible will be referred to the police and can stay behind bars longer."
HMP Long Martin is home to more than 500 inmates, including some of the country's most dangerous offenders.
It was reported in June that the prison's chief jailer received hospital treatment after being attacked by an inmate.
And in October last year, riot officials were called to pay attention to serious disorder during which staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa Threat Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City With Floods (Drought Areas Trek Fall Advantage)
It's unusual for a tropical low pressure to hit Arizona, but that's exactly what could happen early next week if Hurricane Rosa's remaining energy moves across the southwestern desert and brings about flash flood risks.
The National Weather Service has already issued flood watches for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona as well as southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct route across Phoenix on Tuesday, and will approach late on Monday with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones since 1950 have maintained tropical storm or depression status within 200 miles of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the AZ border.
The National Hurricane Center's models predict 2 to 4 inches of rainfall, with isolated amounts of up to 6 inches in the Mogollon rim of Arizona.
Other parts of the American Southwest, including the central Rockies and the Great Basin, are likely to get 1 to 2 inches, with isolated totals of possibly up to 4 inches.
For those beyond flash flood risk, Rosa's rain is likely to be a blessing as the region is plagued by drought.
Although floods are a very serious issue, some of this rainfall is likely to be beneficial as the Southwest is currently experiencing drought conditions.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, just over 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought, the second-highest category," weather.com reported.
First, Hurricane Rosa's path leads to approaching land across the Baja California Peninsula from Mexico.
Rosa, still at hurricane strength Sunday morning, with maximum winds of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm encounters cooler water in the Pacific Ocean and therefore its strength decreases.
It is therefore expected that it will reach the country on Monday afternoon or evening at tropical storm strength in Mexico.
Rainfall over parts of Mexico can be heavy and pose a significant flood risk.
"Rainfall totals of 3 to 6 inches are expected from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, with up to 10 inches possible," weather.com reported.
Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm before it reaches the Arizona border as a tropical depression in the early hours of Tuesday, and will then move through Arizona and into southern Utah by late Tuesday night.
"The biggest danger expected of Rosa is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the U.S. Southwest," the National Hurricane Center said.
This rain is expected to cause life-threatening flash floods and debris flows in the deserts and landslides in the mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four arrests for attempted murder
A 20-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found stabbed in Somerset.
The injured teenage boy was found Saturday at about 4 a.m. BST in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to hospital where he is still in a "stable" condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset Police said.
Officials have called on anyone who might have any cell phone footage of what happened to emerge.
Trump says Kavanaugh suffered "from the meanness, the anger" of the Democratic Party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the merciless and shocking tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "suffered from the meanness, the anger" of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, fervently and emotionally denying an allegation by Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified during the hearing about her claim.
The President said on Saturday that the Americans had seen "the brilliance and quality and courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most competent jurists of our time, a jurist with a pure record of public service," he told the crowd of West Virginia supporters.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's nomination while talking about the importance of Republican turnout in the midterm elections.
"Five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lifetime.
"I'm not standing, but I'm standing," he said.
That's why I'm running for this position."
Trump has argued that the Democrats are on a mission to "resist and hinder."
The first major procedural vote on the Senate floor on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior GOP leadership assistant for CNN said.
Hundreds dead from Indonesian earthquake, tsunami, with figures still rising
At least 384 people were killed and many washed away when huge waves broke on beaches when a major earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday for a festival on the beach when surfers as high as six meters (18 feet) broke into the beach at sunset, washed away many after their deaths, and destroyed everything in the way.
The tsunami followed a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still busy with their activities on the beach and did not run immediately and they became victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the spokesperson for Indonesia's disaster relief agency BNPB, said during a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come on its own, it dragged cars, logs, houses, it hit everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami was moving across the open sea at speeds of 800 km/h (497 m/h) before hitting the coast.
Some people climbed into trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photos released by the disaster agency show numerous buildings and shops destroyed, bridges that were distorted and collapsed, and a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday night, the town of Kissimmee was closed.
A series of earthquakes were felt in an area with 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's giant quake was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city, which sits at the tip of a long, narrow bay, could have exacerbated the size of the tsunami, they said.
Nugroho described the damage as "significant" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
Bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of buildings that collapsed, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and damage could be greater along the coastline 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Donggala that is closer to the earthquake hearth.
Communication "is completely obstructed with no information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there, the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"It's already a disaster, but it can get much worse," they said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for not informing that a tsunami hit Palu, although officials said the waves came at the time the warning was issued.
In amateur footage shared on social media, a man on the top floor of a building can be heard shouting desperate warnings about the upcoming tsunami to the people at the bottom of the street.
Within minutes, a wall of water hits the beach and drags buildings and cars along.
Reuters was not able to immediately explain the footage.
The quake and tsunami caused major power outages that cut off communications around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military began sending cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but evacuees still needed food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport has been reopened for assistance efforts only and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
Indonesia tsunami death toll rises above 800.
This is very bad.
Although World Vision staff from Donggala arrived safely in Palu city where employees were hiding in deck-sail shelters set up in their office's courtyard, they drove past scenes of devastation on their way, Mr. Doseba said.
They told me that they had seen many houses destroyed," he said.
This is very bad.
Even as assistance groups begin the dreadful task of starting the disaster relief task, some have complained that foreign assistance workers with a lot of experience are being prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian guidelines, funds, supplies and personnel from overseas can only get underway after the area of the disaster has been declared a national disaster area.
This hasn't happened yet.
"This is still a disaster at the provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"Once the government says, 'OK, this is a national disaster,' we can open it up to international assistance, but it doesn't have a status yet."
With the dawn of the second night on Palu following Friday's earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of those still missing are hopeful that their loved ones will be the miracles that will bring relief to the sad storyline of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was taken out of a sewer pipe.
On Sunday, rescue workers rescued a woman who had been trapped under rubble for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandano, the coach of Indonesia's national paragliding team, has coached two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Another of those trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"As a senior in the parachute levitation field, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon recounts how, in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel circulated on social media among the paragliding community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the Palu participants who took part in the beach festival.
However, his messages were only answered with one gray tick, instead of two blue ticks.
"I think that means the messages haven't been delivered," he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 during refill of ATM at Newport on the Levee
Thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's worker who refilled an ATM at Newport on the Levee on Friday morning, according to a news release from the Newport Police Station.
The car's driver was emptying an ATM in an entertainment complex and getting ready to deliver more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.
While he was busy, another man "came running from behind the Brink's employee" and stole the bag of money that had to be delivered.
According to the release, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but police did not specify the number involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identities must contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is going to change his name to Ye
When he announced the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The being formerly known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for some time and used the nickname as the title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes before his appearance on Saturday Night Live where he is expected to introduce his new all Yandhi.
He replaced Ariana Grande on the show that canceled for "emotional reasons," the show's producer said.
Apart from being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has said in the past that the word has religious meaning to him.
"I believe 'ye' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," West said earlier this year when discussing his album title with radio host Big Boy.
So I'm you, I'm us, this is us.
It went from Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye—just the reflection of our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
"The album is more a reflection of who we are."
He is one of a number of well-known rappers who have changed their names.
Sean Combs was already known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love this year.
A former West employee, JAY-Z, has also come across with or without a hyphen and capital letters.
Mexico's AMLO pledges not to use military against civilians
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed to never use military force against civilians in the run-up to the country's 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador vowed at Tlatelolco Plaza on Saturday to "never use the military to contain the Mexican people."
Soldiers shot at a peaceful demonstration in the plaza on October 2, 1968, where up to 300 people were killed at a time when left-wing student movements throughout Latin America were taking office.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by giving monthly grants to those studying and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and a lack of training opportunities are attracting youth to gangs.
U.S. should double AI funding
With China becoming more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. needs to double the amount it spends on research in the field, said investor and AI practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The remarks come after several parts of the U.S. government made AI announcements, even if the U.S. briefly developed an overall formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China announced their plan last year: they aim to be the No. 1 in AI innovation by 2030.
"Double the AI research budget will be a good start, given that all the other countries are so far behind the US and we are looking for the next breakthrough in AI," Lee said.
Doubling funding could double the chances of achieving the next major AI achievement in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which invested in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that beat the highest-ranked U.S. Othello player and later he was a management officer at Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee has given recognition to previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's robotics challenge and asked when the next one will be, to help identify the next visionary.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to win government grants, Lee said.
"It's not China that is taking away the academic leaders; it's the corporates," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired influential people from other universities to work on AI in recent years.
Lee says immigration policy changes can also help fuel the U.S.'s AI efforts.
"I think green cards should be offered automatically to PhDs in AI," he said.
China's State Council issued its Next Generation Development Plan for Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
China's National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people at academic institutions similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a joint center for artificial intelligence that aims to involve partners from the industry and the academic world and the White House announced the formation of a Selection Committee on artificial intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it is currently investing more than $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation aimed at creating a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence came under fire months later.
Macedonians vote in elections to change country's name
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether their name should be changed to "Republic of North Macedonia", actions that would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that blocked its membership bids for the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that their northern neighbor's name represents a claim in the area and has refused their admission to NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June, based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argued that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign cast doubt on whether the turnout would meet the minimum 50 percent needed for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum ballot read: "Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership accepting the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, have argued that it is a price that could be paid to pursue admission for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia, to bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means safer lives for all of us," said Olivera Georgiyevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, enough MEPs have said they will accept the result of the vote to decide it.
The name change will require a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The state's electoral commission said there were no reports of irregularities by 1 p.m.
But the turnout was only 16 percent then, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 percent of registered voters voted.
"I came to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Macedonia's EM, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko are bringing their votes to the referendum in Macedonia on changing the country's name that will pave the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small loft and pulled up chairs in front of tents set up by those who are going to boycott the referendum.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads up, not through the back door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia to become part of the Euro-Asia integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe the vast majority will be in favour of it, because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after casting his vote.
He said a "yes" result would be "affirmation of our future."
A survey published last Monday by Macedonia’s Institute for Policy Research said between 30 and 43 percent of voters will participate in the referendum – less than the required amount.
Another survey, conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV, found that 57 percent of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For the referendum to be successful, turnout must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A backlash in the referendum will be the first serious setback for the policies of a pro-Western government since the government took over in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero navigates through entire Brighton defence for goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling cleared the Brighton defence in Manchester City's 2-0 win on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy during his goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine goaltender received a pass at midfield at the start of the series.
He raced between three Brighton defenders before hitting the open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green shirts.
He pushed past one defender before passing several others on the edge of the Brighton goal court.
He then pushed a hand to the left, where he found Sterling.
The English forward used his first touch in the cage to send the ball back for Aguero, who used his right foot to beat Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a kick into the right side of the net.
"Aguero is struggling with problems with his feet," City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We were talking about playing 55, 60 minutes.
This is what happened.
"We're happy that he scored a goal at the time."
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League wrestling.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball deep in the Brighton area on that play.
He sent a beautiful ball along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane had a few touches before leading Sterling to the farthest goal corner.
The Sky Blues' forward kicked the ball into the net just before he was over the back line.
City tackle Hoffenheim in Champions League Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play against the Rockies
With the Nationals out of the playoffs, there's not much reason to force another start.
But the ever-competing Scherzer wants to take on the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if there are still outplaying implications for the Rockies, who have a one-game lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies scored at least a promoter pick with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but still want to tie for their first division title.
"Although we don't play for anything, we can at least play the game knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team is likely to play at the highest level of any point I'll face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to take part in it?"
The Nationals have yet to announce their starting player for Sunday, but are reportedly favorable to having Scherzer thrown in such a situation.
Scherzer, who will start his 34th, had a throwing practice on Thursday and will play on his normal rest Sunday.
The Washington right-hander is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 outs in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump to hold meeting in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation surrounding his Supreme Court pick Brett Kavanaugh as he spoke about the importance of Republican turnout in the midterm elections.
"Everything we've done is at stake in November.
Five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our lifetimes.
It’s one of the big, big – I don’t stand, but I actually stand and that’s why I fight for these candidates everywhere,” he said.
Trump continued, "One sees this horrible, horrible radical group of Democrats, one sees it happen now.
And they are now determined to take back the power by using any possible way, one sees the meanness, the cunning.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to walk over to get power and control, that's what they want, power and strength, we're not going to give it to them."
Democrats, he said, are on a mission to "resist and hinder."
"And one sees it over the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "evil and mean and sneaky and fake."
He referred to the name of Senate Judiciary Committee's high-ranking Dianne Feinstein, who received harsh sentences from the audience.
"Do you remember her answer?"
Did you get rid of the document?
Uh, uh, what?
No, uh no, I'm waiting for one -- it was really weak body language -- the weakest body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a church.
It is intolerant of those who say what they think
When Momentum's activists in my local party voted to put me under censorship, it wasn't exactly a surprise.
After all, I’m the last person in a string of Labour MPs to be told we’re not welcome – all because we said what we thought.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received similar treatments because she stood up to anti-Semitism in a fearless way.
In my case, the motion of censorship criticized me for being different from Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically similar issues that Jeremy has disagreed with previous leaders.
The notice for the Nottingham East Labour Party meeting on Friday said that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For most of my eight years as the local Labor Party LP, that was exactly what Friday nights AR meetings were like.
Unfortunately, this is not the tone of many meetings today and the promise of "more friendly, more benevolent" politics has long been forgotten, if it ever began.
It has become increasingly clear that different views are not tolerated within the Labour Party and every opinion is judged on whether it is acceptable to the party's leadership.
It started shortly after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues with whom I thought I had previously shared similar political outlooks began to expect me to take a U-turn and take positions I would never otherwise have agreed with – either on national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public – and it doesn’t really matter what I say – there is a rant on social media asking me not to be re-elected, disapproving politics from the core and telling myself not to be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
I'm actually happier than some of my colleagues because the comments directed at me tend to be political.
I have a lot of respect for the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face an avalanche of sexist or racist insults every day, but never shy away.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how the levels of insult have normalized.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn claimed that the Labour Party should cultivate a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that broad church and with every "motion of mistrust" or change of rules of selection, the party gets scarier.
I've had a lot of advice over the past two years that encourages me to stay under the radar, not be so outspoken and that I'll be "okay" then.
But I don't have the politics to do that.
Since I joined the Labour Party as a schoolteacher 32 years ago, spurred by the Thatcher government’s neglect that literally left my state high school defunct, I’ve been trying to fight for better public services for those who need it most – whether as a local councillor or government minister.
I never hid my politics, including at the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been at all confused about my policy positions and areas where I differ from the current leadership.
To those who advocated the motion on Friday, I can only say that with the country heading for a Brexit that will damage all households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour Party leader.
But the one message I actually have is not to Nottingham Momentum, it is to my voters, whether or not they are now members of the Labour Party: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no amount of threats of not being re-elected or political gain will stop me from doing what I believe is in the best interest of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unconquered Ayr bo
Two late threes may have slightly skewed the final result, but there's no doubt Ayr deserved to triumph in this wonderfully entertaining Tennent's Premiership match of the day.
They are now the top scorer, the only undefeated team of the ten.
In the end, it was their excellent defense, as well as their better chances, that carried the home team and coach Peter Murchie had every right to be satisfied.
"We've been tested in our matches so far and we're still unbeaten, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "Honor to Ayr, they took their chances better than we have."
Grant Anderson's three in the 14th minute, which was scored by Frazier Climo, made Ayr ahead, but a yellow card for Scotland player Rory Hughes, made available for the match by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to count the numbers and Jason Baggot scored an undefeated three.
Climo increased Ayr's lead with a penalty kick just before he, just before halftime, scored a solo three to make it 17-5 for Ayr at halftime.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's three, downed by Baggot, reduced the backlog to five points.
There was a long delay for a serious injury at Ruaridh Knott carried on a stretcher, and from the restart Ayr increased the lead with a Stafford McDowall three, downed by Climo.
Ayr's acting captain Blair Macpherson then got a yellow card and once again Melrose took advantage of the extra player with an undefeated three by Bruce Colvine, at the end of a very busy game.
The home side made a comeback when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card because he killed Climo without the ball, and from the penalty line stand MacPherson pushed the ball to death behind the oncoming Ayr free-kick.
Climo fared well, as he did almost from the restart, after Kyle Rowe got David Armstrong's goal-kick and sent flanker Gregor Henry away for the home team's fifth-three.
Still Game star looks set to embark on new career in restaurant industry
Still Game star seems to be moving to the hospitality industry after it was discovered that he was named the director of a company of licensed restaurants.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, which he writes and plays in with old comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo have announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the show's last, and Kiernan seems to be getting ready for life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment, although a source at the Scottish Sun suggested Kiernan wanted to get involved in Glasgow's "florescent restaurant industry."
'The sea is ours': land-locked Bolivian hope court will reopen way to Pacific Ocean
Marines patrol a mass-covered naval headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings fly a sea blue flag.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are adorned with the slogan: "The sea is ours to the right.
It's a duty to get it back."
Throughout the landlocked Bolivia, the memory of the coastline they lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century is still fresh – just like the need to sail the Pacific again.
That hope is probably the highest it has been in decades, while Bolivia is awaiting a ruling by the international court on October 1, after 5 years of talks.
"Bolivia has the momentum, the spirit of unity and peace, and obviously expects the outcome with a positive attitude," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the ICC ruling on large screens across the country, hoping that the tribunal in The Hague will find in favour of Bolivia’s claim that – after decades of sporadic negotiations – Chile is obliged to negotiate to give Bolivia a sovereign passage to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic indigenous president – who faces a controversial battle for re-election next year – also has much that depends on Monday’s ruling.
"We are close to returning to the Pacific," he promised in late August.
But some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the Bolivian court will decide in favor – and that few will change if it does.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no power to allocate Chilean territory, and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the IRH’s ruling comes just six months after the last, shows that the case was “not complicated,” says Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And rather than helping Bolivia's case, the past four years may have slowed it down.
"The issue of access to the sea was hijacked by the current Bolivian administration," Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
Morales’ aggressive rhetoric tapped into any remaining Chilean goodwill, she said.
Bolivia and Chile will resume talks at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to hold further talks.
The two countries exchanged last ambassadors in 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making was extremely quick.
On Monday, Bolivia will bring "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "put an end to 139 years of differences with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents – used the maritime issue as a political crutch.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific," he said.
"The verdict is an opportunity to see what we need to overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't come unless U.S. can trust it
North Korea's foreign minister Ri Yong Ho said his country would never first disarm its nuclear weapons if they could not trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to honour the promises made during a summit in Singapore between the rival countries' leaders.
His remarks follow U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo apparently on the verge of restarting nuclear diplomacy, which has reached a dead end, more than three months after the Singapore deal with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is a "dream picture" that continued sanctions and U.S. capitulation to a statement ending the Korean War will also bring the North to its knees.
Washington is wary of agreeing to the statement without Pyongyang first taking meaningful steps toward disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism about whether Pyongyang is serious about relinquishing an arsenal that sees the country as the only way to guarantee their safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion shows reveal latest range of great headwear on the way to the stores near you
If you want to increase your hat collection or completely turn off the sun, you don't need to look any further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne introduced a series of law-breaking oversized head coverings to their SS19 collection on the runway that captivated the style at Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats have permeated Instagram this summer and these designers have paraded their staggering creations on the treadmill.
The highlight by Valentino was an oversized beige hat with a feathery wide brim that swallowed the models' heads.
Other oversized accessories have included watermelons decorated with jewelry, a wizard hat, and even a pineapple – but it’s not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also launched a series of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had finished lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creation looked like scuba gear, with a snorkel and goggles included, while another looked like a melted ice cream cone.
And if you continue the great fashion statement, it's your lucky day.
Style viewers predict that the enormous hats might be on their way to the stores near you.
The oversized hats follow briefly on the heels of 'La Bomba', the straw hat with a two-foot wide brim seen on everyone's heads, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the extremely impractical hat spread across social spaces sent another great creation across the treadmill – a straw beach bag that was almost the size of the swimsuit-clad model it wore.
The burnt orange raffia bag, finished with raffia fringes and finished with a white leather handle at the top, stood out at Jacquesmus' La Riviera's SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Famed stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to see big hats and beach bags in stores next summer – as the designer has made such a big impact that it will be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories."
John Edward: Language skills essential for global citizens
Scotland's independent schools have a string of achievements of academic excellence, and this was continued in 2018 with another set of excellent exam results, which were only reinforced by individual and collective successes in sports, art, music and other community ventures.
With more than 30,000 scholars across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best level of service to their scholars and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen career and their position as global citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a custom school curriculum, we see world languages continuing as a popular and desirable subject choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, "If you talk to someone in a language he understands, it goes to his head.
If you talk to him in his own language, it goes to his heart."
It's a powerful reminder that we can't just rely on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year's recent exam results, we can see that languages are at the top of the league tables with the highest pass rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages achieved a higher grade A.
The data, collected from SCIS's 74 member schools, showed that 72 percent of students obtained a higher grade A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 of those who studied French, and 63 of those who studied Spanish also obtained an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and young adults will no doubt need in the future.
Languages now, as subjects, have the same prestige as the STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) in independent schools' curricula and elsewhere.
A survey by the UK Commission on Professions and Skills in 2014 found that of the reasons employees are struggling to fill jobs, 17 percent are attributed to a shortage of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly important in preparing young people for their future careers.
With more likely jobs requiring languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career someone chooses, if they have learned a second language, in the future they will have a real advantage with such a lifelong skill.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically put a multilingual person above the competition.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage, 15 percent.
That's why it's so important to teach children today.
Knowing several languages, especially those of developing economies, will equip children with a better chance of finding meaningful jobs.
In Scotland, every school will differ in the languages they teach.
A number of schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while other languages will teach what are considered essential for the UK when looking ahead to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be a number of languages to choose from in independent schools, with teaching staff who are specialists in this field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare and equip children with the skills needed to achieve success, regardless of what the future holds.
It cannot be denied at this stage, in a global business environment, that languages are still extremely important for the country's future, and therefore they must be reflected in education.
Truly, modern languages should really be considered "international communication skills."
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to Scotland's young people.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron will make his debut for the San Diego Lakers on Sunday.
The wait is almost over for fans to see LeBron James make his first start for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday's pre-season opening game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But the exact number of minutes he's going to play remains to be determined.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James would likely play for a limited amount of time.
After an exercise earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six games in the preseason program.
"I don't need preseason games at this point in my career to get ready," he said.
Trump's West Virginia rally schedule, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is set to launch a sweeping election rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's Trump's first of five scheduled rallies in the next week, including stops in friendly places including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote currently held back for his choice to fill the vacancy in the Supreme Court, Trump is aiming to build support for the upcoming by-election as Republicans run the risk of losing control of Congress when voting in November.
What time is Trump's rally in West Virginia tonight and how do you look at it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia below via live stream.
Trump is likely to pay attention to this week's hearings for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who has become tense over allegations of sexual misconduct with an expected confirmation vote held back for up to a week as the FBI investigates.
But the main point of view of these excess rallies is to help the Republicans facing tough elections in November.
So President Trump's campaign said that these five rallies over the next week are aimed at "visiting volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and increase the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Congressional control is so critical to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible when we reach the busy campaign season," a spokesman for the Trump campaign, who refused to name him, told Reuters.
Tonight's rally, arranged for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, could draw supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and could be covered by the media in Pittsburgh," according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time last month that Trump visited West Virginia, the state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the West Virginia Republican candidate for the Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who is behind according to voting patterns.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come to give him a boost at the polls," Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team shows they have courage in the battle to keep hope alive as they enter Sunday's singles
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon's four-game squads may have been just what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pendulum of momentum is a generally contrived sports concept but one in which players wholeheartedly believe, and certainly in competitions such as these.
Where do you think the momentum is now?
"They came up with six points and now it's four, so we're wearing it as a bit of momentum, I guess," Jordan Spieth said as he walked away at the end of the day.
Europe, of course, has the advantage, four points ahead and another twelve being played.
However, the Americans feel, as Spieth says, that they have such a bit of wind in their sails and that there is a lot to encourage them, not least the class of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each scored three points out of four.
Spieth was mortal from the womb to the clean field and led by his example.
Those scorching cries of celebration grew louder as his round progressed and he sank a critical set to win game four completely evenly while he and Thomas were behind with two after two rounds.
She set who won the game for them at 15 was greeted with a similar scream, the kind that tells one that he believes the U.S. team has another chance.
"You really just have to take everything out and worry about your own game," Spieth said.
That's all those players are talking about.
18 pieces of paper to print off their stamp.
The only players who have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas in the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undoubted story of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's unpaired but charming couple got four out of four and can't do anything wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only pair who didn't record one keep over track figure on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided one keep over track figure on Saturday morning as well as during the back nine Friday morning.
That run, and the way their energy seems to flow to and from this exuberant crowd, confirms that they are the players to be beaten on Sunday, and there will be no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari who can clinch a potential European victory when the sun goes down over Le Golf National.
Use both at the same time or at different intervals.
It's too early to talk about the glory of Europe.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson met Sergio Garcia, the morning's four-ball hero, while playing with Alex Noren.
One stop over track number and two doubles on the front nine landed the Spaniard and the Swede in a hole they couldn't even get out of.
There's no one out there on Sunday to help you out.
The four-ball and four-game teams are so exciting to watch closely because of the interaction between the pairs, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and the way a strategy can turn in an instant.
Europe has always played better as a team so far and has significantly taken the lead on the final day, but this four-game session also showed that the U.S. team has the courage to face the struggle that some, especially at home, have doubted.
Europe runs 10-6 ahead during the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will have a healthy advantage on the final day of the Ryder Cup after coming out of Saturday's four-ball and four-game matches with a 10-6 lead.
The inspired duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the attack with two victories over a struggling Tiger Woods to take their score to four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, which is trying to retain the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated a US team that performed unevenly in the morning's four balls, so they won the series 3-1.
The U.S. provided more resistance in the four games and won two games, but they didn't shrink the backlog.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points from Sunday's 12 singles matches to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European newcomer to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, named "Moliwood" after a sensational weekend, are just the second pair in Ryder Cup history to score four points after their first four games.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed in the four balls, they played well together to beat a dad Woods and American newcomer Bryson Dechambreau with an even more convincing 5&4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two games on Saturday, sometimes showed flashes of brilliance but he has now lost 19 of his 29 games in four balls and four games and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who rested during the morning's four balls, came back to play with Henrik Stenson in the four games to a 2&1 defeat to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - who are first and third in the world rankings.
However, on a pleasant day with a breeze southwest of Paris, Europe didn't always make sense.
Jordan Spieth who won a major tournament three times and Justin Thomas set the mark for the Americans on Saturday with two points.
They scored a difficult 2&1 win over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-balls and later returned to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 3&4 in the four-game series after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team recovered from a backlog of four points when entering the singles, even though Furyk's team only have to draw to keep the trophy because they already hold it.
After being second-best for two days, however, it doesn't look like they'll be able to make a counter-attack on Sunday.
North Korea says it will 'decisively' unilaterally disarm without confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions were exacerbating their distrust of the United States and that the country would certainly not unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons without such qualities.
Ri Yong Ho told the world body's annual General Assembly that North Korea has taken "significant goodwill measures" in recent years, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, decommissioning the nuclear test site, and promising not to increase nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"We don't see a consistent response from the U.S., however," he said.
"Without any confidence in the U.S., there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances we will certainly not unilaterally disarm first."
While Ri echoed well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phased" approach to nuclear weapons removal according to which North Korea would be rewarded if it took gradual steps, his words seemed significant in that they did not unconditionally reject unilateral removal of nuclear weapons as Pyongyang did in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the very first summit between a U.S. president and a North Korean leader on June 12 in Singapore when Kim vowed to work for the "destruction of nuclear weapons in the Korean peninsula" while Trump pledged guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea wants a formal end to the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States has said Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls for strict international sanctions against North Korea.
"The U.S. is insisting on the "destruction of nuclear weapons first" and is exerting more pressure by tightening the level of sanctions to achieve their goal in a compelling way, and even objecting to the "declaration of the end of the war," Ri said.
"The perception that sanctions can force us to our knees is a dream of the people who are ignorant of us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions are exacerbating our mistrust."
Ri said nothing about plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader drew attention to at the United Nations earlier in the week.
Instead, the minister drew attention to three meetings over the past five months between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in, adding: "If the party were South Korea on this issue of nuclear weapons destruction and not the US, the destruction of nuclear weapons in the Korean peninsula would not have reached such a dead end."
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable that North Korea's rockets would be aimed at the U.S. landmass after "Mr. Bose President" Trump called Kim a "rocket man" on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, lavishly praised Kim for his courage in taking steps to disarm, but he said much work still needs to be done and that sanctions still need to remain there until North Korea destroys nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn't have a time frame for this, saying "it doesn't matter if it takes two years, three years, or five months."
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the actions they have taken.
But U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that: "Application of sanctions by the Security Council must continue diligently and unceasingly until we realize the full, final, confirmed destruction of nuclear weapons."
The Security Council has unanimously tightened sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an effort to deplete funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri on the outskirts of the UN General Assembly and said afterwards that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip there has not gone well.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying progress had been made, but North Korea accused him of making "gang-like claims" just hours later.
North Korea has promised in a meeting with Moon to dismantle a missile site and also take a nuclear complex as the United States "corresponding measures."
He said Kim told him that the "corresponding measures" he wants to see are security guarantees that Trump has promised in Singapore as well as steps towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on getting enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year allows all its undergraduates to get more sleep in an effort to counter the growing macho culture of studying through caffeine-driven "all-night sessions."
An academic has found that students at the world's top university are often uninformed when it comes to the basics of how to care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical Faculty and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the US.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a talk about the effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
"At the end of it, one girl approached me and said, 'Why are they only telling me this now, in my senior year?'
She said that no one had ever told her how important sleep is - which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, which was presented for the first time this year, explains to students the basics of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as how they improve their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical Faculty and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after it was found that students were severely sleep deprived during the week.
The hour-long course involves some interactive tasks.
In one section, there is an image of a dormitory, where students have to click on coffee cups, curtains, exercise shoes and books to be told about the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by sleep deprivation and the importance of a sleep schedule routine.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase risks of heart attacks, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive icons, then encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know this won't change students' behavior immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know the health effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes," Prof Czeisler added.
The culture of pride in "studying all night" still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and ever-increasing pressure on students has meant that sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
Making sure you get enough good-quality sleep should be a student's "secret weapon" to avoid stress, exhaustion, and anxiety, he said - even avoiding putting on weight because sleep deprivation puts the brain in a starvation mode, which makes you feel hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after taking one of its classes last year, during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to strive for a campus-wide course.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all graduate students to complete a similar study program before joining the institution where people compete with each other.
Prof Czeisler recommended that students consider setting an alarm for when they go to sleep, as well as when to wake up, and being aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can disrupt your circadian rhythm and cause you to struggle to touch the sheep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal to defeat Gerrard's men
Rangers suffered another sarge when Dolly Menga's goaltender Steven Gerrard's disjointed team scored a 1-0 defeat.
The Ibrox team wanted to record their first win as visitors since February's 4-1 win at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team handed Gerrard just his second down in 18 games as manager so his team was eight points behind Hearts, who were loosely ahead in the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga struck seven minutes before half-time, and it didn't look like a Rangers team would play without much inspiration.
As Rangers now fall to sixth position, Livingston climbs to third and is just behind Hibernian on goal difference.
And there may be further trouble ahead for Rangers after border judge Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound after an object was apparently thrown from the roadside.
Gerrand made eight changes to the team that stormed past Ayr after the Betfred Cup final.
Holt, on the other hand, used the same Livi-11 that took a point from Hearts last week and he would have been up in his notches with the way his well-trained team smothered their opponents at every turn.
Rangers may have dominated ball possession, but Livingston did more when they had the ball.
They actually should have scored points after just two minutes when Menga's first retrenchment sent Scott Pittman through on Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder opened up his big chance.
A deep free kick by Keaghan Jacobs then found captain Craig Halkett but his defence mate Alan Lithgow could only miss kicks at the back goal post.
Rangers took control, but there seemed to be more hope than belief about their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos felt he should have scored a penalty goal at the quarter-point when he and Steven Lawless clashed, but referee Steven Thomson turned away the Colombian's requests.
Rangers managed to get just two shots to the target during the first half but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was barely bothered by Lassana Coulibaly's header and a tacit goal kick from Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi's opener at the 34th minute may have been against the direction of play, no one can deny that they deserved it, even if it was just for their hard work.
Rangers didn't have a deep set piece of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained cool-headed and sent it to Menga for a simple round-up.
Gerrard acted at the break when he traded Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and the exchange had an almost immediate impact when the winger sent to Morelos but chased the impressive Kelly from his streak to the block.
But Livingston continued to force the visitors to play exactly the kind of game they enjoyed, with Lithgow and Halkett grabbing the ball long after the long ball.
Holt's team could have increased their lead in the final stages, but McGregor stood up well to stop Jacobs before Lithgow could come in far from the corner.
Rangers replacement Glenn Middleton had another late demand for a penalty kick when he got mixed up with Jacobs, but Thomson looked away again.
Almanac: The Inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now a page from our "Sunday Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, and OUR TELLING ... the day on which the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device called the Geiger counter.
Since then, the Geiger counter has been a pillar of science, and it has also become a pillar of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado," in which those two unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans played:
Man: "What on earth is this?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can even hear the effects of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity in the minerals.
Evans: "Gosh, this is about cracking!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to 'see' predator cells
New cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to 'see' and kill predator cells
Vaccine teaches immune system to identify predator cells as part of treatment
Method involves withdrawing immune cells from a patient, changing them in a laboratory
They can then "see" a protein that is common to many cancers and then inject it again.
A trial vaccine shows promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
One woman who was treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to identify predator cells, has seen her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves withdrawing immune cells from a patient, changing them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein found in many cancers and called HER2, and then injecting the cells again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "drives the growth of several types of cancers," including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancers, Prof Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach to removing immune cells from patients and "teaching" them how to attack cancer cells worked to beat a type of leukemia.
Kanye West started with a pro-Trump mockery after his performance at SNL, while wearing a MAGA hat.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was booed in the studio during a Saturday Night Live after a protracted performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for president in 2020.
After singing his third song of the night, called Ghost Town, during which he wore a Make America Great cap, he lashed out at the Democrats and repeated his support of Trump.
"I talk to a white person so often and they say, 'How can you like Trump, he's a racist?'
Well, if I was concerned about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago," he said.
SNL began the show with a sketch with Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on sexual assault charges made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Even though it wasn't broadcast, the footage of West's scolding was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear whether Rock for West is trying to spot it by posting it.
West also complained to the audience that it was made difficult for him behind the stage about what he was wearing on his head.
"It's going to get me higher up.
They said, "Don't go out with that hat on."
They've been bugging me!
And then they say I'm in a low place," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West went ahead: “Do you want to see the low place?” and said that he would put on his “superman cloak, because it means that you cannot tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try for love."
His comments provoked at least twice an outcry from the audience and members of the SNL cast seemed embarrassed, Variety reported, with one person there telling the publication: "The whole studio has become dead silent."
West was brought in as a late replacement for the singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, the rhyme chatter Mac Miller had died a few days earlier.
West surprised many with a performance of the song I Love It, dressed like a Perrier bottle.
West was supported by the head of conservation group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest minds: THANK YOU FOR RESISTING TO THE SHARES."
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was simply "who he is and that's absolutely amazing."
"But I chose NOT to reward someone (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his 'art') who I believe accepts and proclaims an ideology that puts my community at risk.
he is free.
us too," she said.
Prior to the show, the rhyme talker announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was now "the being formerly known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Co-rhythm talker, Snoop Dogg, was named Snoop Lion and of course late music legend Prince changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist formerly known as Prince.

The charge will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington criticises toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for his sword-wielding role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, criticized the macho hero's stereotype, saying that such on-screen roles mean that young boys often feel they need to be tough to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed "something went wrong" and asked how to tackle the issue of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his co-star from Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he felt "reasonably strong" about working on this issue.
"I personally feel pretty strong about it at the moment - where did we go wrong with masculinity?" he said.
"What did our men learn as they grew up regarding the problem we are now seeing?"
Kit believes that television is quite possibly responsible for the growth in toxic masculinity due to its extremely male characters.
He continued, "What is innate and what has been taught?
What is being taught on TV and in the streets that makes young boys feel like they need to have this certain aspect of being a man?
I think this is one of the big questions in our time - how do we change it?
"Something went wrong with our kids."
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not participate in any of the Game of Thrones sequels and sequels when the series comes to an end next summer because he says he is "ready with battlefields and horses."
From November, Kit will play in a new version of Sam Shephard's True West, which is the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he thinks the best thing that came out of Game of Thrones was to meet his wife Rose.
"I met my wife on this program, so that way it gave me my future family, and my life from here on out," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love interest of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on the premises of Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced that there is a 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, the health officials said.
Around 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases have been transmitted through sex, representing a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spreads rapidly through some parts of China due to infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who contracted HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
Year after year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has risen by 100,000.
HIV transmission through sex is a critical issue in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still very common.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of the diseases come from inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, China's government has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to make the case.
Maxine Waters denies that a staff member leaked GOP senators' data, condemning 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy theories'
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Republican Maxine Waters lashed out on Saturday against allegations that a member of her staff had placed the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on the lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat has claimed that the allegations are driven by "ultra-legal" experts and websites.
"Lies, lies and even more detestable lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The leaked information allegedly included the house addresses and phone numbers for U.S. Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during the Senate Panel hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against the nominee for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak happened sometime after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was related to Waters' office and disclosed the information of a member of Waters' staff, the Hill reported.
"This unsubstantiated allegation is completely untrue and an absolute lie," Waters continued.
"The member of my staff - whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of this fraudulent and false allegation - was not responsible at all for leaking this information.
This unsubstantiated allegation is completely untrue and an absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly provoked online criticism, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial testifies to anger," Fleischer wrote.
"That suggests she doesn't have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something he did not do, he should not be angry.
He shouldn't be challenging.
He didn't question the prosecutor's motives.
He needs to be calm and calm."
Fleischer appeared to have compared Waters' response to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of appearing to be too angry during Thursday's trial.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate trying to lift Waters from the cushions in the by-election, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great if this is true," he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had "notified the appropriate authorities and law enforcement entities of these fraudulent allegations.
"We will make sure that the perpetrators are exposed," she continued, "and that they will be legally liable for all that they do that is destructible and dangerous to every member of my staff."
Johnny English Strikes Again by Rowan Atkinson
It's now traditional to look for Brexit significance in any new film with a British twist and it seems to apply to this revival of the Johnny English action-comedy spottery franchise - which at the time began in 2003 with Johnny English and continued to struggle with Johnny English Reborn in 2011.
Will tongue-in-cheek self-satire on the subject of how obvious power we are the nation's new export opportunity be?
In any case, the clumsy Johnny English with his outbursts and rubber face has renewed his license to mess up everything for the second time - and his name is a clearer indication than anything else that he is a great comic creation for non-English-speaking film audiences.
He is, of course, the taunted secret agent who, despite his bizarre pretension to sophisticated elegance, has a bit of Clouseau, a piece of Mr Bean and a good shot of that guy who contributed a single note to the Chariots of Fire theme song at the 2012 London Olympics open house.
He is also originally based on the traveler and international man of riddles, leaving behind chaos, which Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten Barclaycard commercials.
There are one or two cool moments in this latest version of YOU.
I loved Johnny English who came up to a helicopter while he was dressed in a medieval armored robe and briefly clipped the screw blades against his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is on display, but the humor feels rather faint and peculiarly superfluous, especially when the "serious" movie brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible now use self-confident comedy as an ingredient.
The humor feels like it's aimed at children rather than adults, and to me Johnny English's adversity isn't as original and focused as Atkinson's silent movie jokes in Bean's persona.
The perennial thematic assumption now is that Great Britain is in serious trouble.
A hacker has infiltrated Britain's super-secret network of spies and revealed the identity of all Britain's agents in the field, to the dismay of the on-duty agent - a deplorable little role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last straw for a prime minister who is a bloated and besieged character who is already experiencing a complete collapse of political unpopularity: Emma Thomson is doing her utmost best with this quasi-Teresa May character but there is little in the text to work with.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that since every active spy has been put at risk, she has to call in someone from retirement.
And that means the struggling Johnny English himself, now employed as a teacher at some decent institution, but who from the record gives lessons on how to be a secret agent, there are some cute jokes here when English offers a School of Rock-type spying school.
English is recalled to Whitehall for an emergency assignment and reunited with his former long-suffering companion, Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, married to a submarine commander, an all-amateur role in which too little is expected of Vicki Pepperdine.
So the Batman and Robin are about to completely waste everything in Her Majesty's secret service again on duty and come across Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister finds himself under the perilous spell of the charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems: the enigmatic Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their journey of ludicrous escapades: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a French restaurant, causing chaos when smuggling themselves aboard Volta's luxury yacht; and English unleashes pure anarchy when he tries to use a virtual reality headset to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's home.
Nothing is saved for that last scene, but as cute and exuberant as it may be, the whole affair is quite a bit like children's TV.
It's fairly mediocre.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I couldn't help but think: couldn't the British give Rowan Atkinson a role that really put his talent to good use?
Labour denies it's inventing a plan for Britons to work a four-day week but be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party must consider a drastic plan that will cause Britons to work a four-day week - but be paid for five days.
The party allegedly wants company bosses to transfer savings caused by the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to workers by giving them extra day off.
This will allow workers to enjoy a three-day weekend - but they will still take home the same payment.
Sources say it would "fit" the party's economic agenda and plans to put the country in the workers' favor.
Changing to a four-day week was endorsed by the Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party source told The Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
"This will not happen overnight, but a four-day work week is an ambition that fits in with the party's approach to rebalancing the economy in favor of the worker as well as with the party's overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party will not be the first to endorse such an idea, with the Green Party promising a four-day work week during its general election campaign in 2017.
However, the ambition is not currently endorsed by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "A four-day work week is not party policy and is not considered by the party."
Shadow Minister John McDonnell used last week's Workers' Conference to expand on his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from "faceless directors" and "winners" at service companies.
The shadow minister's plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not be able to recover their entire investment as a Labour government can make "deductions" based on alleged infringement.
He also confirmed plans to place workers on boards of companies and create inclusive ownership funds to give 10 percent of equity in private sector businesses to employees, which could receive annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy tell "60 Minutes" whether the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh could make them change their minds
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week, raising the question of whether the bureau's findings could convince any Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley for Republican Sens. John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham asked if the FBI could dig up anything that could make them change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more receptive than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Of course," Kennedy said.
"I said at the beginning of the trial, I said, I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, came out that accusation, and said, 'Did you do this?
He was determined, determined, unequivocal."
Graham's voice, however, turned out to be immutable.
"I have formed my opinion on Brett Kavanaugh and it will require an accusation of dynamite," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett has diligently denied it," Graham continued, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone she called couldn't confirm it.
That's 36 years old.
I don't see anything changing."
What is the World Citizens' Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the World Citizens' Festival, an annual music event that features a particularly impressive group of stars who perform and have an equally impressive goal; the end of poverty in the world.
The World Citizens' Festival is now in its seventh year and during the festival, tens of thousands of people will flock to Central Park's Great Lawn to enjoy performances not only by Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event's true goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Citizens' Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the World Poverty Project, an international advocacy group hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you’re willing to pay for a GDP ticket), concertgoers had to perform a series of tasks, or “actions”, such as doing volunteer work, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call, or any other meaningful way of raising awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But just how successful was World Citizen with 12 years left to achieve his goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a great way to persuade people to demand a call to action, or is it just another case of so-called "cliktiziism" - people who feel they are making a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, World Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, supporting a multitude of different goals.
It says these actions have helped spur world leaders to announce commitments and policies equal to more than $37 billion that will potentially affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group reported 390 commitments and announcements resulting from its performances, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid out or raised.
The group estimates that the confirmed money so far has had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments include the Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and implementers committed to “helping children reach their full potential”, and pledge to give $35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from World Citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and world citizens just like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history," Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that, after more than 5,000 actions taken to approach the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government has announced funding for a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the common questions on his website that asks "what makes you think that we can end extreme poverty?"
World Citizen replied: "It will be a long and hard road - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will be successful because together we have more power.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are among the artists performing at this year's event in New York, which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. may use navy for "blockade" to stop Russian energy exports - Home Secretary
"If necessary," Washington may leave it on its fleet to stop Russian energy from entering the market, including in the Middle East, U.S. Home Secretary Ryan Zinke has revealed, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke has claimed Russia's involvement in Syria - particularly where it operates at the invitation of the legitimate government - is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe the reason they're in the Middle East is because they want to act as brokers for energy just like they do in Eastern Europe, southern Europe," he reportedly said.
And, according to an officer, there are ways and means to tackle it.
"The United States has the ability, with our Navy, to ensure that the sea lanes are open, and if necessary, to block, to make sure their energy doesn't end up on the market," he said.
Zinke addressed attendees at an event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that considers itself the "voice of the energy consumer" in the U.S.
He went on to compare Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran and noted that they are practically the same.
"The economic option on Iran and Russia is, more or less, to finance and replace fuel," he said, referring to Russia as a "single talent" with an economy dependent on fossil fuel.
The statements come as Trump administration was on a mission to boost exports of their liquid natural gas to Europe to replace Russia, by far the cheaper option for European consumers.
For that reason, the Trump administration's officials, including America's President Donald Trump himself, tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, makes Berlin Moscow's "prisoner."
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a pure economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a means of carrying out pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with US Secretary of Energy Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. view has provoked backlash from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industrial organisation, the Federation of German Industries (FDI), called on the US to stay away from EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), said after a recent meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "gravely consider" standing as president in 2020, Massachusetts senator said
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would "consider it serious" to stand as president after the midterm elections.
At a town meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider standing.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government and that includes a woman at the top of the sport," she said.
"After November 6, I will seriously consider standing for president."
Warren voiced her opinion on President Donald Trump during the town meeting, saying he was "taking the country in the wrong direction."
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren was very outspoken in her criticism of Trump and his nomination of Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court.
In a tweet Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before our vote."
A poll released on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own voters did not think she should stand in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of "probable" Massachusetts voters said the senator should not stand, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe survey.
Thirty-two percent supported the idea that she should stand.
The survey showed more support for the idea that former governor Deval Patrick should stand, with 38 percent supporting the idea that he should potentially stand and 48 against it.
Other high-profile Democratic names discussed to potentially stand in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin calls Track Palin's PTSD at Donald Trump meeting
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after joining in September
He was arrested on Monday night and charged with an incident of domestic violence.
"What my own son is going through, what he's been going through since he came back, I have sympathy with other families who feel the effects of PTSD and the injury with which our soldiers are returning," she told an audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said of her son and other war veterans, "they come back a little differently, they come back hard, they come back wondering if there is respect for what they and their fellow soldiers and airmen and every other member of the army have given to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence, assaulting a woman, interfering with a complaint of domestic violence, and possession of a firearm while under the influence, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Station.
18 states, D.C. supports challenge of new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and the district filed a friend-of-the-court law brief in Washington on Friday to support an asylum seeker and challenge the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions lawsuit filed against federal policy by the American Civil Liberties Union in August has not been disclosed.
She said her partner "and his violent gang members" abused her, but U.S. officials refused her request for asylum on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The state attorneys who support Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of applicants for U.S. asylum, as nations facing profound problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed in 2014 a decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals that allowed immigrants without the necessary documents to flee from domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal, and international laws."
"Federal laws require that all asylum applications be decided on the specific facts and circumstances of the claim, and such advocacy violates that policy," the friend-of-the-court legal brief said.
Lawyers further argued in the legal brief that the policies that deny immigrants access harm the U.S. economy, saying they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide needed labor."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic and gang violence.
"Asylum is available to those who leave their homeland due to persecution or fear due to race, religion, nationality or membership in a specific social group or political opinion," Sessions said in his announcement of the policy on June 11.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all the problems – even all the serious ones – that people around the world face every day.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as death toll doubles in race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation is increasingly dire.
"It feels very tense," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma as she consoles her feverish baby boy at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute, an ambulance arrives.
Clean water is a shock."
Residents have been seen returning to their ruined homes, searching through soaked possessions, trying to save anything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5-magnitude quake, were overwhelmed.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a broken back and shoulder, rest outside Palu's Army Hospital where patients are being treated outside due to ongoing strong aftershocks.
Tears fill his eyes as he recounts the violent earthquake that shook the fifth-floor hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pushed into the walls, I think," Haris told Associated Press, adding that he and his family were in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife call for help, but then I was silent.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of 'bullying' with 'propaganda advertising'
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in a U.S. newspaper praising the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to the China Daily's paid insert in the Des Moines Register - the state of Iowa's newspaper with the most sales - after accusing China of interfering in the November 6 U.S. congressional elections, a complaint that China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in U.S. elections has marked what U.S. officials told Reuters is a new phase in an increasing campaign by Washington to put pressure on China.
While it's normal for foreign governments to place ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently caught up in an escalating trade war that has resulted in them levelling out tariffs rounds on each other's imports.
China's retaliatory tariffs early in the trade war aimed at beating out exporters in states like Iowa that supported Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and the former governor of Iowa for a long time, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in an op-ed in Sunday's Des Moines Register, "is now exacerbating the bullying by publishing propaganda ads in our own free press."
"By spreading their propaganda, the Chinese government is seizing America's cherished tradition of free speech and a free press by placing a paid ad in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, one will find very limited dissenting voices at the newspaper kiosk on the street here in Beijing and not see any real reflection of the divergent opinions the Chinese people have about China's worrying economic trajectory, given that media is under the firm thumb of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers has shied away from the offer to publish his article," although he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans alienate women voters ahead of midterm elections with Kavanaugh debacle, analysts warn
While numerous top Republicans stand by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and defend him in the face of multiple allegations of sexual assault, analysts have warned that they will see backlash during upcoming midterm elections, especially from women.
The emotions about this are running extremely high, and most Republicans are on record already indicating that they want to move forward with the vote.
Those things cannot be reversed," said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School for The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted Senator Jeff Flake's (R-Arizona) incitement to an FBI investigation at the close would be enough to appease angry voters.
"Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday - they are not going to forget it tomorrow and not in November," Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, said on Friday, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is on the way!" as they marched into the Senate entrance portal as the Republicans who controlled the Judiciary Committee chose to continue Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation is going to be very high," Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst, told the news site.
"People say it's already high; it's true.
But it could be higher, especially among swing voter-female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18- to 29-year-olds, who don't often vote because they don't like the president."
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing her allegation of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts said a backlash could follow if Republicans continue the confirmation.
"It became a mess for the GOP," Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said early last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not about the committee's vote or the final vote and whether Kavanaugh is put on the bench, it's also about the way the Republicans handled it and how they treated her," Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, told the news channel.
But Americans seem slightly divided over who to believe after Ford and Kavanaugh's testimonies, with slightly more taking the latter's side.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or likely believe Ford's testimony, while 35 say they definitely or likely believe for Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh likely or definitely cheated during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following Flake's injunction, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford, as well as at least one other complainant, Deborah Ramirez, has reported to The Guardian.
Ford testified last week before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh assaulted her at the age of 17 while he was drunk.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee exposed his genitals to her while attending a party during their student years at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the global web plans to launch a new internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the global web, is launching a startup that seeks to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The tech legend's latest project, Inrupt, is a company that builds on Berners-Lee's open-source platform, Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people are allowed access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the idea with Inrupt was "world domination."
"We need to do this," he said of the project.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data storage" or a POD.
It can include contact lists, activity lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It's as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are all available at the same time and on one browser.
What is unique about personal online data storage is that it is entirely up to the user who can access that type of information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data."
The idea for Inrupt, according to the company's CEO John Bruce, is for the company to bring resources, processes, and appropriate skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, developers on the staff contracted to work on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers from around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee says he and his team don't talk to "Facebook and Google about introducing an overall change, where all their business models are completely reversed overnight.
"We don't ask their permission."
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to provide commercial energy as well as an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the Worldwide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has had an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Even as he launches Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the Worldwide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm extremely optimistic about this next era of the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: WW1 Victoria Cross Spiritual Celebration
The only clergyman from the Church of England to win the Victoria Cross as a warrior during World War I was honored in his hometown 100 years later.
Lt. Kol Reverend Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 in the attack at Bellenglyse and Lehaucourt.
But he was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew he had won the highest British military honour.
A memorial stone was unveiled on Saturday by his two grandsons at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "brilliantly symbolic" that the stone was unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning achievement.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lt. Col. Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through very dense mist and under heavy fire from the field and machine guns."
He later rushed to the firing line and, with the "greatest bravery," led the line forward before he stormed a field rifle alone and knocked out three of the division.
Lt. Kol Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918, just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something I know I can never do, but something that is humiliating."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid a wreath after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Orchestra.
Michael Vann said he was "honoured to be able to play a role in the parade" and added that "the courage of a real hero is demonstrated by the support that will be given by a lot of people."
MMA fans stay awake all night to watch Bellator 206, but get Peppa Pig
Imagine staying up all night watching the packed Bellator 206 just to not be able to watch the main event.
The San Jose programme featured 13 fights, including six on the main programme which was to be broadcast live through the night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were on their way to battle each other, viewers in the UK were left stunned when the coverage changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were unimpressed after staying awake especially for the fight until the early hours.
One supporter described the switch to the children's cartoon on Twitter as "some sick joke."
"It's government regulations that the content wasn't appropriate at 6 p.m. and that's why they had to switch to children's programming," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa the pig," ja."
Bellator company president Scott Coker said they would work on their scheduling to include UK viewers in the future.
"I think that when I think about the rebroadcast, I think we can probably work something out," Coker said.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning on a Sunday there and we won't be able to sort it out until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But our work on it.
Trust me, when it switched, there were a lot of text messages sent back and forth and it wasn't all friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
But it wasn't, it was a government issue.
I can promise you it won't happen next time.
We’ll limit it to five fights instead of six – as we normally do – and we’ve tried to offer more to our fans and just about our time.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley has felt 'inferior' about sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up with an inferiority feel about his sexuality – but this gave him the motivation to be a success.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize before he went to high school that "not everyone is like me."
Speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said he vented his feelings about gay rights to give others "hope."
He also said that becoming a parent made him less concerned about winning at the Olympics.
The regular presenter of the year-long program, Kirsty Young, took a few months off due to illness.
When he appeared as a recluse on Laverne's first show, Daley said he felt "less" than everyone else when he grew up because "it wasn't socially acceptable to like boys and girls."
He said: "To this day, those feelings of feeling less than, and feeling differently, are the real things that gave me the strength and energy to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so he wouldn't disappoint anyone when they would eventually find out about his sexuality.
The double Olympic bronze medalist has become a high-profile LGBT fighter and has used his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He says he has aired his feelings because he is so happy to be able to live openly without consequences and want to give others "hope."
The three-time world champion said that falling in love with a man – US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 – “caught him off the hook.”
Daley married the Oscar winner last year, who is 20 years older than him, but says the age difference has never been an issue.
“When you go through so much at such a young age” – he went to his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later – he said it was hard to find someone of the same age who experienced similar highs and lows.
The couple became parents to a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley in June, and Daley says his "whole perspective" has changed.
"If you asked me last year, it was all about 'I need to win a gold medal,'" he said.
"But you know, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.
His son has the same name as his father Robert who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley says his father did not accept that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was if they had tickets for London 2012 – because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him 'you're not going to be here to be in the front row, Dad,'" he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and it was only after he stopped breathing and was dead that I finally admitted that he wasn't invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I just knew that that's what I've dreamed about all my life - diving in front of my home crowd at an Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired his first song choice – Proud by Heather Small – which also resonated with him in building up to the Olympics and still giving him chicken meat.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson won't run and retire from Saturday's Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he will have to get his form in order to stop it from being an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who plays for a record 12 times in the biennial event, was withdrawn from the game by captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's four-ball games and four-sets.
Instead of being the center of the action, as he has often been for the United States, the five-time Major winner will divide his day in between being a rallying egg and working on the practice bowl on his play in hopes of redressing that squint.
Even at the height of his career, he was never the straightest driver and therefore the 48-year-old is not the ideal person for the narrow Le Golf National course where the long rough terrain always punishes the wandering blows.
And as if the track isn't challenging enough on its own, Mickelson faces accurate British Open champion Francesco Molinari in his ninth game on Sunday, teaming up with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week.
If the Americans, who are four points behind, start the 12 singles games well, Mickelson's game may be absolutely essential.
Furyk expressed his trust in his husband, not that he could say much else.
"He fully understood his role he had today, gave me a pat on the back and put his arm around me and said he would be right tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is in the Hall of Heroes and he has contributed so much to these teams in the past and this week.
I didn't think he was going to play two matches.
I've put more into perspective, but that's how things worked out and that's what we thought we should do.
He wants to be there, just like anyone else."
Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record for the player who played the most Ryder Cup games on Sunday.
This could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that never truly matched the highlights of its individual achievements.
Mickelson won 18, 20 defeats and seven halves, although Furyk said his presence contributed intangible aspects to the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he likes to shave the crazy, and he's a great guy to have in the team room," he explained.
"I think the younger players also enjoyed shaving with him, which was fun to watch.
It's more than just a game."
Thomas Bjorn, the European Union's chief executive, knows that a big lead can quickly disappear.
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a considerable lead before the last day's singles in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable experience.
The Dane made his debut in the 1997 game at Valderrama, where the team led by Seve Ballesteros, had a five-point lead, but only won by 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"One keeps reminding oneself that we had a big head start at Valderrama; we had a big head start at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won tightrope," Bjorn said in the photo, after watching how the Class of 2018 won 5-3 on Friday and was 10-6 ahead of Le Golf National yesterday.
So, history will show me and everyone on the team that it's not over.
You're going full speed tomorrow.
Get out there and do all the right things.
It's not over until you have the points on the board.
We have a goal, and that's to try to win the trophy, and that's where the focus stays.
I say all the time, I focus on the 12 players who are on our team, but we are also well aware of who is on the other side - the best players in the world."
Delighted at how his players fared on the difficult golf course, Bjorn adds: "I will never anticipate things with this.
Tomorrow is a horse of a different color.
Tomorrow it is the individual participation that comes in turn, and it is a horse of a different color.
It's great to be out there with a partner when things are going well, but when you're there individually, you're tested to your full capacity as a golfer.
This is the message you need to convey to players, get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you're leaving your partner behind and he's got to get the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furyk would want his players to do better individually than they did as playing mates, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who got three points out of four.
Furyk himself was already on both sides of that great last-day turnaround, where he was part of the winning team at Brookline before finishing as a loser when Europe achieved the "miracle of Medinah."
"I remember every word of it," he said in reply when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999 had encouraged his players on the way to that final day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but one would like to start well, as seen at Brookline, as seen at Medinah.
When that momentum starts going in one direction, it puts a lot of stress on those middle games.
We've put our team together according to that, and we've ranked the men we felt, you know, will bring us something magical tomorrow."
Thomas was tasked with trying to lead the counterattack and faced off against Rory McIlroy in the main game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter being the other Europeans in the top half of the division.
"I chose this group of guys in this order because I think it covers it all the way to the end," Bjorn said of his singles selections.
Germany's new warship delayed again
The German military's newest frigate would have been commissioned in 2014 to replace the old Cold War-era warships, but it won't be there until at least next year, due to faulty systems and growing costs, local media reported.
The commissioning of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the main ship of the brand-new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigate, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper citing a military spokesman.
This vessel was supposed to have joined the Navy in 2014, but the agonizing post-delivery issues plagued this ambitious project's fate.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
It is understood that they will have a powerful cannon, an air defense and anti-ship missiles battle order as well as several secret technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other key features include longer maintenance periods – it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates for up to two years away from home wishes.
But constant delays mean that the advanced warships – which apparently will enable Germany to project power overseas – will already become obsolete by the time they enter service, called Die Zeit.
The disastrous F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to commission the vessel and sent it back to Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but German media has mentioned that a number of essential "software and hardware defects" make the ship useless if deployed in a campaign.
Software defects are particularly important as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels will be handled by a crew of about 120 sailors – only half the manpower on older Bremen-class frigates.
It has also come to light that the ship is drastically overweight, reducing performance and reducing the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000 tons of "Rheinland-Pfalz" is thought to be twice as heavy as ships of similar classes used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the price tag for the entire project – including the training of the crew – also became an issue.
It apparently reached an incredible €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) – more than the initial €2.2 billion.
Problems that have befallen the new frigates are becoming particularly important in light of recent warnings that the strength of Germany's fleet is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, admitted that the Navy's "ships that can be deployed are getting up."
The official said the issue had worsened over time, as old ships were decommissioned, but no replacement vessels were provided.
He lamented that none of Baden-Wuerttemberg class could join the Navy.
National Trust listens to bats' secret life
New research is being conducted on an estate in the Scottish Highlands that aims to reveal how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behaviour of the unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow the common and soprano dwarf bat as well as the brown long-eared and Daubenton bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed on important locations on the property to track bat activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also do mobile surveys using hand-held indicators.
Expert clan analysis of all surveys will check the regularity of the bat calls and determine which species do.
A habitat map and report will then be compiled to create a detailed landscape-scale image of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, a conservation consultant for NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important to the bats and how they are used by each of the species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work such as pastureland creation and how to best manage woodlands for bats and other associated species.
Bat populations in Scotland and across the UK have declined significantly over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects sleeping space and loss of habitat.
Wind turbines and lightning can also pose a risk, as well as fly paper and some chemical treatment of building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
The bats aren't really blind.
But because of their nocturnal hunting activities, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echo-orientation technique to point out bugs and obstacles on their flight route.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, is very serious about bats.
It has ten trained experts who regularly conduct surveys and sleeping spot inspections and sometimes carry out rescues.
The organisation even established Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve at Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
Estate manager David Thompson says the estate is the ideal site for them.
"Here at Threave we have a wonderful area for bats," he said.
"We have the old buildings, lots of veteran trees and all the good habitat.
But there is so much about bats that is still unknown, so the work we do here and on other properties helps us better understand what they need to thrive."
He emphasizes the need to search for bats before maintenance in properties is done because it is possible that unwitting destruction of a single maternity site could mean up to 400 females and young ones dead and an entire local population could be wiped out.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, disturb or prevent them or destroy their sleeping places.
Elizabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to jump in to help.
She said: "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we don't know how their populations fare."
Ronaldo dismisses rape claims as lawyers prepare to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo dismissed rape allegations against him as "fake news" and said people "want to promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers are ready to sue German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portugal and Juventus forward was accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga at a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
He allegedly paid her $375 000 to remain silent about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
In an Instagram Live video addressing his 142 million followers hours after the allegations were published, Ronaldo, 33, dismissed the reports as "fake news."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false news," the five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the camera.
"They want to promote themselves by using my name.
This is normal.
They want to be famous to say my name, but that's part of the whole thing.
"I'm a happy man and everything is right," the player said.
Ronaldo's lawyer is preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegation, which they have called, according to Reuters, "inadmissible reporting of suspicion in the area of privacy."
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for "moral damages for any amount consistent with the seriousness of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident allegedly took place in June 2009 at a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anally, according to documents filed at Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claimed Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and said he was "99 percent" a "good guy" who was let down by the "one percent."
The documents allege that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had had sex, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had pictures of her injuries taken at the hospital, but later agreed to a settlement outside the court because she was "afraid of retaliation" and worried about being "publicly humiliated."
The 34-year-old says she now wants the settlement reversed because she was still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged assault and moved this summer, in a €100 million deal to Italian giants, Juve.
Brexit: UK will 'repent forever' if their car manufacturers lose
The UK will "repent forever" if they lose their status as world leader in post-Brexit car manufacturing, said Industry Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was "worrying" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would have to temporarily halt production at the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," Clark said.
The Japanese vehicle manufacturer said the impact of border delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant – which manufactures Toyota’s Auris and Avensis – produced almost 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if Britain leaves the EU by the end of March, we will see production halted in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director at Burnaston.
Other UK carmakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover have raised fears about leaving the EU without a deal and how cross-border trade will function.
BMW, for example, said they would close their Mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns relate to what automakers say supply chain risks are in the case of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line runs on a "just-in-time" basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars made to order.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be disruption at the border that the industry says could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It will be impossible for Toyota to maintain more than a day's supply at the Derbyshire plant, the company said, and therefore production will be halted.
Mr Clark says Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is "precisely calibrated to avoid those checks at the border."
“We need a deal. We want the best deal that, as I say, will allow us to not only enjoy the current success but for us to seize this opportunity,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.
"The indications from not only Toyota but also other manufacturers are that we absolutely need to continue with what has been an extremely successful supply chain."
Toyota could not say how long production would be stopped, but warned that added costs in the long term could reduce the plant's competitiveness and eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years and is the Unite Union's convenor at the plant, says his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, when these posts disappear, they never come back.
A government spokesman said: "We have proposed a precise and acceptable plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, White House says
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump's high-risk meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be delayed by "another week" as the fight over nominee for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian election interference, links between Trump aides and Russia and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether or not Trump will fire the deputy attorney general, and thereby threaten Mueller's independence, has fueled Washington's gossip stories for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of carrying a recorder to record conversations with Trump, as well as the possibility of removing the president via the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, amid reports that he was on his way to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would "choose not to" fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a clash with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation of allegations against Kavanaugh and further postponed the full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said: "A date for it has not yet been determined, it could be this week, I can see that it will be postponed for another week with all the other things going on with the Supreme Court.
But we will see and I always like to keep the press up to date."
Some journalists will disagree with that statement: Sanders has not held a White House press briefing since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the scarcity of briefings was not due to a reluctance for TV journalists to be "effect-seeking," although she said: "I won't argue with the fact that they are effect-seeking."
She added that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president holds more Q&A sessions than any president before him," she said, adding without citing evidence: "We looked at the numbers."
Information sessions will still take place, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the president of the United States, then it's infinitely better than talking to me.
"We're trying a lot to do this, and you've seen us do a lot over the last few weeks, and it's going to take the place of a press briefing when you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump frequently answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press releases with visiting dignity holders.
Solo press releases are scarce.
In New York this week, the president may have demonstrated why, by making an unbounded and at times bizarre appearance before journalists gathered there.
Health Secretary writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland on Brexit fears
The Secretary of Health wrote to EU staff working in Scotland's NHS to express the country's gratitude and wish that they would stay after Brexit.
Jeanne Freeman MSP sent a letter with less than six months left before the UK withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to covering costs of completed status applications for EU citizens working in the delegated public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote to me: “During the summer, negotiations between the UK and EU on withdrawal continued, en route to expected decisions this fall.
But the UK government has also stepped up its preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this is a very troubling time for all of you.
That's why I want to reiterate how much I value each staff member's contribution, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond, bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and enhance the health service's work, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we would very much like you to stay here.
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after head injury
Tennessee State Tigers line-up Christion Abercrombie had emergency surgery after suffering a major injury in Saturday's 31-27 defeat to the Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessee team's Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told journalists that the injury occurred shortly before rest.
"He came to the sidelines and kind of collapsed right there," Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen along the sidelines before being placed on a stretcher and taken back for further evaluation.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie was out of the theater at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are no details yet about the type/size of the injury," and Tennessee is still trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, an academic sophomore, is in his first season at Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
He died five times on Saturday before leaving the game, bringing his total for the season to 18 tackles.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp duty when buying a property in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp duty when buying a property in the UK and the extra cash will be used to help the homeless, according to new Tory plans.
This move will neutralize the success of Corbyn's effort to attract young voters
The stamp duty will be levied on those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Treasury expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year – to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp duty when buying a property in the UK – with the extra cash that will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The actions will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's effort to attract young voters with promises of providing more affordable housing and targeting high earners.
The seal tax increase will be levied on individuals and firms that do not pay taxes in the UK, with the extra money that will help the government's plans to counter homelessness.
The surcharge – which is outside the current stamp duty, including the higher levels set two years ago on second homes and houses bought to rent – can be as much as three percent.
The Treasury expects the move to bring in up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
An estimated 13 percent of newly built London properties are bought by non-UK citizens who push up prices and make it harder for first-time buyers to get a foot in the housing door.
Many wealthy areas of the country – especially in the capital – have become “ghost towns” due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in stamp duty to help more young people own their first home.
He accused major construction firms of keeping property prices high by picking up land but not using it, and urged Mrs. May to relinquish quotas on affordable homes to repair Britain's "housing disaster."
Mr. Corbyn has announced a striking series of proposed housing improvements, including rent controls and an end to “no-fault evictions”.
He also wants to give councils greater powers to build new houses.
Mrs May said: “Last year I said I would dedicate my prime ministership to restoring the British dream – that life should be better for every new generation.
And that means restoring our broken home market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
But it can't be right that it's just as easy for individuals who don't live in the UK, as well as foreign-based companies to buy homes as it is for hard-working British residents.
For too many people, the dream of home ownership has become a distant dream and the humiliation of homelessness has become too big a reality."
Jack Ross: 'My biggest ambition is to run Scotland'
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "biggest ambition" is to become Scotland's manager at some point.
The Scotsman, 42, enjoys the challenge of breathing new life into the North-East team, which is currently in third place in League One, three points below the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country.
I made the second team, but it was already there," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sports Sound.
"But as a child, I often watched Scotland at Hampden with my father and it's something that pulls me back.
The opportunity can only come when I'm successful with club management."
Ross's predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic boss said he felt no fear of imitating such established names at such a large club, having previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Right now, success for me will be measured by ''can I get this club back to the Premier League?''
Because of the structure and facilities at this club, it undoubtedly belongs in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task to get it there, but I will probably only consider myself successful if I can get the club out there again."
Ross's career in management has been just three years, after a period as assistant boss at Dumbarton and a 15-month period on Hearts' coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa return from relegation to the third league and transformed St Mirren from being on the verge of relegation to winners of the Championship title in the next season.
And Ross says he now feels more comfortable than he ever felt during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a real crossroads," he says as he reflects on how he took over Alloa's reins.
"I really believed management was the right place for me, even more so than playing.
It sounds bizarre, because I've done well enough, made a reasonable living out of it, and experienced reasonable highs.
But the game can be difficult.
There are a lot of things that a man needs to come by on a weekly basis.
I'm still going through this in terms of the stress and pressure of work, but management just feels right.
I always wanted to drive and now I'm doing it, it feels like the most comfortable thing I've been in my own skin all my adult life."

The perfect time for a pint is 5:30 p.m. on a Saturday, found survey
The summer heat wave improved Britain's struggling bars' revenue, but put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Drink spots and pub groups saw sales rise by 2.7% in July – but receipts in restaurants were down by 4.8 percent, figures showed.
Peter Martin, from business consulting firm CGA, who compiled the figures, says: "Continued sunshine and England's longer-than-expected participation in the World Cup meant that July followed a similar pattern to the previous month, June, when drinking spots were down by 2.8 percent, except that restaurants were hit even harder.
The 1.8% decline in restaurant trade in June only worsened in July.
Drink-guided drinking spots and pubs far outperformed and soared more than restaurants had fallen.
Food-led drinking spots also suffered in the sun, but not as bad as restaurant operators
It seems like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
Across managed bars and drinking spots, sales rose by 6.6 percent for the month, with food being down by three percent."
Paul Newman, of RSM's recreation and hospitality analysts, said: "These results continue the trend we've seen since the end of April.
Weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors when it comes to sales in the out-of-the-house market.
It comes as no surprise that restaurant groups continue to struggle, though a 4.8 percent year-over-year decline in sales will be especially difficult beyond ongoing expense pressures.
The long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for food-led operators and only time will show whether the more temperate temperatures we have experienced since August will bring necessary relief."
Total growth in sales across drinking spots and restaurants, including new locations that opened, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the slowdown in brand launches.

One in five children have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents
One in five children — some as young as 11 — have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers, a survey reveals.
Survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in "fake Insta pages"
The news has raised fears that sexual content is being posted
Twenty percent of learners say they have a "main account" to show to parents
One in five children – some as young as 11 – create social media accounts that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed rapid growth in “fake Insta accounts” – a reference to the photo sharing site Instagram.
The news has raised fears of sexual content being posted.
Twenty percent of learners said they had a clean "main account" to show to parents, but also had private accounts.
One mother who came across her 13-year-old daughter's secret site found a teenager urging others to "rape" her.
The research, at Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistress' Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-olds have two profiles, with half of them admitting to having private accounts.
HMC head Mike Buchanan said: "It's disturbing that so many teens are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can't track them down."
Eilidh Doyle will be "voting for athletes" on Scottish Athletics Council
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the board of Scottish Athletics as a non-executive director at the governing body's annual general meeting.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated track-and-field athlete and chairman Ian Beattie has described the move as a great opportunity for those leading the sport to benefit from her far-reaching experience at international level over the past decade.
"Eilidh has great respect across the Scottish, UK and world athletic community and we are sure that athletics in Scotland will greatly benefit from what she brings to the council," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I am eager to act as a voice for athletes and hope I can really contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Games in Atlanta among his four gold Olympic medals, is now a regular BBC expert, unable to walk after suffering a brief ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "Today, a month ago, I had a stroke.
I could not walk.
Doctors said only time will tell if I will recover and to what extent.
It was exhausting work, but fully recovered, re-learned how to walk and do agility exercises today!
Thank you for the message of encouragement!"
Breast pump advertising that compares moms to cows splits opinions online
A breast pump company has split opinions online with an ad comparing breastfeeding mothers to cows being milked.
To celebrate the launch of what is called the "world's first silent portable breast pump," consumer technology company Elvie has released a tongue-in-cheek music video-inspired ad to showcase the freedom the pump gives to moms who are milking out.
Four real moms dance in a barn full of straw and cows on the beat of a song that includes lyrics like "Yes, I milk myself, but you can't see a tail" and "In case you haven't seen it, it's not udders, it's my breasts."
The chorus part reads: "Pump it out, pump it out, I'm feeding the babies, pumping it out, pumping it out, I'm milking my ladies."
But the ad published on the company's Facebook page caused controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it underplays the "horrors" of the dairy industry.
"Very poor decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but their babies are often stolen from them within days of giving birth," one wrote.

Another commented: "Understandably traumatic for mom and baby.
But yes, why not use it to advertise a breast pump for moms who can keep their babies?"
Someone else added: "The advertisement is so out of touch."
Others defended the ad, with one woman acknowledging that the song was "creepy" for her.
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
I would have had one if I had always breastfed.
Milking out made me feel like a cow.
The advertisement is a bit crazy, but I accepted it for what it is.
"It's a brilliant product," one wrote.
Another noted: "It's a fun ad aimed at moms who are milking out (often in their workplaces or toilets) and feel like "cows."
This is not an advertisement that the dairy industry praises or judges.
At the end of the video, the women show that they were all dancing with the discrete pump in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who are milking out say that they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is dead-quiet, has no wires or tubes, and fits discreetly into a feeding bra that gives women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even go out while they're milking out.
Ana Balarin, Partner and UKD at Mother commented: "The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a big and enticing launch.
By drawing a parallel between women who are milking and dairy cows, we wanted to highlight the milking process and all its challenges, while in an entertaining way that people can connect to, we demonstrate the wonderful sense of freedom that the new pump will bring.
This isn't the first time the Elvie pump has made the news.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the runway for designer Marta Jakubowski while she was using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has risen sharply although monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, in part due to fierce rhetoric and policies put in place by the Trump administration that make it harder to place children on sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors were also undocumented immigrants and feared that their own ability to stay in the country would be jeopardized by stepping forward to claim a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would have to submit their fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs enforcement official, testified before Congress that the agency arrested thousands of people who applied to sponsor unsuspecting minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested did not have previous criminal records.
"Almost 80 percent of individuals who are either sponsors or family members of sponsors are illegal here in the country and a large number of them are criminal foreigners.
That's why we continue to prosecute those individuals," Mr. Albence said.
In an effort to process the children more quickly, officials introduced new rules that would require some of them to appear in court within a month of detention, rather than after 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to shelter workers.
Many will appear via video conferencing call, rather than in person, to plead their case for legal status with an immigration judge.
Those who are considered unfit for relief will be deported quickly.
The longer the children remain in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts, according to shelter workers and reports emerging from the system in recent months.
Advocates say those concerns are heightened at a larger facility like Tornillo, where signs that a child is struggling are more easily overlooked due to size.
They added that moving the children to the tent village without giving them enough time to emotionally prepare to say goodbye to friends could exacerbate the trauma that many are already struggling with.
Syria tells US, French and Turkish ‘occupation forces’ to withdraw immediately
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to come home, even though the country's war is in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said the foreign forces were illegal on Syrian soil, under the pretext of fighting terrorism and would be "treated accordingly."
"They have to withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he told the meeting.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terror" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, with millions more uprooted, is "almost over."
He said Damascus would continue "to wage this sacred battle until we have cleansed all Syrian territories" of both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, training and advising mostly Kurdish forces as well as Syrian Arabs against President Bashar al-Assad.
France with more than 1,000 troops on the ground in the war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said conditions are in order for them to return, blaming "some Western countries" for spreading "irrational fears that urge refugees to stay away."
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They're politicizing something that should simply be a humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats said a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in Idlib's last major rebel stronghold created an opportunity to continue with political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement repelled a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hopes that military action would target jihadists, including fighters from the Al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front who will be "eradicated."
UN envoy, Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem prescribed conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the panel's work should be limited to "checking the articles of the current constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Term
According to that logic, Mr. Trump will win the 2020 re-election unless, as many liberals probably hope, a state of impeachment and scandals end his presidency early.
In what is without a doubt "the most dramatic finale of a presidency will ever be!"
To this day, there are no signs of snoring.
Since 2014, peak-time viewing rates have more than doubled to 1.05 million at CCN and almost tripled to 1.6 million at MSNCBC.
Fox News has an average 2.4 million peak viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" tops cable viewing figures with as many as 3.5 million viewers on big news nights.
"It's a fire that people are drawn to because it's not something we understand," said Neal Baer, program manager of the ABC drama "Designated Survivor" about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Congressional building.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club," has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The manager told her that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? she asked.
“He said, ‘Because he makes me laugh,’” Scovell told me.
There is entertainment value in the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the storylines coming out of Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can reunite and the health of the global economy.
Eliminating is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it goes beyond just being an informed citizen when you’re in the sixth hour of it to watch a panel of experts debate Bob Woodward’s use of “deep background” from his book “Fear,” Paul Manafort’s $15,000 ostrich leather flight jacket (“a piece thick of the hubris,” The Washington Post’s anaesthetists say) and the Washington Post’s imp
I'll never look at Super Mario the same way again.
"Part of what he does that makes it feel like a reality show is that he feeds you something every night," says Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of "Pawn Stars," about the Trump show's fluctuating cast and daily twists in the plot (such as seeking out an argument with N.F.L., praising Kim Jong-un).

When I reached for Mr. Fleiss this week, it was 80 degrees outside his home on the northern coast of Kauai, but he was inside watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He couldn't tear him away, not with Brett Kavanaugh on his way to appear before the Senate Judiciary and the future of the Supreme Court hanging in the balance.
"I remember back then when we were doing all those crazy shows and people were saying, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was kind of a joke, but it turned out they were right."

Out-of-pocket stream after most exciting mid-term election races in Home
It's not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th sees an influx of money, thanks to a shift in congressional districts that has now landed two office-bearers in a race for the same seat.
The recently changed suburban Pittsburg district allows Democratic Rep. Conor Lamb – who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring – to measure forces.
Lamb faces yet another office-bearer, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old Pennsylvania 12th district, which heavily overlaps with the new 17th.
The maps were retracted after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally demarcated in the Republicans' favor.
The race in the new 17th kicked off with a campaign finance competition between the major parties' financial legs, the Democratic Campaign's Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after a nail-biting win in a widely watched special election in March for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
The seat was held by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts gave the Democrats a slight advantage.
US considered penalizing El Salvador, rather than supporting China, but then retreated
Diplomats have noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a cordial meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until partners evicted the Trump Organization's management team.
State Department officials have decided to recall U.S. heads of state from diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over the "recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan," department spokesman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But fines were only considered against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including drug control, development and economic assistance.
The proposed fines, which include reductions in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would be difficult for the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, only North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level convention and focused on security and economic progress to follow up on a similar gathering last year that was seen as a step forward in an effort to prevent migrants from going to the United States.
But by mid-September, top administrative officials made it clear that they wanted Congress to continue to effectively put an end to any consideration of fines for El Salvador.
Deputy President Mike Pence is now due to address Congress, now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the seriousness of the meeting for the administration, the diplomats said.
And the three U.S. envoys have quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic with no new angry messages or punishments from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal deliberations on condition of anonymity.
Their statements were confirmed by an outside analyst who was close to the administration and also spoke about the condition of anonymity.
Studying History
The next thing that could happen could be the special deliberation on Robert Mueller's report on Mr. Trump's possible obstruction of justice, of which there is now very significant evidence in the public record.
Mr. Mueller is also likely to focus his investigation on whether Mr. Trump's campaign with Russia cooperated in the country's attack on our elections.
Should Congress pass into other hands, Mr. Trump will have to face accountability in that body just as he prepares to go before the voters again, and perhaps eventually before a jury of his peer group.
It’s a lot of axes, and I don’t want to imply that Mr. Trump’s fall is inevitable – nor that of his counterparts in Europe.
There are decisions to be made on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how much the battle can be stretched.
In 1938, German officials were ready to carry out a coup against Hitler, if the West only opposed him and supported the Czechoslovaks at Munich.
We failed and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points and democracy's relentless course is rushed or delayed.
Americans are now facing several such turning points in the face.
What would we do if Mr. Trump fired Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in hot water since this newspaper reported that last year he proposed to secretly take on the president and speculated about whether he was qualified for his office.
Mr. Rosenstein says The Times' report is inaccurate.
How will we respond if Brett Kavanaugh’s newly requested FBI investigation is not complete or fair – or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible charges of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the by-election for a Congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we look at those tests, there is a long winter ahead for democracy.
But I believe we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czecho-Slovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that lived in my ambassador's house at one time.
She survived, emigrated to America, and, 60 years later, sent me to light Sabbath candles on that table carrying the swastika.
With that as my origin, how can I not be an optimist about our future?"

Rangers' Graham Dorrans optimistic for Rapid Vienna fight
Rangers play hosts for Rapid Vienna on Thursday knowing that victory over the Austrians, following the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify for Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season until the 2-2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes Rangers can use this result as a launching pad for bigger things.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old.
"We went into the game with the belief that we could get something and walked away with a point.
Maybe we could have won it in the end, but a draw is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we came out in the second half and were the better team.
Thursday is a big day for Europe.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it's going to be a tough game because they had a good result in their last game, but with the crowd on our side, I'm sure we can push through and get a positive result.
Last year was certainly difficult, with everything that happened to my injuries and the changes at the club, but there is now a feel-good factor to the place.
The group is good and the men really enjoy it; the coaching is good.
Hopefully, we can now push through, sit behind us in the past season and be successful."
Women Are Losing Sleep Over This Retirement Savings Fear
Despite the fact that survey participants have a clear idea of how they want to be cared for, few people talk to their relatives about it.
About half of the individuals in the Nationwide study said they talked to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they had talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't take the steps to have the conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide's life insurance business.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and the children: You cannot prepare your family to provide care if you do not express your wishes long in advance.
Work with your counselor and your family to discuss where and how to receive care, as those choices can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Bring in your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you come up with a way to pay for those expenses.
Your long-term care funding decisions may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid cash value life insurance policy to help cover these expenses, or self-insurance with your own capabilities – as long as you have the money.
Work out your legal documents: Cut down legal disputes at the pass.
Get a health care proxy in place so you can appoint a trusted individual to oversee your medical care and ensure that experts will honor your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
It's also good for your finances.
You need to choose someone you trust to make financial decisions for you and ensure that your bills are paid if you are incompetent.
Don't forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on the way to hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Play out those details in a written plan so you're ready.
"It's not just the financial issues that are at stake, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
What's the Medication?
Who will take care of the dog?
Make sure that plan is in place."
Man shot several times in Ilfracombe with windbucks
A man was shot several times with a gun while walking home after a night out.
The victim, in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
Officials described the shooting, which occurred at around 2:30 a.m. BST, as a "random act."
The victim did not see his attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening and police have called for witnesses.
Earthquakes and Tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died from a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and the death toll is expected to rise.
With communications put out of action, relief officials were unable to get any information from Donggala Regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the center of the 7.5-magnitude quake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were brought to safety after the disaster hit.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, located at the tip of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a regency stretching along more than 300 km (180 miles) of coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The regency, an administrative region under a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the mainstays of the Central Sulawesi province's economy, especially the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times over the past 100 years, according to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami caused more than 200 deaths and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also hit western Donggala in 1996, causing nine deaths.
Indonesia sits on the seismic Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the great earthquakes and tsunamis of the past few years:
2004: A major quake off the western coast of Indonesian Aceh province in northern Sumatra on 26 December that led to a tsunami that struck 14 countries resulted in 226,000 deaths off the coast of the Indian Ocean, with more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong tremors struck the western coast of Sumatra late in March and early in April.
Hundreds have died in Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude hit southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, resulting in a tsunami that struck the southern coast and caused nearly 700 deaths.
2009: A 7.6-magnitude quake struck near the city of Padang, capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people have died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude quake struck one of the Mentawai Islands, near Sumatra, resulting in a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and resulted in about 300 deaths.
2016: A level shaking hit the Pidie Jaya regency in Aceh and led to destruction and panic when people were reminded of the destruction of the deadly quake and tsunami in 2004.
It did not lead to a tsunami this time, but more than 100 were killed because of buildings that crashed,
2018: Major tremors hit Indonesia's tourist island of Lombok, with more than 500 deaths, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists were temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on domestic violence charges.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interference with a report of domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to a report issued by Alaska State Police on Saturday.
According to the police report, he took a female acquaintance's phone from her when she called the police to report the alleged crimes.
Palin is in custody at Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is being held on a $500 unsecured bond, KTUU reports.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared "innocent, certainly" when asked what he was pleading, the network reported.
Palin faces three Class A infractions, meaning he could be jailed for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He is also charged with a Class B offense, punishable by a day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time a criminal complaint has been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported the alleged attack.
The case is currently before Alaska's Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interference with the report of a crime of domestic violence, and possession of a firearm while intoxicated, in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed that he punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans' groups in 2016 after she linked her son's behavior to PTSD as a result of his duty in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake-tsunami: hundreds killed
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake led to a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been put out of action with death rates expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck just outside central Sulawesi, which is northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos circulate on social media that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the beach.
Federal prosecutors seek rare death sentence for suspect in NYC terror attack
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death sentence for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terror attack who caused eight people's death - a rare sentence not yet carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out an attack on a bike path along the West Side highway in Lower Manhattan to cut off pedestrians and a cyclist who was in his way in October.
To justify a death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "deliberately" killed the eight victims and "deliberately" inflicted serious bodily injuries, according to the notice of intent to seek the death penalty, filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both of those charges carry possible death penalty, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury slapped Saipov with 22 charges, which included eight counts of murder in favor of extortion, typically used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required “profound planning and premeditation,” prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov performed it as “horrible, cruel and perverse.”
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injury, damage and loss to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," the statement said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
A decade has passed since New York City's Southern District judicially prosecuted a death penalty case.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was sentenced to life in prison for the murder of two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were put to death after being sentenced to death for plotting to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenberges were executed with the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, demonstrated no remorse in the days and months after the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators that he felt good about what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the charges.
He also asked to display the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to the 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal pro-deo advocates representing Saipov, said they were "of course disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We think that the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accept a guilty plea to life imprisonment with no possible release will only prolong the trauma of these events for all those involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team has previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory LP says NIGEL FARAGE should be put in charge of Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage made a vow to mobilize "the people's army" today during a protest at the Tory conference.
The former Ukip leader said politicians had to “feel the heat” of Eurosceptics – as one of Theresa May’s own MPs suggested he should be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told the march in Birmingham that the UK "would be out" by then if Mr Farage was Brexit secretary.
But the challenge Mrs. May faces in uniting her deeply divided officers has been addressed by pro-Roman Tories by joining a separate anti-Brexit protest in the city.
The prime minister is struggling to keep her Chequers compromise plan on track amid attacks from Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU.
Allies insisted she would push through in her attempt to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the deadlock – forcing Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and ‘chaos’.
Mr Bone told the Loop Means Loop event in Solihull that he wanted to "throw out Chequers".
He suggested that Mr Farage should have been made a nobleman and be given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
‘If he was in charge, we would have been out by then,’ he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: "I will stand up for Brexit, but we have to throw out Chequers."
He outlined his opposition to the EU, saying: "We did not fight world wars to be submissive.
We want to make our own bets in our own country."
Mr Bone rejected suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: ‘The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay is completely untrue.’
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns was also at the march and told reporters: ‘I simply say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequers is unpopular with the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for it, it is unpopular with our party and our activists who are actually bombing the streets and making sure that we are chosen in the first place.
"Please let Chequers go and start listening."
In a direct message to Mrs May, she added: ‘First ministers should keep their jobs when they keep their promises.’
Mr Farge told reporters that the convention politicians "should have felt the heat" if they were on the threshold of wanting to violate the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
‘It’s about a matter of trust between us – the people – and our political class,’ he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit and we’re here today to tell them ‘we won’t let you get away with it.’”
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class, who are about to betray Brexit, feel the heat.
“We are mobilizing the people’s army of this country that has given us victory in Brexit and will not rest until we are an independent, self-governing, proud UK.”
Meanwhile, Remainers marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour convention in the city centre.
A few activists waved Tories against Brexit banners after the group's launch this weekend.
Labour noble Lord Adonis mocked the conservatives for the security issues they endured with a party application as the conference opened.
‘It’s the people who tell us that they can have the IT systems and all the technology for Canada plus plus in place, for the frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,’ he added.
“It’s an overall smart one.
"There's no such thing as a good Brexit," he said.
Warren Plans to ‘Look Hard at It’ to Stand for President
U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren says she will "look hard to stand for president" after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at a city hall meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, faces re-election in November against GOP state Rep. Geoff Diehl who co-chaired Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She is already in the midst of speculation that she might challenge Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with constituents using the city hall format since Trump came to power.
A resident asked her if she wanted to run for president.
Warren responded that it was "time for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that includes a woman at the top."
Arrest made in shooting death of LSU's Sims
Baton Rouge, LA - Police in Baton Rouge, LA, announced on Saturday that a suspect in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wayne Sims was arrested on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11 a.m. ET news conference.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help identifying a man seen in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed early Friday near Southern University's campus.
"Wayde Sims sustained a gunshot wound to the head and eventually died as a result," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media per 247sports on Saturday.
Wayde stepped in to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being on the scene, in possession of a weapon, and admitted to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and arrested at East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A 6-foot-6 youngster who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played in 32 games with 10 lead last season and maintained an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton clinched world title after team orders gave him his win over Sebastian Vettel
It became clear the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday when Mercedes' team orders would play a major role in the race.
From pole position, Bottas had a good start and almost won for Hamilton as he defended his position in the first two turns and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel first went into the pits and left Hamilton to drive into the back of the bunch in traffic, something that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes pitted a lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton advanced to wheel-to-wheel action that saw the Ferrari driver reluctantly risk-free leaving the inside at risk of stalling after a double move to defend on the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the starting grid and was seventh by the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He then led a large portion of the race as he held on to his tyres to finish quickly and pass Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He eventually entered the pits on the 44th lap, but was unable to accelerate his pace in the remaining eight laps as Raikkonen took fourth place.
It was said that it was a difficult day, because Valtteri had done fantastic all weekend and was a real gentleman.
The team did an exceptional job of having a one-two," Hamilton said.
It was a really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein on Saturday at a convention over her insistence that she had not leaked Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
The president spoke at a convention in West Virginia and did not directly address the evidence Ford gave before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Instead, he commented that what was going on in the Senate showed people to be " mean and rude and liars."
"The one thing that can happen and the sweet thing that has been going on in the Senate over the last few days, when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and mean and liars," he said.
"When you look at statements and leaks and then they say, 'Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do that."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, are you ready?
Remember her reply... did you leak the document - "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no, no, no.
I didn't lick it."
Well, wait a minute.
No, we didn't leak it," he added, in an appearance by the senator.
Feinstein was sent the letter setting out the allegations against Kavanaugh by Ford back in July, and it was leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein denied that the leak had come down from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations. I didn't leak her story," Feinstein told the committee, The Hill reported.
"She asked me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential as she asked."
But the president did not approve of her denial, commenting during Saturday night's meeting: "I tell you what. It was really bad body language.
Maybe she doesn't, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
The president went on to defend the Supreme Court nominee accused by three women of sexual misconduct and suggested that the Democrats use the allegations for their own purposes.
"They are determined to take back power by any means necessary.
You see the meanness, the rudeness, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to drive around to get power and control," Mediaite reported.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
Dundee Stars have reconciled for Friday's Elite League loss to Belfast Giants by winning the match 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants got an early two-goal lead by throws from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied the home team before Dwyer restored the Giants' lead.
Francois Bouchard tied Dundee before two Lukas Lundvald Nielsen goals tied their win.
This was the third Elite League victory of the season for Adam Keefe's men who first lost games and then won Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the sides, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
Dwyer's opener came in the fourth minute at 3:35 from a Kendall McFaull assist, with David Rutherford providing the assist when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In what was a busy opening period, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt became the host for Cownie's equaliser at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants took lead until the first break in when he threw his second goal of the night at the end of the first half.
The home side regrouped and Bouchard again drew with a power play goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran stood together to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the match late in the second half and he made sure of winning with his team's fifth point halfway through the final half.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, are home to Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies to make sure hundreds on plane could escape earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is considered a hero after he died when he made sure that a plane carrying hundreds of people took off safely.
More than 800 people were killed and more are missing after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
There are still strong aftershocks in the area and many are trapped in demolitions in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues fleeing for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the control tower that swung badly at the Mutiara SIS Al-Jufri airport in Palu.
He remained immobile to make sure Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, was able to take off safely.
He then jumped off the traffic control tower when the day it tumbled into each other.
He later died in hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait says the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, Australia's ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts are broken to hear this," he said.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death toll could reach the thousands with the country's disaster mitigation agency saying access to the towns of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"It is believed that the death toll continues to rise as many bodies are still under the rubble while many cannot yet be reached," agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said.
Waves reaching up to six meters have ripped Palu, who will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring in aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute brings in an ambulance bodies.
Clean water is a shock.
The mini-market is being plundered orally."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is racing to help survivors, but we don't know what they're going to find there.
It's a tragedy, but it can get much worse."
Indonesia's President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military service: "I ask almai from you to work day and night to complete every task related to evacuation.
"Are you ready?" said CNN.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok in which more than 550 people were killed.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini now says one man missing after lake of water plane crash
The airline that handled a flight that crashed into a Pacific beach lake in Micronesia now says one man is missing after earlier saying that all 47 passengers and crew safely evacuated the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon they could not account for a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals, and detectives to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water as it attempted to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
On Friday, officials said seven people had been taken to a hospital.
The airline said that six passengers stayed in the hospital on Saturday, and that all of them were in stable condition.
The cause of the collapse and the exact sequence of events remains unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both said the plane landed near the runway in the lagoon.
Some witnesses thought that the plane had passed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane came in very low.
"It's a really good thing," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and the others managed to walk through mid-deep water to the emergency exits on the sinking plane.
He said the airmen panicked and shouted and that he sustained a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that ships working close to improving a quay also used an inflatable boat with the rescue to help people land back and forth before the plane sank into about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Air Safety Network indicates that 111 people have been killed in collapses of PNG-registered airlines in the past two decades, but Air Niugini has been involved in one.
Analists break down timeline of night when woman was burned alive
The state closed its case on Saturday in the retrial of a man charged with burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He set out to the jury how he used cell phone records to put together the movements of 29-year-old indicted Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said he received location data from various cell phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night of her death, which contradicted his previous allegations, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When data showed his cell phone was at Chambers during the period he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday that he wasn't in town that day.
When prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "joking because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency is that Tellis said he knew Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
The couple said they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that a while after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He took her out of his life," Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its closing arguments Sunday.
The judge said he expected the hearing to go to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative outlook of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that hip-hop has moved away from its origins in political messages and tackling social issues.
They want to go back to the basics and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have seen a recent resurgence in the UK by artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
There's a black person?!
NY nanny sues couple for being fired after "racist" text
A New York City nanny is suing a couple for discriminatory dismissal after she received a misaddressed message from the mother complaining that she was "another black person."
The couple denies they are racist and likens the case to "extortion."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, voiced her dismay when she found out that the new childcare provider, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived for her first day at work in 2016.
"NEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Instead of sending it to her husband, however, she sent it to me twice Maurice.
After she found out about her mistake, an "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman fired me Maurice, saying that they were doing bad work for an outgoing nanny who was African-American and that she was instead expecting a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
She was paid for one day's work and then sent home with an Uber.
Now Maurice is suing the couple for damages over the dismissal and seeking his damages up to $350 per day for the six months, resident work for which she was initially appointed, even though it was without a contract.
"I want to show them, look, you're not doing that well," she told the Post on Friday, adding "I know this is discrimination."
The couple slammed back at the allegations that they were racist, saying that it was the reasonable thing to end Maurice's employment and feared that they would not be able to trust her after they insulted her.
"My wife sent her something that she didn't mean to say.
She's not a racist.
We're not racist people," Joel Plasco told the Post.
"But would you put your children in the hands of someone with whom you were rude, even if it was by mistake?
Your new-born baby?
Come on, now."
Plasco compared the case to "extortion" and said his wife would have had a baby in two months and was in a "very difficult situation."
"You're just following a person?
It's not a very nice thing to do," the investment banker added.
While the lawsuit was still ongoing, the court of public opinion had been quick to put the couple on social media and hijack them for their behavior and logic.
A new letter reveals that Paddington publishers feared that a talking bear wouldn't connect readers.
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who reads it for the first time before it's published.
"It's very entertaining to know about Paddington's great success."
She said her father would have been furious if his work had been rejected. He was a BBC cameraman before he was inspired to write the children’s book about the little toy bear. She added that the 60th anniversary of the book’s release after his death was “bittersweet” last year.
About Paddington, whom she describes as a "very important member of our family," she added that her father was quietly proud of his eventual success.
"He was quite a quiet man and he wasn't an apple-gazing man," she said.
"But because Paddington was real to him, it was almost as if you had a child who had achieved something: you're proud of them, even if it's not your job.
I think he saw Paddington's success that way.
Even if it was his creation and imagination, he always gave the credit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to the phone.
When she landed, her daughter was rushed to Nice's Louis Pasteur 2 hospital where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad often called to say that it was really bad, that they didn't expect her to make it," Ms Ednan-Laperouse said.
"Then I got the call from Nad to say that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I should have greeted her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much, hartlam.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicine the doctors gave her to keep her heart beating was slowly getting up and leaving her system.
She died a short time before that, and the body was about to close.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing that it was unfolding.
I couldn't wink or shout or cry because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to keep it together."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who was hurt by the loss of her daughter at the time, boarded the plane with the other passengers - unaware of the ordeal she appreciated.
"Nobody knew," she said.
"I had my head down and the tears had fallen all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the flight I got an overwhelmingly sympathetic feeling for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.
Sad women post cards to prevent suicides on bridge
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide are working to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been posting cards for a while on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he started suffering from depression and killed himself at 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day," she said.
Me Davis, 45, lives in Lydney and said her son was a promising chef with an infectious smile.
"Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said that his smile brightened any departure."
However, he gave up work before he died because he was "in a very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after he took his own life.
Me Davis said, "I'm constantly worried that there's going to be a domino effect."
Me Davis designed the cards, "to let people know that there are people out there who you can go to and talk to, even if it's a friend.
"Don't sit in silence, you have to talk."
Me Humphreys, who has been a friend of Me Davies's for years, lost Mark, her 15-year-old husband, not long after his mother's death.
"He didn't say he was feeling sick or depressed or anything," she said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He reached the very lowest point on Christmas Day - when the children opened their presents, he didn't make eye contact or anything with them."
She said his death was very traumatic for them, but that they had to work through it: "It's ripping a hole through the family.
This divides us.
We all have to fight and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is still undecided as FBI investigation begins
"I thought if we could actually get something like what he asked for - a timeless investigation that has no scope - we might be able to bring some unity," Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "falling apart" under entrenched partisan aggregation.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their unselfishness is all due to timing.
The by-elections are only weeks away, on November 6 - if, as expected, the Republicans fare badly, then they will be severely weakened in their efforts to get the man they want elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush is calling senators to influence them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House and who through him met his wife Ashley and was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happened after the FBI released the report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats currently sit.
It is not yet clear whether Mr Kavanaugh can get to at least 50 votes on the Senate floor that will allow Vice President Mike Pence to break a tie and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
North Korea's 'down' under Kim
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug cited data from the South's unification cabinet, saying there were 1,127 wars last year - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said tighter border controls between North Korea and China and higher tariffs demanded by human traffickers were key factors.
Pyongyang has made no public comment.
The vast majority of defectors from the North are finally offered South Korea citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flights via China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the highly protective demilitarized zone (DMS) between the two Koreas.
China regards the defectors as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often repatriates them by force.
Relations between the North and the South - who are technically still at war with each other - have improved remarkably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks centered around the strike negotiations on the removal of nuclear weapons.
It came after the historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore when they agreed in broad terms to work together for the nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions on Saturday for the lack of progress since then.
"Without any confidence in SU, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances, there is no way that we will unilaterally disarm ourselves first," Mr Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi Calls Brett Kavanaugh 'Histories', Says He's Incompetent to Serve on Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "historians" and said he was temperamentally incompetent to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comment on Saturday in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman ever acted like that, they would say 'histerical'," Pelosi said of her response to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh has denied allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional and at the time he almost screamed and stifled as he discussed his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly denounced Democrats on the committee, calling the allegations against him a "ridiculous and coordinated character assassination," orchestrated by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton had lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved he could not serve on the Supreme Court because it showed he was biased against Democrats.
"I think he's making himself incompetent with those statements and the way he went after the Clintons and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked if she would try to charge Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and if Democrats won the majority in the House of Commons.
"I'll say that -- if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's not qualified to be on the Supreme Court, but to be on the court he's on right now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the D.C. Ommegang Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she was concerned about potential Kavanaugh decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade as he was deemed a conservative right.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh skipped questions about whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
"It's not time for a hysterical, biased person to go to court and expect us to say, 'isn't it great,'" Pelosi said.
Women have to deal with this.
It's a righteous diatribe, months and years of anger boiling over, and she can't get it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual, do you?"
She continued, "I was helped a lot by a woman who was an executive somewhere, who also said that she cried when she got angry, but developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and started crying, she would say to the person she was talking to, "You might think I was sad because I was crying.
I am angry."
And then she just went on.
"I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are permissible as a partial exit for bridle because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my sharpest memories of an early job in a male-dominated office is where I once found myself crying with unnamed rage and being grabbed by my neck skin by an older woman - a cold driver I was a little afraid of - who dragged me into a stairwell.
"Don't ever let them see you cry," she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy because they've had an effect on you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital relationship on a boat called Monkey Business and he had to leave the race, Schroeder realized, very frustrated, that there was no reason why she could not investigate the idea that she could run for president.
"I didn't think about the decision very well," she told me laughingly 30 years later.
"There were seven other candidates already in the race and the last thing they needed was another one.
Someone called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Because it was late in the campaign, she was behind with find collections, so she made a vow that she would not enter the race unless she raised $2 million dollars.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men, only $250 would give her.
"Do you think I'm going to get rejected?" she asked.
When she delivered her speech and announced that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was overwhelmed by emotions - thankful for the people who supported her, frustrated with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and target voters rather than delegates, and angry at the sexism - that she suffocated.
You would have thought I had a nervous breakdown," recalled Schroeder about how the press reacted to her.
"You would have thought that Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they going to put on my tombstone?
"She's crying?"
How the U.S.-China Trade War Could Be Good for Beijing
The opening salvo of the trade war between SU and China had been deafening and while the battle is far from over, a dispute between the countries may be beneficial to Beijing in the long run, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump fired the first warning earlier this year by taxing key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most interesting escalation rolled in this week with new tariffs affecting $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion) of items and effectively taxing half of the goods entering SU from China.
Beijing has retaliated in goods every time and recently slashed tariffs of five to ten percent on $60 billion of U.S. goods.
China has promised to equal the SU shot-for-shot and the world's largest economy is not going to move anytime soon.
Getting Washington to stand back means surrendering to requests, but publicly complying with SU's requests will be too much of an embarrassment to Xi Jinping, China's president.
Experts still say that if Beijing plays its cards right, pressure on US trade war over the long-term could positively support China by lowering the interdependence of the two economies.
The fact that a quick political decision in either Washington or Beijing could create the conditions that could start an economic toll flight in any of the countries is actually much more dangerous than spectators have previously confessed," said Abigail Grace, a research assistant focusing on Asia at the center of New American Security, a thinker.
Syria ‘ready’ for refugees to return, Foreign Minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help to rebuild the country devastated by a war for more than seven years.
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly that conditions in the country were improving.
"Today, the situation at ground level is more stable and secure thanks to progress in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore the areas destroyed by terrorists to normal.
All conditions are now present for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they were forced to leave because of terrorism and the one-sided economic measures that targeted their daily lives and existence.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
A further six million people who still live in the country need philanthropic assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help rebuilding the devastated country.
But he insisted that it would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that sponsored the invasion.
Europe celebrates Ryder Cup victory in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup and defeated Team USA by a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
SU has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team scored the 14.5 points they needed to win the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who struggled for most of the tournament, blew his T-hold into the water at the par-3 16th hole and conceded his match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari excelled in all his rounds and became one of the 1-of-4 players to ever go 5-0-0 since the tournament's current format began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was blown out 5&4 by the player with the lowest rank on the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The player with the world's highest ranking, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 and 1 to land Poulter of England who may have played in his final Ryder Cup.
A veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spaniard Sergio Garcia has become the tournament's European winner of all time with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a rough year.
I'm so grateful for Thomas and for what he has done for me.
I'm so happy, so glad to have the cup back.
It's about the team and I'm glad I could help," an emotional Garcia said after the European victory.
He handed the torch to his compatriot John Ram who on Sunday defeated US golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in a single game.
The incredible pride I feel, to beat Tiger Woods, I grew up watching that old guy," Rahm said.
Woods has lost all four of his matches in France and now has a 13-21-3 career Ryder Cup record.
A strange statistic by one of the greatest players of all time and he won 14 major titles second only to Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA struggled all weekend to find the clean field with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau who played high-caliber golf throughout the tournament.
US captain Jim Furyk spoke on behalf of his team after a disappointing performance: “I’m proud of these guys. They fought.
There was a bit of heat in Europe this morning.
We've scraped it.
Beware of Thomas.
He's a wonderful captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We will regroup. I will work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee, and we will move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to serve as their captain.
You need to keep your hat on.
We're overachievers."
