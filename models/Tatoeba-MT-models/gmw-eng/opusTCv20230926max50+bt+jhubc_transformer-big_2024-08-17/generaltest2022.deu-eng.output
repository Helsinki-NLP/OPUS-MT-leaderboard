The goods cost less than 20 euros.
The fee corresponds to 40% of the value of the goods....
I am a #PRS_ORG# major customer and so it is not a problem for me.
All you need is a number or an instruction on what I should attach to the package so that it can be tracked by you as a return.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG# a few days ago... for 249€.
Today it costs $179.
To be honest, I find that very annoying.
Do I have to cancel and re-order the order for the better price or is there another way of crediting?
I also think that children should not be expected to take on a parenting role for their little siblings.
However, I think it is also good for big siblings to take care of the little ones in moderation.
Take a look, help, bring the bottle, etc.
In this way, they learn responsibility, help in the family and are involved.
As long as you can be a child, I don’t see a problem.
If your K1 is alone for a short time and it is OK for him, that’s good.
You can decide for yourself whether this is suitable for your children.
It is not the case that he should wrap K2 and accompany him to sleep for hours.
Legally speaking, it is probably questionable.
Perhaps that is the psychologist’s point of view.
Because if something should actually happen like a fire, burglary, earthquake, alien invasion, etc., it would actually be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2.
Whether this is a risk you want to take, of course, is your discretion ;)
Please help me find the title of a book.
I remember reading a thriller a few years ago and I can still remember almost the whole story but I don't want to think of the title partout anymore maybe someone knows here...
The story was about fear and treating it.
At the beginning of the story, an animal keeper commits suicide by showering himself with food and going into the enclosure with his big cats.
The case is taken over by a commissioner who, after a short investigation at his therapist, runs a clinic where he treats anxiety patients.
The commissioner has a little niece who is also afraid (of fire) and ends up with this therapist.
There is more suicide and there is another protagonist - a photographer who before each suicide is anonymously instructed to go to the place of the suicide and document and put the photos on the Internet.
In any case, it turns out that this therapist operates a kind of underground therapy group where the patient is transplanted a chip that suppresses a fear center in the brain and the patients ultimately face their fear in the most extreme way.
(one woman jumps out the window, another drives herself to death with intent)
This face of fear is referred to in the book as "the fight".
In the end, there is a big showdown in the clinic that had to do with a fire.
This is the rough plot I am quite sure that the book was originally written by a French author.
If this action is known to someone or even someone can tell me the title of the book, I would be very happy.
Oh dear, I don't have the password for the wifi available.
I need to contact my husband first.
But it can take time.
What steps do I have to take afterwards?
Is it possible to get the price difference back?

Very hard to grasp.
It didn't work and hurt.
Now the child reacts hysterically when we try it.
No more chance.
Tomorrow we go to the doctor.

Because of Omikron: Johnson wants to push ahead with booster vaccination
More and more Omikron cases are bringing politics and science to the UK.
By the New Year, all qualifying adults in England will receive a vaccination offer.
LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to move ahead even faster than previously intended in the coronavirus booster vaccinations in the face of rapidly increasing Omikron numbers.
Every adult in England should be given the opportunity to get a booster dose by the end of the year, provided at least three months have passed since the second vaccination, Johnson said in a pre-recorded video message to his compatriots on Sunday evening.
So far, the target date has been at the end of January.
The UK government will provide additional support to speed up vaccination campaigns in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
“We are facing an emergency in the face of the Omikron variant, which is why vaccination protection urgently needs to be strengthened,” Johnson said.
The good news is that the level of protection can be increased again with a third vaccination dose.
"Let's boost now!" said Johnson.
On Sunday, 1239 more Omikron cases were registered in the UK, bringing the total to 3137.
Compared to the previous day, this was an increase of a whopping 65 percent. dpa

I am in favor of everyone introducing themselves with pronouns
I sent out an application.
Today the invitation came to a conversation by mail.
I want to respond to the e-mail.
But unfortunately the name is not "Peter", but a slightly more complicated name.
I googled him and depending on where he/she has a cultural background it is either a man or a woman.
**I have no idea how to write the email right now.
Can someone please help me?
** I am a foreigner and I don’t want to step over an official’s feet.
Conclusion: everyone should introduce themselves with pronouns.
I have a total of 5 books.
4 of them go.
Only the one I bought today doesn't work
Obviously, the chair had an unobservable shortcoming in sales.
How else can such a cushion damage occur after 9 months?
Only tried on the #PRS_ORG#.
This has worked since ca.
14 days no more.
So I always bought the latest books through the website and then read on the #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# but wanted to buy 8.
However, there was no more.
Now they are available again and I want you to please add 2 chairs to the order and charge me that.
[CW] The feeling when I can't help.
Content warning: I’m going to write a little bit more detail about domestic violence here.
I just need to write something about my soul.
I (21) come into contact with the victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence more often for professional reasons.
One topic that really gnaws at me and unfortunately happens far too often is that many victims do not let themselves be helped or think we could not help them.
I know we can’t do everything and it’s not perfect.
But there are fewer things in my profession that move me more than if I can do nothing in such situations.
I see the bruises, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in a face-to-face conversation, with the perpetrator far out of sight and hearing range, I can’t reach everyone.
I do not know what the reason is, maybe it is fear, fear of revenge, fear of leaving the usual social environment, fear of tearing the children out of it.
What I always want to make clear to everyone, sometimes even very close to the tears, all are worth living without violence.
I want all women to know that they don’t just have to accept violence.
I often wish I could help in any case... I know I can't.
But it never gets easier.
Please, always remember, you are worth living without violence, that is so incredibly important.
"Arcane" on Netflix: What makes the series "League of Legends"?
Lots of fantasy, lots of complicated names, a stunning make-up: "Arcane", the series from the "League of Legends" computer game universe, has recently launched on Netflix.
Why are we looking forward to the two seasons already announced?
Basketball-Bundesliga: Derby debacle of the MHP giants Ludwigsburg at the Merlins Crailsheim
Youngster Johannes Patrick, at least, was reliable.
Again nothing: For the second time in less than three months, the giants lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg's coach John Patrick had said with a look back at the cup defeat at the beginning of October at the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim: "We still have some anger in the stomach".
After the game, however, she did not lay down - but increased again in the face of the 61:72 (28:38) defeat in the Basketball-Bundesliga.
Even more than the naked result disappointed the way the performance was presented.
Let us mention a statistic that expresses the entire dilemma: The triple ratio was just 13 percent, 4 hits (all from young Johannes Patrick) in a whopping 31 attempts - still questions?
John Patrick responded, “We were just not focused enough after the win at Tenerife and we didn’t do what we did.”
Namely to move the ball.
His opponent Sebastian Gleim reacted quite differently: "To win a great game against Ludwigsburg for the second time," said the lucky coach.
"It felt like it was before 10,000 people."
On Saturday, only 750 visitors were allowed in the Hohenlohe Arena, but they got their money’s worth.
Not least because of BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who marked 22 points and steered the game of his team.
"The best playmaker I've ever trained," Gleim praised.
While in Patrick’s team even the top performers like Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed all along the line.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) did the giants prevent a total debacle and came up to eight points after already 39:59 back.
In addition to Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon scored twelve points.
Fortunately, there is not much time left to fight.
Already on Wednesday (7 pm) the giants will receive the Skyliners Frankfurt, before then also in Ludwigsburg a maximum of 750 spectators.
We used to have a different email address, but I changed it.
Yes, I contacted you a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all warranty claims were rejected.
We have legally informed ourselves again and have therefore written to you again.
We originally signed up six months ago.
Max Raabe is 59 years old
He is able to inspire his audience with new interpretations of hit songs from the 20s and 30s.
He is currently on the road with the program "Good day, dear luck" - if he is allowed to perform.
Actually Max Raabe would have wanted to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But that doesn't work.
The planned concert has been postponed to May 2022 - "on official order" to contain the coronavirus.
Also other of his performances planned in the Advent season have to be cancelled, as it is said on the website of the singer, who turns 59 today, and his musicians (www.palast-orchester.de).
From January onwards, the artists want to make up for their deadlines already in 2020 due to the pandemic.
Born on December 12, 1962 in Lünen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Max Raabe has already sung a lot as a teenager.
He studied opera singing in Berlin and founded the Palast Orchester together with fellow students in 1986.
Since then, the baritone has established itself in the style of the Comedian Harmonists with its repertoire of Schlager and Chansons.
He has often been awarded prizes.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached - just like his successful album "Für Frauen ist das kein Problem" (2013) - the second place in the charts.
He made it out of the niche into the mainstream.
Always elegantly dressed, the blonde hair strictly combed back and with etiquette in mind, Max Raabe is an indispensable part of the current German-speaking music landscape.
With the program "Good day, dear luck" he has been on tour since 2020. dpa
Hello #NAME#, is it also possible to get a small sample of the furniture wood in advance?

It still doesn't work I can only crave the cover sheet but not leaf.
Federal Minister of Construction Klara Geywitz: Expropriation does not create a new apartment
The new Federal Minister of Construction Klara Geywitz (SPD) has spoken out against the expropriation of large housing corporations, as was demanded in a referendum in Berlin.
"With an expropriation not a single new apartment is created, it only changes the ownership structure," Geywitz said in an interview with the "Tagesspiegel" (Sunday).
My goal is to give tenants security that their rent will remain affordable over the next few years.
By the way, a colorful mix of private landlords, cooperatives or housing associations, for example, is the best protection against the formation of a monopoly.
In Berlin, the coalition of the SPD, the Greens and the Left Party wants to set up an expert commission on how to deal with the result of the referendum.
However, if the situation does not relax, Geywitz did not rule out talks with the FDP in the traffic light coalition about further tightening in tenancy law.
The coalition agreement provides for a rent brake until 2029, a limitation of rent increases in tense housing markets and the extension of the rent level.
I will speak with the Minister of Justice to implement this as soon as possible.
If the rental market still does not relax, "we will talk to the coalition partners about further steps," stressed the SPD politician.

At Least 100 Killed by Tornadoes in Kentucky
In a devastating storm system, numerous tornadoes have passed through the United States.
In Kentucky alone, there could be more than 100 deaths.
The pictures from there are reminiscent of a war zone.
In the night of Saturday, several tornadoes have caused severe devastation in the United States and possibly claimed up to a hundred lives.
The storms leave an approximately 320-kilometer-long swathe of devastation, especially in the state of Kentucky.
Its governor, Andy Beshear, said after a visit to the disaster area, everywhere where the tornado was raging, everything was gone.
Houses, shops, government buildings - just go away.
Parts of industrial plants, roofs are in the trees.
It is hard to imagine that this is even possible.
He estimates up to a hundred dead in Kentucky alone, with official figures rising every hour.
Hello, I just saw that she is sold out showcase #NAME#.
That's too bad.
Is it still being produced?
Or is it completely out of stock?
Is it possible to order this showcase in another country?
until when do you contact us?
If the delivery cannot be made to my apartment, I have to cancel the order !
I understand that, only can I order the blanket now and have it delivered to Germany, which is in the shopping cart?
I had returned an Artike via the contact form or given a return and wanted to ask if this arrived or is being processed, because I have not yet received confirmation.
Companies pay vaccination premiums and change advertising slogans
While the Federal Government continues to reject the proposals for a vaccination premium, companies in Austria have taken the initiative themselves and offer their employees money premiums for the vaccination.
This puts them in line with the social partners <0xC3><0x96>GB and Wirtschaftskammer, which today demanded financial incentives for vaccination.
The transformation of advertising slogans into vaccination appeals - following the German model - should also increase the willingness to receive corona vaccinations.
He's moved to a company he's been gossiping about.
That doesn't make his situation any better than yours.
Wait and drink tea.
It's been a year.
He obviously did not sew himself to his old place and was looking for something else.
You can do that too.
And that he didn’t like you back then: well, it didn’t matter.
He didn’t like his job either.
There are too many variables.
Please accept the cancellation.
That will be legally relevant.
I'm making a screen shot.

Help with your first campaign
Boron to the rescue!
I’m currently leading the Over the Grasp Pass adventure for a group of 4 friends and want to seamlessly guide my heroes into a campaign written especially for the players.
We're playing DSA 5.
The big bow is made, the bad guys and their motivations written, the individual files made up and now I am about to write the entry-level adventure and trip over my own feet at the first encounter.
The premise is that the heroes should bring a carriage with grain from Gratenfels to a small village near Lake Thuran.
This is where the further action should develop.
A few miles from the village, the heroes are supposed to ambush a group of goblins and lure them into an ambush.
I want to give the player characters the opportunity to solve the confrontation in different ways: Convince, act, threaten, recognize the danger at an early stage, whatever comes to the players.
Group strength: 8 ordinary goblins, 2 armed with spears, 6 armed with bows and sabers
If not noticed, the goblins lurk in a hollow path and flank the carriage armed with three bows on each left and right, while two stop the carriage with spears.
If it comes to the fight and the heroes are lost, I have two solutions.
The heroes are all found unconscious and then healed by the son of the village schulzen, a half-elf.
The cart is, of course, gone.
If a defeat is inevitable, this same half-elf intervenes with two of his servants and comes to the hero's aid in the fight.
The cart is still there, everything great.
How appropriate do you consider Deus ex Machina from Solution 2?
Is the encounter too much as an introduction to adventure?
The group Goblins will play a decisive role later, so is not just cannon fodder.
EDIT: wow, I didn’t expect so many answers, especially not so many great suggestions and tips.
I am guaranteed to heed many of your ideas and now have more confidence in my narratives.
I disassembled the lamp again.
And stuck together again.
Unfortunately, it still does not work.
That's why I'd like to send them back anyway
If you can send me the returns, I can pack the lamp and bring it to the #PRS_ORG#.

Is everything then picked up again or only the storage part?
I'm annoyed by Sky Sport F1
Hello dear F1 fans, over the course of the season the quality on the German Sky has decreased more and more, so I want to take a breather with this post.
First of all, today in the middle of the F2 race, the transmission was canceled in order to have the F1 pre-reporting started on time.
Although due to the delayed start and the starting accident, the schedule was far behind schedule, but you could still have shown the last (planned) ten minutes as well as the championship decision (!)
However, it seems that for legal reasons the F1 has priority and therefore everything else has to be limited, so Sky DE probably had no choice here.
Still stupid, especially since Sky UK has transferred the race to the end.
Nevertheless, a small compliment: the commentator Olivier Zwartyes has accompanied the difficult situation around the serious accident well.
Then there was again a lack of regularity in F1 with the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, so both did not know that you can change the tires under a red flag.
Although this situation already existed in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both decided that Verstappen would be allowed to change the tyres only when there were corresponding radio announcements on this topic to Hamilton.
At Sky UK and RTL, both commentators knew immediately that there was this possibility for Verstappen.
I think you should know such elementary rules when commenting on F1 on a pay-TV station.
It is also not the first guess as to what is now possible or prescribed according to the rules, both simply have constant uncertainties in the subject of rules.
In general, Roos does not like the artificial comment style, but admits that it is a matter of taste.
But I really like even Heiko Wasser from RTL better.
In addition, there are constant absurdities, both of which simply seem unprofessional, such as ordering coffee from (also unsuspecting) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuHD" by Ralf Schumacher.
The latter in particular causes a great deal of anxiety in the comment, which he apparently does not take seriously.
Last but not least, the advertising simply takes over at Sky, in the run-out round Sky is the only station that goes into the advertising, as you can listen to at F1TV since only the German sound track without comment has to do right after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do that.
Also, these two stations do in the training less advertising than Sky, and that as a free TV station.
Although Glock and Baumgartner must be praised for their work, that alone does not let me overlook the disadvantages.
The rest of Sky Sport F1 is also very meagre and full of repetitions.
Overall, Sky is really the worst German-language broadcaster to broadcast F1.
With the exception of advertising, RTL is doing a better job in the four races they are still allowed to transfer.
In any case, the grandiose F1 season is much less fun than it would be possible with a reasonable transmitter.
I would be interested in your opinion.
On the here: #PRS_ORG# pendant lamp, brass and multicolored glass x 1
Hello, I have an item that should be delivered last week and that is still not being delivered.
I have contacted the chat twice and so far nothing.
The first lady told me that it will be sent on Monday, the second lady told me yesterday that she will check and send an email and she never responded.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12.12.19.
One of them showed a defect after a relatively short time (the fabric has a hole in the front part of the chair).
I'm asking for your support.
Fan pumps are ideal for supplying an aquarium with additional oxygen.
It is also possible to operate a filter system via air lifters.
This series is offered in 3 variants by us.
Look at the end of the offer in the table.
There you can see the benefits in comparison.
If the pumps are strong enough, you can operate entire systems with them.
If you have a large aquarium, pumps with 2 or more outlets are suitable, so that you can connect more outlets.
The MK series has one, two or four outputs, but depending on the model fan pump are also suitable to set an accent in the aquarium, e.g. with an air curtain (you can find in our shop) or with a decor, which convert the air bubbles into a function.
Here would be a treasure chest, shell or something like that.
The MK series has a special, sound-insulated construction, which ensures low operating noise.
Installation is very simple.
The fan pump is connected by means of an air hose 4/6 mm to an outlet or similar... and you can start.
The fan pump should be the same or higher than the water level and should be mounted on the outside.
If the fan pump is lower than the water level, a non-return valve should be placed in between.
Simply cut through the air hose and put the valve in between.
This would prevent water from running backwards once the water from the pool runs through the pump...
Should the fan pump be installed outdoors, it should be covered and protected from moisture like other air pumps
The MK series pumps are pure powerhouses that consume little energy
Even if we indicate the processing time with 3 days here in ebay, so is packed daily and the packages are also picked up here daily.
If everything goes well on the way, it goes very quickly.
We just want to prevent a little bit so that no one is upset, just because it once took a little longer.
It would be so, not everyone has understanding for all the employees who also work in the freight forwarding... of course here does not stop Corona.
Please do not rate too badly, just because the delivery is delayed, this is solely due to the parcel services.
Of course, people like to scold about these services, even if we say at the moment...they have it damn hard
This is also very different regionally.
Do not be angry with anyone, stay healthy and we all hope that there will be better times again.
How long does it take to order the yellow with and without armrest?
Is it possible to order your legs in light?
Amazon founder Bezo sends astronaut daughter and host into space
The daughter of the first American in space, a TV host and four other passengers have made a short trip into space.
They were transported on Saturday by the New Shepard missile system of the company Blue Origin by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
The take-off and landing of the approximately ten-minute flight took place in the west of the US state of Texas.
Under a bright blue sky, Bezos personally welcomed the newly crowned astronauts upon their return.
"Welcome back," Bezos said, dressed in a blue space suit as he opened the hatch to the capsule.
To the applause of friends, family, and Blue Origin employees, the six passengers gradually climbed out and embraced the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they were on the road for ten minutes and 13 seconds, reaching an altitude of 107 kilometers.
74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of NASA astronaut Alan Shepard (1923-1998), after whom Blue Origin's rocket system is named, and 50-year-old TV host Michael Strahan were guests of honor at the company, the other four passengers had paid for their tickets: space engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess and his son Cameron.
How much they each paid for their ticket, Blue Origin did not share.
Laura Shepard Churchley recalled her father's mission after the short flight.
He had to work hard and do everything himself.
She just flew along, the 74-year-old said with a laugh.
Michael Strahan was also impressed.
He would like to go back to space again, the moderator said.
"New Shepard" flies to 100 kilometers altitude
The New Shepard missile system is largely automated.
The capsule, which was separated from the rocket during the flight, reached a height of about 100 kilometers above the Earth, at times with zero gravity, before the reusable object landed again, slowed down by large parachutes.
The International Aviation Association and many other experts see 100 kilometers above the Earth as a border to space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was Blue Origin’s third manned all-around excursion: the first of July, Amazon founder Bezos himself was on board, along with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former U.S. pilot and an 18-year-old Dutchman.
The second in October featured 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner, who became world-famous for his role as Captain Kirk in Star Trek, as well as former Nasa engineer Chris Boshuizen, entrepreneur Glen de Vries and Blue Origin deputy chief Audrey Powers.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of driving the space tourism business largely without scientific research interests for the benefit of humanity and without regard to climate.

Someone who works in biochemistry or has studied biochemistry
I am currently studying biochemistry in my first semester and find the subject quite exciting in itself and I do not mind being in the laboratory (I already have the inorganic chemistry internship behind me).
Of course, I was already informed about career prospects before my studies, but I also thought at the time that I would definitely want to study until my doctorate.
At the moment, however, I have doubts, especially depressing me the career prospects.
On the one hand (Studycheck etc) you always hear great job opportunities and the profession is totally wanted, on the other hand you always hear from unemployed biologists and incredibly low-paid jobs.
So I would really be interested:
1) What are you currently working on?
2) Are you satisfied with your work/salary?
3) What did you study/ What did you study?
4) Would you do this all over again?
Thank you very much for your reply!
I’m really unsure at the moment and may consider dropping out of university in 2022 and training to become a specialist computer scientist.
If you have any experience, I’d love to read it too :)
Extra stress before holidays & holiday weekends
This topic came up with me last week.
But I had to use my long weekend to relax.
That's why only now a post on it.
Not only before big holidays, such as the Christmas holidays, there is great stress in our company.
As it seems, there are also before holidays plus bridge days.
It was like this: Last week was the Assumption of the Virgin Mary, which in Switzerland is called the “Ascent”.
On Friday, the vast majority of people and businesses make a bridge day, which is therefore semi-official.
So last week there was a long 4-day weekend in the house.
So what happened last week?
Stress everywhere.
All the e-mails, which absolutely had to leave before the driveway, order here order there, all *unconditionally* before the long weekend.
Because... because?
Because "next week then" sounds like so much time and that's not allowed?
Or because people seriously want to do as much in a shortened week as in a normal one?
Not only was I then stressed on Wednesday, but also powerfully annoyed.
What is this self-flagellation for holidays?
Why do we have holidays when we can’t treat ourselves properly?!
The stress did not come from above, the colleagues were all quite independent.
The question is, are we the Swiss?
Is this our Reformed evangelical way?
Do you know that in the north?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her native Thuringia - but has no gifts yet.
"The beautiful thing, even if there is no snow in Erfurt, then you just drive to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest," said the actress and singer Hit Radio FFH.
She will tune in to the party by baking and crafting cookies with her son.
“I love that,” Catterfeld said.
Until the contemplative days, however, she still has a lot to do: "For the first time, I don't have any gifts, I have to start now".
NEKTON-Bio supports a smooth process of moulting and plumage formation.
NEKTON-Bio contains all essential vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 <0xCE><0xBC>g biotin/kg.
NEKTON-Bio gives the bird a smooth and shiny plumage.
The majority of plumage damage in bird husbandry is exclusively due to nutritional errors.
Since the plumage consists of protein-containing substance, a particularly rich and balanced protein nutrition of the bird is a prerequisite for the formation of a flawless plumage.
For a functioning metabolism, the daily diet must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
Much of the animal losses that occur during moulting are due to a lack of or unbalanced protein intake and/or insufficient supply of vitamins and minerals.
In the composition of NEKTON-Bio, the unfavorable ratio of amino acids in most plant-based feed is explicitly taken into account and balanced.
No further vitamin supplement should be administered during the administration of NEKTON-Bio.
NEKTON-Bio is cold water soluble and can easily be administered through drinking water or soft food.
Thank you, I found it
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work
DDR-Handwerksmodell Altbau E-Lok E 95 03 DRG/ DR, the locomotive was in use in Silesia and Central Germany, the very rare locomotive probably comes from the conversion proposal of the model railway ME Heft 11/1968, used with traces of play and missing parts see photos, function well, the series E 95 is a heavy goods train electric locomotive of the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (German Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft), is the heavy locomotive of the Deutsche Reichsbahn-G.
A locomotive is located in the DB Museum Halle (Saale) and we are operationally reconditioned
In 1924, the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft commissioned the AEG to submit proposals for an electric locomotive that could carry 2,200-ton coal trains and 530-ton passenger trains with a cruising speed of 45 km/h on this route.
The maximum speed was 65 km/h.
Thus, in March 1926, the DRG decided on the delivery as a 1'Co+Co1' locomotive with paw bearing drive AEG with the delivery of the mechanical part, the Siemens-Schuckertwerke with the electrical part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, six locomotives were delivered, which were given the operating numbers E 95 01–06.
All survived the Second World War and then found themselves on the territory of the later GDR.
In 1946, the locomotives arrived in the Soviet Union as reparations goods.
They returned to Germany until November 1952.
The refurbishment of all six locomotives was determined at the Dessau repair plant.
[4] As the re-electrification of the Central German network increased the demand for locomotives for heavy freight train service, the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were reconditioned in 1959, with the remaining machines serving as spare parts dispensers.
In this case, the E 04, E 44 and E 94 which are present in relatively large quantities were first preferably constructed.
It was only when the E 94 saw that the reprocessing number could not be increased further that the E 95 became the focus of the reprocessing.
[4] First, the locomotives were stationed at the Leipzig-Wahren railway plant.
They came to the Halle P railway plant in 1960.
They were used in their own circulation plan mostly before coal trains from the Geiseltal in the direction of Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
The complicated control of the locomotives proved problematic with increasing age.
So it often happened that shooters remained stuck in switching actions.
Then the passenger with a hammer and wooden wedge on this locomotive had to release the shooter again during the journey.
Damage to the traction motors occurred more often and led to months of failures in the locomotive.
[5] Since there were enough new locomotives available at the end of the 1960s and a significant expansion of electric operation was not planned at that time, the Reichsbahn was able to dispense with old locomotives and most of the splinter classes, so that the E 95 were decommissioned.
In addition, the Deutsche Reichsbahn only wanted to occupy electric locomotives with one man, which would have caused a problem in train operation due to the above-mentioned difficulties with the machines and the visibility conditions of the driver's cab.
[5] After the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were discontinued in mid-1969, they were the last to be followed by the E 95 01, which left service on 5 October 1970.
The proposed new designation 255 001 was thus never used.
Except for the E 95 02, all locomotives were dismantled.
The E 95 02 was set up as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10 as a turnout heating system at the Halle main station.
It took some time before those responsible at the Reichsbahn could be convinced that the E 95 was worth preserving as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the first external refurbishment of the locomotive began with the aim of being able to present it at a vehicle show in RAW Dessau.
[5] Since then, it has belonged to the Dresden Transport Museum as a non-operational museum locomotive.
In 1986, the interior of the locomotive was completed.
In the DB Museum Halle (Saale) the locomotive is supervised by a museum.
Since 1995, employees of the traditional community Bw Halle P have been working on the operational refurbishment of the locomotive.
In April 2015, the locomotive was presented for the first time at an exhibition in the Museums-Bw Arnstadt with new interior and exterior paintwork, whereby the transformers were checked and five traction motors are operational.
-The locomotives were in service on the Silesian Mountain Railway and branching branch lines until 1945, where they proved themselves due to their reliable drive and low maintenance.
In February 1945, the machines were relocated to Leipzig for the Central German network.
The main area of application was initially Silesia
Handwork model H0 in OVP, function good, there are optical rework on the locomotive in own work necessary, dusted, with game tracks, cellar smell !!!, very rare handwork model, very small edition - possibly the kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN
The packaging can have labels and storage traces.
Yes, the F-parts are
I got a bed from you.
However, there were problems with one part.
The middle beam is held by two feet..unfortunately these are too narrow and the beam can not be mounted on the feet.
What do we do now?
I can't make the bed.
The middle beam is held by two feet, these are unfortunately incorrectly produced.
The center bar does not fit into the intended holder.
So I get new ones sent to me.
When will they be sent out?
No, not flats.
These are, according to the assembly instructions, the correct ones of the shape, they were just too narrow
But it doesn't matter.
The main thing is that they fulfill their purpose
With me they are not flat
Could I get these?
Hello #NAME#, should I explain the problem to you again?
Home fire with two lightly injured and high damage
Two people were slightly injured in a fire in a residential building in Upper Bavaria.
In addition, an estimated damage in the six-digit euro area has arisen, as the police announced on Sunday.
The fire had probably spread from a carport to the adjacent house in Kinsau (Landsberg am Lech district).
Two residents were taken to the hospital on Sunday with mild smoke poisoning.
The exact cause of the fire was initially unknown, but the police did not assume an intentional incendiary.
Kripo Fürstenfeldbruck has taken over the further investigation.
It will arrive much later
And I have to pay shipping costs again
To defuse fake news - Biontech CEO publishes vaccination photo
U<0xC4><0x9F>ur <0xC5><0x9E>ahin published a photo of his first vaccination in early 2021 on the social network "LinkedIn"
Biontech CEO U<0xC4><0x9F>ur <0xC5><0x9E>ahin has not publicly commented on his vaccination status.
Now the entrepreneur published a photo showing his corona vaccination.
The illness of a friend had moved him to it, <0xC5><0x9E>ahin informed.
The CEO and co-founder of the Mainz-based company Biontech, U<0xC4><0x9F>ur <0xC5><0x9E>ahin, has published a photo showing him getting a vaccine against the coronavirus.
On social media, there was misinformation that I was allegedly not vaccinated.
In fact, my wife and I have received 3 doses of the Biontech Pfizer vaccine,” <0xC5><0x9E>ahin wrote in a post on the “LinkedIn” network on Friday.
"For several months now, friends have been urging me to post a photo of me being vaccinated to counter these false rumors."
So far, he has refused, because the communication should not revolve around him.
But a phone call last week changed his mind: “I was deeply saddened to learn that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life.
He is fighting a serious Covid-19 disease and has been hanging on a ventilator for three weeks.
The school friend and his family were not vaccinated, <0xC5><0x9E>ahin continued.
He did not ask for the reasons.
"However, the most common cause seems to be anxiety, which is often fueled by misinformation and mistrust."
Fear is hard to fight with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences.
An interview with Deutsche Welle in which U<0xC4><0x9F>ur <0xC5><0x9E>ahin says he was not vaccinated circulates on the Internet.
However, the video was created in December 2020, as Deutsche Welle itself clarified.
"I'm not legally allowed to get the vaccine myself at the moment," <0xC5><0x9E>ahin said at the time.
There is a prioritization in Germany in the vaccination of the vaccine.
In the meantime, the prioritization has been lifted for a long time - and the Biontech boss has been vaccinated according to his own information three times.
Fire in substation: tens of thousands of people without electricity
In several municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia, the light went out on Friday evening: no more electricity and in many cases probably no heating.
A fire had crippled a substation.
After a fire with serious damage in a substation, tens of thousands of people in the Rhein-Sieg district in North Rhine-Westphalia have had to do without electricity for about 24 hours.
As a result of the fire, 41,000 affected residents in several municipalities ran out of lights on Friday evening.
The utility Westnetz reported that numerous emergency power generators had been in operation on Saturday until the large-scale fault could finally be completely rectified in the late evening.
Firefighters and helpers of the THW provided support in the municipalities.
The authorities offered childcare places in schools and called for neighborhood help.
He thanked them for their patience and the helpers for their efforts.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant limitations.
We would also like to thank the municipalities concerned, the district, the fire brigades and the THW for their tireless efforts," said Florian Witt, head of primary technology, in a statement on Saturday evening.
The repair of the damage will take a few more days, as the Westnetz assemblers could initially only temporarily restart some lines, he explained.
According to the company, a technical defect led to the fire.
Electricity flows again
The fire, which broke out at around 7:15 p.m. on Friday, severely damaged parts of the 10,000-volt switchgear in the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid substation, according to Westnetz.
This requires extensive cleaning and repair work.
At the same time, a connection to a 30,000-volt voltage level was created.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply will be restored.
Since Saturday 6 p.m., more than 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth have had electricity again.
A further 20,000 residents of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were gradually added as of 9.30 p.m.
Since 11:15 p.m., the last affected by the failure also had electricity.
More than 80 fitters from Westnetz and partner companies were in use.
The authorities had also called for neighbourhood assistance after the establishment of an emergency power supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon.
"What is important now is that the citizens take care of elderly or single people in their neighbourhood and inform the local fire brigade when help is needed," said district administrator Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
When setting up and operating emergency power generators, the focus was primarily on the residents of retirement homes.
In addition, according to the authorities, temporary care places were set up in schools for those people who could not take care of themselves or who need electricity-dependent medical equipment or are dependent on medical care.
Good day. Good day.
Unfortunately, the blanket is sold out in Germany.
Can I buy it from you and pay in Euros?
It is the bedspread #PRS_ORG# in blue-green.
I hope you have a nice day too and please stay healthy <0xE2><0x99><0xA1>
But I can not mount the base on the table top.
It's custom #NAME#.
There are 3 versions of this.
We wanted those with table tops diameter of #NUMBER#
we got 155cm diameter.
Today my #PRS_ORG# arrived, but I can't put it together and thus shorten it.
Can you help me with that?
Otherwise I would have to send it back, otherwise it is not suitable for the purpose.
I would be happy to receive feedback
yes this is really easier!
Then let's do it like this!
will you send me the return slip by e-mail?
The repair is now complete.
I tried this before the chat.
Before the purchase, however, I had not restarted the E-#PRS_ORG#.
Do you want me to do this now?
I find such a low credit almost outrageous.
We do not agree with this

I have to work in between too!
To make the paint even and clean, clean the parts with some soapy water from dust, grease and fingerprints, rinse with clear water and dry.
Before you bring the brush to the model for the first time with a new color, it is recommended to practice 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do this on the inside of the components, which will no longer be visible, or on a yoghurt cup.
The first line on the component
Drag the brush evenly to stroke next to stroke.
Slight overlap of the paint layers later ensures a uniform surface.
Avoid sweeping quickly back and forth with the brush.
This creates areas that appear unrealistic.
A model is not a garden fence.
Start with the bright colors.
The dark ones might shine through later.
Metal tones and metallic colors come at the very end with a separate brush.
Otherwise, it can lead to unsightly metal streaks when they mix with normal colors.
Allow the painted parts to dry for a day before disassembling.
The models achieve true-to-original appearance through the decals or decals.
From emblems on airplanes to ship names to trims and license plates on car models: the decals give the model the finishing touch.
Place the decals in the correct order as long as the parts are still within easy reach.
An aircraft cockpit can be or easier to stick before it is installed in the fuselage.
Even more important than the right tool such as scissors, tweezers and toothpicks are time, patience and a steady hand.
Cut out each decal you need and set it up.
Decals are also called waterslide images because you briefly moisten their back with water until the backing paper becomes dark due to the wetness.
Then you slide the picture only a small piece of paper and put the piece on the appropriate place on the model (which you have previously moistened).
While holding the decal on the model with a tool, pull the backing paper away from the side.
Attention: Always check whether the image fits correctly before you push it completely off the paper, so that it does not stick to the finger, crease or even tear.
Drain excess water with a household towel.
Attention not suitable for children under 3 years
I can only open a book briefly, as soon as I look for something else then I no longer read the book and have to log out and log in and reload the book and look for the place where I have read.
I have already communicated with you on Saturday.
Will I get it by email?
Also for all 3 packages?
Because the lamp arrived in 3 individual packages with me
Thank you very much!
I’ll buy it somewhere else as soon as the money is back.
Can I get it back without any problems?
Fertility treatment at PKV / What is an "insurance case"?
Hello everyone,
we were in fertility treatment for some time, now when it comes to the settlement with the PKV, this suddenly turns transverse.
In turn:
We had applied for the Kinderwunschbahndlung in advance at the PKV and were given the promise of 3 attempts.
The experiments were not restricted in any way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to successful pregnancy and birth and was settled with PKV.
Some time later we tried to have a second child, and carried out 2 (unsuccessful) attempts, but did not yet calculate these with the PKV.
We again applied for the cost assumption at the PKV and were again granted 3 more attempts.
After a few more tests (we have carried out more tests than promised, logically the most expensive with the PKV) we submitted the invoices to the PKV and got the nasty surprise: instead of 5 tests (2+3), the PKV wants to refund only 3 tests.
The reason: With the pregnancy / birth, the remaining 2 attempts of the first promise expire.
The second desire to have children is a new insurance case.
According to the terms and conditions, however, "The insurance case begins with the medical treatment, it ends when the need for treatment no longer exists."
The questions to the experts in the round here:
* Who is right here, the PKV (only 3 attempts will be refunded) or we (there are 5 attempts to refund)?
* Would the PKV have had to point out in the promises that with a birth the further attempts expire?
* Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance claim?
The infertility (due to closed fallopian tubes) is not cured by the first child.
It would be great if the experts here would give their opinion.
Thank you very much for your help!
Can you please send me the three variants by email and tell me how I can best reach them again
All right. All right.
We will no longer order anything from them.
If they add up the sales of me and my friend #NAME# (same address), they obviously lost good customers.
You are welcome to forward this to your manager.
This is not competitive.
Yesterday the colleague told me that the repayment was arranged and now you tell me that I first have to send the thing back.
I guess I can't help the fact that the dresser arrives at me completely disturbed
Take a look at the screenshot of what he wrote.
It says clearly that the repayment was initiated and I still have not received a refund via #PRS_ORG#
You can tell your manager that you have now lost two regular customers.
My friend has also ordered various furniture for our apartment via his account.
We won't do that anymore.
No, the defect occurred only after a few months.
An office chair must endure normal use.
Otherwise, they may not sell it as an office chair.
Irrespective of this, the warranty of 24 months applies.
No, it is not possible for me to procure another type of packaging.
I will be able to dismantle the cabinet and make it available to the transport company.
Hello, I have a question about your series of #PRS_ORG#
These products are advertised with additional stools, but unfortunately we can not find them with you.
Can they help?
Theme of the Week: The Best Low Budget Films
What a low-budget movie is exactly, there is no general definition for it with exact budget limits.
Wikipedia has this to say:
A low-budget movie is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
On the net you can find plenty of lists of low-budget movies, such as on Letterboxd.com.
Do you know any interesting people in this category?
What excites you about it?
And what may not please you at all?
I am a very good customer of you, have already furnished 2 apartments complete with your furniture.
Wanted to get the best price for the gray leather sofa Odelle.
The delivery time has now been extended again, is this now also reliable?
Thank you!
Sincerely,
There is no phone number, a chat where you have to wait 30min is no chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes in the waiting position... I will give up again soon, because it just does not work here.
Hello.
"Half victory" against Belarus linked to high costs for the EU
According to policy expert Raphael Bossong, the EU can declare a "half-victory" in the conflict with the Belarusian regime.
The costs, however, are very high and meant massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees on Belarus' border with Poland and Lithuania, Bossong told the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
Sustainably, the EU has not solved the confrontation, said the researcher of the Berlin Foundation for Science and Politics (SWP).
This state of limbo – Belarus doesn’t give very little but the EU feels like a winner – is likely to go on for a while.
Dealing with the people at the border is not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights, Bossong said.
Apparently, there is an "increasing normalization of pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole does not resolutely oppose it, this comes at the expense of fundamental rights.
At the same time, this development weakens cohesion in the Union.
“It obviously cannot prevail if a Member State goes into its head to do its thing,” as is the case with Poland, which does not even allow the EU border agency Frontex to access the border.
In addition, the EU is paying another price for its policy on the border with Belarus, according to Bossong: A principle agreement on asylum policy will be made more difficult, as the line "border protection, border protection, border protection" has been strengthened.
Another attempt at crossing the border
According to Poland’s border guards, migrants have again tried to reach Polish territory via Belarus.
55 migrants were arrested on Sunday night and returned to the border, a spokeswoman for the authority said on Sunday.
The Polish officials were pelted with stones by the migrants in the incident near the village of Czeremsza.
According to the information, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be medically cared for by a military doctor.
In total, the border guards recorded 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
Already on Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had overcome the border barriers.
Thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan had crossed or attempted to cross the border between Belarus and the EU in recent months.
The EU accuses Alexander Lukashenko as a leader in Minsk of having attracted them with the prospect of entering the EU.
Poland and Lithuania sealed off border sections, according to press reports.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines that bring migrants and refugees into the country.
In addition, EU Commissioners travelled to people’s countries of origin in order to prevent departures there.
The most effective element of the EU response is pressure on airlines, Bossong said.
"The EU has put its market power in the balance and demonstrated its determination to operate with tough bandages and extraterritorial sanctions".
Minsk must also take into account domestic political costs.
Belarusian society is probably not prepared for the fact that the security apparatus regularly smuggles thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes protests after controversial Formula 1 final
According to Mercedes, Max Verstappen is said to have broken two rules during the race.
Abu Dhabi - After the controversial Formula 1 final of Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has objected.
The Silver Arrows suspect two rule breaks in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest refers to a supposed violation of Max Verstappen at the Red Bull in the last safety car phase, when he is said to have passed irregularly.
A second objection was filed against the rating at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes, the protocol was not followed in accordance with the rules.
Verstappen had overtaken Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes on the last lap and had raced to his first Formula 1 title.
The manoeuvre took place shortly after the end of a safety car phase, in which the Dutchman had overtaken cars in front of him.
I'll check it out.
I'll talk to the bank and report back to you.

Free admission for members: Europa-Park organizes SC-Freiburg-Fantag
Europa-Park, the namesake of the Europa-Park stadium of the Sport-Club Freiburg, has invited to the SC Freiburg Fantag.
As the park informs, members and season ticket holders of the Sport-Club from the Breisgau as well as members of the fan community were allowed to visit the Europa-Park for free on this day.
In addition, there were vouchers for drinks and sausages.
The roller coaster trains lit up red and white through the jerseys that day.
Füchsle, Ed Euromaus and many red-and-white balloons provided the perfect backdrop," says the park.
Since the beginning of the 1990s, the cooperation between the Bundesliga and the leisure park in Rust, 40 kilometers north of Freiburg, has existed.
The first SC Freiburg Fantag in Europa-Park once again showed how well the partnership fits.
Seeing radiant fans having fun together in the roller coaster confirms that," says Europa-Park owner Jürgen Mack.

Judith Hermann read from her novel "Home"
As part of the reading series "LiteraTour Nord", author Judith Hermann read on Friday in the sold-out Blue Note from her current novel "Daheim" and also acted as a presenter.
She is divorced, lives in a house on the coast and listens sensitively to the night sounds at her front door.
yesterday I gave up the contact form to return an item, but did not receive an email confirmation or similar.
I wonder if my question has been answered.
Not everyone has the time for your crazy chat and misdelivered cheap goods from China.
Your mistake that you fix and not all from our household.
Please contact #NAME#.
I can't chat with them every day
We had chatted yesterday and agreed that I or my wife #NAME# will get an email with a 60 Euro voucher, a new order of the #PRS_ORG# bedside table and a return label.
This email hasn't arrived yet.
The package would like to bring to #PRS_ORG# today.
Please contact me

Sorry but just because he says he's not an anti-Semite doesn't mean anything.
This is like when an afdler says he has nothing against foreigners.
Neither of them will admit it.
But Kollegah constantly reproduces any anti-Semitic messages.
If you want to distance yourself then you should just leave it completely.
You’re not as serious as Kollegah.
Anyone who seriously questions evolution is simply completely lost.
Because of me, one God set the whole thing in motion.
But once you’re a creationist, you have to believe that the Earth is 10,000 years old and science is just fooling around.
And with that you are an enemy of science and no longer take it seriously like Kollegah
In order to obtain an optimal field of view, the magnifying glass should be drawn as close as possible to the eye.
The specially designed aplanatic-achromatic lens system allows you to use the magnifier practically free of distortion and color defects up to the edge zone.
Magnifiers are often marked with magnification information.
However, this information only applies to precisely defined conditions, which rarely correspond to the conditions of use.
In order to make the best use of your magnifying glass, we ask you to observe the instructions in the table "Technical data" (see instructions for use in the packaging).
Light reflections are created on the lens surfaces of all optical devices – also in the case of impact magnifiers.
These reflections are significantly reduced by an anti-reflective coating.
If the optimum conditions of use are maintained - a magnifying glass close to the eye - reflections on the lens surfaces are less perceptible.
Further information can be found in the enclosed instructions for use (available in German and English).

Tannenverkauf in Schönwolde: In the municipality of Krembz, women choose the Christmas trees
Farmer Frank Diers has already experienced so many strange situations when selling fir trees.
Once a man is said to have gone home without his partner, because both could not agree.
Every year he plants a good 2,000 pieces for it.
The 56-year-old has already experienced so many strange situations.
That always makes the pre-Christmas season a little fun, he says.
What about the voucher?
Am I going away as a customer?
After all, I received a defective delivery and now paid the full price for it.
Then I will evaluate it accordingly!
We do not need to have discussions here about the better court, but there is some similarity between the two.
Both consist of meat that is grilled on a rotating skewer.
Both have their names.
In German, an equivalent would perhaps be something like the "Dreher", which by far does not sound so tasty.
Problems with fiber + Devolo DLan/Magic
We have a new fiber optic connection in the house for a few weeks now.
Unfortunately, I now have problems to build a stable Wifi network.
Before I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and I used Devolo DLan, which received and sent out 50 Mbit except for a few failures.
The new fiber optic connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and they also arrive at the DLan module, which is connected to the FritzBox.
However, at the other DLan module, which sends out the Wifi, no longer the full 500 arrive, but the further away I am in the house with the module, the less arrives (so use a socket that is 1, 2, 3, etc. Rooms away from the other module).
As a result, the internet with the new fiber optic connection is now even slower on the first floor than before (<0x5C><0x7E>45 Mbit).
I also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which apparently uses a new technology.
This was slightly better than the DLan, but there were similarly large losses here as well.
Could someone explain to me why so much internet speed is "lost" via the power line with fiber optics?
And is LAN really the only solution?
It would be extremely expensive to install LAN cables in the house.
I am really desperate, which is why I have created an account here.
That is why I would be all the more pleased to receive an answer.
When it is time to change the current account
Who would have thought, now would be first calm at the checking accounts, is mistaken.
While many banks have used the autumn to let their customers confirm the fee increases of the past with all sorts of tricks, the allowances for negative interest rates continue to fall.
Deutsche Bank, for example, was long considered relatively generous with a limit of 100,000 euros.
Now she has just halved the allowance and even quartered it for the daily allowance.
In a first step, the limit was lowered only for customers of the Group’s Postbank division – to 50,000 euros for current and investment accounts and 25,000 euros for overnight money accounts.
Meanwhile, however, these lower allowances apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as a spokesman confirmed on request.
And not only for new contracts, but also for "newly concluded individual agreements with existing customers".
Commerzbank had already gone down to a limit of 50,000 euros, which still applies, as well as at ING Deutschland.
The direct bank DKB, which is particularly popular with cost-conscious customers, has reduced the allowances in two stages, initially to 50,000 euros, and now to 25,000 euros.
After all, according to figures from the Internet portal Verivox, more than 100 banks now have an allowance of 25,000 euros or less.
Sparda-Bank Berlin has also arrived at 25,000 euros: However, there is still a legal dispute with the consumer centers, which in the first instance before the district court of Berlin have even been given a right against this regulation.
The banks are already discussing whether institutions should possibly make provisions - in the event that the upper courts also declare the negative interest rates to be inadmissible in principle and many millions have to be repaid to bank customers.

Jennifer Aniston has an entire beauty army.
She is now officially at the top of Hollywood.
But their life is like a mountain and a valley.
Jennifer Aniston, 52, was named the most influential woman of the year by The Hollywood Reporter.
For her, who made a splash in 2021 with the “Friends” reunion and the continuation of her series “The Morning Show”, this success is primarily the result of a lot of discipline and work.
A whole army of assistants, stylists and trainers takes care of her appearance.
After all, according to Aniston, she treats herself to a chip a day (yes, correctly read: a SINGLE chip from the bag).
The fact that the hearts of female and male fans still fly to her is actually a miracle.
Maybe because she's just unlucky with luck - and still looking for great love.
And removed the baby's wish from the list.
She was constantly asked when she would become a mother.
That hurt her.
The people who asked this have no idea what's going on with me personally, medically, why I can't.
It was really hurtful.
Let’s hope that success and fame will also make you happy.
Unworthy end of a career: Raikkonen must give up
Kimi R<0xC3><0xA4>ikkönen’s departure from Formula 1 was even quieter than expected.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn took off his gloves and wiped sweat off his forehead.
That's it.
After a driving error and a slight contact with the tyres, R<0xC3><0xA4>ikkönen had to park his Alfa Romeo at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix after less than half the race distance.
It was his 349th and last Grand Prix, the "Iceman" ending his career in the motorsport premier class.
His wife Minttu and the two children had also travelled to the United Arab Emirates to say goodbye.
R<0xC3><0xA4>ikkönen's biggest success was winning the 2007 World Championship in Ferrari.
He achieved 21 Grand Prix victories, started 18 times from pole and finished on the podium 103 times.
Friedrich wins 60th World Cup - Nolte wins in a two-man bobsleigh - Sport
The brand of the Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 successes is the goal of the bobsleigh pilot.
“I once calculated this, I would have to take nine and a half victories per season, then I could make it to Cortina 2026,” said the double Olympic champion from the BSC Oberb<0xC3><0xA4>renburg, who scored two successes in two days at the races in Winterberg.
Only on Saturday he resisted the attack of Johannes Lochner by five hundredths, in which he drove from rank three to one.
Then he changed the material setting slightly and took a bigger lead on Sunday with 0.30 seconds.
With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberb<0xC3><0xA4>renburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle) he prevailed over the British Brad Hall.
Third was Austrian Benjamin Maier.
“We took a bigger risk today and were rewarded,” said Friedrich, who also recorded his 22nd win in a row.
Berchtesgadener Johannes Lochner, driving for Stuttgart, came in fifth place after second place earlier this time.
Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach finished fourth in the first race in eighth place.
“If I knew what he was doing differently, I would do it,” Lochner said.
Nolte with home victory - podium for Jamanka
Laura Nolte won her third win of the season in a two-man bobsleigh on her home track.
After only reaching fourth place in the Monobob on the previous day, she raced to World Cup victory on Sunday in the German triple success with pusher Deborah Levi.
Two-man bobsleigh Olympic champion Mariama Jamanka from BRC Thuringia came second with Germany’s fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
In addition to her Olympic qualification, she booked the first podium this winter.
The Wiesbaden woman Kim Kalicki landed in third place with Leonie Fiebig.
For me it was super cool, first podium in the World Cup, I am super happy that Mariama takes me.
I am super happy with the development.
There is still a lot of potential at the start, but the start times today were okay," said Burghardt and emphasized: "It is not only pushing, but there is also an enormous amount of work to be done around it."
Jamanka was a little annoyed about the not entirely flawless rides, but said: "It's going in the right direction".
I already had the blanket in my shopping cart and could buy it now!!!
What do you want me to do?
I did not receive it and therefore could not redeem why I finally asked.
Due to Corona, I had completely different problems last year and never had time for them.
And now it was said that he had passed away which made me very angry.
Look in the chat it was about the Asare bench.
I would like to return it and then order again as it has just been reduced :)
Why will the shipment only start on 16.3.?
There was nothing of such a long delivery time on your website
No until I tap an extra field with the message
Was taken off by your colleague yesterday.
Why is this a problem today?
I also sent you pictures of the wrong delivery.
But we want the shelf module anyway, just a new undamaged
Do not cancel the entire order.
Only this day, only this week, only until XY...
Hello lovely girls and girls and women,
I have something I just want to write and maybe one or the other goes like this...
I am 24, have kPTBS, full-time student and dog mom - apart from the fact that my dog does not scream or goes to kindergarten, he is actually 1 to 1 my child.
My boyfriend (since 6 years together) is ill, got himself a 2nd degree burn on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him because I also have emotional needs and because I want to see and feel him, we cuddled a lot and it was beautiful.
I helped him shower (because hand is in bandage wg burn).
On top of that, it is cold and we are currently seeing less (1-2x week) which makes me very busy with my needs for affection and love.
My dog child has a stomach ache, I have cooked for him and now he is lying in his cuddly blanket and has relaxed a bit after I was there for him with the heat lamp and caressing.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she just left for a month.
Now there is also some housework coming our way, which of course we split up.
But even cooking is a lot of work for me right now...
My PTSD disease is currently quite well adjusted, I am reasonably well treated and manage.
Not good, but I get along and am almost symptom-free.
My university is demanding a lot (for me), tomorrow at 15h I have a written test for which I have done nothing yet and the day after tomorrow anatomy-hour for which I should at least prepare a bit.
And next week I have an oral exam on Tuesday, and what comes next is in my calendar and not in my head because there is no more room.
So my week goes like this: Only until the day after tomorrow, then it’s weekend.
But then the whole thing goes on?
Only until his birthday.
Only until the beginning of the holiday.
Only until the weekend.
Only until...
And so it goes on forever.
I think I’m just so stressed out that I need these mental cues, because otherwise I’ll pack the ned.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic" but otherwise I can't do it...
Is that how you feel, too?
Honestly, I’m infinitely grateful that I don’t have to work.
Thank you so much, I can’t put that into words.
I don't know if I'd have survived my KPTBS.
I think this has a lot to do with mental load of women and that's why I thought that I would find suffering comrades here...
I wish you a relaxing evening, the week is almost done!
I got my order today unfortunately the whole other color plus surface is scratched and table leg has imprint.
On the first delivery, the color was just like on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!!
What can you offer me?
If we change the table now I get another color or how?
The cancellation email was sent on 26.12.#NUMBER#.
Two other times.
But it was not confirmed.
Something completely different: I realized at school that many religious teachers do not believe in God and it is just another subject for them like math or geography.
For me this was always a bit strange, maybe also because I was raised as a Christian and I always believed in something like that.
How do you feel about that?
Perhaps you can also talk about work and study colleagues with different attitudes.
Basically, I understand the difference between private and professional and it makes sense to separate.
There is also a curriculum and so on.
But it would also be strange to have a physics teacher who does not believe in the theory of relativity.
What makes you want to teach religion if you don’t believe it?
Culture or something like that?
Hope your question is not too private.
Can't it be changed or not?I like to write in english that I understand well
It's been a long time, then I'd stop
All right, thanks.
I expect a response soon, by the beginning of next week at the latest.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Film Search Help Please
Hello dear friends,
I am looking for a movie from my childhood (I am 24).
I think it was a movie for young people.
There are two timelines (or parallel worlds) in the film.
On the one hand, the modern (real world).
On the other hand, the past (or the realm of the dead) (not quite sure).
Since I can’t describe it in more detail in the real world anyway, there is a young woman.
And in the realm of the dead a young soldier (uniform similar to that of the soldiers from Curse of the Caribbean).
For some reason, the paths intersect and an action arises.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman into this realm in order to be able to live on her own.
The passage is, I believe, also the burial place of the soldier.
In the end, I think both soldiers are fighting each other.
If this tells you anything, I am grateful for any response.
Our little one has only slept on her stomach from week 1.
Fast forward: still alive :D
Just relax.
Such a child can endure much more than you think.
Make sure everything around you is right, no cuddly toys, go in and look more often, but no minutes of surveillance.
That's what drives you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattress.
No pillows.
Achso and ours did not have a sleeping bag, but always had a blanket.
Watch your child when he sleeps.
Does it turn its head to the side?
Can it lift from the stomach?
Or is it with the face ahead Directly in the mattress?
You can tell if everything is okay.
We all grew up and when my husband came into the world, it was gait and there was that you put the kids on your stomach to sleep.
In addition, we are already "regular customer" with you and have already bought a lot of items
Why are you offering me only $20?
Hello, I wrote yesterday with a colleague of yours and so far no feedback.
It's about my wardrobe, which arrived the day before yesterday (order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer does not fit in the cabinet.
Please contact me as soon as possible.
The closet is so currently not to use.
To be perfectly clear.
RBTV has promised a lot.
And yes, I know for myself, not everything can be kept.
And I also had a lot of fun with RBTV.
It’s just that the politics of this station is now under control.
Almost every format is sponsored (ok), but then at the same time go on a big begging tour.
It was said that one was an "independent" Internet broadcaster.
Arno: You don't want to be a running poster column.
What is it now?
An 0815 advertising channel trying to bring his BilloMerch to the elite fan.
And then we have Marahs Do's & Don'ts.
Of course, that applies to everyone except Simon and Etienne.
Of course, they can continue to insult people.
A Krogmann who completely lacks empathy and tries to make ashes at the expense of the action with the exploded rented rooms.
How do you find all this good?
Great if you like it, I think it's terrible.
I ask for a call back, since my delivered wooden table was delivered defective.
Corpus fracture due to damaged delivery of the #PRS_ORG#.
Whether as a comforter for stomachaches or just for cuddling – my little warmth friend can be used in many ways.
Cherry core pillows are a traditional home remedy for soothing heat applications, as cherry cores can absorb heat very well and release it in a metered manner.
The removable inner cushion can be easily heated in the microwave or in the oven.
The soft cover makes the application particularly pleasant, so that the little ones feel safe, even if they are not doing so well.
The cherry core cushion with cover is suitable as a heat pad exclusively for the following areas of application:
Before heating the pillow, check for untypical odor, stick or burn marks and dispose of them immediately if present.
Please remove the inner cushion from the cover before heating!
Heat in the microwave at max. 300 watts for max. 2 minutes (please note the microwave manufacturer's details!)
Immediately after heating, distribute the heat evenly in the pillow by shaking!
Then place the inner cushion in the cover.
During the first heating, slight moisture formation may occur on the surface, but this will disappear in repeated applications.
Be sure to follow the heating instructions given, as longer periods or higher energy outputs can lead to damage (inflammation and combustion risk!).
Before heating the pillow in the microwave, check that heating of grain products is allowed in the manufacturer's instructions for use.
After the heated inner cushion has been placed back in the cover, please check the temperature of the pillow for suitability for babies (max. 43 °C) at your armrest!
Do not use the pillow for acute and chronic, inflammatory or feverish diseases, circulatory problems, fresh haematoma, bruising and open wounds, as well as in people with reduced pain.
For existing skin, heart, veins, diabetes or tumor diseases as well as pregnancy, please consult a doctor before use.
If seams have opened and loose cores are leaking, dispose of the product and loose cores immediately and inaccessible to children.
If the product is used in babies under 1 year of age, the temperature of the child should be monitored regularly during use to exclude overheating!
All serious incidents related to the product shall be reported to the manufacturer and to the competent authority of the country in which the user is established.
The cover is removable and machine washable at 30 °C.
Please note the care symbols on the product!
Darmstadt second after first leg - Pauli wins in Düsseldorf
Darmstadt 98 can dream of returning to the Bundesliga.
Meanwhile, Hannover 96 is working from the table cellar.
For Ingolstadt, it does not run under the third coach.
Cheers in Darmstadt after the late victory in the top game, joy in Hannover over interim coach Christoph Dabrowski and frustration in Ingolstadt after the failed start under the new coach Rüdiger Rehm.
Is the battery broken?
Last night my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) was no longer charged by my power supply.
I bought this about 5 months ago, so it should still work.
I thought power supply alone was enough for operation.
Error, the battery is empty and the laptop does not start despite the power supply plugged in.
I then removed the battery, but nothing is happening here either.
Do you have any ideas?
A new battery is ordered, but why can't I use the laptop in AC mode?
Is something else broken?
Thank you very much for your help!
I want the delivery of the #PRS_ORG# to the room.
How can I book this?
I am interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
I don't know how high the seat is...
Often on tour and still a lot of equipment?
With the Everyday V2 Backpack from Peak Design no problem!
Even larger photo equipment swallows 20 litres of capacity without problems, which can be safely stowed with the padded FlexFold dividers.
And what else you need for everyday objects, remains well organized and separable from the photographic equipment thanks to practical accesses in the individually configurable interior.
With the "Update" of the Everyday Line to the version 2 (V2), the series presents itself in a new look.
Its chic, minimalist design is synonymous with it - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack while still allowing access to photo equipment in seconds.
This works with two options: once conventionally via the lid flap, which can be closed with the MagLatch closure system, an excellently thought-out solution for effective protection, which has already proven itself with the messenger bags.
There is a metal hook in the closure flap with matching anchor bars on the front of the backpack.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has considered different "fill levels": there are 4 anchor bars, securely riveted, in which the hook can be hooked.
If the backpack is fully loaded, you simply take the top bar, it is rather empty, a deeper one.
The flap closure and hook are also magnetic.
This means that the backpack can also be reliably closed without locking the hook.
The second option also distinguishes the Everyday Backpack from other, photo backpacks: In addition to the lid flap, there is also a zipper opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest disadvantage of conventional backpacks with access from above - you no longer have to rummage through the contents!
At the same time, this clever detail increases the everyday suitability of the backpack enormously: if you not only take your photo equipment, but also everyday items or luggage.
In the Everyday Backpack, you can configure the interior individually (more on this below) and store both separately without any problems - and access it independently through the two lateral openings.
You can also pull the backpack from the right side in front of the body, for example to access the camera equipment in the main right compartment, while the everyday things stay safely in the left half of the backpack and do not come in between.
Comfortable, easily adjustable carrying straps help with this.
And since the outer shell of the backpack is also made entirely from 100% recycled, weatherproof nylon, the contents remain dry even if it is to go to Scotland in the fall.
Unfortunately, I am waiting in vain for the email from your support.
Yesterday, #NAME# sent me an email confirming that the
Contact by the forwarding company for the collection of the incorrectly delivered table announced.
So far I have not received a message.
I ask for immediate processing.
I am already writing with the third support employee, with no one I got further than the promise that I will receive an email as confirmation.
It is the return of the incorrectly delivered custom #NAME#
Is it possible to know when the cabinet will be delivered again?
Keeping it that way is not an option for me...
It works.
Thank you very much for the help
Wish you a nice evening
Hello, my order number is #NUMBER#. When will the item be delivered?
Order and payment was on 12.1.21.
I was delivered a completely different lamp than I ordered
Please call me
If you extend the voucher to me, then I will immediately place a larger order, but at least I have kept the damaged piece of furniture and not sent back.
And that the past year went differently than I thought, I could not imagine and just did not be able to redeem it in time and clarify.
But I have the damage as a customer and I do not accept it that way.
Rotinger brake discs are designed for the demands of the dynamic driver who appreciates reliability and safety when braking even under difficult conditions.
Rotinger brake discs are made of cast iron and then mechanically machined (drilled and cut).
All tuned discs are produced in short series according to individual technical characteristics, which are specific for certain discs and patterns.
On the basis of the individual technical drawing, a special production program is created, which is based on the characteristics of the original assembly when balancing the pane.
The tuned discs produced in this way ensure high comfort and braking effectiveness.
Additionally created openings increase the effectiveness of the cooling of the disc, whereby the cuts improve the cleaning of the brake discs and brake pads.
Aesthetic features of our tuned windows underline the character of each car through their attractive and striking appearance.
Coloma is the city where an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man discovered glowing boulders in the water at the southern fork of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery a secret, the news quickly spread, triggering the so-called “California Gold Rush” of ‘49.
Thousands came from near and far, making Coloma one of the fastest growing and thriving cities in the country.
Areas were set up, tents were set up, and saloons and hotels were built almost overnight.
Everyone wanted their share of the country’s wealth.
For many, it was called "Coloma or Bust" (Coloma or bankruptcy)!
In this game you are a pioneer who is looking for wealth in the West and wants to make a name for himself.
You will search for gold, recruit workers, rally horses, and build businesses.
You will also have the opportunity to explore the surrounding rivers and adjacent areas.
You're not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You have to outdo your pioneer colleagues to avoid going broke with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast paced strategy game with many ways to win.
You simultaneously choose your actions, have to manage your resources and build a tableau that "works" for you more and more (so-called "engine building").
The buildings on your tableau allow you to become more efficient, get extra actions, or turn rules in your favor.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge tiles, you can develop your individual playing style with the help of fine adjustments.
Coloma takes place over a three-year period from 1848 (the year in which the gold was discovered in Coloma), over 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush) to 1850 (the year in which California gained official statehood).
A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, players will secretly and at the same time choose a location on the game plan where they can perform actions.
After that, their selections are revealed and they place their pioneers at the appropriate locations.
If a site has the most pioneers, it gets a lock!
This disables one half of the location - thus reducing the possible actions there.
Then players take turns performing actions such as gaining resources, moving carts, setting up tents, browsing rivers, building bridges, opening shops, and positioning gun heroes.
When all actions are completed, the pioneers return.
The advertiser turns to a new location at the beginning of each round and thus changes the available actions.
This continues until the advertiser has moved five times, i.e. has hidden each location once and the year ends.
There is a shooting in which players must defend Coloma from a raid of angry bandits.
If players have contributed enough gunslingers and outnumber the bandits, they will receive rewards.
However, if they fail, they will receive lower rewards or end up in the cemetery.
The game ends after the third shooting, then the final score takes place.
The player with the most victory points wins!

"Why children are not tyrants" Documentary, ARD Mediathek
CW psychological violence, sexual abuse, abuse of power
The ARD documentary appeared in my Twitter timeline today, and I looked at it right away.
>The child psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a welcome guest on talk shows and gives lectures throughout Europe.
With his book "Why our children become tyrants" (2008), he triggered a fierce debate about education.
Former patient: women and persons entitled to education are now making serious accusations against him.
Please take care, the movie is hard to bear.
And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently.
We parents and other responsible persons must never, never, never! be concerned about power over the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child space for his development and to make the framework for the child as large as it is sensible and possible in the situation.
Brrr, I'm still shaking.

At their next meeting, the health ministers of the L<0xC3><0xA4>nder want to decide on a nationwide elimination of the test obligation for triple vaccinated people.
"We countries need clarity quickly as to whether and from when the test obligation for three times vaccinated people can be dispensed with," Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the Health Ministers' Conference, told the "Bild am Sonntag".
The elimination of 2G plus for triple-vaccinated is "not only medically meaningful, but also provides an additional vaccination incentive," said Holetschek.
Federal Minister of Health Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has promised, "that he will make a proposal to the Conference of Health Ministers next Tuesday". <0xE2><0x88><0x92> afp
So I want to send the lamp back
What is the best way to do this?
Hello, I think the #PRS_ORG# chair is very nice, but I can't see how high the seat is.
Can you help me?
I can no longer make purchases using my #PRS_ORG#.
Oops, an error has occurred.
Purchase via the #PRS_ORG# page on the computer goes.
I have updated my account details.
What is the reason for this?
What you describe is called *awareness*, meaning sensory perceptions under general anesthesia.
These occur with a frequency of about 1 in 1000.
It is most common to hear sounds/voices, less often to see pictures and most rarely to perceive pain.
Relevant to this topic: C-sections are surgeries that are associated with an increased rate of awareness, since a very deep anesthesia is avoided to protect the child until the nap.
Previous episodes of Awareness should be mentioned during the anaesthetic audition.
Certain anesthesia procedures, such as total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA), are associated with a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT: Dear everyone, this comment by me describes Awareness correctly, but had** u/Nitemarex **per definition none.
I misread your comment.
The chair is defective.
Unfortunately, the $20 doesn’t help either.
These are statutory warranty claims.
The absolute minimum would be that they take back the defective chair.
In addition to the legal obligation, this is also standard in the field of eCommerce.
Please check again if you at least take back the defective chair.
We then sell the second chair privately.
We also lose a lot of money.
I already sent you an email that you didn’t answer.
Again the question.
In the order and on the invoice it says that the goods will be delivered to a room of my choice.
The forwarder is company #NAME#.
I just called there.
I was told that they only deliver to the front door - because of #PRS_ORG#.
Is that so?
If so, I have to cancel the order as I don’t know any person who can carry me the heavy furniture to the first floor.
Am I not being called?
I had formulated a question
Theatre historian Günther Rühle dies at 97
He has distinguished himself as a theatre critic and as an artistic director.
Later he wrote a monumental theatre history.
Günther Rühle died on Friday at the age of 97.
There is still the new book on the table, freshly printed: "An old man is getting older".
The shattering diarium of a slow farewell to the world, which the theatre historian and journalist Günther Rühle led until April 2021.
And in the middle of the reading comes the news that the author has died.
The last sentence in the book is: "I already testify here my thanks for life".
There are different types of pallets.
One of the most common are Euro pallets, standardized wooden pallets, which are mainly used in the European area as load carriers.
They are certified by the European Pallet Association EPAL
According to data from Statistik Austria, more than ten million pallets were produced in Austria in 2020.
The production value was a good 79 million euros.
How many pallets are imported to Austria annually is not charged
New York wins MLS championship for the first time
New York City FC has won the title in Major League Soccer for the first time.
After the 1:1 in the regular season against hosts Portland Timbers, the team from the Eastern Conference decided the final in penalty shootout with 4:2.
In the final of the Eastern Conference, New York prevailed against Philadelphia Union, the team of the German Kai Wagner.
Rouladen Tips & Tricks
A week ago I got a lot of great tips for the perfect goulash.
This was for Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and buttery!
Thanks again for that :)
Now I have come to the taste and would like to cook roulades for the first time on New Year's Eve.
Tomorrow I will start a cattle fund for this.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I don't have an oven, just a large pot.
What's next?
What about the books or how do I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#?
My English is not so good anymore, but I get it.
It's about a refund of €#NUMBER#
I was already informed on 18.01. by mail that the refund was made.
To this day, the money has not been received by me.
Would you check there, please.
Where there are still Christmas roasts in the Lübeck area
For many people, goose or duck belongs to the Christmas days like the Christmas tree and the gifts.
You haven't got any poultry yet?
Now time is running out.
We will tell you where you can still get a Christmas roast in the Lübeck area.
The "drive" of a tube amplifier contributes significantly to the heat and fat content of the guitar amplifier sound.
These features are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor circuit.
With the VOLUME, GAIN and MASTER VOLUME controls, you can set the desired level on the one hand and the distortion of your sounds on the other.
Furthermore, the amplifiers of the VT+ series offer a unique POWER LEVEL control, which allows you to reduce the sound level without changing anything about the "gain" and the distortion.
The POWER LEVEL controller even allows you to set up a power reserve when it’s outrageously loud.
Thanks to the POWER LEVEL controller, the full potential of the VT+ series can be used in any situation.
The headphone jack can also be used as a line output.
The signal applied here is processed with a speaker simulation, so that you get an eminently "acoustic" sound impression even when using a headphone or direct recordings.
A CD or MP3 player can be connected to the AUX jack, allowing you to jam to your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - so you don't need a separate tuner.
If you also use a VFS5 footswitch, you can also call up the sounds conveniently by foot, switch the effect blocks on/off and "tap" the tempo of the compatible effects.
This is actually essential for live use.
With its new powerhouses, VOX is taking another step into the future!
But I had seen it that way in others.
Is it possible to return the lamp?
Because it hangs too low for over a dining table?
So I would like to send them back.
Can you help me with that?
And the dresser?
Will we receive an update on the exact delivery date in the next few weeks?
Have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
If it is not possible, I would be satisfied with a discount or voucher.
I may find a buyer for the furniture.
Only over 1,000 euros for goods that I do not need are then something much.
I have just received my delivery and would like to know if screws were provided as part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) on the intended hook.
This is not a satisfactory answer and the waiting time was not worth it
Is there a premium customer status with you?
Iran sees progress in nuclear deal negotiations
According to Iranian data, the negotiations for a revival of the international nuclear agreement are progressing.
“Both sides are on the verge of agreeing on the issues that should be on the agenda,” Iran’s chief negotiator Ali Bagheri told Irna on Sunday.
This was a "positive and important development", because initially there was not even agreement on the topics to be negotiated.
The agreement is designed to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna talks on reviving the agreement continued after a week-long hiatus.
Negotiators from Iran, Germany, Great Britain, China, France and Russia will participate in the negotiations.
A US delegation is also on site in Vienna, but only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia overtakes Saxony - Free State now federal state with highest corona incidence
Thuringia has replaced Saxony and currently has the highest incidence nationwide.
As the only federal state, the value is above the mark of 1000.
Thuringia is the only federal state to have been above the mark of 1000 in the corona incidence on Sunday.
The Robert Koch Institute reported the seven-day figure with 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which had always had the highest incidence nationwide, this figure was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thuringia had fallen slightly, but had also been above the value of 1000.
In Thuringia, 2242 new infections with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 other deaths related to an infection were reported within one day.
200 seriously ill people with Covid-19 received intensive care in hospitals on Sunday.
Reporting delays may occur on weekends.
In addition, the health offices have been overloaded for weeks and hardly come behind with the recording of new cases.
I understand that.
Since the delivery will only take place at the beginning of March, it may be possible until then.
I have to print it out and stick it on the package and drop it off at the post office, right?
I don't have to click/enter/fill anything here?
This is exactly what I want to avoid, so I am writing to you.
I would like to take over the return at my own expense.
8 euro return fee is in my opinion an impudence.
It's time for change
###MBundestag greetings, I am u/StratorDE in the Plenary Hall in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
"Why the post here?
If you look at the activity in the past months of the MBundestag you can see one thing: It is not existing.
We got into a winter freeze and extended the summer hole to a few months.
#Where is the problem?
Yeah, what was it about?
For the most part, this should simply be related to the dissatisfaction, as here some things have passed and how we generally stand.
In recent days, the impression has increased that many here are still really looking forward to the MBundestag.
#What we need to change
At this point, the community around the MBundestag is asked who wants to keep it alive.
The impetus came from u/edizVEVO, who has become aware of this project in the last few days and has found a, simply put, pile of pieces.
After some back and forth, several people from the community have found themselves wanting to rebuild the project.
However, I would also like to explicitly call on everyone to participate, only in this way this project can continue to exist in the future.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a discord server on which we can exchange ideas and work out concrete things.
You can join the server via this link.
Objectives:
* How should the MBundestag work in the future?
* Which existing orders need to be changed / adapted / removed?
* How should we act externally in the future?
* How should new members be recruited?
How do we create a fair electoral system?
I’m pretty sure I’ve forgotten a few things, but that’s not bad, we’ll end up with the discord.
If you have the desire and time, come to the discord, cooperate and let us decide democratically about the future.
I have ordered a lampshade from you that is still being delivered.
Now I see that the article is too big / clunky for this and not suitable for my taste.
For this I have already ordered another suspension from you.
I put it together and then noticed this when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about it.
I hope this will be returned and I have a full refund.
This is also quite sad, as the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have another question: the bedspread #PRS_ORG#, is there also in oversize, so in 240/240 for example?
#PRS_ORG# must be able to guarantee that the faulty cabinet will be picked up in a timely manner.
And I ask you to arrange that now.
I do not have a suitable packaging, but will remove the cabinet as far as possible for collection - you have to clarify with #PRS_ORG# how this can work then.
#PRS_ORG# can contact me by phone at any time to arrange a collection appointment.
Is there any instructions for assembly?
How long do I have time to get them or decide to return them?
How do you answer the question of why you are vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague that I like.
She herself has lived vegetarian for a while, currently also rarely eats meat.
I was a vegetarian a few years ago.
When asked if I had always wanted to be vegan, and vegetarianism was a planned intermediate step, I answered honestly without much thought.
And that I thought for a long time that I would support animal welfare as a vegetarian, but at some point I reflected and understood that I ultimately also support animal cruelty.
So I decided to go vegan.
At that moment, I had the impression that her side was disheartened, she then defended vegetarianism and said she knew where her meat came from and you reduce animal suffering as a vegetarian.
Now I wonder if my answer was to "plump"?
How do you answer the question?
I have the feeling that as a vegan you are quickly put in a corner and conflicts arise, without which you would put it on.
It greets a harmony-loving vegan (;
It is clearly not an exception according to <0xC2><0xA7> 312d BGB.
You do not release your #PRS_ORG# from the legal requirements for distance sales.
I am not on site on the date assigned, on which #PRS_ORG# picks up my return.
Since I can not be there because of a funeral, unfortunately this cannot be changed.
Can I be assigned an alternative pick-up date?
From the 01.02.#NUMBER# I can be found all over again.
Lahnsteiner Wehr prepared for water rescue: 45,000 euros subsidy from the state
Recently, the Rhineland-Palatinate Minister of the Interior Roger Lewentz handed over a grant notice of 45,000 euros to Lord Mayor Peter Labonte in the Lahnstein Town Hall for the new water rescue vehicle of the Lahnstein Volunteer Fire Department.
The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in use since November 2020, amounted to 135,000 euros.
A good and important investment in safety.
I am pleased that the state of Rhineland-Palatinate is supporting us in this," says Lahnstein's Lord Mayor Peter Labonte.
The equipment car is used by the diving staff Lahnstein, one of a total of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Above and below water, they perform tasks in water and ice rescue as well as technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, increasing efforts are expected on a permanent basis: The boom in hotel shipping on the Rhine and Moselle as well as the further increasing use of the Lahn as a leisure river contribute to this.
I bought a book that I could only read 10% and then the problems started.
I can't open the book.
I followed their recommendations but have synced, removed and reloaded the app NOTHING has worked.
I am a bit frustrated because the whole action has already cost me a lot of time and now I hope for help.
Okay, that's it.
I would like to order 3 items from the collection of #PRS_ORG# for June.
Can I enter an appointment in the order process?
In accordance with the ANSI/PLATO FL1 standard, the previously stated values are determined in the Fenix laboratory at 21°C<0xC2><0xB1>3°C, 50%-80% humidity and the built-in 275mAh LiPo battery.

First of all, thank you for standing up for the whole thing here, I also spent almost a decade in the civil service in a similar activity, that is, we were also weapons carriers in the executive branch, I do not want to go into this further!
I have always found the question of right and left to be very simplified.
In principle, however, one should say that, of course, the civil servant comes from the liberal to conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left, that should actually be clear to everyone.
That of course also in the special uniform and weapons carrier people right from conservative magical attract should also be clear to everyone, that these people then of course with the lived reality can be difficult to deal with is of course also clear, because you have of course next to the average white, meanwhile many Germans with a migration background, women and also homosexuals (and by that I now do not mean people can not rely on these overly feminine cliches, because they do not tell you in the executive and rather less to normal men).
But even these marginal groups also represent a conservative attitude, even if it sounds comical in my experience, i.e. they are proud of Germany and feel themselves rather less picked up by exaggerated left-wing politics, even if this policy supposedly stands up for them or thinks they have to make it right, while they simply want to be treated as normal.
Back to the right, since of course police and armed forces are also a cross section of society, you will also find extreme right there, but that they are allowed to openly say their opinion there or even openly make any state-endangering plans is completely exaggerated in the media and also annoys me.
Of course, it happens that especially police officers and soldiers who were often in foreign missions often start to generalize due to negative experiences and sometimes say things that are controversial to politically incorrect.
It also happens that even right-wing contemplatives meet sometimes who engage in a lively exchange of ideas.
Nevertheless, in my opinion, such a thing is well fought and also counteracted with political education and education the whole!
Germany is so internationally entangled and that is also good in my opinion that we could not afford to have real racists and Nazis in our ranks at all!
yes, which I do not understand, I ordered the other basket also on the German side.
Why would this come from England?
When I ordered, it was not sold out.
I ordered in November.
It was confirmed to me in your confirmation of the order.
It is still about my order, which is no longer available.
I've been chatting with #NAME# before.
Alternatively, you could still deliver the other #PRS_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# Euro in black to Germany or this basket is also available somewhere in Germany.
I always find you as a partner company.
but at the top of the edge of the wooden part are two deep notches filled with something yellow
and on the mirror itself is a small scratch
More orderly by child?
I (w32) have been working on this for a long time.
I am very disciplined and organized at work, (I am self-employed, very little free time), but already my life I get it more bad than right to run my household permanently clean and tidy.
There are always phases in which everything remains, and every now and then it grabs me and I clean up and clean up.
But it is never so "that someone could come spontaneously to visit".
My husband is (unfortunately) no better, it bothers me somewhere but usually loses budget simply against work and displeasure.
The kitchen is cleaned most regularly as we like to cook.
Now to my question, have you managed to become more orderly with a child?
We don’t have any but work on it yet and this question has been occupying me for some time.
Because for me I have no incentive, it just does not bother me so doll, as long as no visit comes and e.g. always fresh clothes there and the kitchen usable.
Do you have a bigger incentive with a child or do you stay sloppy?
I look forward to your answers.
Exclusive, new, high-quality and anatomically preformed cut, offers maximum comfort, a perfect fit and thus allows almost unlimited freedom of movement.
Preform with special, wide embossing on the joints for improved freedom of movement (at arm and squats)

Career in social work - as someone with a self-insecure personality disorder?
I was trained in software development and have been trained for about a year now.
Unfortunately, I notice more and more that this profession is not the right one for me, which is why I have been thinking about starting again and studying social work for a long time.
The problem: I have a self-insecure (or anxiously avoiding) personality disorder (<0xC3><0x84>VPS).
This roughly means that I have no self-esteem and am accordingly shy.
I have no problem with talking to people on a factual level, but it is very difficult for me to have casual conversations and I have been told many times that I seem unapproachable (though I think that has already gotten better).
Can I become a social worker like that?
I do not want to work as a street worker or in an open youth meeting, but rather in addiction counseling or family help, for example.
However, I don’t know if the actual day-to-day work is really as I imagine it to be, and it is difficult to find something on the Internet.
The <0xC3><0x84>VPS already leads to problems in my job (for me, emotionally), because it pulls me down every time there is something to complain about my code ("already easiest things fucked up") and it is difficult for me to ask more experienced colleagues for help ("I should really know how to do it myself by now" / "I keep him away from work with my stupid questions" / "I must really consider myself to be inferior" etc.
I will probably have the problems in every profession but I wanted to have it mentioned at the place.
Did you get the sofa back?
Because there was no confirmation for that either.
I'm waiting for an appointment to pick up
What do you mean please give back?
If I have downloaded a book to the #PRS_ORG#, the message Your #PRS_ORG# does not authorize this book
Is there a problem?
I was chatting with #PRS_ORG#, who asked me if I got a delivery confirmation for my closet.
The bird breaks down the protein (protein) taken up with the feed into the individual protein building materials (amino acids) in its gastrointestinal tract and from these in turn builds up its own proteins, which it also needs for plumage formation.
The formation of plumage in the nestling and the formation of new plumage in the moulting bird are extremely complex processes and are associated with a particularly high stress for the entire organism of the animal.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio may not be administered during breeding, otherwise there may be disturbances in the breeding process.
Following this curative administration of NEKTON-Bio, the daily vitamin supply of NEKTON-S (multivitamin supplement) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral supplement) should be resumed.

1 g of NEKTON organic on 250 ml of water or 100 g of soft food.
It is recommended to prepare only as much drinking water/soft food as the bird consumes daily and to change water/food daily.
A coated measuring spoon (inside) corresponds to 1 g of NEKTON organic.
In the case of severe plumage damage, double or triple doses of NEKTON-Bio can be given at the beginning until the formation of plumage is visible.
After that, the normal dose is given until the plumage re-formation is fully completed.
Storage: NEKTON-Bio should be stored dry without sunlight, between 15° and 25°C.
Please excuse them, but the chair is sold as an office chair.
How can an office chair break after 9 months?
The warranty claims in Germany are 24 months.
This is really bad service.
Hello, I sent an email on Monday to let you know that my order arrived damaged and pictures were attached.
Did you receive this e-mail?
Statement of a municipal employee in opposition to the statute
Hello r/LegaladviceGerman,
I have the following problem.
A walnut tree is to be felled on our property.
So, the petition was filed with the municipality.
One employee writes to me that the felling of fruit trees and thus also the walnut is not part of the statute.
In the statute, however, the walnut is explicitly stated as a tree to be protected.
Can I rely on the employee’s statement or not?
On the one hand, I have to be able to rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the statute is clear.
Thank you for your reply
We understand that.
Then we will use the new packaging for it.
I have not received a message
Well, then I still have a sofo without use.
Could you offer me a discount or a voucher?
What was more expensive?
Yes, I think so, only the question is whether I can pay in euros and have the blanket delivered to Germany
Can you check that?
Emergency notification: Severe traffic accident at Selb
Recently, a serious traffic accident occurred on the St 2179 between the junction Selb-Nord and Plö<0xC3><0x9F>berg.
As the press alert of the police currently informs (14:03 clock), a car has come into oncoming traffic when overtaking.
There are casualties.
Ah okay I understand.
Well, thanks again for making it so easy!
Advice and ideas for further professional life
Merry Christmas to you all!
My Christmas is unfortunately moderately good, because my dear head is just thinking up everything you can think up.
In short: I need advice and best of all from people who somehow know my situation - from you.
I'm doing the ref as a lateral entrant.
Originally, I studied something else and worked in an area there (to remain anonymous at least, I don’t mention anything more specific here).
The whole thing was too boring for me and I looked for alternatives that I could enjoy more.
At some point I ended up at the teacher’s office and was sure that it was – even if the framework conditions are much more inflexible than in my previous profession, but I didn’t care.
I have now arrived at the third "I google other job postings".
And it's only been six months.
In the paintings before that I always decided to continue and at least finish the ref, after that I can still swing.
But right now, I'm totally done.
I had so little free time last month that I was completely drained.
Now it’s holidays, but there’s still a lot of work waiting for me.
Before the ref I always thought I was stress-resistant, but then my weekend was also my weekend and my end of work was my end of work.
I was free.
The stress at work didn’t matter at the time.
Now even the family celebration is too much stress for me.
And then there are those rigid structures that also annoy me.
Basically, it is fun and from the outside, the ref also runs well in terms of the feedback and so on.
But I’m completely drained and I wonder how much stress my body can endure before it closes completely – if it doesn’t already.
I wonder if I would like to have this for the rest of my working life - especially if I read some of your posts here - or if I should not go back to the old area where I was appreciated, where I could take my free time when I needed it, and the work was somehow boring, but was adequately paid for and together in a team what worked out and not as a lone fighter like that is now most of the time.
But then I wonder if in a year I will not be back in the same place as I am now and will not be satisfied.
You realize it’s all kind of confusing, but maybe as an outsider you have advice or ideas about how I get out of this situation, which I’m completely done with and almost at the slightest thought of crying about.
I’m not going to make decisions so emotionally right now, which probably doesn’t lead to anything good.
But maybe your views help me to see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel - or to be able to enjoy Christmas, that's enough for me for now.
Thank you for reading and apologies for the whiny undertone of mine.
I hope my situation has at least become a little clear.
Since its introduction in 2001, VOX's Valvetronix series has evolved steadily, resulting in the combination of advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" circuitry, which perfectly reproduces the behavior of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X amps, we introduce a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely state-of-the-art in terms of sound.
Thanks to VET (Virtual Element Technology) technology, which is based on the analysis of components and amp circuits, the VTX amplifiers offer an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
Of course, these amps also contain the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamplifier.
This is partly based on real analog circuits, because these simply manage the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier better than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated circuit, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed housing and a bass reflex system from which the natural resonances bubble.
With VOX’s Tone Room software, you can even correct and bend historical facts on the virtual level until the amp and effects sound the way you’ve always imagined.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the VOX Valve Reactor technology introduced in 2001.
Of course, it has been refined several times since then to meet new sound requirements, which in 2010 again led to a performance boost of the VOX Valvetronix series - with more dynamics and more numerous and significantly improved amplifier models.
From the handy VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has also been designed in such a way that all guitarists looking for maximum sound diversity will find what they are looking for.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amp: they expect a bold sound, a nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and string stroke, and a prompt response.
During an in-depth analysis, the VOX engineers discovered that the amplifier in particular determines the tube character of an amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology on the basis of this finding.
The Valve Reactor circuit of each VT+ amplifier, equipped with a 12AX7 tube, perfectly reflects the behaviour, subtle nuances and sound character of a tube amplifier.
NBA: Despite 20 points from Wagner: Magic lose at Clippers
The Orlando Magic's series of NBA defeats continues.
The Wagner brothers can shine - but it's not enough to win against the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven points from his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost to the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday 104-106.
The large main compartment is also adaptable: with three individually placeable and foldable Velcro dividers, it adapts to the needs of your photographic equipment and is therefore suitable for any type of camera - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full-frame mirror reflex cameras.
What ultimately fits into the backpack, of course, depends on the size of the camera and the lenses.
A possible assembly would be a DSLR camera with an attached lens, two to three interchangeable lenses and a clip-on flash.
Larger DSLM cameras such as the various models of the Sony a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 still leave room for more lenses.
In addition, you can store a lot of accessories.
And if you have a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-series) you can use the backpack for your equipment and for things that are not photogenic.
Even drone pilots make an optimal choice with the Everyday Backpack 20L, because the backpack offers enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Volcanic eruption on La Palma: probably the longest in history
In the nearly three months since the eruption began, the lava flows on the Canary Island have caused great damage.
Is there an end in sight?
With a duration of 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma is the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Island since Sunday.
So far, the eruption of the volcano Tehuya in 1585, with 84 days, was considered the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa.
There is no reliable data on previous outbreaks.
The activity of the still unnamed volcano in Cumbre Vieja has decreased somewhat in recent days, but volcanologists did not dare to predict when it might end.
The indicators indicate a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable," said the president of the island council, Mariano Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez Zapata, the state TV channel RTVE.
Damages in the millions
In the nearly three months since the eruption began, the more than 1,000-degree hot lava has destroyed nearly 2,900 homes and other buildings, RTVE reported.
Nearly 1,200 hectares were covered by a metre-thick layer of lava.
That’s nearly 1,700 football fields.
More than 7,000 residents had to be evacuated, the damage is estimated at more than 900 million euros.
Two new headlands with a total size of about 50 hectares were created off the coast due to cold lava.
Banana cultivation, of which about half of the approximately 85,000 inhabitants live directly or indirectly and which was already in crisis before the volcanic eruption, was particularly affected.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, further areas severely affected, wrote the newspaper "El Pa<0xC3><0xAD>s".
Christmas and Gifts
Christmas is just around the corner and especially the children will not be able to wait for the heavenly feast.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree have something seductive in themselves combined with the spiritual atmosphere and the crackling tension.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that keeps our increasingly divided society together.
It is therefore all the more important to become aware of the Christmas tradition of giving so that the gesture of giving, which according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss was a peace-making "social contract of native peoples", can escape the rigid routine and be filled with life again in the context of this tradition.
How St. Nicholas Became the Christ Child
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants through whom the Christmas days were closely linked to the giving of gifts.
Previously, gifts were handed out in one way or another on St. Nicholas’ Day.
The background to this still popular custom is that St. Nicholas, as Bishop of Myra, secretly threw gold into their windows in one night in order to spare them another life in sin.
From this unconventional way of giving emerged the popular custom in Germany to fill the boots especially of the children with gifts.
Protestants opposed this custom because they rejected mediators between God and man as “holy worship.”
For these reasons, they shall defend themselves against the institution.
Martin Luther turned St. Nicholas into the Christ Child, thus establishing a new lineage of tradition.
The focus of the present shifted to Christmas Eve.
Since most Protestants do not see such detailed questions as closely anymore, it only annoys the few that the custom of St. Nicholas is still an integral part of the pre-Christmas season, similar to the Martin custom with Martin’s songs and Martin’s parade.
Today you can find everything your heart desires in boots outside the door and under the Christmas tree from socks to coveted luxury watches.
Diversity of Traditions in Christian Countries
Sources prove a tradition of giving since the 13th century on the day of Saint Nicholas.
With the Reformation, the day of giving shifted to Christmas Eve.
In all Christian countries, however, there is a cheerful kuddle about the question of who now brings the gifts to the children.
In Germany, it depends on the respective region, whether the Christ Child appears on Christmas Eve or Santa Claus, which in principle is a kind of Nicholas, to which some peculiarities have been assigned over time.
These include, for example, his white beard, which has little in common with the rather strict Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sleigh pulled by reindeer and the preference of the fireplace to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas remains the central figure on Christmas.
In Spain, the Three Kings give the gifts, while in Italy it is the witch Befana, who is said to have shown them the way to the Child Jesus.
In Scandinavia, mythical creatures sometimes bring the gifts, while in Russia it brought Father Frost to some fame.
Here it is not reindeer, but three horses that pull his sleigh as a troika.
In the Czech Republic, the motherland of the Reformation in the course of the Hussite wars, the Christ Child is responsible for the handing over of the gifts.

Police shoot suspected bank robbers near Royal Palace
An armed man was shot dead by police near Kensington Palace in London on Saturday.
The police said callers had reported a man who went with a gun to a bank and the business of a bookmaker.
The man fled, according to the authorities in a vehicle, which could be stopped a little later by officials.
Shots were fired and the man was shot.
He was pronounced dead at the scene.
The police did not come from a terrorist background.
Several embassies are located in the area around Kensington Palace.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine and their three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.
Which one?

The decorative lamp fits harmoniously into any bed, garden area or rock garden.
The lamp is simply set up and can be anchored in the ground with 2 ground spikes.
Integrated and powerful 0.4 watt solar module for optimal charging of the built-in battery.
Luminous duration max. 10 hours
- The robust plastic version can be used outdoors all year round.
In the Hollywood spectacle, it is mostly menacing objects from distant galaxies that glow inwardly in color.
On the other hand, “Smart Stone” is completely harmless: the sun alone ensures that this solar light shines fascinatingly – either in white or coloured light (in six different shades).
The edgeless, amorphous design is deliberately chosen: like a naturally shaped large pebble, this modern light object presents itself by day.
Its organic curves fit into any natural environment – whether on the edge of the terrace, in the lawn or in the stone bed.
It also does well in the vicinity of larger pebbles and boulders, where it knows how to assert itself thanks to its size.
You can save yourself big preparatory work: As a solar light, »Smart Stone« does not require any supply lines or batteries.
Place the »Lightstone« in any place illuminated by the sun during the day.
Two supplied ground spikes provide a firm hold if necessary.
The matt white plastic cover itself is robust and weatherproof.
Its solar panel discreetly hides “Smart Stone” inside, along with its battery and two LEDs – one for white, the other for colored light.
The battery is already charging when sunlight hits the case.
At dusk, »Smart Stone« lights up automatically; in which colour, you decide for yourself: Six attractive light colours are available – in addition to daylight white – for you to choose.
The switch-off also takes place automatically as soon as the battery charge level has fallen to a predetermined minimum or as soon as it becomes bright again.
As soon as the sun shines again, the charging cycle begins again the next day.
I've done this several times before, it doesn't work.

Pill problem
Hello dear ladies and gentlemen,
I hope I’m doing everything right here, after a year Reddit is actually my first post.
To my problem: I started taking the pill again about five years ago, mainly because I had such incredibly bad pain during the period and shit PMS before the period.
Now I would like to leave that again, because I already have to take enough medication due to chronic diseases, which I can not choose.
My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
During my last two-year break from 0 to 100, I got explosive pimples everywhere.
So far so superficial, but it bothered me a lot and I didn't feel comfortable.
During the two-year break, the whole thing has never really normalized.
Maybe someone has some tips to avoid this one.
My cosmetics are already perfume-free and without tints, but maybe there's something that someone can recommend to me.
Unfortunately, gynecologist did not take me so seriously and dermatologist appointment is yet to come.
Many thanks to everyone who read the novel!
Yes, the lovely skin is such a thing.
Had pre-bupertary bad neurodermatitis, then a period of rest, then large-scale nodules and the acne theme.
Nutrition I also tried everything possible in the course of chr. illness and got stuck on sugar, milk and low-meat mixed food, because nothing else worked really well.
It can also be good that hormonally is simply the worm in it, but if you have construction sites everywhere like me you want to stop looking for what else is wrong.
I already had everything her colleague semina or. . .
Written and now I have lost the conversation and do not know what was answered to my request.
I always have to work and get on the phone and suddenly everything was gone...
What is there to check, if the money was there, I would have seen it
Please check my bank details, maybe there was something wrong

110 kV underground cable to be rebuilt in 2022
The approval for the laying of the new high-voltage cable at Tann is final.
The plan approval decision of the government of Lower Bavaria paves the way for the construction, which is to start in 2022.
This was announced by the network operator Bayernwerk.
The approximately seven-kilometer-long underground cable will connect the Tann substation in the north of the municipality and the existing 110-kilovolt line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen.
The cable is connected to a mast of the overhead line near the village of Edermanning near Reut.

Ref: Planning lessons (EK)
Hello dear colleagues,
I have been in the Ref since summer, teaching is fun for me, but I still have big problems to plan my lessons in geography in an efficient way.
Unfortunately, my school is not technically well equipped, so in principle I can only use the blackboard, the textbook and an OHP as a medium.
In school I can only copy b/w free of charge (which is annoying for earth study).
It just takes me a long time to plan my time.
For example, we are currently working on the topic of geofactors and with me, every hour stands on its own.
In principle, the methods always repeat themselves, but on the other hand I don't want to invest too much time for simple lessons (I also need them for UBs, etc.).
When planning, I always start with the learning goal (what do I want to achieve) and then think about how I can build it up (usually I create a worksheet with texts from books that my school does not have).
We have the book Terra and I am rather dissatisfied with most of the tasks in the book.
So are the worksheets.
Maybe a geography teacher can teach me how to work with the book in a time-efficient way.
I'd be really happy.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from the order #NUMBER#.
I have actually already decided for a new one at #PRS_ORG# but I would like to process the return as soon as possible.
The trade fears because of the 2G regulation for the Christmas business.
In most businesses, only those who have been vaccinated or recovered are allowed.
The trade considers this unnecessary and complains of a drop in sales.
He also has a possible solution.
The 2G regulations spoil the important Christmas business from the point of view of the trade association Germany (HDE).
When it comes to deals with non-daily items, sales are to be lamented, criticized HDE CEO Stefan Genth.
According to a recent survey by the HDE of 1,100 retailers, more than 70 percent of companies looked negatively at the remaining days of the year.
Many would have already written off the Christmas business.
“What should actually be the positive highlight of the year is now often a hole without soil,” Genth said.
Traders with 2G access restrictions lost nearly a third of their pre-crisis sales in the past week.
It only works well in food retail and online.
The association demanded consequences from the dramatic development.
The purchase with mask, distance and hygiene concept is a safe matter, said the CEO.
“2G in shopping doesn’t get us anywhere in the fight against the pandemic,” he said.
The current regulations deterred customers and required a high level of staffing.
The bill must be approved nationwide, he demanded.
After that, each customer had to be checked only once on 2G (vaccinated or recovered) and would have access to all shops with the received ribbon on that day.
In addition, in the retail sector - as in public transport under the 3G rule (vaccinated, recovered or tested) - sampling checks should be sufficient.
German real estate group Deutsche Euroshop, which specializes in shopping centres, also spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
Most recently, frequencies without 2G were around 75 percent of pre-corona levels, and sales were around 90 percent.
These figures will now certainly fall in the middle of such an important Christmas business," CEO Wilhelm Wellner told Wirtschaftswoche.
Due to the high personnel and administrative effort, the centers are trying to find solutions and get approved.
This includes the so-called ribbon solution, in which "the visitors can, for example, at a central location in the center once provide their 2G proof and afterwards - equipped with a bracelet similar to a club hotel - undisturbed enter all shops".
I recently ordered and received the #PRS_ORG#.
The mirror has a scratch and there is also a flaw on the frame that was tried to be covered with a yellow filler.
That looks unsightly.
I would like to return the mirror and have already packed it back into the package and glued it.
How do I proceed for the return now?
The lamp is designed for dual balance, based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high power and high color rendering.
To adjust the color temperature and brightness of the lamp, a modern microprocessor with exceptional possibilities is provided.
In addition to adjusting the brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually set and store the color temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K.
Use the current settings in the flash memory.
A special feature of the controller, it is simple and intuitive to use.
The lamp produces a very luminous flux with soft light of high quality, completely flicker-free.
The beam angle of 120 degrees, with which you can illuminate large areas at a relatively small distance, is excellent.
Incidentally, even in reporter situations in small rooms or short distances.
You can adjust the brightness virtually without changing the color temperature.
It is a great tool to work on both the movie set or in the studio.
The optional DMX512 controller allows remote control of the luminaire in TV studios or when the luminaire is mounted in hard-to-reach places.
At the back of the lamp is the control panel, it consists of buttons and a luminous display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
Furthermore, there is the slot for the NP-F batteries (not included)
The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
In order to perform the settings of the individual settings on the memory locations, one of the memory keys is simply occupied and finished by pressing it for a longer time.
The memory controller stores the current state of the lamp when it is switched off, so that the known situation is present again when it is switched on again - Very practical when working in the studio, for example, when the camera is set to certain color temperatures.
Working with battery one of the greatest strengths of the DL3120 functionality results from the possibility of operation with cheap NP-F batteries.
These are often already in the possession of photographers and cameramen (and women) - so you can fall back on already existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check before the set whether the batteries have enough power - there is a battery tester built-in - for each of the two battery compartments a value in the two display displays (the left battery top display, the right on the bottom display).
In addition, it is of course possible to continuously supply the headlight with power via the supplied power supply.
The design of the headlamp is very simple.
You have to attach a 16mm sleeve as a connection, so you can directly to your photo tripod.
The inclination is to be reliably adjusted by means of locking devices on both sides.
Care has been taken to ensure that the mechanical components are also extremely high-quality and are therefore also designed for durability and hard use.
In addition, a tilting joint is included in the scope of delivery.
Great is that included in the scope of delivery is also a bag.
So you can safely transport or store the lamp with all the accessories you might still want to buy without any problems.
Too bad I got it and it's too small :(
"Party we wanted to throw": Frankfurt celebrates against Leverkusen after a great comeback
What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the last twice in a series victoryless Hesse were supposedly on the way to the next Bundesliga bankruptcy.
But then the SGE turned up, shot within a good hour the frustration about a mixed season start from the soul and won furiously with 5:2. "It's madness what the guys have done today," cheered coach Oliver Glasner at DAZN and pronounced a "package praise, to every single one who was there".
At the beginning, it looked like a new damper for the now ninth-placed Frankfurters, who are still below their expectations.
Patrik Schick had brought the Leverkuseners in the lead with 2-0.
What happened next also impressed the SGE coach.
"How the players came back and did a fantastic job," Glasner continued.
I am extremely happy with the performance we have shown and of course with the result.
Defender Christopher Lenz, who was able to stand on the pitch again for the first time since the fourth matchday and his overcome muscle injury, also emphasized the morale of his team-mates.
“I think our mentality is incredibly great,” said the 27-year-old, looking at the result, especially for the spectators.
That was the party we wanted to throw today.
Glasner now wants to keep the focus on the upcoming tasks, but also sees himself well positioned with regard to the personnel situation.
It’s extraordinary that we have all players fit in December that all players are physically in top shape.
It is top work in our medical department, but also the players live highly professional.
Now they want to "go ahead step by step and remain modest" and carry out the tasks until the turn of the year "at this level".
Next on Wednesday in the course of the English week is an away game at Borussia Mönchengladbach (18.30 clock, Sky) on the program.
Grade I get the mail that my package comes back to you due to a mistake on my part.
I tried to call #PRS_ORG# and reroute it, no chance.
Can it be sent directly to me again or do I have to wait until the money has been transferred back and place the order again?
For me it would unfortunately mean that I will not order again because it has already taken a very long time.
Have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
Damper for handball women ahead of quarter-finals against Spain
After the humiliation against Denmark, Germany’s handball women snuck off the floor with hanging heads and empty glances.
At the end of the main round of the World Cup, the DHB selection conceded a bitter defeat in front of 800 spectators in Granollers in the 16:32 (8:13) and must now in the quarter-finals against hosts Spain.
"We were far too scared and had too much respect for the opponent," said national coach Henk Groener.
We have to act differently against Spain.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany finished the main round group III with 8:2 points as second behind the Danes (10:0).
It is a pity that we could not take the flow with us.
This was a bad game for all of us and we have to delete it,” said captain Emily Bölk.
In the fight for the entry into the semi-finals, against the World Cup second of 2019 next Tuesday, a significant increase must come in order to keep alive the tender dream of the first medal since 2007.
Best German thrower in a duel with the three-time Olympic champion Denmark was backroom player Alina Grijseels with six goals.
"We were just not there - neither in the attack, nor in the defense," admitted backspace player Xenia Smits and demanded: "We have to look forward quickly now".
From front to back not at the height
Unlike in the previous five tournament games, the German team with the kick-off was not at the height.
Faults and technical errors in the attack and gaps in the defense were responsible for a quick 4-0 deficit after seven minutes.
Only Torfrau Dinah Eckerle was immediately on operating temperature and prevented worse with some parades.
The first goal was scored by the DHB team after 9:30 minutes, when Grijseels successfully completed a quick counterattack.
However, the expected initial ignition was not.
Against the aggressive coverage of the Danes, the German women could hardly put themselves in the scene - and if they did, they mostly failed because of the strong Althea Reinhardt in the gate of the Scandinavian women.
So the game was early in the 3:10 after 20 minutes, especially since backroom player Mia Zschocke saw red a little later because of a hard foul on her opponent.
She will be allowed to participate in the quarter-finals again.
Only in the final phase of the first half did the DHB selection come into play somewhat better and until the break at least on five goals.
The only hope of catching up after the change was already gone after seven minutes at 9:19.
Again, the Groener protégés sinned in all areas and made it easy for the well-off opponent, who is one of the medal candidates in the final round.
As a result, the German team could no longer work its way up to an increase in performance and went off the stage as a clear loser.

The title states that I work as a vaccination doctor in mobile vaccination teams, in which (so far only) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is vaccinated, especially in nursing homes.
Since these are soon to a large extent ready, it goes on after that partly in vaccination centers for me.
I am happy to answer questions with no time limit on the organizational and human aspects and also medical questions, as long as these are not related to one person (e.g. "I take medication X, this is compatible with the vaccination..").
In my area of responsibility is the education for the vaccination, the indication (person is entitled to a vaccination according to corona vaccination regulations and no reasons that speak against it), the medical documentation and, if necessary, the emergency care in case of allergic reactions (never happened to me before).
The vaccination itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, e.g. medical specialists.
In vaccination teams, however, we often do not have any, but "only" (for God's sake no lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical-technical assistants for vaccine preparation, who can not (may?) carry out vaccinations, so that I also carry out most of the vaccinations there myself.
Serious "Huidler" question: Amberger knows the solution
What is a "hiddler"?
With this dialect word, sent in by an Amberger, in the BR television program "Wir in Bayern" for fierce reflection has been provided.
But unlike on many previous days, the term in the series "Host mi?" was this time unsuspected by the callers.
No, it wasn't a "man who's nervous."
And neither does anyone who “must go fast”.
This, people heard from the TV presenter, is completely wrong.
Whereupon the man from Amberg announced the solution and probably caused astonishment in many Upper Palatinates.
"The skinner," the spectators learned, "is a rag with which someone wipes out the stove."
Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, who has been interviewed by Bavarian television as an expert for years, confirmed this.
With the remark that this is a typical Upper Palatinate term, derived somehow from the more familiar dialect word "Houdern".
This closed a gap in education - probably also for a number of people who have been living in the Amberg area for a long time.
I haven’t been able to buy books in two weeks.
It always comes after the confirmation the following error message: oops - something went wrong - try again later.
I restarted the #PRS_ORG# gel#PRS_ORG#n, connected to the PC, synchronized and repaired.
Nothing helped.
Tire choice in road bike- really so puncture-proof?
This morning I woke up full of energy, because I wanted to train at least a little to prepare my bike tour in the coming week.
Said, done and I started with my road bike, which I bought yesterday on eBay.
The first 40km were also really nice - but then what happened in every city center (this time: Thank you Krefeld!) lurked.
Glass splinters on the track.
Zack, loud hissing and my rear tire didn’t want to take part in the rest of the track at all.
Since I had no real opportunity to get a spare coat and hose due to the day of the week, I had to turn around with a half bad mood and take the first train home.
Was then also not quite so bad in terms of mood, maybe it is also better if I practice again before the bike tour with the tire change.
Now I have a question and I hope you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long distance over several days in front of me, I would be very reluctant to get this problem more often.
Now it was really not bad, because even the old tires from the previous owner (very nice old man, on the day I came to pick up the bike has demolished 120km!) and who had already described them as suboptimal, because he has driven with them for several years on roll.
But if I think about it that I still have to make a tire change when driving after 80-90kms, then I think I am really in a bad mood :D
Now I got into a conversation with an older man at the platform, who asked me in amazement why I didn’t have the Marathon Plus tires; they are supposed to be unflattable.
Now, of course, the whole thing sounds very tempting.
But are they really so unstoppable?
I don't want to spend 40€/tires now, only to be disappointed.
I also wonder: I think I have 25x622 on the road bike at the moment.
Although there are also (apparently?) with the Marathon Plus tires, but the majority is already wider.
Is this a problem?
Or would you advise me on a road bike in general to other tires?
The Schwalbe page seems to my absolute! Lay knowledge rather recommend the Durano DD?
Thanks in advance for the help and greetings!

After the release of our new high-end broadband B 100-6 OHM, it was only a matter of time before our SOLO series would have offspring again.
SOLO 15 is the name of the new offspring and is visually reminiscent of the great role models with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, in this building proposal, a suitably designed foot is included directly to raise the speaker to the correct listening position.
This has no influence on the acoustics and can therefore be adjusted in length according to the circumstances at home.
Due to the principle, the SOLO 15 is very well suited for people in whom the maximum volume plays a rather minor role, but an exceptionally high level is to be achieved in terms of sound.
A 10 cm speaker is simply not able to produce such large sound pressure levels in a virtually unfiltered manner.
However, this does not mean that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, it appears remarkably adult and extremely impressive and accurate for its size.
Tonal, the SOLO 15 was tuned with a slight high-frequency rise.
This is generally common in widebands in order to optimize the excessive bundling of high frequencies.
The SOLO 15 convinces with a very clear and fine sound, precisely oriented to the listening area.
Slightly turned outwards, the high-frequency range can be reduced and thus the sound image can be made warmer.
Thanks to the point sound source, the location of the individual components of a piece of music in the optimal stereo triangle is razor-sharp and amazingly precise.
The reference suspects extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM provide a fine dynamics that its same seeks.
The SOLO 15 not only complements our SOLO series, but extends it in terms of resolution and accuracy.
As with all our kits, it is advisable to think about the final appearance of the speaker at the beginning in order to plan appropriate changes in the construction.
If, for example, you want to veneer the housings, the lowering of the speaker must be adjusted accordingly, because the veneer applies material again.
After all the panels have been cut to size (e.g. in the hardware store), you should first drill an 8 mm hole in the bottom plate in the appropriate place, in order to be able to carry out the cable there later without any problems.
With the aid of a router, the loudspeaker opening in the front now follows, so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can later be used flush.
On the back, this opening should be provided with a 45° chamfer in order to make the opening area of the loudspeaker chassis as large as possible.
The four bolting points of the B 100 - 6 OHM get an interruption in the chamfer, as shown in the picture "Detail chamfer".
Then you start with the actual construction of the box and place one of the two side walls on a flat surface in front of you.
The back wall, the cover, the front and the bottom are then glued onto this.
The three stiffeners should also be used and glued.
The stiffeners themselves can vary in material thickness if necessary, if you want to use finished strips from the hardware store, for example, instead of producing them yourself from 16 mm MDF.
In the next working step, the second side is attached.
Then follow all the plates of the foot, i.e. the two sides, as well as the front.
By means of a suitable circular hole saw or a Forstner drill, the mounting of the openings of the bass reflex tube, as well as the connection clamp on the rear wall is made easier.
Then you use a round milling cutter to round off all edges of the actual box.
The top side of the foot plate can also be rounded off with it.
Subsequently, the base plate is firmly glued to the base of the housing and additionally screwed on with long wooden screws.
This is followed by drawing and pre-drilling (2.5 mm drill) of the screw points of the loudspeaker chassis and the connection terminal.
After the housing has been cleaned of wood dust (aspirate / blow out), you start laying the cable.
The easiest way to do this is through the 35 mm bass reflex opening in the back wall.
You push the entire uncut cable piece by piece through the 8 mm hole in the foot to the terminal opening and let it protrude there about 30 cm.
In the upper part of the case, you lead the cable to the speaker opening and let it also hang out loosely there.
Subsequently, the crossover is prepared and used.
The design plan of the crossover and the corresponding connection plan can be found in the following document: Installation instructions Switch Solo 15.
If the crossover is installed and the connection terminal is screwed, the 8 mm cable opening inside the box is sealed, which is not yet completely closed.
Through the 35 mm BASSREFLEX opening and with some skill, you can drip hot glue on the opening and close it.
Through the opening of the B 100 - 6 OHM and with a small lamp you can check the seal accordingly.
Now follows the damping according to the description.
The B 100 - 6 OHM is then connected and screwed with the appropriate screws.
The polarity plays an important role here, so that the positive line (marked cable) must be soldered to the positive pole of the loudspeaker (larger contact).
Finally, the bass reflex tube is shortened to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the tube) and inserted.
For damping, a mat of the damping material is cut into two parts and distributed loosely in the housing.
The opening around the bass reflex channel should be kept free.
Can I place an order now and have it delivered at the beginning of June?
Hello to all of you,
> finally we can announce that we will host the OSCAST again this year!
> Unfortunately, for well-known reasons, it is not possible for us to get more than four people into the studio, which has meant a higher planning effort and explains the short-term nature of the announcement.
BUT: There will be at least three people on the switch, so we will be following the 2021 Oscars with at least 7 beans in the stream and hopefully thousands of you!
> We do our best to avoid delay or other problems.
But hey, it’s still a pandemic – yet we will do everything we can to make the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
> It will start around 0:30.
Have a cold drink, plan a good meal and get ready for a long but very interesting night.
