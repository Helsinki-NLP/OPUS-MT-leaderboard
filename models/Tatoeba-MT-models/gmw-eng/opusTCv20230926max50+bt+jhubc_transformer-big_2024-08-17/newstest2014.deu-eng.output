Gutach: Even more safety for pedestrians
They are not 100 meters from each other: On Tuesday, the new B 33 pedestrian light at the village car park was put into operation in Gutach - within sight of the older city hall light.
Two plants so close together: Intention or shield burger prank?
This question was clearly answered by Gutach’s mayor yesterday.
"The traffic light in the town hall was installed at that time because it secures the school path," Eckert explained yesterday.
The Kluser traffic lights secure both cyclists and bus passengers and the Bergle residents.
The plant, which was officially put into operation yesterday, is important for the Sulzbachweg/Kirchstra<0xC3><0x9F>e intersection area.
We have the museum, two churches, spa park, the bus stop, a doctor and a bank as well as the traffic flow from the residential area <0xE2><0x80><0xBA>Grub<0xE2><0x80><0xB9>.
"With the high traffic and pedestrian traffic, another traffic light had to be installed to ensure their safety," Eckert said.
This is also confirmed by Peter Arnold from the Offenburg district office.
"According to current measurements, about 12,000 vehicles pass through the municipality of Gutach on the B 33 every day, of which about ten percent are heavy-duty traffic," Arnold emphasizes.
Therefore, the construction of another traffic light is more than necessary: "Safety simply takes precedence here," says Arnold.
A total of four traffic shows were held, a roundabout was also planned, but because of the narrowness in the intersection area Sulzbachweg / Kirchstra<0xC3><0x9F>e discarded again.
According to Arnold, everything was tested before the location of the traffic light poles: "By means of a transporter loaded especially for us with particularly long logs, we tested whether these vehicles can extend from the Sulzbachweg to the B 33 without buckling the traffic light poles."
The traffic light itself, which costs around 15,000 euros, is "the most modern on the market at the moment," Arnold explained.
The system is equipped with coloured LEDs that shine so brightly that the lights of the drivers can be easily seen, for example, even when the sun is low.
And it is also economical: The older lighting systems consume about 100 watts, the new just eight watts.
There are three lighting systems per direction of travel.
Arnold explained the technology of the new system: It is equipped with two radar sensors.
If the pedestrian presses the traffic light button, the upper radar sensor tests the traffic situation.
If the road is clear, immediately comes green for the pedestrian, if not, it takes about 15 seconds.
Another radar sensor checks whether the green phase can be ended for the pedestrian.
"If a group or people with walking disabilities cross the road, the green phase will be extended, so everyone can cross the road safely," Arnold explained.
Of course, the driver has to think as a partner here and observe the road.
This was not the case yesterday: As soon as the traffic light for pedestrians showed green, a luxury vehicle roared through - with bright red.
Josef Winkler has been writing about the needs of his childhood and youth for more than 30 years.
The catastrophes of his Catholic village childhood - the speechlessness, the propensity for raw violence and blunt sexuality, the narrowness and joylessness - the Carinthian poet has described many times.
The Büchner Prize winner is known above all as a prose author, theatre texts are rare in his work.
For his performance "Wetterleuchten auf der Tongenspitze", which can now be seen in the Garage X at St. Peter's Square, Gerhard Fresacher put together a collage of prose texts.
The theatre maker combines elements from the autobiographical novel "Der Leibigene" (1987) with prose miniatures from "Leichnam, seine Familie belauernd" (2003).
On the largely empty stage - an important prop: a crumpled sofa on which is copied and masturbated - the eight-piece ensemble lingers through the text material.
Director Fresacher seems to have little faith in the text.
The 70-minute performance glosses over the original with a wealth of directorial ideas, known from the repertoire of post-dramatic forms of play.
Especially the actresses get involved in the sometimes somewhat questionable scenic implementations.
They are touched hard, with their heads submerged in water, with their evening robes tacked to the wall.
Forced into cellophane or bodice, they stung on dangerously high sticks through the staging, either monologize loudly or lie completely silent on the stage floor.
The text, however, hardly conveys itself in this strenuous way.
The evening has the best moments when singing - the range ranges from Deep Purple to folk songs.
Only towards the end does the over-the-top performance come to rest, and Winkler’s absurd humor flashes up.
A black box in the car?
U.S. road planners are looking for a source of money to repair the decaying highway system, and believe they have found the solution in a small black box that fits in the dashboard of every car.
The devices, which record every kilometer driven and report the information to the authorities, are at the heart of a controversial attempt by Washington and state planning agencies to overhaul the outdated system for financing U.S. roads.
The usually rather boring field of road planning has suddenly sparked an intense debate with colorful alliances.
Libertarians have teamed up with environmental groups and advocate that the government can use the small boxes to record the kilometres driven – and possibly also where they were driven – and then use the information to calculate tax returns.
The Tea Party is horrified.
The American Civil Rights Association (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of privacy concerns.
But while one cannot agree on a course of action in Congress, several states no longer wait.
They are currently looking at how they can switch to a system over the next ten years where drivers pay per mile driven.
Thousands of drivers have already tested the tachographs, some of which are equipped with GPS monitoring.
This is truly a must for our country.
“It’s nothing we’re only going to possibly use,” said Hasan Ikhrata, executive director of Southern California’s Assn. of Governments, which plans to keep a record of miles driven among all California motorists in the state starting in 2025.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
The technology for that is there.
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund, which is funded from taxes that Americans pay at the pump, is broke.
In America, however, not as much is being refuelled as before.
Cars use less gasoline.
The state mineral oil tax of 18.4 cents per gallon (less than 4 eurocents per litre) has not increased for 20 years.
Politicians do not dare to raise the tax even by one cent at high fuel prices.
“Gasoline tax is simply not sustainable,” said Lee Munnich, a traffic law expert at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently equipped 500 cars with tachographs to test a mile-based payment system.
"This is the most sensible alternative in the long term," he said.
Bureaucrats refer to it as a mile-based user fee.
It is not surprising that the idea resonates with urban liberals, because the steering could be used, for example, to influence driving behavior in such a way that congestion and climate-damaging exhaust gases are reduced.
California’s planners are relying on the system to develop strategies to achieve the state’s ambitious, legally-enforced climate change goals.
But Pennsylvania Republican Bill Shuster, chairman of the House Transportation Committee, has also stated that he sees it as the most viable long-term alternative.
The free marketers of the Reason Foundation are also impressed by the idea of having drivers pay after a distance has been covered.
"This is not a tax that disappears into a black hole," explains Adrian Moore, Vice President of Policy at Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
The movement is also backed by two former U.S. transport ministers who, in a 2011 report, called on Congress to move toward mile-based billing.
Last year, the U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project that would have included 10,000 cars.
But the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the move, responding to the concerns of members of parliament from rural areas who represent people who often have to travel many miles on their way to work or to the city on a daily basis.
Nevertheless, several states and major cities are moving in this direction on their own.
The most dedicated is Oregon, which is currently recruiting 5,000 drivers for the country’s largest experiment.
These drivers will soon pay the mileage fees to the state instead of the mineral oil tax.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City is considering this as well.
Illinois is testing it to a limited extent with trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes the transportation ministries of 17 states on the East Coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Florida), is currently exploring how to introduce the change.
The concept is not a universal hit.
In Nevada, where 50 volunteers were recently equipped with the devices, motorists were skeptical of the idea that the government could track any of its movements.
“Concerns about Big Brother and things like that were a big problem,” said Alauddin Khan, head of strategy and results management at the Nevada Department of Transportation.
People didn't want it.
When the test began, the ACLU of Nevada warned on its website: “It would be relatively easy to turn the tachographs into full-blown surveillance devices.”
There is no need to build a gigantic, bulky technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to collect data about individuals’ daily movements.
Nevada is one of a number of states that are now looking for affordable technology that allows the state to track the miles driven, but not exactly when and where.
So, according to Khan, the public would also be calmer.
The hunt for this technology has led some authorities to a small startup called True Mileage in California.
The company did not originally start to help states tax motorists.
Rather, their goal was to gain a foothold in an emerging car insurance market where drivers are expected to pay based on miles driven.
But the devices she tested are also interesting for the road planners, because they do not work with GPS and only provide limited information, which are regularly uploaded by modem.
“People are more willing to participate if their speed and locations are not recorded,” said Ryan Morrison, CEO of True Mileage.
Major mistakes have been made in some of these public pilot programmes.
There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to do this.
In Oregon, planners are experimenting with giving motorists a range of choices.
You can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they don’t choose a device at all and instead pay a flat fee based on the average miles driven by all residents of the state.
Other agencies hope to be able to sell the concept of a suspicious public by equipping the devices with more features than fewer.
In New York City, traffic officials want to develop a device for taxation that can also be used to pay parking fees, pay insurance only for kilometres driven and collect speed data from other vehicles in real time, thanks to which drivers can avoid congestion.
“Drivers would be motivated to participate by the added value of the benefits offered by the system,” according to a planning document from the city.
However, some traffic planners wonder if all the talk about paying per mile isn’t just a huge distraction.
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the San Francisco Bay area, officials said Congress could solve the problem of the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund simply by raising the fuel tax.
An additional one-time fee or an annual tax could be imposed on drivers with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that consume little fuel, so that they also pay a fair share.
"There is no reason for surgery if an aspirin is sufficient," said Randy Rentschler, the Commission's Head of Legislation and Public Affairs.
When we do that, hundreds of millions of motorists worry about their privacy and numerous other things.
Koenigsfeld: Small team beats itself bravely
The volunteer fire brigade mastered its autumn main test despite a lack of personnel with flying colors.
Only 11 men took part in the exercise.
Department commander Hans Kammerer had chosen the Feder estate in Burgberger Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e in his exercise assumption.
There, a short circuit is said to have been created during sawing.
As a result of the fire and smoke development, two people were injured, but one of them was still able to send an emergency call.
After Hans Kammerer’s first examination of the situation, two respirators of the Wehr prepared to enter the building.
After a short time, it was possible to find the first person and guide them out into the open.
The second person had to be carried.
This was not so easy, as even a narrow staircase had to be overcome.
The building, a workshop with integrated stables for two horses, was not easy to secure.
There was a lot of wood and straw bales in it.
Furthermore, there were also electric machines for woodworking.
The first extinguishing attack was carried out via the tank in the vehicle.
A further line was carried out via an overhead hydrant at a distance of about 100 meters.
Now, three fire-fighting attacks have been carried out.
A hollow jet tube was also used in the building.
During the exercise, Hans Kammerer also wanted to show what can be done with little available personnel.
In the event of an emergency, support is provided via the Königsfeld day-care group.
The commander was satisfied with the course of the exercise.
Networking of universities and companies is important
During his visit to the district of Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald, President of the State Parliament Guido Wolf was also informed in Titisee-Neustadt about where the workforce of tomorrow comes from.
At the Förderzentrum Hochschwarzwald, he investigated this important question together with the managing directors of the vocational schools as well as the district high school and the chairmen of the parents’ advisory board.
"Education is an important location factor," underlined Claudia Stehle, Director of the Hans-Thoma-Schule, who presented the networked school project Bildungszentrum Hochschwarzwald.
Wolf was impressed by the model projects for training.
Since 2011 there has been a successful cooperation between the Förderzentrum, Kreisgymnasium and Berufsschulzentrum in the W<0xC3><0xA4>lderstadt.
He also praised the family friendliness in the county.
"It is important to have an eye not only on the family phase, but also on the care of relatives due to demographic change," Wolf explained.
He also said that more and more employees were caring for and caring for their relatives.
"Without the support of employers, the resulting burden on employees can lead to an end to the employment relationship," Wolf said.
But no one can afford to lose qualified workers, he said.
Another particularly important factor is the networking of universities and companies.
“Those who have already learned about the advantages of the region during their studies often retain the regional economy with their acquired knowledge and skills, which contributes to the strengthening of the region,” said the President of the state parliament.
Because only if sufficient training places were offered, the need for skilled workers could also be met.
In his opinion, the district's location advantage is its advantageous location in the southwest of Germany, in the immediate vicinity of France and Switzerland.
In addition, on his train journey from Titisee-Neustadt to Freiburg, he experienced the efforts already made for the expansion of local public transport.
"Keep stubborn and make sure that the public transport is better," he explained to the local politicians present.
Enjoy an enjoyable afternoon with music
For 15 years, the Kaul family has been inviting Dietinger seniors to coffee, cake and then a vesper.
In the past, the older citizens were entertained in the rest area.
In the meantime, this afternoon will take place in the nursing home St. Josef.
The residents were looking forward to the delicious cakes and pies.
Later there was sausage salad.
Silvia Kimmich-Bantle and her father Karl Kimmich entertained with common melodies.
The more than 100-year-old natural stone wall as the front demarcation of the old schoolyard to Kirchstra<0xC3><0x9F>e before the renovation is to be placed again on the renovation cost plan of the city of Br<0xC3><0xA4>unlingen.
In the days before the Kilbig, during the first work on the renovation of the front school yard, a small angle wall was installed to stabilise and relieve static pressure on the more than one hundred-year-old natural stone wall with balustrade.
According to Alexander Misok from the Br<0xC3><0xA4>unlinger Stadtbauamt, the next step is to include the Landesdenkmalamt in the planning and to create a renovation concept for the old wall.
Thereafter, a cost calculation is to be carried out by experts, which is then to be put on the table for the municipal council to decide and determine the further procedure.
A decision on this is expected to be made as early as next year.
After the refurbishment, paving and tree planting of the old school courtyard within the two side wings of the school built in 1912, the boundary wall in need of refurbishment must be renovated from scratch and placed on a new substructure in the foreseeable future.
The historic, one hundred-year-old demarcation wall from the old school yard to Kirchstra<0xC3><0x9F>e, is mainly damaged by water and frost, as there is no drainage, in need of refurbishment and has a tendency to bend forward.
Deep cracks in individual stones testify to weather damage, but the wall is currently not at risk of collapse.
A stable wall is a prerequisite for a schoolyard used by students, which has been done by the current fortification work.
Originally, the schoolyard renovation was even planned in the years 2008/2009, but high unscheduled expenses brought a postponement.
An important word in the historical renovation of the school walls, which has even been used for filming, will be spoken by the National Monument Office.
If requirements come from this side, then the city of Br<0xC3><0xA4>unlingen hopes for subsidies from the conservationists.
The pupils of the Br<0xC3><0xA4>unlingen elementary school, which are now being taught again in a well-renovated old school building with a new auditorium, can soon use the old school yard.
<0xC3><0x96>zdemir wants to receive jazz education in Stuttgart
Cem <0xC3><0x96>zdemir, Federal Chairman of the Greens, has now also taken part in the ongoing discussions about the future of music academies in Baden-Württemberg.
"I think it is wrong to give up holistic training at the Stuttgart Musikhochschule," <0xC3><0x96>zdemir told the "Stuttgarter Nachrichten".
Jazz and classical music belong together at the jazz location Stuttgart.
Thus, <0xC3><0x96>zdemir, who is in Stuttgart as a favorite for a direct mandate in the federal election on September 22, contradicts the Green-Red state government.
On the basis of an expert study, this is pushing for a reorganization of the five music academies in Baden-Württemberg.
After that, the course of study Jazz and Pop will be transferred from the Musikhochschule Stuttgart to the Musikhochschule Mannheim.
US border: 'super-tunnel' discovered for drug smuggling
On the border between Mexico and the US, investigators have discovered and shut down a "super tunnel" for drug smuggling.
The more than 500-meter tube between Tijuana and San Diego was equipped with electricity, railroad tracks, and a ventilation system.
Three suspects were arrested, eight tons of marijuana and almost 150 kilograms of cocaine were confiscated.
The tunnel had not yet been put into use.
“These cartels are stupid if they think they can dig themselves out under the radar,” Laura Duffy, the U.S. District Attorney for Southern California, told a news conference outside a warehouse in San Diego, where one end of the tunnel had been discovered.
Speaking to the drug gangs, Duffy assured: “If you continue to build such tunnels and try to use them, we are determined to make that a huge waste of your dirty money.”
Both the US authorities and the Mexican security forces are in a constant battle against the drug cartels.
Since 2006, more than 77,000 people have been killed in Mexico in connection with drug-related crime.
Designed by experts
Due to the complex equipment of the tunnel, the investigators assume that it was designed by architects and engineers and that the construction took about a year.
The track system was equipped in such a way that electrically operated cars could be used there.
On the Mexican side, access is in a building 80 meters from the border.
According to authorities, a ladder 20 meters into the depth leads to the actual tunnel entrance.
The tunnel has a cross-section of 1.20 meters height and 90 centimeters width.
It would also have been suitable to promote illegal immigration to the United States.
Two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine discovery.
The third, a Mexican, was caught for the marijuana seized.
All three of them face a maximum sentence of life imprisonment, officials said.
Eight such tunnels have been discovered since 2006, according to the press conference in San Diego.
This is the first time cocaine has been found in a tunnel.
Cocaine is usually smuggled in smaller quantities, not through tunnels.
This shows the “desperation” of the drug gangs, whose traditional routes have since been cut off, said Bill Sherman of the drug investigation DEA in San Diego.
They would do anything to get to the United States.
No details were given about the detainees, at least one of whom was Mexican, it said.
They must expect prison sentences of up to ten years.
2014 will be Geisinger Festjahr
The anniversary of the city of Geisingen on the occasion of the 1250.
The return of the first documentary mention is drawing ever closer.
When the year ends in a good eight weeks, the anniversary year is coming up.
Geisingen and Kirchen-Hausen were first mentioned together in 794.
In churches, a document was made in which both places are mentioned.
On March 15th there is supposed to be an official prelude to the anniversary year, and since Geisingen currently has no hall, this prelude event takes place in the place where 1250 years ago both were first mentioned, in church houses.
As part of the anniversary, several events are planned both in Geisingen and in Kirchen-Hausen.
Kirchen-Hausen will host the 1250 in July on a festive weekend from 18 to 20 July.
Celebrating return.
On Friday with a ceremony, on Saturday and Sunday with a party around the Kirchtalhalle.
On this festival weekend there is also the Kirchen-Hausener Kirchenfest.
Stadtmusikdirektor Rudolf Barth has written a commissioned composition for the city on the occasion of the anniversary, which will be performed on three dates.
On 21 June together with the solstice celebration of the Schwarzwaldverein, on 12 July in the arena with fireworks and on 13 December as the first concert of the city music in the new festival hall.
This will be finished and inaugurated in the anniversary year, the official date is on the last weekend of September, on 27 and 28 September.
On the occasion of the Geising city anniversary, a new chronicle will also be released.
"But it should become a chronicle not only of Geisingen itself, but a printed work about today's Geisingen, which consists of Geisingen, Kirchen-Hausen, Leipferdingen, Aulfingen and Gutmadingen," said Mayor Walter Hengstler.
And today’s Geisingen also celebrates its birthday in 2014; in 1974, today’s raumschaft was completed with the incorporations.
The new chronicle will then be presented on November 21 or 22 in the new Festhalle in Geisingen.
2014 is also another year with many anniversaries.
The Strohglonki Fools’ Guild begins on 8 February with a customs evening on the occasion of its 60th anniversary, the Harmonie Gutmadingen turns 90 years old and has the festive banquet on 29 March and then celebrates the District Music Festival from 1 to 4 May.
The Altenwerk Leipferdingen turns 40 years old, the Geising School has been at the new location for 50 years and celebrates this on May 10, the Musikverein Polyhymnia Leipferdingen turns 150 years old and celebrates this as part of the Brunnenfest from July 4 to 7.
The town of Geisingen was first mentioned in a deed of donation, which is owned by the monastery of St. Gallen, in 764.
The document was made in churches (houses), which was then the courthouse.
Both communities are mentioned in the same document.
The reason to celebrate this 1250-year-old in 2014 accordingly, in addition, the municipal reform is also 40 years back.
Council takes aim at track systems
Should the railway crossing "Am Hirschen" be extensively rebuilt in order to increase traffic safety?
Yes, the municipal councils have decided.
Schiltach has to take 220,000 euros in hand for this.
Deutsche Bahn plans to improve the Kinzigtal railway line next year.
In particular, the safety at level crossings should be increased - regularly there are collisions of trains with other vehicles nationwide.
If the municipalities agree to the reconstruction measures, they must contribute a third of the costs, the rest are shared by the railways and the federal government.
Schiltach's master builder Roland Grie<0xC3><0x9F>haber explained the special features of the Bah crossing "Am Hirschen" to the municipal council.
There, the city plans to build a bulge at the level of the tunnel mouth west of the railway tracks.
Larger vehicles, such as those transporting long logs, could also be parked there on oncoming traffic without having to block the tracks.
Grie<0xC3><0x9F>haber therefore proposed to construct a necessary retaining wall in such a way that the city could widen the adjoining road in due course to ensure a smooth flow of traffic.
This was controversially discussed in the municipal council, as some councils doubted the necessity of a road distribution: Thomas Kipp, with his statement, summed up the mood of the critics: "Do we have to take so much money in our hands because of so few vehicles?"
Mayor Thomas Haas contradicted: The railway crossing "Hirschen" is regularly used for long wood transports.
Even wood from the "Kuhbach" area is partly transported over this route, because the vehicles up to 20 meters long could not use the route at the H<0xC3><0xA4>berlesbrücke, because they could not turn into the main road there.
In addition, the route serves as a diversion for those vehicles that are not allowed to use the tunnel when the main road is closed, Haas argued.
Since it is foreseeable that Kirchberg and Schlossberg tunnels would have to be rebuilt and renovated, as is currently the case in Wolfach, the railway crossing "Am "Hirschen" could also be an important traffic significance for a longer period of time.
The councils agreed to investigate the costs of the proposed widening of the road.
Nevertheless, the majority agreed to the conversion of the railway crossing with the proviso that the required retaining wall be built in such a way that the city could expand the subsequent road towards "Bahnhofstra<0xC3><0x9F>e" to around 5.5 meters, if necessary, for meeting traffic.
The conversion of the railway crossing at the tannery Trautwein, on the other hand, could lead to a completely different problem, which concerns the access to the strongly rising "Geroltzh<0xC3><0xA4>user Weg".
The administration had had the plans for the conversion of the railway examined by the engineering firm Breinlinger, because it had doubts about whether the planned connection of the Geroltzh<0xC3><0xA4>user Weg would then be possible without further ado.
The investigation concluded that it could not be ruled out that the slope of the road could lead to longer vehicles sitting on it.
The responsibility for this, in turn, lies with the city as a road construction load carrier.
The restructuring could therefore lead to liability disputes.
Since both the wood removal and the turning worked in the current state of expansion, one should not agree to the conversion of the level crossing, Haas argued.
Also at this point, the risk of a collision of the train with a vehicle standing on the transition is significantly lower than at the other level crossings, because the stop point Mitte is located directly next to it, to which there is a good visual connection.
Even trains from the main station would have to be slowed down at this point to such an extent that no collision would be imminent.
The majority of the approval for the conversion of this level crossing was denied, since the city of Schiltach would have to "bath out" the problem with mounted vehicles, according to the councils, since the railway can withdraw from responsibility after completion of the construction work.
The committee considers the conversions at the railway crossings "Vor Heubach" and "Vor Kuhbach" to be unproblematic, for which crossing agreements have already been made with the railway.
ESA Decides on Major Space Missions: Missions for Billions
Distant planets, gravitational waves or black holes – experts from the European Space Agency now have to agree on two major projects that they want to launch in the next few years.
There were 30 proposals to choose from, five are still in the race.
Far Worlds.
Astronomers have already found more than 1,000 planets near other stars.
Whether there is life on at least some of them, no one knows.
The choice is difficult: Should one search for gravitational waves?
Or would you rather explore the origin of the cosmos?
Or searching for Earth-like planets and perhaps discovering extraterrestrial life with them?
These questions are being asked by those responsible for the European Space Agency (ESA).
For their "Cosmic Vision" programme, they are looking for ideas for two major space projects that will decisively advance research.
The budget for such "L-Missions" is about one billion euros each.
The launch is expected to be in 2028 and 2034.
At the beginning of September, the elite of European space research met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions.
Thirty ideas were discussed, five of which have now been shortlisted.
Numerous committees are examining the proposals, and are following up with the researchers.
In the next few days, a final decision will be made by the Scientific Programme Committee.
ESA has selected a total of four major questions to which the missions of the "Cosmic Vision" programme initiated in 2007 should find answers.
What are the conditions for the formation of planets and life?
The exact processes involved in the formation of stars from large gas clouds - and thus also the formation of planets orbiting these stars - are still in the proverbial darkness.
A large infrared telescope in space could penetrate this darkness.
And if a star has planets, under what circumstances can life arise there?
In order to answer this question, the space telescope "Cheops" is to be launched in 2017, with which 500 already known planetary systems in our immediate vicinity will be examined in more detail.
However, the possibilities are limited, Cheops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million euros.
Using larger instruments, astronomers could image Earth-like planets and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres, looking for "biomarkers": gases that are considered to indicate biological activity.
How does the solar system work?
This question, too, should ultimately provide information about the prerequisites for the emergence of life.
An important role is played by the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field and the particle radiation emanating from it with the planetary system.
In our solar system, these processes can be studied by way of example.
With the "Solar Orbiter", esa has already approved a mission of the M-Class (where the budget is about half a billion euros) for this question.
The probe is scheduled to launch in 2017 and closely observe the surface and activity of the Sun.
Jupiter and its moons are also of great interest to the researchers.
They want to find out what role the giant planet played in the development of the solar system.
For this purpose, the ESA provides the first of the three L-Missions of the "Cosmic Vision" program.
The spacecraft "Juice" (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) is expected to begin its journey in 2022.
Eight years later, it reaches Jupiter to study the planet’s atmosphere and the icy moons of Europa, Callisto and Ganymede.
What are the basic physical laws of the universe?
The universe offers many possibilities to study matter under extreme conditions and thus to investigate whether the laws of nature known to us are still valid there.
Perhaps there are also deviations that could show physicists the way to a new theory under whose roof all known laws of nature can be united.
How did the universe come into existence and what does it consist of?
13.7 billion years ago, our cosmos was created by the Big Bang.
In addition to the matter we are familiar with, which consists of stars, planets and living beings like us, there is dark matter, whose gravity holds galaxies and galaxy clusters together, and dark energy, through whose action the expansion of the universe accelerates.
So far, the researchers do not know which physical laws were valid in the first fractions of a second of the Big Bang, nor what dark matter and dark energy consist of.
With "Euclid", ESA has already approved an M-Mission, whose launch is scheduled for 2020.
With a special telescope, the probe will study the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time in the entire sky, thus enabling conclusions to be drawn about the nature of dark matter and dark energy.
Who could make the race
Of the 30 proposals, only two will remain at the end of the selection process.
According to many experts, E-Lisa, a sophisticated concept for detecting gravitational waves, has the best chances of being approved as an L-mission.
Physicists understand this to mean changes in the structure of space-time that Albert Einstein predicted almost 100 years ago.
They have not been proven to date.
Elisa could do that, the scientists behind the project hope.
The mission envisions a detector consisting of two or three probes that will be stationed in space.
It could also detect gravitational waves that formed during the Big Bang, in contrast to plants on Earth, and thus provide new insights into the origin of the cosmos.
Four more proposals compete for the second L mission: a large X-ray telescope called "Athena", which is to explore black holes, "Icy Planets", another mission to the outer planets of the solar system, "Prism", a mission to measure the cosmic background radiation, and the "Exoplanet Finder", which is to track down and examine Earth-like planets.
Proposals for sample retransport from Mars, for the exploration of the Moon, Venus and asteroids, as well as for solar physics, have already been eliminated.
Snowden ready to “cooperate” with Germany on US surveillance
Edward Snowden, the US intelligence whistleblower, has stated that he is ready to travel to Berlin and testify before the German Bundestag if the US National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander do not provide answers about their activities.
German MP Hans-Christian Ströbele met with Snowden on Thursday in Russia, where he was granted asylum to discuss the statement with him in Germany.
In a letter from Snowden, presented to the media in Berlin on Friday by Ströbele, he writes: “Even though the outcome of my efforts has been demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat dissent as a breach of faith and attempts to criminalize political expression with a criminal threat where no defense is possible.”
Telling the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Snowden writes that he is convinced that the support of the international community can convince the American government to drop the charges against him.
The charges brought by the U.S. Department of Justice include espionage and theft of state property.
German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich told Zeit Online: “If Mr. Snowden is willing to talk to German representatives, then we will find ways to make that happen.”
Relations between the US and Germany have been strained by claims that the NSA has tapped Chancellor Angela Merkel’s cell phone.
Thomas Oppermann, the deputy who heads the parliamentary committee responsible for intelligence, said that the opportunity to listen to Snowden as a witness should be seized if possible, “without endangering him and completely ruining relations with the United States.”
Ströbele, a Green MP, posted a picture of himself and Snowden in his Twitter feed.
He was accompanied by two German journalists during his visit to Russia.
Ströbele explained that, according to former NSA employee Snowden’s lawyer, he could not return to Russia if he left the country.
If Snowden says in Germany, then he needs an assurance that he is "safe" there, according to the deputy.
Snowden said in his letter that he was facing a “serious and ongoing” campaign of persecution that had driven him out of his home country.
However, he was touched by the worldwide reaction to "my act of political expression".
Citizens around the world, as well as high-ranking politicians – including in the United States – have described the revelations about an uncontrolled system of comprehensive surveillance as a merit to the general public.
In his letter, Snowden offers the German authorities an offer of cooperation "when the difficulties surrounding the humanitarian situation have been resolved".
Frontier Airlines charges for carry-on baggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to $100 from passengers who want to stow carry-on baggage on their flight.
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to $100 for a piece of carry-on baggage and $2 for coffee or lemonade, even though the announcement on Wednesday said passengers would be allowed to keep the entire can.
The new fee applies to hand luggage in the overhead compartment, small bags under the seat are still free of charge.
Frontier said it would charge $25 if the fee was paid in advance, and $100 for travelers who paid at the gate.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O’Malley said the $100 fee was aimed at moving travelers to take care of the payment in advance.
"We don't want to calculate this sum," she said.
Airlines began charging fees in 2008 for the first and second piece of checked baggage.
Passengers who tried to get around them have therefore stuffed as much as possible into hand luggage, which means that the luggage compartments above the seat are often overcrowded.
Fees are a way to encourage passengers to take less on board.
O'Malley said the new fee isn't really about making money.
These are the most loyal customers of Frontier, who have clearly expressed that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find space in the compartment above the seat.
Passengers who purchase their tickets on the airline’s website do not have to pay.
This means that a passenger may be allowed to take one piece of luggage for free at Frontier’s gate, but the next person will have to pay $100 for a comparable piece of luggage.
O’Malley said Frontier’s website and check-in procedures would be changed so that passengers would be informed of the fee before coming to the gate.
Frontier’s new carry-on baggage fee will not take effect until summer, and there is no exact date yet.
Passengers often complain about baggage surcharges and other charges, but airlines are happy to take advantage of them.
They argue that transporting the luggage should cost money and passengers should pay for this service if they want it.
Many on Wall Street see the new baggage fees as a sign that airlines are making enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
Most, however, have so far left the fingers of charges for carry-on baggage.
Spirit Airlines Inc. was the first to charge for carry-on baggage three years ago, followed by Allegiant Air, also a low-cost airline.
The only other airline with such a fee is the Hungarian Wizz Air, said airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who is closely monitoring the additional fees.
He estimated in a December 2011 report that Spirit’s carry-on baggage fee would bring in $50 million annually.
Sorensen, who previously held a leadership position at Midwest Airlines, recently flew with Spirit and was curious about what he would expect at the gate if passengers were confronted with the company’s unusual carry-on baggage fee.
“The boarding process was one of the smoothest I’ve seen in my aviation career,” he said.
I expected to see teeth grinding and palpable discussions at the gate.
"The plane was full," he explained, "and the boarding was smooth."
Frontier also follows Spirit on the $2 charged for coffee, tea, soda, or juice.
The company explained that passengers who bought lemonade or juice would be allowed to keep the whole can and refill coffee for free.
Water is still free.
US Airways briefly attempted to charge money for soft drinks in 2008, but reversed it seven months later after passengers complained and no other major company had followed suit.
Frontier’s move to charge for carry-on baggage charges if passengers don’t buy directly from the airline is the latest initiative to direct customers to their own website.
Airlines pay online travel agencies like Orbitz $10 to $25 per ticket sold.
This provides all companies with an incentive to encourage passengers to buy directly from them instead of through an online travel agency.
Frontier, however, has gone the farthest in this area.
In September, the company began to award only half as many frequent flyer miles when booking through an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, the miles were reduced to 25 percent of the flight distance.
Therefore, a flight with Frontier over 1000 miles booked with a third-party service earns customers only 250 miles.
Passengers can also reserve seats only when making a direct purchase on Frontier’s website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base at its Denver headquarters, but the business is shrinking and the company is losing money.
Revenue fell 9 percent and flight capacity shrank just under 13 percent in the first quarter, as reported in the financial report released Wednesday by parent company Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic has been trying to get Frontier’s finances under control as part of the company’s sale.
Proverbs come from the Bible
About 40 women attended the last women’s breakfast this year in the Protestant parish of Bisingen.
The theme of the day in the parish hall were "Proverbs from the Bible" and "Speech from the Middle Ages".
Zita Köhler, the chairman of the parish council, addressed the biblical proverbs in a lecture after breakfast.
“Proverbs contain life-wisdom, precepts, or warnings,” she explained.
She compared several proverbs with the corresponding Bible passages and explained the meaning.
She spoke of sayings such as, “Let the wooden eye be watchful, like scales falling from the eyes, casting an eye on someone whom the Lord gives to his own in sleep, washing his hands in innocence.”
On several occasions, the speaker had her listeners also advise what proverb it was.
The parish councillor Christel Dehner took on the idioms from the Middle Ages: All good things are three, make blue, make something up.
She explained the meaning and origin of the idioms, which she called "bridges into the past."
Finally, a raffle was raffled.
The prizes were laid on a table and humorously described before being handed over to the winners.
Among the visitors of the breakfast round also mixed mayoral candidate Roman Waizenegger.
Learning instead of the unemployed: pilot project for unskilled workers in tourism
A pilot project for the tourism industry is being launched today at the Mecklenburg Lake District.
Under the leadership of the Federal Employment Agency, 49 women and men who are already working as unskilled workers in the industry are to be qualified as specialists for hotels and restaurants over three winters.
"What is new is that the six-month courses end with degrees," said Carmen Wiechert of the employment agency Neubrandenburg.
The benefits were manifold: the participants would not be unemployed, the companies would receive trained specialists who were increasingly lacking in hotels and restaurants, and the agency would not have to finance unemployment.
The Chamber of Industry and Commerce in Neubrandenburg and the German Hotel and Restaurant Association (Dehoga) Mecklenburg-Vorpommern are also involved in the project.
NSA says it’s an “internal mistake” and not hackers to blame for website crash
The shadowy National Security Agency said late Friday that a bug crippled its public website for several hours and not hackers, as claimed online.
"NSA.gov was unavailable for several hours tonight because of an internal error during a planned update," the spy agency said in an emailed message.
The problem will be resolved this evening.
The claim that the failure was caused by a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack is not true.
In the early hours of the evening, online server trackers had noticed that the NSA website was down for at least six hours and that it still isn’t for some users.
Earlier, a spokesman for the NSA told ABC News that the agency’s sensitive internal network was “in no way” compromised.
Secret information is not in danger, the spokesman said.
At least one group of hacktivists claimed to have crippled the NSA website with a DDoS attack.
In such attacks, the target website is flooded with page views until the servers are overloaded and the website collapses.
The cybertactics are relatively simple and the attacks do not serve to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The formerly super-secret NSA, whose nickname was No Such Agency, is now in the public eye, facing sharp criticism after revelations about its extensive domestic and foreign surveillance program in recent months — a result of the secret NSA data stolen and published by disillusioned former NSA employee Edward Snowden.
The growing intelligence controversy fueled initial speculation that the incident today was the result of a targeted cyper operation.
The number of people without jobs dropped slightly in October from 22 to 1,307.
Although the rate was 3.1 percent better than last year and also better than in September, “we had hoped for more,” says Monika Felder-Bauer, deputy head of the agency for work in Sonthofen.
Because so far, numerous companies have reacted cautiously to settings.
According to Felder-Bauer, one reason for this is: "We hardly have any skilled workers in the trades, in the healthcare sector and in the care of the elderly."
Due to the season, vacancies for staff in the hotel and restaurant industry have been open again since September.
In mid-December, the winter season begins there.

Bombardier Profit Losses After Decline in Delivery and Orders
Canadian aircraft and rail manufacturer Bombardier Inc reported a 15 percent decline in net profit on Thursday after coming under pressure from declining orders and aircraft deliveries in the third quarter, as well as contract problems in the rail business.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, also did not release flight test data for its brand new CSeries aircraft and did not provide any new information on whether the aircraft could go into commercial use next September according to the ambitious schedule.
The maiden flight of the test aircraft a month and a half ago was followed by only three further take-offs, which makes it seem questionable whether the test phase is going as planned.
The results fell short of forecasts and led to a price drop of over eight percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at National Bank Financial, lowered his valuation on Thursday from “outperform” to “sector perform” in view of the stock’s limited price potential over the next one to two quarters.
"Although weaker aircraft delivery figures were widely expected, we are clearly disappointed by the development of margins in the transport sector," Doerksen said in a customer letter.
We believe Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries as the test program for the aircraft progresses.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more skeptical of the program.
Bombardier hopes the CSeries aircraft lineup will catapult the company into the lower market segment currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was unveiled to the public in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delays.
But so far, binding orders for the CSeries at 177 have been moderate as potential buyers wait for the results of flight tests to see if the company’s claims about fuel efficiency and cost-saving potential of the new jet airliner are true.
There are currently a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies.
Pierre Beaudoin, chairman of the board, is confident that Bombardier will meet its target of 300 binding orders at the start of commercial use of the jet.
The company management also assured analysts and the media on Thursday that the program was on schedule.
"The test aircraft did not stay on the ground longer than expected," Beaudoin said at a conference call, adding that ground tests and software updates had been scheduled during the aircraft's service life.
Every manufacturer plans differently.
We decided to take a first flight and then attach a revision period, which we did.
This happens throughout the flight program.
The second of five test aircraft is expected to take off in the next few weeks, the remaining shortly after, it said from the company side.
Still, analysts remain skeptical as to whether twelve months after the maiden flight, the first customer can commission a CSeries aircraft.
Bombardier said it is reviewing the commissioning plan (EIS) and will update it in the coming months.
“The slow progress of the flight test – even though it seems to be in line with Bombardier’s internal planning – reinforces our view that commissioning will be postponed to the first quarter of 2015,” Doerksen said.
In the third quarter ended September 30, Bombardier’s net income fell to $147 million or 8 cents per share from $172 million or 9 cents per share the year before.
Adjusted earnings per share remains unchanged at 9 cents.
Sales fell slightly, falling from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.
Analysts had expected earnings of 10 cents per share and sales of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world’s fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer says it delivered 45 aircraft this quarter, down from 57 last year.
Net orders dropped from 83 aircraft to 26.
The order backlog in the aerospace division was $32.9 billion on September 30, unchanged from December 31.
"In the aerospace sector, the results were in line with our targets, but the low order intake and overall market conditions were disappointing," said Beaudoin.
Revenue in the aerospace industry fell 13 percent to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world’s largest rail manufacturer, announced that sales in this segment have increased by almost 11 percent to $2.1 billion.
The order backlog in the transport division was $32.6 billion on September 30, slightly up from December 31.
The profit margin in the transport sector was affected by settlement problems in some large contracts.
According to management, there will be new requirements for the fourth quarter.
In the afternoon trading on Thursday, Bombardier stock fell 8.5 percent and stood at 4.83 Canadian dollars, after it was also announced that Google CFO Patrick Pichette will move to the board.
Brazil’s Embraer SA, the world’s third-largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and Bombardier’s closest rival, reported a 10 percent decline in quarterly earnings on Thursday.
USA: Shooting at Los Angeles airport
An unknown person fired shots on Friday morning (local time) at LAX airport.
While the airport management announced via the short message service Twitter that the shooter is in custody, the "Los Angeles Times reported that the man is dead.
A security guard was also killed.
The media also reported that several people were injured.
U.S. President Barack Obama is constantly being informed about the situation, said White House spokesman Jay Carney.
Eyewitnesses said they had seen a gunman with a rifle in one of the departure halls, according to several media reports.
A traveler told CNN that many people were panicking and looking for shelter.
Travellers would scream and children would cry.
Among those waiting, panic had broken out, many had hidden behind chairs for fear.
He heard two shots, a traveler told the Los Angeles Times.
A TSA security officer suffered a gunshot wound to the foot.
The scene was “like in a movie.”
After that, he was taken to a security area himself, the man reported.
The shots are said to have fallen near a security control area.
Airport building evacuated
Television images showed numerous ambulances and police cars driving in front of a terminal.
Hundreds of people were evacuated from the building.
Users posted photos on Twitter of a special operations squad and a gun lying on the ground.
As the airport management announced via Twitter, the incident began at 9.30 am (local time).
The access roads were closed, causing long backlogs, according to CNN.
Until landing, air traffic had been temporarily suspended, it said.
However, several planes were also observed on CNN at the launch.
Terminal 3 is mainly served by smaller U.S. airlines.
Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) is one of the largest airports in the United States.
Cocaine-dependent lawyer who warned drug lord against police investigation must go to jail
Basharat Ditta, 42, passed on information to underworld size Neil Scarborough
The lawyer was afraid his secret drug addiction could come to light
He was sentenced to three years in prison by Liverpool's Crown Court
A well-known criminal lawyer who warned a drug lord about a major police investigation because he was afraid his secret drug addiction could be exposed was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, provided underworld star Neil Scarborough with sensitive information about investigations into his drug-trafficking activities after being compromised by his own cocaine addiction.
The lawyer, nicknamed "Bash" by criminals, was arrested in his home in 2011 after police oversaw Scarborough, whom he had represented in a previous drug case.
Officials watched Scarborough (32) deliver three bags of cocaine at the lawyer's home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was with colleagues at a barroom dinner.
The investigation revealed that Ditta regularly used Class A drugs after tests found traces of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet, and on credit cards.
Over a period of eight months between January and August 2011, he attempted to obtain unauthorized information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners.
All four suspects were then monitored by the police as part of a major investigation into the heroin and cocaine trade in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
Together with 32 other people, they were later arrested after police secured <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million worth of heroin and cocaine and <0xC2><0xA3>200,000 worth of cash in a series of house searches.
Ditta, 42, gave information to the criminals because he feared that his drug addiction could become public.
Today, Ditta, who works for the firm Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn, was found guilty and convicted at Liverpool’s Crown Court after a three-week trial on two counts of obstruction of justice.
He admitted possession of cocaine in an earlier interview.
The lawyer was convicted after police found out in their investigation of Scarborough that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and saw him go to Ditta’s house and put the drugs under the lawyer’s bin with a purity of 60 percent in a black golf glove.
Shortly after delivering the drugs, Scarborough made regular phone calls to Ditta, who was at dinner at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium in Ewood Park.
The lawyer returned home, picked up the drugs, and then nine communications were exchanged between the two.
In court, it became known that Ditta was a “regular consumer” of cocaine after tests revealed Class A drugs in his hair, wallet and credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested, but denied taking cocaine, saying he had spoken to the alleged dealer because he was his client, and claimed their discussion was “lawyer’s secret.”
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards, but they were secured and a hair sample was taken from him.
During the police interrogation, he stated that he was operating an office both at his home address and at the workplace, and that clients would call him at home for legal matters.
In court, it became known that he had called key drug traffickers, some of whom he had previously represented, after significant arrests and briefed them on what the investigators knew about them.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said: “A criminal lawyer should know better than anyone else that you don’t break the law.”
Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal defense attorney because he has become too involved with certain clients.
The relationship in question is not simply that of a drug dealer, but of a drug dealer supplying his lawyer with drugs.
Part of his communications were undoubtedly legitimate, for he was the advocate of these individuals.
But this went far beyond the boundaries of a normal relationship between lawyer and client.
He countered the police investigations as much as possible, so that they could continue to pursue their criminal activities.
Mr Ditta thus discredited his profession.
He was too close to certain clients, especially Scarborough, and he allowed his independence to be compromised.
Ditta dismissed any wrongdoing, claiming: "If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and wanted to pass on information to Scarborough, then I would not wait 15 hours, but do it immediately."
But after the hearing, Lancashire Police Superintendent Lee Halstead said, “Mr. Ditta took the step from a criminal defense lawyer to a criminal the moment he started buying drugs from organized criminals.”
His cocaine addiction led to a hopeless compromise and made him receptive to the motives of leading members of organized crime who commissioned him to gather valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and ensure trust and confidence in the public.
Ditta has betrayed this trust and tried to entrench himself behind the facade of his profession.
Lancashire’s Serious and Organised Crime Unit led the investigation against Ditta, which also led to a conviction in three cases for possession of cocaine and obstruction of justice, underlining our determination to bring criminals to justice.
This case should be a warning to criminals and shows that no one can escape the arm of the law.
We'll find you and bring you to justice.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after pleading guilty to conspiracy to trade heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five others involved in the drug trade were sentenced to a total of 153 years for drug offences.
On his website, Ditta published a section with questions and answers about himself in which he stated that his dream job was to represent clients on death row in America as a lawyer, that his ultimate guest at dinner was Mohammed Ali and that inequality of opportunity was the motivation for his work.
Revolutionary Work of Church Music
At the end of the celebrations on the occasion of its 160th anniversary, the Liederkranz Dunnningen will frame two services with the "German Mass" by Franz Schubert.
After the great success of the musical "Rock my Life", which thrilled the audience in the spring of this year, the Liederkranz will enrich two services with the performance of Franz Schubert's Deutsche Messe at the end of the anniversary year.
On Saturday, 26 October, this extraordinary Mass will be heard from 19 during the evening Mass in St. Martinuskirche Dunningen and on Sunday, 27 October, from 10.15 a.m. at the service in St. Johannes Baptistkirche in Lackendorf.
The so-called Deutsche Messe with the original title "Ges<0xC3><0xA4>nge zur Feier des heiligens Opfers der Messe", D 872, is a spiritual musical work by the composer Franz Schubert from 1826 and was considered almost revolutionary at the time of its creation.
The Mass is performed as part of the divine services, as the client Johann Philipp Neumann had it in mind.
Under the direction of Hermann Schneider, the choir is accompanied by the brass group of the Musikverein Frohsinn Tennenbronn and Noemi Lokodi on the organ.
Haslach: Skepticism gives way to increasing confidence
The 2015 elections to the parish council will change fundamentally, for example in the Haslach pastoral care unit (SE).
There is then only one common parish council for all six parishes.
In a joint meeting on Saturday, the committees from Haslach, Hofstetten, Mühlenbach, Fischerbach, Steinach and Welschensteinach prepared themselves for the changes.
There is nothing left to change about the fundamental decisions of the diocese and it is up to the parish councils to implement them as satisfactorily as possible.
In the course of the day it became particularly clear: the skepticism towards the new is hesitant but increasingly giving way to confidence.
From the ideas and expectations of the innovations in 2015 to concrete proposals about the future composition and size of the parish council, the extremely constructive discussions between the six committees and the main officials of the pastoral team were enough.
Regional dean Georg Schmitt explained the new guidelines for pastoral care units in the Archdiocese of Freiburg on the basis of a presentation.
According to this, the SE Haslach as a parish will in future form a body under public law, which will enter into the rights and duties of the six individual parishes so far.
There will only be a joint parish council and a foundation council in which the pastor Kraft Amts is represented.
At least two elected members are to be represented from each parish, in the six parishes so-called community teams are formed locally.
Its future task will be to promote the church life in the village.
When asked about the finances of the individual parishes, there was then a considerable need for discussion.
The changes provide that accumulated funds in the parishes will be retained for specific purposes.
The liabilities, on the other hand, pass to the entire community.
Especially with regard to the large planned investments, the obligation of which then affects all parishes, there were great concerns.
"Even in the past, investments were only made in projects that could be handled by the individual parishes alone," relativized Haslach's parish council chairman Bruno Prinzbach.
Practical experience with a joint body for five parishes was described by Barbar Ritter, the chairman of the body in the pastoral unit Schutterwald-Neuried.
They had set themselves the task of "becoming one, staying five" in 2006 and had to realize that this is not so easy.
The committees of the Haslach pastoral unit then set out to answer the questions about the future composition and size of the joint parish council as well as the practical work of the community teams.
The elaborations will be specified in further meetings and will be decided at a further joint meeting of all six bodies next spring.
In the end, parish councillor Michael Schöner from Steinach presented the new logo of the pastoral unit, which was approved by a clear majority.
In Pfullendorf, the electricity will be more expensive
The citizens of Pfullendorf have to adjust to higher electricity costs.
As Jörg-Arne Bias, Managing Director of Stadtwerke, confirmed to S<0xC3><0x9C>DKURIER, a family of four from Pfullendorf is charged 70 to 90 euros per year in additional costs.
The main reason for the upcoming price increase is the increase in the so-called EEG surcharge from 5.277 to 6.3 cents per kilowatt hour.
This levy is re-established every year in October by the four operators of the large power lines.
They calculate the additional costs they incur from the energy transition, which they can charge by levying a surcharge on the price of electricity.
Stadtwerke Pfullendorf is the last link in this chain.
The energy company’s Supervisory Board had even assumed a higher levy in its forecasts, as Jörg-Arne Bias reports.
Now the concrete figures would have to be calculated before the municipal utilities could inform their customers about the exact price increase next week.
"We expect an increase of 1 cent plus x," says Bias, although the figure will be closer to the 2 cents.
Traffic lights on permanent red: Pay attention to waiting time
Sometimes a traffic light just doesn’t turn green.
The contact loop in the road does not react, or the light sign is defective.
What do you do when driving in red?
If a person has waited long enough at a red light and the intersection is free, he can continue, explains the Stuttgart lawyer Ralf Becker in the magazine "Motorrad".
However, the waiting time must be "appropriate", which can be interpreted differently from case to case.
Becker advises to wait at least five minutes before the traffic light starts to malfunction.
However, those who continue the journey despite the red light must be aware that they are fully responsible for an accident caused by it.
Anyone who is tolerated for less than five minutes may not wait long enough, warns Becker and refers to a decision of the Higher Regional Court of Hamm.
In the case negotiated, a driver had ignored the traffic light after about three minutes of continuous red and had to answer for a negligent red light violation.
The traffic light was not defective, but switched to green a little later.
He was spared a driving ban because of the special situation - but not the fine.
Local government is happy with a solid budget
Whenever it comes to the budget in municipal council meetings, Mayor Ralph Gerster has a good laugh.
The community sack in Herdwangen-Schönach is well filled and the administration has not been aware of debts since 2005.
In this sense, the 2012 financial year can also be recorded as a complete success.
This became clear at the presentation of the annual accounts for 2012.
As Andrea Rothmund explained, the administrative budget of around 7.6 million euros was more than one million euros higher than planned.
Also, the surplus of the administrative budget of about 1.8 million euros is about one million euros above the approach.
The surplus is mainly due to higher business tax revenues and the share of the municipality in the income tax.
The asset budget was again significantly above the planned values.
Instead of the planned 1.5 million euros, it amounted to 2.5 million euros last year.
"This is mainly due to the higher supply from the administrative budget," says Rothmund.
As fewer investments than planned were made in the 2012 financial year, the provision of reserves was also higher.
Overall, the general reserve was increased by around EUR 2.1 million to a total of EUR 4.9 million.
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for the good work.
"You don't just shake such a work out of the sleeve," Gerster praised with a view to the annual accounts.
He and the local councillors were clearly pleased with the good figures.
It may sound paradoxical, but it is precisely these good figures that could soon cost the citizens dearly.
Due to the good financial situation, the municipality was able to dispense with high lifting rates in the past.
As a result, however, according to Gerster, subsidies from the country have often been cut.
There are prerequisites for these grants from various compensation poles.
Among other things, the cities and municipalities that apply for grants must have certain lifting rates.
"We have to look at the issue of lifting rates, because in the coming years we will have investments for which we would like to have subsidies," Gerster announced in this context.
Nagold: Hugo Wermter for 60 years in the choir
With 60 years as a singer, Hubert Wermter’s story at the men’s singing club C<0xC3><0xA4>cilia is almost twice as long as that of the Herbsfest, during which he was solemnly honored.
As usual, Hubert Wermter stood on stage in the colours of his men’s singing club.
Even after 60 years, he still enjoys singing with the choir, which is now more than well-loved.
Wermter was also active in the association, including 28 years as a member of the committee.
For his commitment and loyalty to the association he received several awards: Jörg Kohr, Pastoral Officer on behalf of the C<0xC3><0xA4>cilienverband Rottenburg-Stuttgart, presented him - since the choir is also a church choir - a certificate of the association and a letter of honor signed by Bishop Gebhard Fürst.
His fellow singers presented him with the certificate of the German Choral Association as well as an engraved tin plate.
In addition to the award ceremony, the 31st Autumn Festival took place in the usual ways: With the MGV Betra, the Liederkranz Salzstetten, the singers department Baisingen and the local music club, the Vollmaringer had invited a colorful mix of different choirs and singing styles, which entertained the approximately 400 visitors.
The MGV Vollmaringen opened with atmospheric songs such as "Im Weinparadies" and "Lustig, ihr Brüder".
To honour their singer of honor, Hubert Wermter, they prepared a small stand - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's "Bundeslied".
The men's singing club Betra also sang classical choral songs such as "J<0xC3><0xA4>gerwerben" by Julius Wengert, "Weit, weit weg" by Hubert Goisern as well as the folk song "Wann du durchgehst durchs Tal".
The Liederkranz Salzstetten provided with its mixed choir and its women's group - the "Impulschor" - for the women's quota of the festival.
The mixed choir carried off with the Neapolitan folk tune "Santa Lucia" and "Eviva Espana" by Antos Gus to foreign countries, while the "Impulschor" also used foreign languages: "Liberatio" and "Hey Jude" were part of their program.
The singer section of the Baisinger Sportverein came back with "Was isch der Schwob?" by Hans Süssmuth and Robert Papperts "Bierlied" back to the home country, where the Vollmarniger Musikverein offered the crowning musical conclusion.
For the children there was a small side program - "Oma Hanne" aka Hannelore Stollsteimer performed a Kasperltheater and read a few stories, which the children occupied well over lunch.
Children's dreams come true
The kindergartens and daycare centers in the Zollernalbkreis receive mail these days.
In cooperation with Bauhaus and Sparkasse Zollernalb, the Schwarzw<0xC3><0xA4>lder Bote would like to support the institutions in realizing their building and beautification wishes.
Does the kindergarten need a new sandbox?
All kindergartens, daycare centres and cr<0xC3><0xA8>ches from the entire Zollernalbkreis can participate in the campaign.

Kenyan press outraged by controversial media law
"We are in a frightening situation and one can ask oneself: what is stopping Parliament from simply abolishing judicial independence tomorrow?", the newspaper said, which considers the bill to be unconstitutional.
“The law is draconian and very punitive and we reject it,” said Cyrus Kamau, CEO of Capital Group, which also includes CapitalFM, one of Kenya’s most respected independent radio stations and news websites.
He said the new media tribunal “will always be biased because it is an extended arm of the government,” and restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya’s position in the global economy.
"I hope the President listens to us and we appeal to him to reject this bill and send it back to Parliament," he said.
According to The Star newspaper, the new law "effectively strangles the media" while The Standard writes that democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya have suffered "a severe blow" and called the draft "draconian."
The passage of the law is part of a series of measures aimed at strengthening national security following the September attacks by armed Islamists on the Westgate shopping mall.
Kenyan media drew the wrath of the authorities for posting footage of security cameras showing the units deployed at the crime scene allegedly robbing the luxury shopping mall.
Police chief David Kimaiyo responded by ordering two journalists and a top media official to be interrogated, even though the subpoena was withdrawn following a media outcry.
Under the new law, media houses can be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists up to one million, as well as the further risk of losing their professional recognition or being excluded from official press accreditation.
The Tribunal also has the right to confiscate the property of the persons concerned if a penalty is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, “just a single penalty can bankrupt most radio stations.”
In addition, the newspaper believes that these measures could have a devastating effect on what it describes as Kenya's "living blogosphere".
If they silenced the media, politicians could do whatever they wanted with impunity.
“No one will ever know,” wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist at the nation’s national news agency, who described Kenyan media as a crucial control factor in public life.
“If you leave politicians to themselves, they will lead the country into bankruptcy and us back to the time of hunter-gatherers,” he said.
Kenyan lawmakers have already attracted public anger in the past.
In May, they voted to reverse the cuts ordered by the National Compensation Commission and reinstate their hefty salaries of about 532,000 shillings per month tax-free – they are among the world’s highest.
Bad-Dürrheim: A dream come true for FC
Despite the cold weather and the rain, the official inauguration ceremony for the artificial turf sports field did not lose its importance for the city and the football club.
Everyone had wished for a more pleasant celebration last Saturday, but Peter did not want to play.
So were all those who came without an umbrella or could not hold one for some reason.
This was the case for the musicians who framed the ceremony, as well as for many speakers.
Wet was therefore also the FC chairman Albrecht Schlenker, who spoke of the fulfillment of a dream.
His thanks went first and foremost to Mayor Walter Klumpp, who was strongly committed to the implementation of the project, the local council, the participating companies and association members who contributed.
Especially Lothar Held, Paul Weizenegger, Heiner Gail and Peter Graf.
The brisk pensioners laid 400 square meters of paving stones for the new paths.
Karl Rombach, Member of the State Parliament, also paid tribute to this remarkable voluntary commitment.
Further greetings were given to the city sports committee Hubert Baier, the district chairman of the South Baden Football Association, Kuno Kayan, and Friedrich Knorr from the planning office, who announced a donation for the youth department of the club.
Mayor Klumpp recalled that recurring weather-related influences in the spring and autumn added to the original lawn in such a way that it could not be played.
Already 15 years ago, there were the first considerations to solve the problem, when the construction of a third place at the site of the football club or at the Realschule am Salinensee was considered.
Both were rejected again.
Six years ago, thoughts came to the creation of an artificial turf sports field, which was generally regarded as the ultimate solution.
Concrete planning was started two years ago, when the FC took over the Schabelstube in Erblacht, promised a cost contribution of 100,000 euros for the construction of the square and approved the country subsidy of 104,000 euros.
In October 2012, the municipal council decided to take over the remaining 356 000 euros in the total cost of 560 000 euros, summarized Klumpp.
Construction of the 68-by-108-meter artificial grass pitch began on June 4.
During the construction phase, which lasted over three months, 3,000 cubic metres of soil were removed, half of which was used for the construction of a dirt bike track.
The Union and the SPD have continued their coalition negotiations on the topics of home affairs and justice.
To this end, the responsible working group met in Berlin in the morning.
Among other things, it is about direct democracy, bribery of deputies and the federal police.
In the morning, the Working Group on Migration and Integration also wanted to continue its deliberations.
Among other things, it is likely to be about the topic of dual citizenship, where both sides have conflicting ideas.
The SPD wants to end the compulsion for immigrant children born in Germany to opt for one – the Union rejects a double passport.
On the subject of traffic, which is not on the agenda this Friday, the SPD underlined its no to a car toll demanded by the CSU.
A vignette is a "flat rate for frequent driving and thus ecologically counterproductive," said the SPD negotiator for the topic of transport, Florian Pronold, in a letter to his group.
There was a threat of alternative traffic on country roads, which are already the main accident areas.
In Pronold’s view, the introduction of a toll for all passenger cars would only be a first step.
"There is a risk that compensation for Germans will be cancelled at a later date," he said.

Car driver seriously injured in accident
In an accident on Thursday evening, a 37-year-old passenger car driver from Aachen was seriously injured.
According to the police, a 41-Year-old from Müsch around 21.15 clock with their car on the Kempener outer ring in the direction of Grefrath.
When she wanted to turn left onto St. Töniser Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e, she overlooked the 37-year-old’s oncoming car.
The driver collided.
The Aachener suffered serious injuries and had to be taken to the hospital for treatment.
Konstanz: Blocking after an accident at the Sch<0xC3><0xA4>nzlekreisel
According to the police, the accident occurred when a 51-year-old driver of a Swiss Seat Ibiza drove out of town on Thursday evening, around 8 p.m., on the left lane of the two-lane Reichenaustra<0xC3><0x9F>e.
Shortly before the roundabout at the Sch<0xC3><0xA4>nzle, he noticed that he was on the left turn in the direction of Stromeyersdorfstra<0xC3><0x9F>e and changed to the right lane.
This resulted in a collision with the BMW of a 23-year-old Konstanzer driving there.
The VW Passat of a 19-year-old was also damaged behind the BMW.
In total, about 15,000 property damage occurred, the police said.
The roadway had to be closed during the accident recording, it said.
Vienna Airport cancels passenger calls
Mr. Max Maier, please come to gate 24.
In the future, announcements like these will no longer be made at Vienna-Schwechat Airport.
A large part of the loudspeaker announcements is thus eliminated - the noise level should be reduced significantly.
Creating a more relaxed atmosphere is the goal of this innovation.
As Airport spokesman Peter Kleemann announced to Radio Wien, Vienna Airport is following an international trend with the cessation of announcements concerning individual persons.
For example, the airports in Copenhagen, Frankfurt or Dubai already dispense with the noisy calls.
By eliminating these announcements - on average, about 200 personal calls are heard through the speakers in a day - it should be quieter at the airport in the future.
"It has also been shown in the experience that these individual announcements were perceived relatively little, but at the same time all other information about changed flight paths or departure times are a bit lost here," said Kleemann in an interview with the radio station.
Highlander Games at the Kaltenhof
In addition to pulling the brake wagon with tractors, there will also be a second competition at the agricultural autumn festival at the Kaltenhof from 6 to 8 September.
On Saturday, September 7, the Highlander Games will start at 1.30 pm.
Although they have a Scottish tradition, they are Swabian-inspired on the Kaltenhof.
Teams and lone fighters compete in the disciplines of tree trunk throwing, horseshoe throwing and water buckets.
The tree trunk is four and a half meters long and weighs 25 to 30 kilograms.
"It doesn't depend on the distance," explains organizer Peter Saile.
The trunk must be dropped vertically, should turn over once and then come straight to lie down.
This is assessed with most of the points.
When throwing horseshoes, the accuracy of the target is important.
From eight meters away is thrown on a peg.
Dexterity and strength must be demonstrated by the participants when carrying water buckets over 50 meters.
Time and amount of water in a vat are measured at the end.
From each "clan" or team, two are then allowed to participate in the individual competition.
The winners of the team and individual competition will receive prizes.
You can train from 10 a.m.
Matching clothing is desired, for example, the competitors can compete in a tartan.
Swabian costume is also allowed.
For the "outfit" the jury awards a few bonus points.
You can register up to one hour before the start of the competition.
With the Scottish-Swabian Highlander games and the tractor-pulling, which starts half an hour earlier, there is already a lot of action on the festival grounds on Saturday.
In the evening, the brass band friends get their money's worth.
At 7 pm the biraböhmische Blasmusik from Schömberg organizes the big entertainment evening.
The chapel plays fast polkas and marches.
Her repertoire also includes soulful waltzes and a rich big band sound.
Heinz Koch, known as a singing host and black sausage baron, will be there from Weilen among the gutters.
In Dornhan he has already performed at the Christmas market and at the guild of fools.
On Sundays the music club Leinstetten entertains for breakfast, from 2 pm the Bauernkapelle Böffingen is a guest, and the "oldies" then let the party end.
The Stoppelackerparty with DJ Ralf is already kicking off on Friday.
Other program items on Saturday and Sunday include the classic car and tractor meeting, exhibitions by companies on the subject of agriculture and forestry.
Other attractions on Sunday are the corn maze, the artisan market and sheep shearing.
Especially for children there is a petting zoo, straw bouncy castle, tractor riding (under instruction) and tractor surfing.
Organizers are the Förderverein Mehrzweckhalle, the Skiclub and the Traktorfreunde "Zündk<0xC3><0xA4>psele".
Milk and egg alternatives at a glance
Vegan diets require plant-based alternatives to eggs, milk, and dairy products.
Pureed tofu with plant cream, for example, is a quark substitute.
The World Vegetarian Day is celebrated on November 1st.
The Vegetarian Federation Germany proposes a number of vegan alternatives on the occasion of the World Vegan Day on 1 November:
Pure plant margarine is a good alternative to butter, yogurt is replaced by soy yogurt.
Instead of milk, soy, oat, almond or rice milk can be used.
Whipped plant cream replaces conventional whipped cream.
There are also plant-based alternatives to eggs.
A half crushed, ripe banana, for example, can replace an egg as a binder in a cake.
Also 50 grams of applesauce or a tablespoon of ground flaxseed plus three tablespoons of water are suitable for this.
Loose doughs become doughs instead of using egg, for example, with a mixture of a teaspoon of baking soda, a tablespoon of cornstarch, and three tablespoons of mineral water.
But even 50 grams of soy yogurt or silken tofu can fulfill this purpose.
According to Vebu, around 800,000 people in Germany currently eat vegan, i.e. purely plant-based.
Sleepless in New York
On the way to their host families in Weymouth, Massachusetts, the students of the Black Forest High School got to know the American city of New York.
After an eight-hour flight, we went straight to the Brooklyn Bridge, which reached the heart of the city, Manhattan, on foot.
A fascinating view of the world-famous skyline was already offered here, which is a special attraction in the evening light.
Due to the time difference, the students were on their feet for almost 24 hours, but true to the motto "The city does not sleep" the day in Times Square was decided.
Despite the shutdown, the Statue of Liberty could be reached on the second day by ferry and climbed on foot.
Then we went over the financial center around Wall Street to the memorial of September 11.
On the third day, the students were able to gain an overview of the fascinatingly large city from the Empire State Building’s 373 metre high observation deck while enjoying the view.
After that, we went through the hustle and bustle of New York streets via the Rockefeller Center to Central Park, which offered an ideal opportunity for a short stay in the autumn sun.
After a short flight from New York to Boston, the students have now arrived in their host families and experience the school life at Weymouth High School.
Also this year, a Hubertusmesse will be celebrated on the name day of St. Hubertus in the parish church of St. Marien an der Hülsbergstra<0xC3><0x9F>e.
According to legend, St. Hubertus was a rather ruthless hunter who was converted by a vision and later appointed Bishop of Li<0xC3><0xA8>ge.
The Jagdhornbl<0xC3><0xA4>sergruppe of the Jagdreiter Westfalen under the direction of Brigitte Kluth plays on parforce horns (natural horns in the mood for it) according to old, originally French melodies.
The windmen wear riding clothes because they accompany mainly riders, horses and dog pack on tow hunts musically.
The solemn Mass will take place on Sunday, November 3, at 11.30 a.m.
The newly designed serve shines with a new cafe.
One that invites you to linger and come back.
One that wants to make the name a program.
According to the lexicon, déj<0xC3><0xA0> vu is a psychological phenomenon that expresses itself in the feeling of having experienced or seen a new situation before.
In the case of a visit to the café of the same name at Opschlag in the district town of Kleve within sight of the Rhein-Waal University of Applied Sciences, it does not have to remain the pure Déj<0xC3><0xA0> Vu feeling.
After all, the café with the beautiful name has exactly that goal: to make an actual stay not only mental, but tangible recurring experience.
Because it's fun and it's just beautiful.
A look into the inner workings of the Opschlag 8 gives the viewer a good feeling right away.
The state-of-the-art, but not cool café ambience looks like a place to feel good.
Here, the team with the founders Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner at the head spoils the guest with various coffee or cocktail variants.
In addition, there are delicious cakes or individually topped fresh baguettes.
The owners, both 33 years old, have already made a name for themselves as restaurateurs before the opening of the fancy café am Opschlag: In Kranenburg they ran the "Art Lounge".
From the move to Kleve at the Opschlag, the likeable café lovers hope for more audience.
Last but not least, the university.
"While we do not have a specific target group," emphasizes Daniel Büttner.
Rather, the two here would like to address young students as well as seniors and all age groups in between.
Speaking of coffee lovers.
The friendly owner couple is behind the coffee enjoyment.
Enjoy the fragrant hot brew in the most varied variations yourself.
Expressofan
Daniel Büttner is rather the Expresso fan and Mirjam van der Stelt the cappuccino drinker.
"A baguette for that - that's my thing," she tells the NRZ.
There were also two events in the bright café.
Better to say one.
Because the harbour festival took place rather outside - the Café Déj<0xC3><0xA0> Vu did not benefit from it.
But there was also the Ringelnatz evening.
"Beautiful, successful and funny," the two 33-year-olds said.
But not everyone's business.
Perhaps this is why Daniel Büttner is not a fan of event evenings: "You can't do it all right".
And with an event I always address only those who are interested in the special event.
That is why events will be the exception.
"We want to disrupt the normal operation as little as possible."
In other words, Déj<0xC3><0xA0> Vu also stands for reliability.
In terms of the quality of the products offered here, as well as the team and the beautiful surroundings at the store in Kleve.
The street that is becoming more and more a gastronomic mile.
To the delight of many Klever, the guests from near and far and the students who discover the Gastrome and thus also the Café Déj<0xC3><0xA0> Vu for themselves.

A day of thanks at the MGV in Dinker
It was the 165th foundation festival to which the MGV "Friedrich Wilhelm Dinker" had invited this year and 52 guests, active singers and their wives, were happy to come.
In the club bar of the restaurant "Witteborg" in Dinker everyone enjoyed the harmonious togetherness completely in the sign of the music.
Traditionally, the foundation festival is also always the right celebration to perform honors.
The special award "Singer of the Year" this time pleased secretary Rolf Wagener.
"Not only have you written a lot for us, but you have also made many rounds for us, for which we thank you very much", says the chairman of the choir Erich Schlotmann.
The awards for participation in the performances and choral rehearsals by means of activity bouquets went this year to the choir director Dieter Schulze with 44 participations, followed by the honorary chairman Horst Pier-Ribbert, the chairman himself, and last year's "Singer of the Year" Friedrich Winkler with 42 participations each.
Fifth place was occupied by Musician Artur Brückner.
A special thank you was addressed by the board to the team of club owner Ange Pier-Ribbert, who had once again conjured up a top-class menu and to Gerda Pier-Ribbert for the table decoration.
The MGV "Friedrich-Wilhelm" meets for its regular choral rehearsals every Tuesday at 7.45 pm in the club pub.
"New singing-loving voices are always welcome," says Schlotmann.
UN announces new targets for poverty reduction
The United Nations is now working on a series of new goals to replace the Millennium Development Goals announced 12 years ago.
In the run-up to the UN Sustainable Development Summit, which began in Rio de Janeiro in the evening, Australian diplomats played a key role in pushing for “sustainable development goals” to replace the Millennium Development Goals, which expire in 2015.
They were included in the final draft of the document, which will be adopted by world leaders, including Mrs Gillard, at the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said at the summit that the time had come to “think beyond national interests.”
"I am pleased that member states have agreed to embark on a process to agree on universal, sustainable development goals," he said.
“These goals will build on our progress from the Millennium Development Goals and form an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will spare no effort to implement this mandate given to me by the member states in order to realize our vision of the Sustainable Development Goals, which build on the success of the Millennium Development Goals."
Even though SG Achim/Baden has been without a win for four match days, the handball super league remains in a good mood.
Coach Tomasz Malmon leaves no doubt about this.
Everyone remains fully motivated in the matter.
Nevertheless, I hope that we finally win again.
"Because I don't even know what such a victory tastes like," Malmon expects a sense of success from his team at VfL Fredenbeck II.
Even though the third-league reserve from Fredenbeck has currently not torn out any trees, Malmon raises his index finger in advance.
I have coached many players myself in the A-Jugend.
You will be especially motivated against your ex-coach.
"At the same time, it is important to wait to see if reinforcements from the first team will be present," the SG coach explains.
In order to finally return to the track of success, the Malmon team must definitely increase compared to the previous appearances.
Especially in the cover work and the switching game, it faltered enormously at the end.
Exploitation of opportunities must definitely be improved as well.
Therefore, I hope that my players finally got their heads free during the short break.
Mozambique’s security concerns grow amid clashes between influential figures
Thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputo under the watchful eye of the statue of Samora Machel, the founder of the state and first president of Mozambique, to make peace calls at a rare public demonstration.
"We want peace again, we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, managing director of an investment company.
Out of fear for the future of the country, she exchanged her business clothes for a T-shirt with the inscription "We demand security" in Portuguese and joined the crowd on Thursday in the Independence Square of the capital.
For the past two weeks, there have been almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo, which are among the worst battles since the peace agreement more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement, initially supported by white-ruled Rhodesia and later South Africa’s apartheid government in an effort to destabilize the country’s independent government.
After the 1992 peace treaty, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe it is unlikely that the country will return to a full-blown conflict, but recent events have alarmed foreign investors and locals.
Much is at stake for the fast-growing economy, as the discovery of huge offshore gas reserves and coal deposits in the northwest could bring in more than $50 billion in investment from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the US over the next few years.
The ruling Frelimo party, the dominant force since 1975, and Renamo blame each other for the tensions.
Renamo claims that the government provoked the latest clashes by attacking its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional stronghold of Renamos, on October 17.
The attacks on the former rebels escalated as government forces attacked Renamo bases and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group’s leader, Renamo’s spokesman told the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for the clashes and accuses the organization of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has tried to downplay concerns about instability.
Speaking to AFP, the French news agency, he said on Wednesday that Dhlakama sees himself as a “loser” who wants to “use all his remaining forces to prove that he can impose his decisions on the government.”
Both Frelimo and Renamo emphasize that they want to avoid a war.
But concerns have increased since Mazanga was quoted as saying that Renamo was giving up the 1992 peace agreement.
He told the FT that he meant that Frelimo no longer respected the agreement.
"Our vision is to resume negotiations, seriously," Mazanga said.
Previous talks between the parties have done little to resolve tensions fuelled by a series of clashes this year.
“We have two grown men here (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who are hitting their heads,” says Joseph Hanlon, an Open University lecturer and Mozambique expert.
None of them are good at negotiating and none are willing to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, who is pushing for electoral reforms, has already declared that she will boycott the municipal elections in November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of force as an attempt by an ailing movement to obtain concessions and financial benefits from the government.
Renamo's electoral successes have been shrinking since 1992, while a newer party, the Movimento Democr<0xC3><0xA1>tico de Mo<0xC3><0xA7>ambique (MDM), founded by a former Renamo member, is likely to improve in the elections.
Mazanga claims that Guebuza – whose resignation is due when his second term ends next year – wants to destroy the country’s democracy.
“He doesn’t want multi-party democracy, he doesn’t want transparent elections, he doesn’t want peace because he doesn’t want to give up the presidency,” Mazanga said.
It is unclear what capacity Renamo has, but she has launched unrest-causing attacks on police stations and vehicles on an important north-south connection.
Most of the fighting took place in the province of Sofala, which is a few hundred kilometers north of Maputo, but in which Beira is located, the port, which mining companies such as Rio Tinto and Vale use to export coal.
In June, Rio interrupted use of the railroad for a month after Renamo announced an attack on the track.
Mazanga reluctantly replied to the question of whether Renamo would repeat this threat.
Renamo wanted to “warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique,” said Mazanga.
The instability has increased frustration with the government, says Fernando Lima, head of Mediacoop, an independent media company, as many people are already concerned about corruption, slow progress in development and a recent wave of kidnappings.
“People think that the government and the president are responsible for the future of the country and he should be the one to find solutions to the problems,” he explains.
Omar Sultane, a protester, said people just wanted stability.
"Nobody cares about Renamo and Frelimo, they just want peace and roads that can be used," he said.
Children should be taught myths and legends as “models for life,” one author says.
Thor’s stories showed that “brutal force has no chance against clever tricks,” and the Arthurian legend demonstrates the importance of having a dream.
However, many of the myths are "far too wild, too offensive, and in some cases too dirty to be taught in schools," which is why Crossley-Holland advocated a "careful selection" of age-appropriate works.
“I think it’s wonderful that in America myths and folklore are already part of education,” he said.
I've been proposing this as a plan for twenty years.
He added that authors and teachers who are "excessively didactic" would "completely switch off" children, because in entertaining stories the messages would be conveyed "sublimely".
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon and is the author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and the British Folk Tales, stated, "You can pursue certain intentions, but you should keep them in the background if possible."
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult writer who writes for adults and an author who writes for children lies in the need to convey hope.
Not everything needs to be simplified or lead to a happy ending, but there is an immanent sense of good and evil.
This must be subliminally represented, revealed by history and not explained.
This is the old story of showing instead of telling.
Hansjakob moves again in Freihof
100 years ago Heinrich Hansjakob moved into his retirement home in Haslach, on Sunday his last years came to life in the "Freihof".
The many spectators were enthusiastic about the very entertaining scene play.
From his arrival to the award of honorary citizenship to his death, screenwriter and Hansjakob actor Alois Kraftzcyk had designed an entertaining play that received much acclaim under the direction of Cornelia Volk.
Marcus Zagermann took the audience as a speaker through the ten different scenes, explained connections and bridged time jumps from youth to approaching retirement.
On October 22, 1913, Hansjakob comes home to his children's heaven, to his courtyard.
And then the scene play began, in which Alois Krafczyk once again shone in his role as the city’s great son.
Stilecht he performed with the pair and "Schwarzw<0xC3><0xA4>lder Füchsen" by Erich Becherer from Mühlenbach.
Not only was he received with great applause by the audience, his sister Philippine welcomed him.
Billy Sum-Hermann understood it incredibly well to put himself into the role of the sister and gave her immense life in facial expressions and gestures.
Between the individual playing scenes, the Mühlenbacher Bauernkapelle played suitably selected pieces of music and thus rounded off the performance.
For the award of the honorary citizenship, Haslach's mayor Heinz Winkler gave himself the honor, who made his appearance on behalf of the then incumbent H<0xC3><0xA4>ttich together with a part of the city council.
Their wait was then made by the Dreikönig singers, who caused Hansjakob to exclaim: "Oh how beautiful, there again youth memories of my own Dreikönig period come to life".
With their song "O Jesulein" they delighted the audience in the Freihof as well as the Storchentag children with their loud "Out, Out".
Hansjakob had expressed his criticism of the Amtskirche at the time, as well as his concerns about the excesses in agriculture, the consequences of industrialization or the effects of war.
In the Heimaterde, behind his grave chapel on the fire near Hofstetten, he found his resting place.
“A restless spirit had finally found his peace and had gone home forever,” the scene’s ending said.
There was a lot of applause and praise from the audience for the performance.
Basketball: The hope of the Neckar giants is growing
The chances of the league remaining of the sportively relegated Ludwigsburg Bundesliga basketball players have increased.
Because if there is a wildcard procedure, then there is now one less competitor for the Neckar Giants.
The basketball project Hamburg Towers waives an application for a possible return seat.
"We will not participate in the wildcard procedure," said former international player Pascal Roller, who has been developing the concept for a professional club in the Hanseatic city since 2012.
Nevertheless, a first breath of air could not be heard from Ludwigsburg.
"We did not deal with the wildcard procedure until it is clear that Düsseldorf will not receive a license," Neckar-Giant-Boss Alexander Reil told our newspaper.
Until 23 May, Aufsteiger Düsseldorf Baskets can still file documents with the arbitral tribunal and prove its economic Bundesliga suitability.
So far, however, the Rhinelanders have been denied the license twice.
The arbitral tribunal shall be the last instance.
Haigerloch: Last Supper Church moves into focus
As a contribution by the city to the 150th anniversary of the Evangelical Church in Haigerloch, the city’s cultural and tourism office is dedicating the last of this year’s public themed tours to the Last Supper Church on Sunday, 27 October.
After visiting the Atomkeller Museum, the Haigerloch period is to be considered after 1850, when Haigerloch came under Prussian rule.
A crowning finale is a visit to the Last Supper Church.
There, the leaders are told the story of the construction of the church and gain insights into the development of the evangelical community in a thoroughly Catholic area.
Last but not least, the church also has a look at the Last Supper painting created by Friedrich Schüz with the support of Walter Kröll and Georg Halbritter.
It is an original reproduction of the famous Milanese model of Leonardo da Vinci.
Meeting point for the other half-hour tour is at 3 pm at the Atomkeller Museum.
Tickets are available at the ticket office of the Atomkellermuseum.
For questions and information, the Tourist Office of the City of Haigerloch is available.
Snowden could also testify in Russia
The former US intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in the US spy affair in his Russian asylum.
Representatives of the Federal Prosecutor General’s Office could either ask questions in writing or meet the 30-year-old in person in Russia.
This was reported by the Interfax agency, citing unspecified circles familiar with the situation.
Such an issue could be resolved inter-state, it said.
An exit of Snowden from Russia is practically excluded.
"In this case, he loses his refugee status," the agency quoted its source as saying.
Because Germany is an ally of the US, Snowden threatens to extradite them there, it said.
Long breaths pay off
Six men's teams competed in the tennis tournament of the clubs for the title of winner.
In the end, the endurance of Team Maier/Bronner decided the last match.
The tennis department of Sportfreunde Rohrdorf had received a dream weather for the tournament of local clubs and friends.
The fun of playing tennis was in the foreground of the tournament.
There were five games per team on the schedule, with each playing against each.
Played in double mode with a long set up to nine points or a maximum duration of 45 minutes.
Anja Schlichter leads the tournament
The tournament management was in the proven hands of Anja Schlichter, she was supported by Carmen Müller and Inga Kronemeyer.
After the first three games and a lunch break with pasta, the tournament entered the decisive phase.
The favorites Andre Maier/Matthias Bronner were equal to Michael Klippel and Sadmin Osmicic (both teams of SG Rohrweiler), so the last two matches had to bring the decision.
At the award ceremony, Carmen Müller was finally able to hand over the Wanderpokal to Andre Maier/Matthias Bronner, who had the longest breath on the finish line.
Second place went to double Michael Klippel/Sadmin Osmicic.
Rainer and Bernd Maier of the Asphaltriecher team reached the bronze staircase.
In the late afternoon sun and coffee and cake, the successful conclusion of the tournament took place.
On the last weekend of August, the Black Forest Open-Air Museum Vogtsbauernhof in Gutach near Hornberg is back in the hands of children.
Traditionally, the museum welcomes visitors on Saturday and Sunday, 24 and 25 August, as part of the summer holiday program to a colorful children's and family party with numerous hands-on activities and events.
"Big and small can learn different old crafts on both days," the press release says.
Whether making soap, turning candles, felting or making ropes, there is something for every age.
The children are assisted by regional craftsmen from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.
In the museum workshop there is also a workshop.
During the construction of cuckoo pipes, water wheels or gyros, the young guests can prove their craftsmanship.
Lots of fun are also promised by the many old games, such as wheelbarrow racing or stilt running.
Speed and coordination are required here.
For all the little detectives, the open-air museum offers a puzzle tour of the museum on Saturdays and Sundays, each at 12 and 14 o’clock.
On a field tour, the children have to guess which stories correspond to the truth or are lying.
In addition, visitors have the special opportunity to get to know the open-air museum during a carriage ride with Black Forest foxes.
Not only horses, but also many other animals such as sheep, goats, cows and chickens can be found and admired on the site.
In addition, all children can look forward to the clown Otsch on Sunday, who drives his cockroach from 11 am with the museum guests.
In the meantime, Hermann Büttner is enjoying a cosy and fairytale atmosphere.
The storyteller takes the little guests to the wonderful world of fairy tales at 11, 13 and 15 o’clock.
In addition, the children's dance group from Gutach performs traditional dances at 11.30 a.m.
Furthermore, on both days of the event from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m., numerous craftsmen such as the broombinder, the seamstress, the spinner, the weaver and the baker can look over the shoulder in their traditional work.
Until the end of the summer holidays in Baden-Württemberg, visitors to the open-air museum can expect a varied holiday program.
In a small New Zealand town, Burt Muro is considered a lovable fool because he set out to take part in a race in America with his motorcycle, built in 1920.
Despite a heart defect, Burt is not to be dissuaded from his dream.
With his savings, a few donations and a mortgage on his old workshop shed, he transfers by ship to Los Angeles.
After the movie there is coffee, tea and cake.
Shrill beeping disturbs local residents
Rhenus Midgard has also invested heavily on land.
They distribute the coal coming from the ships to the stockpile.
The company has several irons in the fire at the same location.
In addition to coal imports, Rhenus Midgard also focuses on wind turbine logistics.
Black shimmers the hard coal in the storage area in front of the dike.
Two huge blue dumpers and reloaders distribute or load the coal here as needed.
With every movement of the handling equipment, a shrill warning sound sounds across the terrain.
"The signals serve safety and are required by law," says Matthias Schrell, Managing Director of Rhenus Midgard in Wilhelmshaven.
With unfavourable wind, this is unfortunately widely heard - and so there have already been some complaints from people from the city order.
He takes the complaints very seriously and has therefore made contact with those affected, says the 40-year-old.
In close consultation with the authorities, we are now in the process of keeping the warning signals quieter with technical measures.
In the future, he will continue to engage in open dialogue with his neighbours.
Because Matthias Schrell still has a lot to do at the location.
With the expansion of the Lower Saxony Bridge, Rhenus Midgard continues to rely on coal imports for power plants and is one of the major players in this sector in Europe.
Thanks to the 18.5-metre-deep bathtub in front of the terminal, Capesize bulk carriers can also be handled here for a long time.
“This year, we want to break the 3 million ton mark on the envelope,” said Schrell.
In addition to the Eon power plant on site, the import coal goes to power plants in the inland.
If the GDF-Suez power plant goes on the grid, a good 5 million tons of coal imports per year are realistic.
The three ship unloaders on the bridge and the second conveyor could create up to 10 million.
Bavarian basketball player optimistic despite first defeat
Even the first defeat in the Euroleague could not diminish the huge optimism among the basketball players of FC Bayern Munich.
"No one can forbid us to believe that we will win against the best team in Europe in the past two years," Bayern coach Svetislav Pesic said after the unfortunate 83:88 (39:47) on Thursday evening at title defender Olympiakos Piraeus.
We have sent the message: Basketball also exists in Munich!
At their only third appearance in the European premier class, the Munich team sold very well for a long time, but were simply not clear enough in the decisive phases.
The guests initially managed to convert a 15-point deficit into a lead 13 minutes before the end, before Piraeus gave the game another turn.
"We fought back incredibly against the two-time Euroleague champion, but then made reckless mistakes again," said Bayern professional Yassin Idbihi.
We are proud of our performance, but we want to win every game.
Malcolm Delaney and Nihad Djedovic were the most successful pitchers of the Munich team, which had celebrated clear victories in the first two games against the Italian series champion Montepaschi Siena and the Polish title-winner Zielona G<0xC3><0xB3>ra.
Ben Greenman: Ten Years of New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
You could say that New York City is the birthplace of stand-up comedy in America: almost a hundred years ago, the variety artist Frank Fay, who worked as a conference host at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, started telling jokes directly to the crowd in the form of a conversation.
Over the years, Fay’s innovation has grown, as it did at the New York Comedy Festival.
Launched and directed by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the Carolines stand-up institution, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year with over sixty shows in small clubs and large theatres.
"Most of these headliners started with Carolines and then became more and more successful until they were too well known to perform in a club," Hirsch said.
We designed this festival so that we can continue to work with them.
This year’s event features performances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin, and Bill Maher, as well as Stand Up for Heroes, an annual army veteran music and comedy benefit event at Madison Square Garden featuring Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters, and Bill Cosby, among others.
With the festival, the world of comedy has also grown.
A number of the comedians participating in the festival this year have become known through rather unconventional ways, such as broadcasts on smaller television channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll became known with a cable sitcom (the ironic-sloppy fantasy football series "The League" on FXX) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was part of the cast on both Saturday Night Live and Parks and Recreation, though she is best known for her viral video series Marcel the Shell with Shoes On.
Both Kroll and Slate and other young comedians with characteristic voices (the surreally pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic, racially focused W. Kaumau Bell) are products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the biggest visitor magnets of the festival is an interview: David Steinberg talks to Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, but has developed into a respected television and film director, as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he hosted a TV show called "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg" on TV Land.
The meeting will take place in the Town Hall in the middle of Manhattan.
“The city is definitely in the comedy DNA of Larry’s entire work,” Steinberg said.
He told me that when he's here, he sometimes walks through the alley between two buildings and thinks, "Hey, if I lose all my money, maybe I'll live here."
Iran Satisfied With Nuclear Negotiations Process
One week before the next nuclear meeting with the five UN veto powers, Iran and Germany are satisfied with the negotiation process.
"After years, we now have an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency to resolve the differences of the last few years," Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif wrote on his Facebook page.
It would still be a long way to go, but the nuclear chief negotiator is satisfied with the negotiation process and also optimistic that both sides will come to a solution in the end.
Drama in Uruguay: Boys Kill Game Combs with Machete
Two children have confessed to the murder of an 11-year-old in Uruguay.
The two 14- and 12-year-old boys had invited their victim to go bird hunting with them.
Armed with machetes and knives, they stabbed the 11-year-old on Tuesday and threw the body into a well, the newspaper "El Pa<0xC3><0xAD>s" reported on Thursday.
They then played football in front of their homes in a working-class neighborhood.
The body was found the following night in the village of Cerro Pelado, 15 kilometers north of the exclusive beach town of Punta del Este.
As an alibi, a five-year-old half-sister of the younger one they took with them testified that she had been sexually assaulted by the boy.
However, when the girl described the incident to the police without mentioning an attack against her, the two boys admitted the deliberate killing of the 11-year-old.
As a reason, the elder mentioned, among other things, a rivalry in the football game.
He was admitted to a psychiatric youth facility for the time being.
Pimps have to go to jail
For exploitative human trafficking, pimping, threats, insults and dangerous bodily harm, the Regional Court of Konstanz has sentenced a 33-year-old man from St. Georgen to three and a half years in prison.
The former Bundeswehr soldier, who worked as a bouncer after two missions in Afghanistan, made a confession as part of a trial agreement.
In five cases, he met women via internet or telephone contacts, which he sent after a few weeks against their will on the line.
He used to break resistance with violence and threats.
He retained the income of the women, some of whom had been purchasing for him for years.
By confiscating mobile phones and SIM cards, he undermined women’s contacts with the outside world.
Together with a colleague who mediated the women, he took them to various brothels in the southwest.
There he had them partially monitored to control their revenues.
In court, the defendant initially claimed that he was suffering from severe trauma after colleagues in Afghanistan died alongside him in an explosion.
After a psychiatric expert indicated great doubts about the psychological limitation and thus a limited culpability, the 33-year-old made a comprehensive confession.
The court did not hear any of the injured women.
As reported by a Kripo official, after an initial report by telephone surveillance measures, at least four other cases of exploitative human trafficking could be identified.
The intercepted conversations were characterized by high aggression.
In later interrogations, the victims confirmed their martyrdom.
Another witness, in which one of the women had discovered bruises all over her body, had made no statement until today.
It is about "a completely broken personality" who sees violence and exploitation in this field as normal.
The defendant regretted his conduct yesterday.
"He broke away from these circles and wanted to live a normal life after the detention," he said.
Oil Price Continues to Drop to $96 Per Barrel
Oil prices continued to fall on Friday after concerns over a high supply overshadowed a report that China’s energy-hungry manufacturing sector is growing.
The reference crude for December deliveries fell 14 cents to $96.24 per barrel in late morning electronic trading in Europe on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The contract fell 39 cents on Thursday, which meant a 5.8 percent price drop in October.
The large supply of crude oil has weighed on prices in recent weeks.
The U.S. Department of Energy said on Wednesday that U.S. supply increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over the course of five weeks, the supply had increased by 25 million barrels.
But on Friday, there was evidence of stronger demand from two reports of an increase in activity in Chinese manufacturing.
This indicates a continued recovery in China’s economy, which grew to 7.8 percent in the third quarter, after reaching its lowest level in two decades in the previous quarter.
Brent crude, a benchmark for international crude that is also used by U.S. refineries, fell 26 cents per barrel on the ICE Exchange in London.
Court blocks decision on NYPD stop-and-frisk policy
A federal appeals court in the U.S. on Thursday blocked the order of a judge who had called for changes to the stop-and-frisk program (“stop and search”) of the New York Police Department, and absolved the judge of the case.
The 2nd U.S. Court of Appeals said Judge Shira Scheindlin's decisions would be suspended until an appeal by the city was decided.
The judge had ruled in August that the city violated the constitution with the way the program for stopping and questioning people is implemented.
The city appealed against its assessment and ordered remedial action, including the decision to set up a monitoring body to assist the police in changing its policy and training program.
The appeals court heard the arguments for the suspension on Tuesday.
The appeals report said the judge had to be relieved of the case because she violated the Code of Conduct for U.S. judges by stating that a judge should avoid the appearance of partisanship, based in part on a series of media interviews and public statements in which she publicly responded to the court’s criticism.
The judge had ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people because they were inappropriately targeting black and Latin American men with the stop-and-frisk program.
It appointed an external body to monitor the implementation of material changes, including reforms in policies, training and oversight, and ordered a pilot program with body-worn cameras in neighborhoods where most controls were carried out.
In August, the city of New York agreed to end the practice of storing names and addresses of people who were released after police checks.
A hearing on the appeal of the city is planned after 14 March 2014.
The stop-and-frisk tactic has been criticized by a number of civil rights advocates.
Controls of this kind have been around for decades in various forms, but the number of controls recorded during the tenure of non-partisan Mayor Michael Bloomberg rose to an all-time high of 684,330 in 2011, most of them black and Latin American men.
In 2004, a lawsuit was filed by four men who belonged to all minorities, which developed into a class action lawsuit.
Proponents of changes to the NYPD’s stop-and-frisk program say the changes will end unfair practices and create a more trusted and effective police force, as well as impact the way other police presidencies use the scheme.
Opponents believe the changes will dampen the morale of the police, but not the criminality; also, money will be wasted and the broader problem of a police force that is under pressure after the disappearance of thousands of jobs over the last decade will not be solved.
The judge pointed out that she did not end the stop-and-frisk practice, which was constitutional, but only reformed the way the NYPD implemented the controls.
The happiness of the dreaming camels
Happiness is an oasis that only dreaming camels succeed in achieving
With this Bedouin wisdom, the first chairman Wolfgang Henne described the history and fascination of the association "Helping Hands".
On Saturday afternoon, the tenth birthday of the club was celebrated, which can already show considerable success.
The first chairman Henne reported extensively on the work of the association.
He himself was in Mauritania for the first time in 2004 at the Cheijk-Zajed Hospital in Nouakchott.
As a result, a further cooperation developed, and the gynecologist Henne performed numerous operations on site on several trips.
During the speeches, pictures of the operations were shown on a large screen, so that the guests of the anniversary event could get a picture of the mentioned actions.
The club's desert vehicle was also shown.
It is a former federal border patrol vehicle.
Rainer Prewo, the former OB of Nagold, had made the proposal to equip this vehicle with a photovoltaic system and now plans, according to Henne, to work in an advisory role at the association.
In 2008, the carpentry company Schleeh from Baiersbronn created the hospital in Socogim, a slum on the outskirts of the capital, in the record time of just under a week - on a voluntary basis.
Henne also mentioned a new mother-child hospital in Nouakchott
Particularly interesting in times when the birth clinic is to be rationalized away in Nagold.
One learns a lot in Africa as a physician, so Henne, for example, deceleration against burn-out.
Due to the political unrest in the country, you could not make as many trips as planned, but many doctors came to Germany to hospitate in different areas.
In addition, containers of material are regularly sent to Africa, such as medical equipment, medicines, bandages, hospital beds and glasses in March this year.
Co-initiator Hans-Joachim Fuchtel himself provided plenty of local color by telling from Mauritania about Mercedes vehicles converted into a mobile goat stable and describing the experiences of the Stammheim musicians, who traditionally support the association, on their Mauritania trip.
As his personal motivations, he mentioned his work in the area of auditing as a young member of parliament.
When he realized how much money was lost along the way, he decided to help the Africans control a budget by the people.
In addition, Fuchtel stressed that the global economy also demands global love for humanity.
It should not be forgotten that Africa is closer than some people think.
From Gran Canaria it is not far to Africa.
Coulson used phone hacking to check a tip
Former News of the Word editor Andy Coulson allegedly used “telephone hacking, surveillance and confrontation” in an attempt to confirm a false tip about an affair by then-Secretary of the Interior Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the Old Bailey court in May 2005 that News of the World had heard a false rumor that Clarke was having an affair with his “attractive special counsel” Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper hired private investigator Glenn Mulcaire to hack and track Pawlby's voicemails, but Coulson also called them and left messages, as the court learned.
"According to the prosecutor's office, Coulson, who is now the editor of NotW, is no one who stands in front of people's homes and hopes to catch them in the act, but one who likes to confront people with a story to see their reaction," Edis said.
He said NotW uses three procedures to investigate stories investigatively: phone hacking, surveillance, and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third method.
Obviously he knows about the second, the surveillance, it can not be otherwise.
What about the first one?
Does he know about the phone hacking?
He denies it, but we say, "And if he knew about it."
Rumors of Clarke’s affair were first picked up by NotW’s feature editorial team when a source who was sexually interested in Pawlby was told, “Don’t waste your time, she’s with Charles.”
A tape of voicemails from her phone of at least three occasions was secured in Mulcaire's apartment in August 2006.
Investigators also found records on the detective’s computer where Pawlby and her sister were stored as “projects.”
During the time the research was going on, Pawlby’s grandparents received anonymous calls asking for information about them, Edis explained.
Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup oversaw Pawlby’s movements.
On June 18, 2005, Coulson left her a voicemail saying, “I have a story we want to bring out tomorrow that I’d like to talk about with Charles.”
Edis explained that Coulson’s activities in this story followed the same pattern as other key figures, such as former Secretary of the Interior David Blunkett.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson confronted Blunkett about an affair with a married woman when he himself was engaged to co-defendant Rebekah Brooks, who had been married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks denied conspiring with others to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted to phone hacking.
In protest against the planned tax on the rich, French football will actually go through the first strike since 1972.
A conciliation meeting comes to an end without result.
In the conflict over the tax on the rich, the government and professional football in France have manoeuvred into a dead end after a failed conciliation meeting.
President Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande received association and association representatives at the <0xC3><0x89>lysée Palace in Paris on Thursday and listened to their complaints.
However, he refused to spare football from the planned 75 percent levy on income of more than one million euros per year, which all companies in the country are expected to pay for two years from 2014.
The other side was tough, too.
The strike announced for the end of November will now also be carried out, said the head of the association of professional clubs (UCPF), Jean-Pierre Louvel.
The matchdays scheduled between 29 November and 2 December in Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 are thus cancelled.
Gechingen: No absolute protection possible
"We want to involve the residents in the planning at an early stage," Mayor Jens H<0xC3><0xA4>u<0xC3><0x9F>ler opened the citizens' information event on the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
Around 80 participants had come to the community hall to have the planned measures explained to them, to ask questions, to express concerns and to contribute ideas.
H<0xC3><0xA4>u<0xC3><0x9F>ler clarified: "The final decisions are made by the members of the municipal council."
The flood, which hit Gechingen on 15 May 2009, unprepared, was a drastic event that raised the question of protective measures for the future, according to H<0xC3><0xA4>u<0xC3><0x9F>ler.
A river basin survey was commissioned with the neighbouring municipality of Aidlingen, which is now the basis for the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
"The protection of as many built-up plots as possible is the goal," said H<0xC3><0xA4>u<0xC3><0x9F>ler.
Based on the planning of the protection against a flood to be expected statistically every 100 years according to the German weather service.
The climate change is taken into account by a 15% surcharge.
In professional circles, this is referred to as "HQ 100aKlima".
The water masses, which had led to considerable damage in Gechingen in 2009, corresponded to a 1,000-year flood.
"There is no absolute protection, but we can achieve a relative improvement," said H<0xC3><0xA4>u<0xC3><0x9F>ler.
In order to achieve the HQ 100aKlima protection, around four million euros have to be invested in Gechingen, whereby the municipality can expect state subsidies of around 70 percent.
H<0xC3><0xA4>u<0xC3><0x9F>ler pointed out, however, that the funding only exists if an overall concept is implemented.
For this, the community is dependent on the participation of the citizens.
An elaborate planning and approval process must be completed.
In the best case scenario, implementation could begin in 2016.
Among other things, the protection concept, which was already presented to the municipal council last week (we reported) provides for local measures in the inflow of the river Irm from the Stammheimer Valley.
Following the presentation of the flood protection concept, the participants took the opportunity to contribute their concerns.
Among other things, it was questioned why more dams and retention basins were not planned to protect the site.
Gregor Kühn, specialist planner of the commissioned engineering firm Wald und Corbe from Hügelsheim, who presented the concept, emphasized that it required the interaction of all the measures presented in order to achieve the desired goal in total.
In addition, it is necessary to find the most economical solution, says Joachim Wald of Wald and Corbe.
There was displeasure among residents of the old town, who have to suffer from an overload of the sewer network even during normal thunderstorms.
The problem is known to the administration and initial measures have already been taken.
However, H<0xC3><0xA4>u<0xC3><0x9F>ler pointed out that the guidelines for sewer systems were different from those for flood protection and that this should not be mixed.
The municipality is obliged to interpret the sewer network in such a way that two to three years of rain events could be tolerated.
To increase the size of the sewers would consume millions.
Severely Injured After Collision
In the early Friday afternoon, two drivers were seriously injured in a frontal collision on Landesstra<0xC3><0x9F>e 44 near Revensdorf.
The police immediately blocked the road completely, but could initially say little about the accident.
However, there are various testimonies that should be evaluated first.
It is certain that the 19-year-old driver of a VW Golf drove towards Revensdorf and the 38-year-old man from Gettorf came to meet her with his Hyundai.
Both vehicles collided, with the woman being so severely trapped that it took the fire department just under half an hour to get her out of the wreckage.
The actual cause of the accident was initially unclear.
Both victims were taken to nearby hospitals.
The track remained closed for about two hours.
One could call him the Dostoevsky of the United States.
Philip K. Dick was a God-seeker, a metaphysician, his novels and narratives also have something serial.
Astonishing the kinship in the exterior: the stinging eyes, the beard, the high forehead.
And just as Fyodor M. Dostoyevsky, with his massive oeuvre, is to be understood as the founder and apologist of the Russian soul, one reads Philip K. Dick as an American prophet, who certainly applies something in his own country.
Some titles have been published by Heyne Verlag, the Haffmans cassette with the 118 stories sells two thousand eins.
Dick explains America - the realm of breathtaking technical progress, coupled with paranoia, security craze and the belief of being chosen.
Dick had experiences of God, his late books read like a mixture of the Revelation of John and a computer manual.
Maybe he was crazy, had drugs attached to his brain.
He understood, early on, that the calculators are divinities.
He wrote a theology of the computer and asked what distinguishes a man from a machine, the creator from his creature.
That's the Blade Runner problem.
The killing.
A master of science fiction.
A fantastic writer.
His stories have inspired film directors such as Ridley Scott, Paul Verhoeven and Steven Spielberg.
This story is particularly significant now.
The "Minority Report" dates back to 1956, it exudes the smell of the Cold War and the McCarthy Tribunals.
It is here that the principle of "pre-crime" is developed, "pre-crime", that is, what is now more or less official doctrine of the White House.
In Dick's terrifying world, mutants look to the future - and the police seize.
“We are recording individuals who have not violated any law,” the head of the agency says.
"We'll catch them even before they can commit a violent crime".
And: "In our society there are no serious criminals, but we have a penal camp full of pesud criminals".
They assume that bad things are happening and prevent the criminal idea from being put into action.
Dick's narrative acts like the blueprint for the anti-terror laws and the NSA's wiretapping frenzy.
Anticipation of the attack: This is how Obama’s drone philosophy and practice works.
But Dick's story isn't over yet.
The police chief complains that there is no longer a separation of powers, the military controls everyday life - and what is left of the state.
Then the supervisor himself is monitored and convicted of a future crime.
The system is going crazy.
It's perfect, but it's lying.
It invents its own presuppositions.
Don’t just accept mistakes and sacrifices, but build on them.
The system creates the danger it fights.
To read Philip K. Dick is to keep coming closer to the truth.
Merkel's scandals in Russia
The former US intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in the US spy affair around Chancellor Angela Merkel in his Russian asylum.
Representatives of the German federal prosecutor’s office could either ask questions in writing or meet the 30-year-old in person in Russia, the agency Interfax reported.
Earlier yesterday, Hans-Christian Ströbele, a member of the Green Party, was the first German politician to meet Snowden in Moscow to talk to him about the affair.
NSA disclosures increase corporate paranoia over state surveillance
On a mild day at the end of August, a German police helicopter flew deep over the US consulate in Frankfurt am Main, the financial capital of Germany.
At the direction of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution and the Fight against Terrorism (Bundesamt für Verfassungsschutz und counter-terrorism (BVT), the German domestic intelligence service, he was to photograph the roof of the US outpost, which is located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
According to German media, the BAT wanted to prove the presence of surveillance antennas and the action led to a change of words between the US and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, US Director of National Intelligence, once again insisted in September that the U.S. did not use foreign espionage capabilities “to steal the trade secrets of foreign companies on behalf of U.S. companies so that they could expand their international competitiveness or their profits.”
But since Edward Snowden, the former whistleblower, began publishing his cornucopia of U.S. surveillance secrets, European governments and corporate leaders are no longer sure they can take the director at his word.
Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency has been spying on Brazilian oil company Petrobas and obtaining data from American cloud providers including Google and Yahoo have raised corporate paranoia to a new all-time high for state surveillance.
The barrel to overflowing brought the revelation that Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone was bugged, possibly for ten years.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then corporate leaders are certainly also potential targets.
Snowden has made the intensive cooperation between U.S. intelligence agencies and companies transparent.
I believe it is conceivable that this data will be used for mutual benefit.
"Germany has to wake up," explains Oliver Grün, President of BITMi, which represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
German companies believe the U.S. now represents almost as much of a risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, according to a survey published in July by consulting firm EY.
In the documents leaked by Snowden, however, there has been no evidence so far that the US has passed on the trade secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians have expressed concern that the EU lacks certain IT and Internet capabilities and should reduce its dependence on the US.
Companies are skeptical about this.
In the Bundestag it was suggested that we should build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
"That's not how it works," says Hasso Plattner, chairman of the German software manufacturer SAP.
If you wanted a strong European IT industry, you shouldn’t have let it die out 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidized, from coal to cars and agriculture.
Anything but the IT industry.
Nevertheless, the reach and technical sophistication of the US spy agencies uncovered by the Snowden revelations have shocked companies that had previously seen the greatest risk of espionage in China.
Cloud computing is undergoing a major change as European business leaders are now more aware that data stored in the US is subject to U.S. jurisdiction and therefore potentially at risk.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a trading institution, following the revelations about the U.S. data mining activities with Prism, about ten percent of non-U.S.-based members rejected plans to use an American provider.
Jim Snabe, SAP’s deputy chief executive, said: “We’re seeing a new question from customers that didn’t exist a year ago – it’s: Where will my data be stored and can you guarantee that it will remain physically in this jurisdiction?”
Many German business leaders believe that the latest reports simply confirm what they already knew, namely that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and therefore must be guarded at all costs.
That economic espionage is taking place is no surprise.
That's always been the case.
“For many years it was an issue and the current discussion has not fundamentally changed it,” says Kurt Bock, Chairman of the chemical company BASF.
The Americans are spying on us on a commercial and industrial level, just as we are, because it is in the national interest to defend our companies.
Management usually doesn’t brag about the countermeasures they’ve taken, because that gives attackers advantages.
In large companies, employees have long been told that taking a free USB stick at a trade fair or leaving a laptop unattended in the hotel room is not advisable, to say the least.
Ulrich Hackenberk, a board member at car manufacturer Audi, says that it has been standard practice for years to collect mobile phones before a board meeting so that they cannot be used as listening devices.
The German BVT advises executives to use simple prepaid phones when they go on trips abroad, because smartphones may be compromised.
The prepaid phones are thrown away afterwards.
However, there is concern that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many of these companies are global market leaders in their respective niches.
“Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack the experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect trade secrets against unauthorized access,” the BAT warned in a report.
The US warns its own companies against economic espionage by other countries.
According to the Washington Post, in the US National Intelligence Estimate in February, France, Russia, and Israel were ranked second behind China, among the countries that used hacking to obtain economic data.
A board member of a German blue-chip company agreed that when it comes to economic espionage, “the French are the worst.”
Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French interior intelligence service DCRL, was quoted this month in an interview as saying: “The intelligence services know very well that all countries, even if they cooperate in the fight against terror, are spying on their allies.”
Hechingen: Trade fair gives answers to wedding questions
“Marriage is the most important journey of discovery that man can undertake,” said the philosopher Sören Kierkegaard.
Tips on how at least the wedding celebration succeeds, there was now a special fair in the domain in Hechingen.
They were important providers around a wedding.
A trend: The retro look has returned.
It starts with the wedding dresses.
White is must, best covered or in cream.
At the front, the often ruffled and embroidered dresses are closed, often with a veil, but at the back they go down the back and often end in a train.
However, as Stefanie Koch from the fashion house Kleidermüller emphasizes, the ghosts separate.
For men, the suit with vest and plastron dominates, but you can also choose cream or brown combinations.
The choice of location is important, he explained.
Unadorned side rooms are not optimal, the ambience should be special.
Here the domain drew attention to its own offer in the coach house.
If you want to take a ride, then you have an offer.
“Cuts are also popular for young people’s parties,” he says.
Romance is also in demand for invitation cards, flower arrangements and also for wedding pictures.
The "after-wedding photo" is becoming more and more fashionable - i.e. series of photos at special locations, preferably waterfalls, a few days after the festival, but in wedding clothes, explained Elisabeth Keidel.
Many more details of a successful wedding were presented in the domain on Sunday.
Flower arrangement, rings, wedding table, cakes and also a magician, such as Marko Ripperger, who can entertain guests in style.
Not to mention the right cosmetics and nail care.
Everything for an unforgettable party.
Dog Friends Successfully
Once again, the athletes of the dog friends Bitz were successful in a rally obedience tournament.
Achim Scherrenbacher started in Kandel with two dogs; with his dog Sandy he scored 94 points in the beginner class and secured fifth place, and with the 15-month-old Marley he took it to twelfth place with 87 points.
Susi Höpp and her Woody took a critical look at the performance judge in class 1.
Parents of Georgia teenager who died in tragic accident believe in murder
The parents of the teenager, whose body was found in a coiled ringer mat in the gym of his high school, are convinced that their son was murdered, the family's lawyer said on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson of Valdosta, Georgia, was found on Jan. 11 in an upright mat behind the grandstand in the gymnasium.
Lowndes County Sheriff's investigators concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident, which the 17-year-old's family doubted.
“They are convinced that their son was murdered,” Benjamin Crump, Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson’s attorney, told FoxNews.com.
They never thought he had died the way the sheriff had concluded.
"They believe that there is no logic to be found in violating the laws of physics and common sense," Crump said.
Rather, they are convinced that the truth is being covered up to protect the person or persons responsible for the death of their son.
"Your son went to school to study and came back in a body bag," he comments.
U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said Thursday there will be a formal investigation into Johnson’s death as a number of important issues remain unresolved.
What was the cause of death?
Is his death due to a crime?
This was stated by Moore at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I follow the facts in whatever direction they lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I believe there is a sufficient basis for a formal investigation," he said.
Moore told reporters that the initial autopsy indicated that Johnson had died as a result of “position-related suffocation.”
A second autopsy revealed a different cause of death, Moore said.
"There are a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed," he said.
Moore added that if there is sufficient evidence to support a criminal or civil investigation into Johnson’s death, he would instruct the FBI to conduct the investigation.
A representative of the County Sheriff’s Office was not immediately ready to comment on our request on Thursday.
A court in southern Georgia on Wednesday ordered authorities to release all surveillance videos that investigators reviewed.
The teenager’s parents said they hoped the video recordings contained clues to how he died.
CDC Releases Allergy Guidelines for Schools
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a set of guidelines for dealing with food allergies from children in schools.
These are the first such guidelines issued by the U.S. government as the number of school-age children with food allergies increases.
One in 20 children in the United States now has a food allergy.
The prevalence of food allergies among children increased by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007, according to the CDC.
The guidelines contain information for schools to raise awareness of food allergies among teachers and staff and how to deal with children who show allergic reactions.
It is also recommended that schools have epinephrine in stock—the EpiPen brand’s auto-injection is most commonly used—to counter a potentially fatal hypersensitivity reaction.
State legislators have recently amended regulations to make it easier for schools to keep epinephrine in stock.
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms cited by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children may say, “It feels like something is pressing on my tongue,” “My tongue feels like a hair is on it,” or “My tongue is tingling.”
Parents of intersex children can choose ‘gender indeterminate’
Germany is the first European nation to recognize a third sex for children born with indistinct genitalia.
Newborns are no longer rigidly assigned male or female.
Under the new law, parents no longer have to declare sex for such children, but can indicate "indefinite" or "undetermined" on the birth certificate.
The aim of the law is to take the pressure off parents so that they do not have to make hasty decisions regarding operations for gender assignment in newborns, and to combat discrimination against intersex people.
An intersex person said years later, according to the BBC, “I am neither a man nor a woman.”
I remain the patchwork created by doctors, mutilated and full of scars.
It is estimated that one out of every 2,000 children is born as neither a boy nor a girl every year.
They belong to the intersex, a group that falls under the diagnosis of "sexual differentiation disorder" (DSD), a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, germ glands (ovaries or testicles) or unusually developed genitalia.
Wallis Simpson may have been intersex.
Understanding gender identification is still not very well developed, but most experts in the U.S. recommend using the best available sex-assignment information if a determination is not possible, and not waiting for the child’s psychological and physical development before deciding on surgery, if at all.
New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in the issue of gender identification, said the new German law “sounds like a good thing.”
Intersex children are an ethical dilemma.
“Some people have life-threatening conditions that require surgery, but most children don’t,” he said.
One can do a gender assignment without surgery and then wait to see how the identity develops.
The scientific data on how a child develops their gender identity at all is not very accurate.
No one knows why it happens.
It’s like the secret to why people are gay.
A 2011 report to the European Commission states that intersex people are to be distinguished from transsexual or transgender people, because their status is not gender-related, but conditioned by their biological constitution, which is neither exclusively male nor female, but typically both at the same time or not clearly defined as one of them.
These characteristics were manifested in secondary sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hair, breasts and stature, primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals, or in chromosome structures and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender individuals in professional life, as well as the extent of harassment, violence and prejudice crime.
Boys not in line with the gender picture now have a special camp.
In Australia and Nepal, it is now possible for adults to indicate male, female or "third sex" on official documents.
In June, Australian Norrie May-Welby, 52, was recognized as the world’s first “genderless” person after a court granted lifelong retention of “undetermined” sex status.
In addition to M and W, German ID cards will in future have a third allocation, X for intersex, according to the Ministry of the Interior.
In neighboring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a news report on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French deputies from the strictly Catholic country signed a petition that the "gender theory" should be removed from school books.
Catholic Online has also spoken out against German law, stating: “If the world is dragged into a new state where gender is a choice, but sexual activity is not, then we are twisting two more pillars of civilization.”
The mother of a Maryland newborn told Baby Zone that she would find it better if babies were assigned a gender at birth.
“Parenting is stressful enough, even without further restrictions, especially if you don’t know your child’s gender,” she said.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children born with both male and female genitals were referred to as hermaphrodites, after the attractive Greek god who had both sexes.
Just ten years ago, medicine viewed gender as something that could be erased and then rebuilt.
But now the ethical foundations of an operation are being challenged, now that it is known how complex the gender identity is, and that doctors can also be wrong because they do not know how the child feels growing up with the sex they assign.
“In the mid-20th century, this was called a psychiatric emergency,” Drescher said.
When such a child was born, it was not the psychiatrist who was called, but the surgeon.
The prevailing theory on the treatment of children with inconclusive genitalia goes back to Dr. Johns Hopkins University’s view that gender is malleable.
He coined the term “gender identity” and argued that social and environmental cues—like parents raising a child—interacted with a child’s genes and hormones, shaping whether a person viewed himself as male or female.
However, in a 1966 case known as John/Joan, his theories became controversial.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been severed during a botched circumcision to castrate the child completely and also to remove his testicles and then raise him as a girl.
"Money presented this case as a successful example of a transformation, which it was not," Drescher said.
When the boy was about 15, he switched back to the male sex and married a woman.
At 38, he committed suicide.
According to Drescher, there are still doctors who would practice this model.
However, in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, survivors of these sex surgeries have come to the public, who are "not happy with the result."
For example, Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old author from Montana, who was born with XY male chromosomes, but ambiguous genitalia.
The doctors were not clear about whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced he could never live a “satisfactory life” as a man.
So his external organ and testicles were surgically removed shortly after birth in 1976 and he was raised as a girl.
At the age of 12, he was given female hormones.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he told ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he should receive a vaginal plastic.
But because he was depressed and knew something was wrong, he requested his medical records.
What he found was shocking.
I was sterilized at birth, and no one ever told me that.
Bruce was born with a DSD that prevented his body from producing enough testosterone to develop the genitals.
After learning the truth, he switched back to male identity, received testosterone injections, and had his breasts removed.
The operation made him infertile.
Today, he fights for others in an organization called the Interface Project for intersex people to be perceived as normal.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, managing director of the California-based legal group Advocates for Informed Choice, worries that German law can “encourage stamping and stigmatization.”
"Many activists are concerned that the German decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and assign the child a 'undetermined'," she said.
We fear that this favours intervention.
We think it would be better to assign the male or female gender and then wait.
But we still don’t know how the law will work, so we can only speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said her organization supports Australian law because “it allows adults to be recognized as third sex.”
“Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal gender,” she said.
The German law is about the attribution at birth.
This is not a fight that should be forced on young children at this time.
When they grow up, they can decide for themselves about their body.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a Pittsburg-based breast radiologist who has a daughter with a sexual differentiation disorder and supports hundreds of others in a support group, says German law “enforces” both parents and children.
Katie, the daughter of Baratz, was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called complete androgen resistance.
Because of the receptor defect of the target cells for testosterone, Katie developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus and no ovaries.
Today, Katie is 29 and married; she works at the University of Pennsylvania as an employee in child psychiatry.
Although she is infertile, she hopes to have a child through adoption or a surrogate mother.
“The law gives parents space, so they do not have to make hasty decisions,” Baratz said.
It gives them time to do various tests and clarify things, and so gives them time before they write "male" or "female."
In this way, everything is fine – you raise the child and love it.
You have a wonderful baby and enjoy the happiness of your parents.
And you don’t have to rush into an operation that can’t be reversed.
“That includes the children in the decision and eliminates the fear that parents are having because they think they are not doing the right thing,” she explained.
Ultimately, the child decides on the gender that suits him better – and that’s wonderful.
This enables children to make their own decisions.
Unknown girl hurt by gunshot from car
Unknown people have injured a twelve-year-old in Saxony-Anhalt during shots from a car.
The perpetrators had probably fired on a group of children with an air pressure weapon on Thursday evening in Genthin.
This was reported by the police in Burg.
The girl was easily injured in the left calf.
Rescuers took the girl to the hospital.
The shot came from a small car that had passed a group of six children and had suddenly stopped.
Witnesses saw two people sitting in the car.
The attackers also shot at a bus stop.
A disk broke.
Then they drove away.
The criminal investigation, it said on Friday.
Until now, the Kempten police inspectorate can look back on a quiet Halloween night.
The officials were only called twice to egg-throwing children, who threw them against house facades.
Since the house owners recognized this in time and immediately removed the egg remnants, no material damage should have occurred.
In addition, some New Year's Eve fires were probably also ignited in the city area, but no material damage has occurred here either.
A local resident in the Bischof-Freundorfer-Weg reported that his car was wrapped in toilet paper and his wheel trims were stolen.
Until the arrival of the police, however, the man found all his wheel trims in the immediate vicinity again, which is why the police did not have to take further action.
Living with a future perspective
Waltraud Ries actually lives dreamily.
Your house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with lots of greenery, an old tree population, nice neighbors and not too much traffic.
The city is only a few minutes away by public transport.
"I hope you're not afraid of spiders?" asks Waltraud Ries, pointing at a fat spider on the door frame.
I have been looking for a new apartment for my husband and me for some time now.
But you know how difficult that is in Stuttgart.
The reason, however, is not spider phobia, but the worry of not being able to cope with the many stairs to the house and in the apartment in old age, she explains.
In addition, since a meniscus operation, the mid-fifties have had to experience on their own what it means to move from floor to floor with a handicap.
Recently, she published a book on the topic 'Happy living in old age - Which form of living is the best for me?'.
'Our apartment is the best example of what can't be done in old age,' she begins to tell.
When she moved into the duplex apartment with her husband more than 20 years ago, it was just a beautiful apartment surrounded by greenery.
Today, at the age of fifty, Waltraud Ries thinks differently.
But she also knows that she is one of the few people who even deal with the topic of 'living in old age'.
Most of them will leave as long as they can.
Only the others get old,” she says with a smile.
Only when the pressure of suffering is really great, do you think.
“It may be too late,” Ries said.
In her book, the interior designer presents 17 living models for self-determined living in old age.
'But which form of housing you choose is always an individual decision,' she explains.
The solution is not for old age.
Even those who can afford retirement in Tuscany or Brittany should always consider that they can also get sick.
And: 'Without good knowledge of the national language you can also be lonely in the Dolce Vita,' the specialist book author gives to consider those who want to emigrate.
Among their models are classic care models, alternative forms of housing or the often cited pensioner flat.
In old age, everyone has their ticks and quirks
"For me, such a community would be nothing," she says with a wink.
Not at all like in a student flat with a shared bathroom and a kitchen.
'In old age, you just need your retreat rooms,' says Ries.
Nevertheless, the author does not want to rule out the fact that a senior living community can still work.
However, this would have to be different than in the classic student flat.
And sometimes you just want to rest,' she believes.
With this opinion, she is not alone, at least in the state capital.
'Most old people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own apartment for as long as possible', is also the experience of Theresa Rütten, the head of the citizens' service life at the age of the state capital.
Her department advises people around the topic of 'getting older'.
Therefore, especially older people would often also accept inconveniences and restrictions, only in order to be able to stay in their usual environment, this is also the experience of Stiftung Warentest.
Today, there are many ways to make the house or apartment barrier-free.
Ries recommends that anyone who is concerned with the age-appropriate renovation of their house or apartment first thoroughly inform themselves and not commission the first craftsmen.
Today, there are also specialists for age-appropriate remodeling.
Even in the rented apartment, one or the other can be realized, and if it is only the toilet seat increase, the interior designer clarifies.
But it is not always possible to transform the existing apartment according to age and thus barrier-free, even if it is still beautiful.
Waltraud Ries had to make this experience.
Although you could install a stair lift inside the apartment, the path also paved with stairs to the apartment door would be the much larger obstacle.
She will continue searching until she has found the ideal object for herself and her husband.
Before the move, she is more horrified than before the spider at her apartment door.
U.S. wants Snowden prosecuted
The U.S. has not changed its stance on former U.S. intelligence official Edward Snowden.
He is also accused of leaking classified information illegally.
So he has to face a criminal case in the US, said the spokeswoman for the US State Department, Jennifer Psaki, in Washington.
Even Snowden’s recent statements would not change that.
Earlier, German Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele had called on the US after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow to stop threatening him with punishment.
Psaki stressed that Ströbele’s statements were those of a parliamentarian and not those of a German government member.
Edward Snowden is in principle ready to talk to German authorities.
First, however, he wants to clarify his situation.
This was made clear by the former NSA employee sought by the US in an unaddressed letter published by Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and forwarded to the Federal Government, the Bundestag and the Attorney General.
According to a translation published by Ströbele, the letter is worded as follows:
To those in charge
I was asked to write to you about your investigation into mass surveillance.
My name is Edward Joseph Snowden and I used to be contracted or employed by the National Security Agency (NSA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) of the United States.
In the course of my employment in these institutions, I witnessed systematic violations of the law by my government, which caused me to act out of moral duty.
As a result of the publication of these concerns, I saw myself exposed to severe and persistent incitement that forced me to leave my family and home.
I am currently living in exile and enjoy temporary asylum granted to me by the Russian Federation under international law.
I am encouraged by the response to my political actions, both in the United States and elsewhere.
Citizens around the world, as well as senior officials — including the United States — have judged the revelations about a system of all-encompassing surveillance that holds no one accountable as a service to the public.
These spy revelations attracted many proposals for new laws and policies aimed at the previously covert abuse of public trust.
The benefits to society from these findings are becoming increasingly clear; at the same time, the risks accepted have been visibly reduced.
Although the outcome of my efforts has been demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat dissent as a breach of faith and seeks to criminalize and impeach political expression.
To speak the truth is not a crime.
I am confident that the United States government, with the support of the international community, will abandon this injurious stance.
I hope that, once the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved, I will be able to participate adequately and lawfully in the responsible clarification of the facts regarding the statements made in the media, in particular with regard to the truth and authenticity of the reports.
I look forward to speaking with you in your country as soon as the situation is resolved and thank you for your efforts to uphold the international law that protects us all.

Kindergarten has found a private buyer
"The building is in good hands," says Winterlingen's mayor Michael Maier.
The former kindergarten in Gartenstra<0xC3><0x9F>e has been sold by the municipality to a private individual.
The sale was approved by the local council in its most recent meeting in the non-public part.
The building changed its owner at a "reasonable" price.
"The community is satisfied," says Maier.
The budget was set at 100,000 euros.
It is not yet clear how the new owner wants to use the former kindergarten.
The mayor is right that Winterlingen has handed over responsibility for the building to someone else before the winter and thus no longer has to pay for the entertainment of the house, such as heating, looking after the garden and clearing the sidewalk.
"This effort is now gone," says Maier.
Square concert in midsummer temperatures
The Musikverein Hammereisenbach gives a square concert on the terrace of the Gasthaus Hammer.
When conductor Bianca Willmann raises the baton at 7.30 p.m., the thermometer still shows 25 degrees.
About 50 listeners enjoy the sounds of the Hammrich musicians.
Chairman Manuela Honeck explains the music.
In this context, Honeck thanked all those who had helped to successfully cope with the first musician’s hurdle.
Report: Obama campaign considered replacing Biden with Hillary Clinton
The closest advisers to President Barack Obama have been secretly considering replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton in the 2012 election campaign, according to the New York Times.
The unveiling is the most noteworthy surprise of Mark Halperin and John Heilemann’s long-awaited work on the 2012 election campaign, “Double Down: Game Change 2012.”
The Times has a copy of the forthcoming book, and it reported Thursday night that the president’s top advisers had conducted “extensive group meetings and polls in late 2011” to see if Obama’s dwindling hope of re-election would look better if he dropped Biden.
According to Jonathan Martin, National Policy Correspondent of the Times, the book thoroughly retraces the efforts of campaign and White House leaders, including former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, to measure the effect on poll scores of swapping former Secretary of State Clinton for vice president.
The potential shift was a closely guarded secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen of the president’s closest advisers — including Daley, former Obama campaign chief Jim Messina, and former White House senior advisers David Axelrod and David Plouffe — knew about the proposed change.
Double Down claims Daley was at the forefront of efforts to replace Biden despite her “close, personal relationship” before finally deciding against such a move after the data showed that Clinton’s candidacy “would not significantly improve Obama’s chances.”
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the government had actually considered replacing Biden with Clinton.
“I said a whole bunch of things to consider, and that was one of them,” Daley told the magazine.
It must be remembered that the president had terrible poll scores back then, so we thought, "For God's sake, what are we doing?"
While Daley described the investigations as “provided care,” Martin told CNN’s Anderson Cooper that during the campaign for re-election, considerable effort had been made to find out whether such a move would pay off in terms of ballot boxes.
“Campaigns don’t spend that much money on surveys and focus groups if you don’t think seriously about something,” Martin told AC360.
It is not clear, however, whether Obama knew his team was thinking about an exchange.
Martin told CNN he asked Daley if his then boss knew about the potential switch.
Although Daley said he did not believe the president was “aware” of the possible change, the former chief of staff admitted that it was “possible” that Obama had known about it.
Martin added that "Double Down" did not provide a definitive answer to the question of whether the political probes had reached Obama's desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought Obama knew nothing about the investigation into whether to drop Biden in the election.
“Possibly,” Martin replied.
What happens to my email on the way?
Email is actually an electronic letter.
When designing the Internet service, was e-mail technically implemented in a similar way to conventional mail?
When designing the early Internet services, the focus was on making communication possible.
For this reason, the basic technical protocols have not been careful to provide a stable foundation for a hearing-proof correspondence.
Therefore, a conventional email is more like an open postcard than a sealed letter.
If user "Anna" sends an email to "Benni", are the computers of the two directly connected?
In the first step, Anna’s e-mail program or browser sends the e-mail to the mail server of her service provider.
For example, if she has a Gmail account, it would be Google.
This mail server sends the content to the provider that Benni uses.
On the way, the mail can run through several other servers on the Internet.
Bennie can then call the content at his provider.
Are traditional e-mails being read on their way through the net?
Most e-mails are read several times on the way by software robots.
The sender's provider usually checks whether the mail carries a malicious program as an attachment.
A virus check is also carried out on the receiver systems.
In addition, the providers check whether it is an annoying and unwanted spam mail that is immediately deleted or at least sorted into a spam folder.
Do the robots have another task?
For systems such as Gmail, the robot also determines the information Google needs to place context ads.
If Anna and Benni communicate via Gmail about their upcoming holiday trip, Google can display corresponding links to holiday offers.
Do unknown people read e-mails?
The probability that unauthorized persons read an email is extremely low.
In theory, however, this is possible.
In companies, administrators often have the opportunity to read e-mail.
Law enforcement agencies and intelligence agencies also have legal ways to intercept or take notice of e-mails.
In addition, there are possible illegal spying actions.
Is it possible to protect e-mails from being read?
With an encryption according to the OpenPGP standard, an e-mail can be effectively encrypted against reading.
With a high technical effort, it is also possible to disguise the metadata of an e-mail communication, so that it is not even easy to recognize who has communicated with whom.
How important are Yahoo and Google in the email market in Germany?
Yahoo and Google play only a minor role in the mostly privately used mailboxes, according to an August 2013 study by Convios Consulting.
While the shares of Yahoo Mail had recently fallen, Gmail from Google was able to increase significantly.
Mother in the forest buried and pension collected
When his elderly mother died, a man from Wolfsburg made a plan.
He buried the dead in a forest - and continued to collect their pension and care allowance.
In order to continue to collect pensions and nursing allowances, a 67-year-old Wolfsburger buried his dead mother in the forest after investigations by the police.
First, he covered up the death of the 89-year-old, then he cut in the money for more than a year and a half.
The 67-year-old has been charged with fraud, a spokesman said on Friday.
The man hid the woman in a forest near Helmstedt.
The man was suspected in May: At that time, it was noticed that no more drugs were needed for the mother in need of care.
The investigators told the pensioner that his mother had traveled to Spain.
Because this seemed strange to the officers, they continued to investigate.
It turned out that the two had lived in a common apartment for more than 15 years and he had last cared for them.
The 67-year-old admitted to his mother's death.
According to the police, an autopsy showed no evidence of a capital crime.
Fancy ice cream that glows in the dark?
A British entrepreneur has developed the first glowing ice in the dark – with the help of jellyfish.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of the marine animals and created a luminous treat from it.
The idea came to him after he read a research paper on jellyfish and was able to convince Chinese scientists to artificially make the glowing protein.
The ice cream reacts with the tongue when consumed, which raises the pH in the protein and triggers the glow.
Chris explains that the ice cream reacts to the heat in the mouth and glows – so the more you lick, the brighter it gets.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company "Lick Me I'm Delicious", says: "The product is incredible, but still in a very early production phase, and so you get two grams of it for 200 pounds."
The protein used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue at a neutral pH.
When the mouth warms the protein, the pH rises and the ice shines.
We have tested it over the last few months and it seemed ideal to launch it on Halloween because it has this wonderful lighting effect.
It’s probably the most expensive ice cream I’ve ever made, because the jellyfish phosphor is four times more expensive than gold.
Each bullet costs me about 140 pounds.
But for that it tastes delicious.
Charlie’s experimental company based in Bristol is famous for its unusual flavors, which include beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf.
But his latest creation should be even more ambitious.
He says, "I'd like to develop an invisible ice cream."
This is in and of itself impossible because of the refraction of light caused by the ice crystals that make up ice cream; but I suspect we will find a way to make it.
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a jellyfish, which are artificially made by Chinese scientists
The TSV Morsum is after six matchdays still without any point in the handball league.
It’s just now that the team of Ingo Ehlers will face TSV Daverden tomorrow, who celebrated his first victory last weekend.
With this game, the season starts anew for us.
"I hope we finally have our heads free," Ehlers says optimistically.
With the exception of the permanently injured Hendrik Blohme, he finally has his entire squad at his disposal.
Daverden, like us, also relies on tempo play.
Therefore, we need to keep our error rate low.
In the first place, however, it is important to increase in the coverage, which has recently left everything but a safe impression.
Daverdens coach Thomas Panitz is much more relaxed after the first win of the season against Nordhorn.
The game was, of course, a house number.
But that’s why we’re still far from the favourite, because anything can happen in the derby.
Nevertheless, Panitz now wants to follow up in Morsum to start a series.
Jan-Malte Jodat is missing.
Joost Wind<0xC3><0x9F>u<0xC3><0x9F>, who is active with double play rights at the A-Jugend-Bundesliga HC Bremen, is celebrating his season debut.
Anyone who is not hot in such a game should stay home.
Halloween 2013: In numbers
When I was little, Halloween had something magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, stay up late, and dress up for the neighborhood.
Today I have become more of a Halloween muffler.
For the last two years I have not agreed to distribute sweets from my apartment, and probably will not do it this year.
But according to statistics, I'm a black sheep when it comes to Halloween.
The majority of Americans — 158 million, to be exact — are celebrating Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 billion on candy, costumes, and decorations, according to the U.S. Retail Federation (NRF).
One thing I look forward to every Halloween is the trend values.
The costumes will make up about 1.2 billion of the $6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year, inanimate objects are the last straw.
Women no longer have to dress up in sexy clothes, they can now also embody seductive food such as pizza, hamburgers or carrots.
As for men, I expect a lot of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead, and I bet the Daft Punk spacemen will make it into the Instagram feeds this year.
According to Google, the most wanted costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
There is nothing wrong with tradition.
We dressed up our dogs last year and to my surprise we were not alone.
In fact, Americans are spending $330 million this year on costumes for their pets, according to the NRF.
That’s a lot of hot dogs.
As far as sweets go, we're not squeamish.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion on it this year, according to The Nielsen Company.
That’s about 270 million kilograms of chocolate bars, lollipops, candy and gummy bears.
So good news for the 41 million people who, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce, are passing through the neighborhoods with the slogan “sweet or sour”.
In fact, we will buy over 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and – let’s not pretend – eat it.
The only thing we don’t want to consume is the sugar-sweet candy corn; yet 15 million kilograms of it are sold around Halloween, according to the National Association of Confectionery Manufacturers.
That's about nine billion grains of corn.
It's a mystery I haven't been able to solve yet.
Nothing belongs to Halloween more than houses where it haunts.
They have great names like "Terror Behind the Walls" (which, by the way, stands in a real prison), "Howl-O-Scream" and "The House of Shock".
There are actually 1,200 officially recognized haunted houses in the United States that make $500 million in revenue, according to America Haunts, and that includes the wonderful photos where you pee your pants and then put your friends on Facebook where you can’t get rid of them, and then the guy you’re into leaves you with a comment like “nice facial expression.”
But let's finally get to the pumpkins.
Charlie Brown introduced us to the Great Pumpkin when we were kids, and carving a pumpkin lantern is like decorating the Christmas tree – something we did from a young age.
Fortunately, the “baby in the pumpkin” trend only started last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up carving the pumpkin and not sitting in it.
This year, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
The pumpkin lantern, which slowly rots in the front yard, probably comes from Illinois, where 245 million kilograms of pumpkins were harvested this year.
If you want to score right, then call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California and carve something pretty out of their 921 kilo pumpkin.
Housing fire in Helmbrechts: rescue workers save charred corpse
The fire brigade had to leave Helmbrechts late Thursday evening.
A three-family house in the district of Hof catches fire at night on Friday.
Rescuers are recovering a charred body from the house.
Rescuers have found a charred body in a three-family house in a fire in Helmbrechts.
Whether it is a resident is still unclear, as a spokesman for the police in Bayreuth said.
Late Thursday evening it had burned on the ground floor of the house.
When the fire department arrived, the flames were already beating out of a window.
The police went into the apartment and found the body in a room.
This and another room completely burned out.
The entire ground floor was damaged.
All other residents were not at home during the fire, the police spokesman said.
The building is no longer habitable.
The exact cause of the fire was not clear at first.
Germany’s largest state church has launched an offensive to promote the profession of pastor.
The background is a possible lack of pastors: The Evangelical Lutheran Church in Hanover expects the number of its current 1,800 pastors to halve by 2030.
For young people today, the profession is very attractive and offers good prospects for the future, said Pastor Mathis Burfien (43) in an interview with the Evangelical Press Service.
It is attractive to be able to determine the work and daily routine yourself.
With Burfien, for the first time, the state church has commissioned a full-time pastor to inspire young people to study theology.
At present, fewer and fewer young people decide to study theology after graduating from high school.
Burfien attributes this to the process of de-churching: "God's voice is quiet, the world is loud".
The profession is characterized by great freedom and diversity.
I am the master of my schedule and I can focus where it is important to me.
Pastors could be very close to people as pastors.
They earned as much as teachers and could live well on it.
Certainly, more is paid in the free economy, but theologians would have a safe employer for this.
This is in line with the young people of today, who are not only interested in careers, but also in meaningful work.
According to the State Church, which comprises three-quarters of Lower Saxony, around 60 pastors are currently retiring each year.
At the same time, about 40 graduates of a theology degree program begin their vicariate.
In sparsely populated peripheral areas such as the Harz, the Emsland or the Wendland, it may become difficult to fill positions in the future.
Among other things, Burfien wants to organize study days for young people and to invite celebrities who have studied theology.
The study of theology offers a broad education.
You can even become a federal president.
Land Rover Rally Series Announced
The interior features racing seats and six-point harnesses, as well as a hands-free system.
The options range from reinforced brakes, a service package with support from Bowler Works mechanics and logistical support, to vehicle storage between events.
Drew Bowler, CEO of Bowler Motorsport, explains: “The rally customers who come to Bowler have changed.”
They are not all experienced racers, but people who are looking for excitement and adventure as well as an accessible way to world-class events.
We are delighted to be able to open this path in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA and believe the format opens up new opportunities to experience the different rally disciplines in the UK and abroad, and prepare newcomers for the rigors and realities of Rally Raid.
We really enjoyed developing the Defender Challenge car – it’s going to be an entertaining championship.
In addition, the Defender Challenge will include a training and testing day in February, as well as the option to participate in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
Firefighters called to rescue a dog that was stuck 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous rocky outcrop in a quarry
Cocker Spaniel bitch Ruby had run away after a minor traffic accident
Three days later she was discovered by a walker in the quarry in her predicament
Firefighters Sailed Off to Rock Wall and Saved the Dog from Safe Death
The fire brigade managed to bring a dog to safety, which was stuck on a 15 meter high projection in a rock wall.
Nine-month-old Cocker Spaniel dog Ruby ran away after a traffic accident Sunday afternoon and survived alone for three days before being rescued from a quarry on Wednesday.
Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20, to whom the dog belongs, came to the Flappit quarry in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to receive Ruby again and to thank the firefighters of the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They had been desperately searching for their missing dog and posted calls for help on social networks as she had escaped to the quarry after the small traffic accident.
Around 2:15 p.m. on Wednesday, a walker walking his dog saw the stranded Ruby on the 15-meter-high heel in the quarry.
The technical rescue team of the Cleckheaton Fire Station rushed to the spot and sailed to the rescue of Ruby, which was then transported upwards in a dog box.
Andy Clayton, the technical rescue team’s specialist, said: “She was in a dangerous situation.
It was located in the middle of the rock face – 15 meters from the top and the ground.
She didn’t move a muscle during her rescue – she was frozen.
But now she's fine.
She then ate a few dog cakes.
It was a rather unusual mission.
The fact that the dog was discovered is incredible.
Peter Lau, a specialist in the technical rescue team, said: "Ruby was very lucky."
There was a possibility that she was seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the vet for examination, but he found nothing except exhaustion and dehydration.
Becky Hall of Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: "Watching the rescue was scary."
I couldn’t believe she was really up there.
It was wonderful to hold her in your arms again.
The veterinarian explained that if the exhaustion had become too great and it had collapsed, it would probably have crashed.
The firefighters did a great job.
It was really brave what they did.
We are just so grateful and each of them was absolutely incredible.
Scott Alderson of Keighley added, “We were afraid she would fall down, but she stayed on top.”
The firefighters were great.
I can't believe where she was.
Mick Jagger says he never turned on Katy Perry when she was 18.
In an interview with an Australian radio station this week, the pop star said she had worked as a background singer on Jagger’s 2004 song “Old Habits Die Hard.”
Perry explained that she had dinner with the alt-rocker, and that "he dredged me when I was 18."
She added: “That was a long time ago and he was very nice to me.”
In a statement, a representative for Jaggers, 70, said on Thursday that he "categorically denies that he ever made any rapprochement attempts with Katy Perry."
The representative added: "Maybe she confused him with someone else."
Perry was one of the singers who made a guest appearance on the Rolling Stones tour this year.
Their new album "Prism" went straight to No. 1 this week.
George Kerevan: European unbundling gives Scots the choice
A new day, a new horror story about independence.
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland is needed to join the Schengen area as a condition of EU membership.
This provides the keyword for stories about passport controls in Berwick and a barbed-wire border along the Hadrian's Wall.
Indeed, the Strathclyde template pointed to the potential economic benefits that more freedom of travel would bring to the rest of Europe, but it did not – as expected – play a role in the headlines.
Nor has anyone mentioned that EU member states often bend their strict rules when it is more favorable for them.
As Scotland is not currently part of the Schengen area, the continued non-compliance with Brussels would be only a small concession in return for what you really want from the Scots.
Actually, not a story.
And one that has already come in such a way in the years that it is already like a fossil: The first time I heard the "independence means passport control" duck at least 40 years ago.
An interesting point is lost in the constant repetition of this age-old story.
Why would you expect an independent Scotland to dance to the European whistle?
Why trade the London yoke for that of Brussels, especially now?
These are the real European news: the great plan for the unification of Europe, conceived after the war, has come to a standstill.
With the euro crisis, the project Europe has officially died.
Throughout the EU, parties that are hostile to the EU or want to throw the euro overboard as a common currency are gaining ground.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Alternative for Germany party – founded only this year – was able to win just under five million votes in the Bundestag election in September, effectively driving the Free Democrats (the equivalent of the British Liberal Democrats) out of the Bundestag.
There has always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federalist Europe.
The current economic crisis, however, turns out to be a turning point.
Because of the strict austerity policies imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank in connection with the straitjacket into which the respective national economy is forced by sticking to the common currency, many people believe that the project Europe has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments causing excessive budget deficits – this was only the case in Greece.
Instead, the Eurosystem has pegged its members to exchange rates that are beneficial for German exporters – and German politicians would like to keep it that way.
Without the possibility of devaluation of the local currency, Southern Europe finds itself with a built-in productivity disadvantage compared to Germany.
The only option is to cut wages and public spending – spurred on by Berlin.
Behind the current budget and currency problems lies a deeper European productivity problem.
As a result of Brussels’ “green” energy directives – a code for subsidising French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers – European industry pays double for electricity and four times for gas compared to the United States.
This is a crippling cost disadvantage, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
All the world’s wage restraints do not protect the European petrochemical industry from being cornered by cheap American shale gas.
As a result, a revolt is on the rise, especially in France, the former cheerleader of the EU.
After the war, France’s political elite saw the EU as a vehicle to keep Germany in check and to keep Paris on par with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a gateway to political legitimacy and has pushed Europe into its own economic policies, which the battered French economy is struggling with.
The result: Marine Le Pen’s right-wing, EU-hostile Front National has just won a decisive by-election, putting the ruling socialists in third place.
The Front National is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the vote – a timely warning for the British Labour Party that it cannot assume a right-wing split would automatically bring benefits to the left.
What does Le Pen do with her newly gained popularity among the white French working class?
It wants to use the EU elections next year to forge an anti-EU, anti-common currency bloc in the European Parliament.
If the anti-EU parties do well in these elections – and this is very possible – then for the first time such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament.
This is the point I want to make: in the not too distant future, the growing resentment against the EU and the common currency will come together to abolish the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will rather become something of the "Europe of (sovereign) nations" that General de Gaulle favoured.
Germany and a few of its satellite economies may stick to the euro, but France and southern Europe will return to their own currencies.
I expect the UK to distance itself from this project in the hope of ingratiating itself to the US.
However, Washington’s growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will stand alone in the Atlantic rain.
Where is Scotland in all of this?
We can decide to be a region of (ultimately) Little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – including telling Berlin and Brussels what they can do.
I suspect Scotland could do quite well in a looser European alliance, provided we keep our own currency.
Cooperation with other, similarly thinking countries is easier in a non-federated Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should consider doing the same to Norway and maintaining our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is – remarkably – the most successful political movement against austerity in Europe and won a spectacular majority in 2011 due to the rejection of the proposed (and made) cuts that Labour Finance Minister Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory-Lib Dem coalition were responsible for.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to opt for independence now, only to be forced into austerity by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: growing up faster
African-American and Hispanic girls tend to be more likely to reach puberty than their white peers, research shows.
Physical changes do not immediately mean puberty
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible.
Experts Believe Epidemic Obesity Is a Trigger of Early Puberty
The trend towards early puberty is less pronounced in boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in child health and family issues.
Should a mother be concerned if her daughter grows breasts and pubic hair at the age of seven or eight?
At the American Academy of Pediatrics’ annual conference this week in Orlando, Florida, pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz stated that these early physical changes were relatively normal among American girls and were a new norm.
“I spend a lot of time trying to reassure parents – usually this is not a sign that puberty is happening quickly,” Kaplowitz explained.
Obvious signs of development, such as growing breasts, pubic and underarm hair, as well as body odor, appear in girls earlier.
Nevertheless, there has been only a slight shift in the age of menarche (occurrence of first menstrual period) in the last 40 years.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, slightly less than 12.75 in 1970.
"When the development of breasts begins, it takes at least two to three years to menarche," said Kaplowitz, also author of the book "Early puberty in girls: The essential guide to dealing with this common problem."
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty progresses.
It is controversial what actually marks the onset of puberty, but it is "tired" when breast augmentation is accompanied by a growth spurt before the age of eight years.
In most cases, the process slows down or stagnates — something a pediatrician can closely monitor.
In the case of faster progress, tests by an endicronologist may be indicated, so that serious problems such as tumors or cysts can be excluded.
There are treatment methods for delaying early menstruation and warding off another consequence: premature aging of the bones, which can ultimately lead to inhibition of growth and thus small body growth in adults.
The recommendations for drug or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child, the rate of development, the rate of growth and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is reserved about medication, but admits: “Suppressing puberty can mitigate behavior problems and the feelings of girls, being different from their peers.”
The other big problem is understandable: Parents just don’t want their very young daughters to have the period.
“They worry about the risk of pregnancy or how they handle the hygienic side,” Kaplowitz said.
“It was a shock,” recalls a woman whose daughter got her days when she was ten.
Even though there were initial signs and we had talked about menstruation, she was not emotionally prepared.
She came home scared and excited from school because she was the first in her circle of friends.
There are many widely published theories about the causes of early puberty.
But there is no conclusive evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment, or sexual messages in the media are causal.
Boys come into puberty in a similar way to girls before.
Kaplowitz believes that the most convincing premise is the epidemic of obesity.
He supported the conduct of a 2001 study on girls aged six to nine, which found a link between body fat and puberty.
Other research supports this conclusion, but there are many other factors that played a role.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white peers.
There are different explanations for this.
Globally, early puberty seems to be influenced by all sorts of things, from economic conditions to climate to genes.
Another mystery: Although boys’ facial and pubic hair grows earlier, the trend toward full-blown earlier puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other doctors at the AAP conference underlined the complexity of the issue.
The appearance of acne and pubic hair is common even in babies and young children.
"We need to be careful how we identify the true onset of puberty," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to get advice from their pediatrician on how to talk to their child.
"This may mean that you have to have a conversation earlier than expected," advised Kaplowitz.
If you stay calm, the child usually responds well.
Girls who bloom early need the assurance that the process is a normal part of life, even if it occurs earlier than thought.
Jumbo manufacturers argue over seat width in the face of large orders
There has been a dispute between leading aircraft manufacturers over the breadth of tourist class seats on long-haul flights, setting the tone for a bitter clash at this month’s Dubai Airshow.
The dispute revolves around the seat width offered to passengers on long-haul flights in the tourist class – not always the ones airlines strive for the most, but this designated space is the key to the efficiency claims on the latest Airbus SAS and Boeing Co. aircraft.
Airbus this week called for an industry standard requiring a seat width of at least 46 cm (18 inches) in the tourist class, but U.S. arch rival Boeing says airlines should decide.
The dispute comes at a time when aircraft manufacturers are vying to sell even larger versions of their twin-engine long-haul aircraft and expect record orders at the 17-21 November event.
How the rear part of the aircraft is designed – especially whether there are rows with nine or ten seats – is crucial to the stated economic results that the new “mini jumbo” design is intended to deliver.
Boeing claims its upgraded "777X" holds 406 people in tourist class seats that are over 17 inches wide, allowing ten per row.
Airbus says the competing version of the A350 will carry 350 people in 18-inch-wide seats in the tourist class, with nine per row.
Aircraft giants often distribute blows over technical details by means of advertising in the trade press.
Airbus is now appealing directly to the public in front of the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X is expected to make the race with over 100 orders.
Recently, the company unveiled an ad that could be the start of a new ad war, showing donors a picture of three people sitting squeezed together in a restaurant, along with the title, “Would you accept that?”
"Boeing proposes long-haul flights in seats that are narrower than regional turboprops," said John Leahy, Airbus' chief sales officer.
People are getting fatter in the face of changing dietary habits, but airplane seats have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 defined modern long-haul travel, and the end of the century, the weight of the average male American between 40 and 49 years has increased by ten percent, according to data from the U.S. Department of Health.
The waist circumference of the average male American in the 21st century is 100.8 cm, according to U.S. health statistics.
Airbus says its rival is sticking to a seat concept from the 1950s, when the average body circumference of the newly christened "Jet Set" was narrower.
According to Airbus, studies have been carried out that show that an additional inch (2.54 cm) per seat increases the quality of sleep by 53 percent.
Boeing denies Airbus’ figures on seat dimensions, saying it is not at the manufacturers’ discretion to decide how airlines balance fares and set-up.
The company also explains that, according to research, the experience in the aircraft depends on more than the seat width.
“It really boils down to giving airlines flexibility so they can do what they think they need to do to be successful,” said Boeing cabin expert Kent Craver.
They don’t want us to dictate to them what makes them profitable.
You know your business better than anyone.
For passengers, it’s about more elbow room, but for manufacturers, it’s increasingly becoming an issue that can impact sales.
Behind the dispute is a race for aircraft orders with an estimated volume of at least $700 billion according to list prices in the coming decades, which could have a lasting impact on the export balance of the USA or Europe.
As Reuters first reported in July, the seat layout is the driving force behind the dispute over the new jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim 20 percent more efficiency per seat in their latest long-haul twin-engine designs than the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 77-300ER.
Boeing’s statements on the results depend in part on the fact that the 777X, with its ten seats per row, is compared to the original design of nine seats in the 777.
The increased cost per unit is still lower than that of currently used machines with ten seats per row.
“Boeing is therefore squeezing more seats into its aircraft to make it more competitive with our products,” said Kevin Keniston, Head of Passenger Comfort at European Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts say full cabins with ten seats per row at existing 777s indicated that many passengers opted for the tighter arrangement, which could come with cheaper airfare.
“Eighteen inches of seat width would be great for passengers, but the reality is: from an economic point of view, the Airbus offering is controlled by the threat posed by the 777,” says Mary Kirby, cabin furnishing expert, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not offer seats, but a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines can choose.
The world-traveling jet sellers even carry tape measure to measure the facility in the competition.
Even if they promote comfort, all manufacturers also offer jets with a highly compact design for low-cost airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers an A350 with ten-seat rows, but according to its own statement has not yet sold one.
Until recently, Airbus has stressed the importance of greater cabin adaptability and offered wide seats at the aisles for some jets.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets, experts say the call for a new industry standard is likely to fizzle out but could distract from the wave of 777X sales.
New anti-nicotine vaccine could kill smoking pleasure
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could spoil the fun of smoking.
A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice from nicotine addiction for a lifetime.
More tests are needed before testing on humans, which may take a few years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the initial results are good.
“We are very hopeful that this type of vaccination strategy can once again help millions of smokers who have tried to quit using all the methods available on the market, but have experienced that their nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches,” said Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to contain the genetic information needed to produce nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then produce a constant stream of antibodies.
The antibodies chase down the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain, preventing a smoker from experiencing a nicotine high.
In trials, vaccinated mice given nicotine maintained their normal activity levels.
Mice without vaccination, on the other hand, had taken a "timeout," the researchers explained, a sign that the nicotine had reached their brains.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
Vaccinations had to be given so frequently to maintain antibody levels that they were expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be significantly lower, as it turns liver cells into antibody factories.
As Professor Crystal said, a future vaccine for humans, if it was completely safe, could be given to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette, thus preventing nicotine addiction.
More likely, however, smokers would use it to quit.
"You know then that when they start smoking again, they don't feel any pleasure in it because of the nicotine vaccine, and that helps them to get rid of the habit," he explains.
British scientists said the findings were interesting, but at the same time warned that further research was needed.
Tripodi denies being influenced by Obeid
Former Labor Party minister Joe Tripodi of New South Wales has been charged with corruption.
The former NSW Minister denies having changed the rules on maritime lease at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who owned covert holdings in three properties on state-controlled land.
The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC Independent Commission Against Corruption) on Friday expanded its investigation into whether Obeid has influenced various state ministers to extend leases at Circular Quay, where the Obeids operated two restaurants and a café, without tendering after their expiry in August 2005.
Now it is being investigated because of the accusation that Tripodi knew of Obeid's hidden interest in the properties, after Tripodi's former deputy chief of staff Lynne Ashpole testified accordingly on Thursday.
In years of talks that began in 2005, the government had pushed for public tenders for the leases.
The tenants were against it and also wanted longer terms.
In 2009, the leases for the companies at Circular Quay, which raised the Obeids $ 2.5 million annually, were extended without a public tender.
Tripodi, who was Minister of Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, had originally called for public tenders.
But he denied making the changes at the request of Obeid, who, as Tripodi confirmed, had pushed for a redesign of the government’s lease arrangements.
An ICAC telephone record showed conversations in August and September 2007 between Obeid, Tripodi, and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had moved to the Ports Department after working under Obeid at the Fisheries Authority.
"Was the subject discussed in these telephone conversations the elaboration of the commercial leasing arrangements?" asked Deputy Commissioner Anthony Whealy Tripodi.
“No,” Tripodi replied.
I don’t remember what was discussed, but it definitely wasn’t.
Definitely not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli fighter jets attack target in Syria, official sources say
Israeli fighter jets attacked a target in the Syrian port of Latakia on Thursday night, a senior government official confirmed to Fox News.
The officer did not explain what the target had been, but said there had been at least one.
According to the Associated Press, the target was Russian SA-125 missiles.
At least twice this year, Israel has carried out airstrikes on missile supplies in Syria.
Foreign workers with 457 visas could undergo ‘authenticity test’
The government is considering an "authenticity test" for foreign workers with a 457 visa as part of extended measures.
Should the test be introduced, it would be implemented via a criterion designed to prevent the 457 from being used to fill unqualified jobs or as a back door for family and friends to move to Australia.
A government discussion proposal was released today after former Labor Party MP Maxine McKew condemned the government’s comments on foreign workers because they could be perceived as an insult by Australia’s neighbours.
“Strong declarations such as ‘foreigners should line up in the back’ and ‘Australians should line up first’ are a very unpleasant setback at a time when unions were calling for a protected labour market,” she told the Australia India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that white workers should be protected – and if some in the region take an echo of this historic artifact, I wouldn’t be surprised.
The discussion proposal outlines twelve measures that were once envisaged by former immigration minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O’Connor, who was in talks yesterday about human smuggling in Sri Lanka, has implemented five of the recommended changes, the others are still being considered.
If the "authenticity criterion" is adopted, then a person applying for a visa could be checked to ensure that "the application is genuine in cases where the applicant is related or personally related to the holder or a relevant person of the supporting undertaking."
Companies could also be required to account for the number of 457 visa holders after companies that initially wanted to support only a small number of workers eventually hired hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker is believed to have died of a heart attack after arriving on Christmas Island on a refugee boat this week.
The troubled nine-year-old son of the man who had come with him to Australia has been cared for since his father’s death on Wednesday by an adult cousin who was also on the boat.
Australian authorities took the man to Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
A study has been announced by the UK government to increase the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland.
In the work of HS2 Ltd, it is proposed to realize high-speed connections between Scotland and the north of England as early as the start of phase 1 in 2026.
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said the project "will bring Britain closer together".
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was very pleased to be working with the UK government on this plan.
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed rail link between London and the West Midlands.
At the end of Phase 2, there will be connections to Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government corrected the estimated cost of building the high-speed road between London and the north of England from <0xC2><0xA3>32.7 billion to <0xC2><0xA3>42.6 billion.
The UK Government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, has contracted HS2 Ltd to look for further route capacity and travel time improvements for Northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of a travel time of ultimately three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
Baroness Kramer said: “Our target for HS2 is a truly national route network that brings the UK and its cities closer together.”
We are moving forward with HS2 because it brings enormous benefits.
Without it, we face a capacity crisis in our rail network.
But it is also about the connection between 18 British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which is being improved thanks to HS2.
Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael said: “Today’s announcement is good news for Scotland.
On behalf of the Scottish government, Keith Brown called on Carmichael to “unambiguously” advocate Scottish involvement in the HS2 network.
Brown said: “The high-speed rail link holds the potential for enormous economic benefits for Scotland, but at the same time, Scotland’s economic strength also provides an argument for fast rail links across the UK.”
That is why we are delighted to be working as a partner of the UK Government and exploring the options for a high-speed rail link in Scotland that will create benefits for all and complement the Glasgow-Edinburgh link that the Scottish Government is already planning.
I look forward to reviewing the investigation report with the UK ministers next year and to deciding together on the next steps.
Regulations on electronic devices in aircraft remain in force in Australia for the time being
Australian air passengers will continue to have to switch off tablets and smartphones at take-off and landing, despite efforts in the US to loosen regulations for such devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) allows U.S. airlines to change their regulations so that passengers can read, watch or play e-books on their devices during critical flight phases, provided they are in “flight mode.”
During most of the flight, passengers are already allowed to do so, but many people find it annoying that they are not allowed to read their e-books when taking off and landing.
Australian companies are watching the decision, which requires U.S. airlines to do a ton of work, but are not pursuing any immediate plans to change their regulations.
CASA also said it would look at the announcement, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical flight phases in Australia remain in place.
"CASA currently has no specific regulations regarding the use of electronic equipment in aircraft," it said.
The issue is subject to regulations requiring airlines to maintain safety at all times and passengers to follow the safety instructions given by cabin crew.
Virgin has already had discussions with CASA about extending the use of its Wi-Fi entertainment system on flights, saying that it is open to change, but that it needs to be initiated by lawmakers.
“We would welcome a review of the approval of electronic devices by CASA, because we are convinced that this would improve the customer experience after we now offer (wireless entertainment) during the flight,” a spokesperson said.
Qantas said it will remain in the current rules until further notice.
“Our current guidelines state that electronic devices are not allowed to be used at take-off and landing, and we have no plans to change that at this time,” the company said in a statement.
The FAA regulations apply to U.S. airlines.
However, we are always interested in developments in regulations from which passengers can benefit, and will certainly take a close look at the FAA decision and the reasons behind it.
The decision has a different effect on US companies depending on the age of the fleet.
They must demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference from mobile devices, and change manuals, training materials, hand luggage programs, and customer training.
“Once an airline has confirmed the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use portable, lightweight electronic devices such as tablets, e-book readers, and smartphones at any height,” the FAA said in a statement.
In rare cases of poor visibility, the crew will instruct passengers to turn off equipment during landing.
The group also recommended stowing heavier equipment safely under the seat or in the compartments above the seats during take-off and landing.
Before the Revierderby against Schalke, BVB trailers with flare rockets had taken care of ugly scenes in the Veltins Arena.
Borussia Dortmund then announced harsh consequences.
Before the Friday game of the Fu<0xC3><0x9F>ball-Bundesliga against VfB Stuttgart, the Ultras reacted with a silence - first.
It was an unusual, almost spooky acoustic that presented itself to the viewer until shortly before the kick-off of the Bundesliga match between the German vice-champion Borussia Dortmund and VfB Stuttgart in Signal Iduna Park.
Most of the guests were listening to their songs.
The southern grandstand, on the other hand, where the most loyal - and loudest - BVB fans stand, initially presented itself exceptionally quietly: no chants, no battle cries.
The podium of the Capo, which otherwise coordinates the joint cheering, remained unoccupied.
And at the very front of the grandstand, a large flag with the inscription "Section Stadium Ban" was waving.
Only when goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller entered the pitch as always as the first BVB player, did short-term cheers flare up.
When his teammates followed, there was loud singing and waving scarves – but not everywhere.
In the central blocks 12 and 13 of the south stand nothing stirred.
The fact that stadium spokesman Norbert Dickel once again listed the positive experiences of the last days - Derby victory, victory over Arsenal, extension of the contract of coach Jürgen Klopp - did not cause a celebration mood.
Only five minutes before the start of the whistle did the capo climb up his podium - and the tension, which until then had been palpable with his hands, was released in a loud scream when Dickel, as usual, questioned the mood on the stands in the stadium.
Finally, as always, it was the South Stand's turn - and finally, as usual, the loudest place in the stadium was here again.
And at the latest when the loud call "Derby winner stands up" came with the kick-off from the south stand, everything was again as always.
The silence before was probably a reaction to the events of the past few days.
Immediately before Revierderby at FC Schalke 04, some of the BVB supporters had fired flare rockets into the spectator ranks and onto the pitch - and almost hit goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller.
The game was delayed due to chaotic scenes.
BVB boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had received the heads of the Dortmund Ultras in his office - and if you believe Watzke's words, this was a rather uncomfortable date for the fan representatives.
“There will be massive cuts for the entire ultra movement,” the BVB boss announced on Thursday evening at a panel discussion in Frankfurt.
As an immediate measure, Watzke forbade the Ultras a choreography for the home game against VfB Stuttgart.
“I banned it,” he said.
We cannot abandon the zero-tolerance policy on pyrotechnics.
In addition, the Ultras were shown various possibilities of punishment - until Tuesday, they now have time to decide on one.
Otherwise, according to Watzke, BVB will impose a sanction by the end of next week.
"This will be drastic," Watzke assured.
One can be curious to see how the reactions on the south stand then turn out.
Pawnshops are booming in Singapore as the crisis has arrived in the middle class
In a pawn shop in Singapore’s Bendemeer shopping mall, Janani Amirthalinga exchanges a gold bangle, a ring and a pair of earrings to pay her daughters’ school fees.
“My husband and I have just bought a house, all my money is in it,” Amirthalinga says.
Although she earns 3,000 Singapore dollars (about 1,730 euros) each month as an administrative employee and her husband also works, the monthly family income is not enough, she explains.
In fact, demand in parts of Southeast Asia – where household debt is increasing – is so high that ValueMax, where it made its exchange, became the third pawn shop listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
Bonding jewelry is not only a quick way to get money – $1,300 in the case of Janani Amirthalinga – but also almost as cheap as an unsecured bank loan.
Typically, pawnshops in Singapore charge an APR of 17 percent, which is just over the 15.4 percent that United Overseas Bank requires, a local lender with a branch in the same mall.
However, pawnshops offer the advantage that no verification of creditworthiness or proof of income is required here, which is why loans are possible faster than with banks.
For this reason, millions of people in the region turn to pawnshops after families feel the pressure from rising living costs as well as rising household and consumer debt.
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap loans due to a loose fiscal policy in the developed economic areas, lower- and middle-income families seek pawnshops to make up for the difference in a stuttering economy.
This week, the rating agency Standard & Poor described its growing household debt, mainly due to rising mortgages, as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
According to the agency, Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest household debt in Asia relative to the gross domestic product.
Malaysia is at the top of the list with 80 percent of GDP, an increase of 60 percent in 2008.
Economists are also worried about the high consumer debt in Thailand, which has barely emerged from a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, the data showed a continuing weakness in exports and a decline in consumer demand.
“Ultimately, this means that with rising costs, people in the middle to lower segment (the income scale) will try to supplement their income wherever possible,” says Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historic highs in gold prices over the past two years have further fueled the trend of pledging personal items as people seize the opportunity to turn family jewelry into cash.
In Singapore, about 70 percent of the pledged items in the city state’s 200 pawnshops are gold.
People say to themselves, "The price of gold looks good, let's pawn Grandma's gold chain and get it back next month."
The largest Thai pawn shop operator, EasyMoney, has seen a 20 percent increase in customers in its stores in recent months.
Growth in the pawn shop is so strong that ValueMax, operator of the branch in Bendemeer and 15 others in Singapore, wants to expand not only into neighboring Malaysia – where the company operates four houses – but also outside Asia, according to ValueMax CEO Yeah Lee Ching.
The company is funding this with 60 percent of the $66 million it raised this week with the Singapore IPO.
While some lenders have been caught in the crossfire because of high interest rates, Yeah explains that pawnshops not only offer cheaper interest rates than other lenders, but also do not directly increase debt.
"Customers are borrowing items they already own, and the liquefaction of personal valuables does not increase household debt," she explains.
The pawn lending business is increasingly socially accepted as short-term, secured financing.
Also, not all people who use pawnbrokers are in financial trouble.
Wealthy people from Singapore also come to ValueMax’s stores to pawn gold bars and Rolex watches, for which they receive up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash.
Customers from every social class come to us.
“These include wealthy people who borrow short-term for a business or an investment, or small businesses who need to bridge cash flow bottlenecks,” says Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
NSA sucks data from Google and Yahoo - Snowden wants to help
The intelligence revealer Edward Snowden has a fundamental interest in helping Germany to investigate the increasingly explosive NSA spying affair.
According to Hans-Christian Ströbele, a member of the Green Party’s parliament, his surprising meeting with Snowden in Russia was about the conditions under which the former intelligence officer would testify at a German public prosecutor’s office or before a committee of inquiry.
Snowden had referred to his complicated legal situation, Ströbele told the ARD magazine "Panorama".
325 million Australian dollars bailout package for Tasmanian health care
The Australian government insists on the harsh conditions associated with the Australian $325 million bailout package for Tasmanian health care to ensure that the state government cannot waste the money.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth will take “immediate action” to avert a crisis caused by an aging population of the island state, a higher rate of chronic diseases and system limitations.
The funding for a period of four years was decided after government consultations with the independent Tasmanian MP Andrew Wilkie.
“The government has put together an emergency rescue package that we believe addresses the unique challenges facing the state,” Plibersek said.
The $325 million package includes $31 million in emergency election assistance.
Another 2,600 surgeries, including orthopedic procedures and treatments for cataracts, are to be carried out to eliminate residues.
In addition, there is money for day clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better aftercare after inpatient stays, specialist training, mental health services and the introduction of a system for electronic recording of health data in local hospitals.
“These investments are in line with the ideas that clinic staff told me were the best way to improve the Tasmanian health care system,” said Tanya Plibersek.
The Minister insisted on the Tasmanian Government’s strict reporting and accountability.
The state must maintain the current level of funding to receive money from the Commonwealth and report monthly on where the additional funds were spent.
A three-member commission will be established to ensure that the state provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible.
As Wilkie explained today, the $325 million would be of little use if “they are not accompanied by genuine reforms that put the public Tasmanian health system on a more sustainable course.”
Nevertheless, he praised the government for responding to his request for urgent assistance, which he first expressed to the Prime Minister in early May.
"I am confident that federal aid will make a major contribution to removing the state's public health system from the worry list," Wilkie said.
According to the state government, these electoral benefits will largely offset recent cuts.
But the health policy spokesman for the opposition at the federal level, Peter Dutton, is of the opinion that today's announcement is only a "pavement solution".
“We are in the situation today because the Labor state government has withdrawn $430 million from the health care system,” he told ABC TV.
It cannot be that a state government rips almost half a billion dollars out of the system and puts 300 million in the Commonwealth and then pretends to be good news.
Dutton called on Plibersek to guarantee that not a single dollar of the bailout would be spent on additional bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nicloux's adaptation of Denis Diderot's novel convinces with exceptional production equipment and contemporary details, but is also heavier food than necessary.
Set in 1760s France, the plot tells the gripping story of Suzanne, a young nobleman who is sent to the monastery by her family.
When she rebels, she is confronted with the extreme cruelty of an extremely sadistic superior and becomes the object of erotic fascination of another.
The film never slips into lust or sensationalism – and that’s where its problem lies.
The solemn seriousness with which the film is told also makes it a tormenting shirt for the audience.
Syria has destroyed its ability to produce chemical weapons, a monitoring group says
Syria has destroyed key facilities for the production of chemical weapons and poison gas munitions, the global chemical weapons monitoring group said on Thursday, as heavy clashes occurred in the north of the country near one of the sites where suspected toxic substances are stored.
Also on Thursday, a Syrian activist group announced that more than 120,000 people had been killed since the beginning of the civil war almost three years ago.
The announcement by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) came a day before the date on
November 1, which the Hague-based organization Damascus had set up to destroy or make “inoperable” all facilities for the production of chemical weapons, including all machinery for mixing chemicals into poison gas and filling ammunition.
The completion of this process, which is essentially the first stage of destruction, is an important milestone of an ambitious timetable aimed at the destruction of all chemical weapons in Syria by mid-2014.
The destruction of the facilities means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
Damascus has yet to begin destroying its weapons and supplies.
It is estimated that there are about 1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons in the country, including mustard gas and the nerve gas sarin.
The announcement came at a time when fighting was taking place in the city of Safira on Thursday, where experts say there is a production facility for chemical weapons as well as deposits, the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.
The activist group, which tracks the death toll through a network of activists in Syria, said on Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
Of these, 61,067 were civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government side, 29,954 of them belonged to President Bashar Assad’s army, 18,678 were pro-government fighters and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah militias.
Also among the dead were 2,202 deserted army soldiers and 5,375 opposition fighters, many of them foreigners.
On 25 July, the UN estimated the number of deaths in this conflict since March 2011 at 100,000.
This number has not yet been updated.
The conflict has forced about two million people to flee the country.
Assad’s forces have been fighting in Safira for weeks against the rebels, many of whom have ties to al-Qaeda groups.
The observatory said there were losses on both sides on Thursday, but did not provide any details.
The fighting underscores the danger facing chemical weapons inspectors, as their mission to liberate Syria from its toxic arsenal is a race against time in the midst of a raging civil war.
According to the OPCW, which works closely with the United Nations, the team “is now convinced that it has seen and witnessed the destruction of all the important production and mixing/filling facilities mentioned by Syria.”
Therefore, "no further inspection activities are currently planned."
Earlier this week, inspectors said they had completed the first round of inspections and visited 21 of the 23 sites identified by Damascus.
Due to security concerns, it was not possible to visit two facilities, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, the OPWC said the two sites had been abandoned, according to Syria’s statement, “and the chemical weapons program objects there have been moved to other named facilities that have been inspected.”
It was not immediately clear whether the site in Safira was one of the two facilities the OPCW inspectors were unable to visit.
Syria has presented a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which must be approved by the OPWC Executive Committee next month.
"I take the hat off to the bravery and courage that you have all shown in fulfilling the most challenging mission ever carried out by this organization," Ahmed Uzumcu, the director general of the monitoring organization, said in a comment published by OPCW.
For three years now, the mainly Sunni Muslim rebels have been fighting a split from Shiite Islam in this civil war against Assad’s government and its security forces, which include many members of the Alawites.
In view of further developments, the head of the observation group, Rami Abdurrahman, said there was a strong explosion at an air defense facility in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia on Wednesday.
The cause of the explosion is unknown, he said.
Wrath over judgment for Bali bombers
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people who died in the 2002 Bali bombing reacted with anger at the verdict for the last of the instigators to be brought to justice, as they believed Umar Patek should be shot to death.
Patek, who spent nearly ten years on the run as one of Southeast Asia’s most wanted people, was sentenced yesterday to 20 years in prison for his role in building explosive devices for the bombing.
With suspension, he could be released after 15 years.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder for attacking two nightclubs in Kuta’s popular tourist district, which killed 202 people, including 88 Australians, and injured many others.
He was also convicted of a number of terrorism-related charges, including a wave of explosive attacks on churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
The prosecution had demanded a life sentence, even if they could have applied for the death penalty for the man who is also called "Demolition Man" because of his reputation as a master bomb maker.
The decision has brought painful memories to June Corteen, a mother from Perth who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in the devastation wrought by Patek and his co-conspirators nearly a decade ago.
Fighting with tears, she said Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really mean, he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys.
"You should put him in front of a firing squad," Corteen told AAP.
I have to live every day with the fact that I will not have any more grandchildren and I will never see my daughters again.
The Sari Club was razed to the ground on October 12, 2002, shortly after 11 p.m., when a massive bomb exploded in a small truck parked in front of the nightclub.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's Bar, where just 20 seconds earlier a suicide bomber exploded a backpack filled with explosives.
He fell into a coma for a month after the attack and "died" three times while hanging on to a life support system.
Hughes said Patek deserved the same fate as the three other members of the terror cell Jemaah Islamiah – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra – who were responsible for the massacre and were executed four years ago.
Really, this guy should get the death penalty before anyone else.
To keep him alive – no, there is no reason to keep him alive.
Getting 20 years after killing 202 people and injuring many hundreds is not much.
Patek is the last of the Bali bombers to stand trial.
He evaded arrest for nearly a decade, but was eventually apprehended in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where U.S. forces killed former al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden just four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent testified that intelligence reports had indicated that Patek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden with the aim of rebuilding the link between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda.
"He didn't turn himself in," said Corteen.
Until recently, he has shown no remorse for how much suffering he has inflicted on other people.
The verdict came ahead of the ten-year anniversary of this year’s attack, which is celebrated with commemorations in Bali and Australia.
“There will be a lot of tears this year,” Corteen said.
Patek can still appeal his verdict.
FAA: Passengers can now use electronic devices on airplanes (but not make cell phone calls)
From departure to landing, passengers can now use their electronic devices to read, work, play, listen to music and watch movies, but can’t make phone calls, according to new guidelines issued Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the United States.
However, passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately.
How quickly they will be implemented depends on the airline, FAA employee Michael Huerta explained at a press conference.
Airlines must demonstrate to the FAA that aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they have updated the flight crew’s training manuals as well as the regulations governing the stowage of the equipment in accordance with the new regulations.
The FAA said it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.
Among these airlines were Delta and JetBlue.
"Depending on the state of the plan, we could very soon approve the expanded use of electronic devices," the FAA said in a statement.
Currently, passengers have to turn off smartphones, tablets and other devices when the aircraft doors are closed.
They may not take off until the aircraft has reached a height of three kilometres and the captain gives the green light.
When entering the landing approach, the passengers must switch them off again and may not take them off again before the plane has landed.
Under the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are protected against electronic interference could allow their passengers to use the devices during take-off, landing and on the runway, the FAA said.
Most new commercial aircraft and other aircraft that have been converted to use Wi-Fi at higher altitudes should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Professional Association of Professional Flight Attendants, welcomed the changes.
“If the new regulation is implemented safely – and we are working closely with the airline in this regard – both sides will benefit,” Glading said.
To be honest, we are tired of having to feel like watchers on this topic.
Nevertheless, internet connections for surfing, exchanging e-mails, text messages or downloading data under three kilometers remained prohibited, the authority explained.
Passengers are asked to put smartphones, tablets and other devices into flight mode.
So still no "Words With Friends", the Scrabble-like online game that actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011, when he had to leave a jet of American Airlines in public effect because he refused to turn off the device while the plane was parked at the gate.
And heavier devices such as laptops must still be stowed away, as there is a risk of injury if they fly through the cabin.
Mobile phone calls during the flight will also remain prohibited.
The regulatory authority for telephone calls lies with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), not the FAA.
FAA may lift ban on certain electronic devices at take-off and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, a national transportation safety expert on CBS News, said cell phones were still considered a risk.
"Mobile phones are really a problem, not just because they could potentially cause interference to navigation devices, but because we know from the FCC that transmission from the air can also interfere with transmitter masts," said Rosenker.
An industry advisory committee set up by the FAA to investigate this issue last month recommended that the government allow wider use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, pressure on the FAA has increased to loosen restrictions on use.
Critics such as Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill from Missouri argue that there are no valid security reasons for the ban.
The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce because the use of the devices has become ubiquitous.
Some studies say that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore switching off the device.
The FAA began restricting the use of electronic devices by air travelers in 1966 after reports of disruptions to navigation and communication devices by passenger-carried FM radios became known, which were the latest technology trend at the time.
New aircraft are far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA so that they don’t mind electronic interference.
Airlines have been offering passengers Wi-Fi for several years now when the altitude is reached.
The planes adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also less sensitive to interference.
The vast majority of passenger aircraft should be fit for increased use of electronic devices under the new guidelines, Huerta said.
Today’s electronic devices generally emit much less radio radiation than previous generations.
E-readers, for example, emit only minimal radiation when you turn the page.
However, when downloading or sending data, the transmission values are stronger.
Among the advocates for easing restrictions on device use by passengers is Amazon.com.
In 2011, company employees loaded a passenger plane full of Kindle e-readers and made a test flight to identify problems, but could not detect any.
Members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings about the risk involved in using equipment.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said he believed the disruption caused by the devices was real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other committee members said there were only isolated reports of pilots talking about aircraft systems being disrupted by the devices, and most of them are very old.
However, the committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to order passengers to switch off equipment when instrument landing in low visibility conditions.
A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes and described them as a reasonable adjustment for travelers who today would be extensively equipped with technology.
“We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not inconsistent with safety,” said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
Bird rescued from North Sea drilling island released by air rescue service
An air rescue bird that had been found exhausted on a North Sea drilling island was released back into nature.
The water raffle was flown to Aberdeen by helicopter last month, where it was patched up by the Scottish animal welfare organization SPCA at their rescue center in Alloa.
Colin Seddon, head of the center, said: “This water-rally was probably a winter migration bird from Northern Europe, which was held back by the strong winds over the North Sea.”
Apparently, the exhausted bird took refuge on the oil rig.
He added: "He couldn't fly any further, so we were contacted for help."
When she was released, the water rattle was fit and healthy again.
Is Europe’s elite ready to do business with Britain?
Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention of bringing the economy together and defining what those who provide prosperity and work in the UK want to change about our relations with the EU.
To this end, we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey of UK business leaders and asked them what they think about the UK, the economy and the EU.
YouGov surveyed more than 1,000 business leaders, representing roughly UK company sizes, sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will surprise many.
We have found that the vast majority of companies now export outside Europe, focusing on countries that are modernizing and growing, while countries in the EU are stagnating.
They want the government to favour new trade links with countries such as China, India and Brazil, rather than the long and exhausting process of reforming the obscure EU institutions.
When asked about their views on certain legally regulated issues – from antitrust law to product legislation – the majority of business leaders believe that control over these key competences should be taken back to Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction with the single market because, according to the companies, the costs of the Brussels regulations would now outweigh the benefits of being part of Europe’s trade zone – even 40 percent of large companies agreed with the one that is traditionally the most Europe-friendly.
Finally, and this probably says it most, our survey of business leaders revealed that a clear majority of the UK wants a course towards changing the agreement and a relationship with the EU based on trade, not politics.
This insight, which can be found among companies of all sizes and leading corporations, shows that the economy is pushing for a "meaningful change" that will bring the heft of action back to the UK.
It’s about a lot – a change in the agreement and better conditions for Britain would lead to a 16% change of opinion in favour of remaining in the EU in a referendum.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt: this survey shows that the UK economy is behind his plan for renegotiating the UK’s terms for EU membership.
It also shows that the companies expect a renegotiation of a significant shift in the balance of power back to the UK.
A better deal for the UK economy is possible and increasingly necessary as the eurozone moves towards a closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in the UK, as the result of our survey shows, which means an increased focus on trade for businesses and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach to regulation.
Gazprom’s Alexei Miller calls Bulgaria’s pipeline the beginning of a new gas era
The start of construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria marks the start of one of the largest European energy projects, the Gazprom board said.
“Today’s event is a milestone: Construction work on the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, has begun,” Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller said in a statement.
The project is a key element for the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream aims to increase the diversity of Russia’s export routes through Europe.
A treaty dispute between Gazprom and its counterparts in Ukraine, where the bulk of Russia’s gas is stored for Europe, is causing an increased risk on conventional routes, as can be heard from the official side.
Miller said the direct link to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, meant that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries were eliminated “forever.”
Bulgarian consumers will get gas from South Stream at discounted rates when the entire project goes live in 2015.
According to Gazprom, construction work in other neighbouring countries is to begin on the planned route by the end of the year.
The pipeline is designed to have an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic meters of natural gas.
For national and international investors, there is no way around Germany as a real estate location.
The economic framework is right, and the funding opportunities are excellent.
This has been the tenor of the 9th real estate day of the Börsen-Zeitung.
The German real estate markets benefit from the economic strength and the favourable economic conditions in the country in comparison with Europe.
Christian Ulbrich, CEO Europe, Middle East and Africa of Jones Lang LaSalle, pointed this out at the 9th real estate day of the Börsen-Zeitung.
According to Ulbrich, a look at the volume of transactions shows how sought-after German commercial real estate is.
In the first three quarters of this year, it increased by 31% compared to the previous year’s period.
In Great Britain, the increase was only 6%, in France 19%.
“Real estate investments offer attractive interest rates,” Ulbrich said.
The yield gap between real estate and federal bonds is at a historically high level.

Hearing before the Royal Commission: Two YMCA employees accused of sexual assault charges against Jonathan Lord
Two New South Wales (NSW) YMCA employees were charged with child sex offences before allegations were made against Caringbah nurse Jonathan Lord in 2011, according to the Royal Commission on Child Sexual Abuse.
However, in the opening statement before the Commission, the YMCA had stated that “in the organisation one had never had to deal with an incident of child sexual abuse”.
Chief Executive Phillip Hare was questioned about one case where one YMCA employee had been charged with child pornography offences and another in which a YMCA Caringbah Hall sports teacher had been convicted of abusing children entrusted to him in 1991.
Hare told Gail Furness, a lawyer assisting the commission, that he knew about the first case, but did not know about the second.
He acknowledged that the YMCA’s opening statement to the Commission was also inaccurate in claiming that “there have been external reviews of the YMCA that have recognized the YMCA as at the forefront of child safety.”
Rather, evidence before the Commission shows that the YMCA was informed that it received the second lowest rating of four possible in a quality audit conducted by the Department of Education and Communities (Ministry of Education) in August of that year.
Hare, who joined the YMCA at the age of 21, admitted that management had failed “from me on down” at Lord’s hiring and failed to ensure that employees were aware of their obligations to report violations of child safety guidelines.
Lord had been convicted earlier this year of sexually assaulting twelve boys during his two-year tenure with the YMCA.
He was sentenced to at least six years in prison.
Hare denied, however, that the YMCA had a cultural issue that prevented employees from reporting Lord’s child safety violations.
The staff said they had observed violations, including Lord being alone with children, caring for them privately as a babysitter, letting them sit on his lap, telling one that he loved it, and letting children play with his cell phone.
Danielle Ockwell, whose supervisor was Lord and who asked for child protection training because she was concerned about his behavior, testified that Child Services Manager Jacqui Barnat, who was Lords’ supervisor in the YMCA Caringbah, was “very intimidating and very unapproachable most of the time.”
The CEO stated that he would not accept statements from employees that they did not dare to report to their superiors.
Instead, he said, their friendship with Lord had impaired their judgment, so they did not report him.
Hare explained that he had informed the board of the YMCA NSW of his view that the lesson the organization had to learn from the “Jonathan Lord incident” was “not the reporting” by staff, and the board had agreed to it.
Hare said the decision to urge employees to sign confidentiality obligations shortly after the allegations arose had been made by YMCA’s Children’s Services Director Liam Whitley.
He said this was intended to prevent evidence from being contaminated, but it was “overzealous” and poorly implemented.
The YMCA NSW was not a safe organization for children during the period when Jonathan Lord was employed there between 2009 and 2011, Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University, an expert on child sexual abuse, told the commission.
He explained that there had been “serious problems” in hiring, reviewing, training, and supervising employees.
The hearing was adjourned until 20 December.
Tony Blair said he would seize the opportunity to return to Britain as prime minister, but acknowledged that a comeback was unlikely.
In an interview tonight on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his departure from office, the 59-year-old announced his views on various domestic policy issues.
Since resigning in June 2007, after a decade as head of state, Blair has largely avoided commenting on British politics, and his comments have mostly been limited to foreign policy and his role as envoy to the Quartet of Peacemakers in the Middle East.
When asked if he would like to return to the office of Prime Minister, Blair was quoted by the Evening Standard from London as saying, “Yes, sure, but it’s unlikely to happen, so...”
When the horse show experts gathered in droves in Cardiff to choose the horse of the year, they were aware that a fierce competition was imminent.
But no one was prepared for Fenton Kirkland, who was three years old.
The Knirps, who is not even in kindergarten and has only made his first steps a few months ago, and his Shetland pony Toffee trotted loosely through the three rounds and won the first prize – leaving 30 adult opponents behind.
The inseparable pair, both of the same size, were praised for their appearance, behaviour and style at the annual competition hosted by the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
When competing against men and women with elegant melons, he had his cap set at a cheeky angle and led the two-year-old toffee through the ring.
Fenton was praised by the jurors for his natural abilities in handling the pony, which were well above his age.
And Toffee received top marks for his demeanor and personality.
Fenton had received Toffee as a gift for his third birthday last March and has been practicing with the Shetland Pony every day since.
His mother, Donna, 30, said, "Fenton and Toffee are a great team."
They had to compete against the entire field of participants and went off the pitch with the Gold Cup and Rosette.
It was only the second time he had participated in a competition with Toffee, and we were all thrilled when he won.
Complete strangers in the arena thought he was so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
The little boy from the village of Nantyglo, near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been showing horses for over a decade.
Howells said, “The whole audience was electrified and everybody cheered and clapped at him.”
He ran on sand the entire length of the arena and although he looked so tiny, he did a fantastic job.
Fenton is crazy about animals – he loves horses, tractors and farms and has two chickens to take care of.
The way he started, it won’t be long before he’s on the “Horse of the Year” show – and I’m sure he’ll do well.
A spokesman for the annual horse show said: “Fenton is only three, but he knows how to handle his pony.”
Together they make a great team.
The jurors rated Fenton and Toffee according to how well they had done and presented themselves in the demonstration ring.
They pay attention to good cooperation between Pony and Führer – and Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring.
I’m sure Fenton’s cute clothes did their part, which was a perfect fit for the occasion.
Chinese newspaper to be "reformed" after appeal
A Chinese newspaper that had called for the release of a reporter accused of defamation on the front page should be reformed, a press regulator said.
The Guangzhou-based New Express had printed a rare public call for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Chen later admitted on television that he had accepted bribes to falsify reports about a state-owned company.
Now, the New Express will undergo a "comprehensive rectification," the regulator said.
The "Rectification Order" was issued by the Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television Authority in Guangdong.
Preliminary investigations revealed that between September 2012 and August 2013, the New Express, which is part of the Yangcheng Evening News Group, had published several inaccurate reports on the publicly traded company Zoomlion.
"The editorial management of the New Express was disorderly," the regulator said in a statement.
She said the decision was made to “impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou and revoke his reporter’s license.”
In addition, the Yangcheng Evening News Group was instructed to carry out a full rectification of the New Express and recommended that the relevant authorities be identified at the New Express and that the management team of the New Express be immediately reviewed.
Chen had written several articles for the New Express reporting alleged financial irregularities at a construction machinery manufacturer called Zoomlion.
After he was arrested, the newspaper published two calls for his release on the front page and stood behind his journalistic work.
But then Chen appeared on state television and admitted that he had published false reports against payment.
“In this case, I have harmed Zoomlion as well as the entire news industry and its ability to gain the public’s trust,” he told state news channel CCTV.
I did it primarily because I was out for money and fame.
I realized that I was wrong.
Following Chen’s apology, the New Express released an apology on the front page, saying it had failed to check the reports correctly.
Several well-known suspects have recently made confessions on television.
Experts say confessions are still routinely enforced, despite a law change earlier this year that banned authorities from forcing anyone to blame themselves.
Drug tunnel with its own railway between the USA and Mexico discovered
One of the most sophisticated drug smuggling tunnels between the U.S. and Mexico, complete with lighting, ventilation and electric rail operation, has now been discovered.
The U.S. authorities described the 120-by-90-centimeter tunnel as one of the most sophisticated passages they would have ever found.
The zigzag-patterned tunnel, which spans nearly six football fields, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
There are countless inconspicuous warehouses in the area, making it easier to hide lorries loaded with drugs.
The tunnel was closed before drugs could be transported undetected, authorities said.
According to the court’s records, eight and a half tons of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine were recovered during the discovery of the tunnel.
Three men who worked as drivers, according to the authorities, were charged with possession and the intended sale of marijuana and cocaine.
If convicted, they face prison sentences ranging from ten years to life.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers rely on an extensive underground network of drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth major passage that has been discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered after the marijuana harvest in central Mexico in October, which presents the drug cartels with the challenge of how to get their product to consumers quickly.
In 2010, authorities found a nearly 640-meter-long passageway with rails that ran from a kitchen in a residential home in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr still love each other
Actor Orlando Bloom and model Miranda Kerr plan to separate in the future.
However, in an interview, Bloom said that he and Kerr still love each other.
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are parents to two-year-old Flynn.
Orlando Bloom has announced the separation of his wife, Miranda Kerr.
In an interview with US journalist Katie Couric, scheduled to air on Friday (local time), Bloom said that “life sometimes doesn’t go exactly as we plan or hope.”
Kerr and himself still loved each other, the 36-year-old stressed.
"We will support and love each other as parents of Flynn".
Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010, and their son Flynn was born in 2011.
According to the encyclopedia, veganism is subject to vegetarianism, but differs from it in a very significant way.
Because while vegetarians allow themselves the consumption of cream pie, ice cream or a strong Edam, these delicacies are not on the menu of a vegan.
Milk, cheese, egg, in addition to abstaining from meat and fish, the vegan refrains from all consumption of animal products - even honey is denied.
What remains, one may ask, but on closer inspection, the vegan food world is characterized by considerable ingenuity.
"Bread spreads are very popular," explains Ute Henkelmann, the owner of the local health food store, which offers a variety of special products for vegans.
Reuben Proctor also likes to visit the shop in Domgasse.
Born in New Zealand, he has been living vegan for 13 years. In Lampertheim he has (almost) everything he needs to live. "In 1997 I changed my diet and became a vegetarian".
At the turn of the century, the next step was taken and I became a vegan.
“The conviction came not just because of the diet, but because of the choice of shoes,” says Proctor, who prefers faux leather to normal leather.
He realized that it is also possible in other everyday matters without animal products.
First and foremost, being vegan is an ethics.
"I don't want animals to have to die for me," Proctor says of the vegan maxim, which extends to all consumer behavior.
Instead of mourning burgers, scrambled eggs or gummy bears, the vegan quickly discovered completely new products, the enthusiasm increased.
"It's a double bonus," says Proctor today, "actually, being vegan is not a renunciation, not an asceticism, it's an enrichment." The assumption that changing your diet reduces the choice of food options leads Proctor more to the power of habit.
And it is precisely these conditionings that have made many well-intentioned attempts fail.
"The addiction factor is a very crucial factor that makes many give up quickly, similar to smoking," Proctor makes a comparison.
And say, “There is no such thing as an animal.”
Often it is the spices or the type of preparation that make up the taste.
“But you can also create the same effect in other ways,” explains the vegan.
For example, Proctor brings eggplants, mushrooms and a few vegan sausages to a barbecue.
He pays attention to a balanced, varied diet, in which it should certainly taste decent once.
Of course, you want to have something in between your teeth, which is legitimate.
"It's supposed to taste good, but that's not just to reduce to animal food," said Proctor.
He had not suffered any health damage, including eating disorders, another widespread assumption.
For me, the changeover had a positive aspect.
I do not take up foreign cholesterol and have an increased vitamin content.
There are high-performance athletes who eat exclusively vegan.
"My blood values are excellent, I get checked often," says Proctor.
In particular, many vegansimus critics warn against the lack of vitamin B12.
“Since animals are fed feed instead of grazing on pasture, it is questionable whether the amount of vitamin B12 in the meat you buy in the fridge is high,” says Proctor.
For vegans, it is also possible to take the coenzyme in the form of tablets.
“My B12 levels are fine,” he explains.
Proctor does not have to go far in terms of food procurement.
After all, basic foods are everywhere and every supermarket now has soy milk and other products.
Everything I need, I can find on site.
I only buy something special from time to time.
"A lot of people overlook the fact that only the finished products are expensive, but this is also known to be the case with "ordinary" finished products."
In any case, the preparation of vegan dishes is much cheaper and less time-consuming than generally assumed.
“There’s a lot to discover in the home kitchen, with a few small tweaks you can get good, if not partially better results,” says Proctor.
Margarine instead of butter, a little more baking powder and carbon dioxide instead of egg, with his vegan cheesecake Proctor was also able to amaze his in-laws.
Family celebrations give the vegan a new spice.
This has dynamics, when you cook together, it has a new meaning.
“The situations that can arise are as different as the people themselves,” says Proctor.
Of course, he has also been met with skepticism.
You don't like my food anymore?
"Should I feel bad now because I drink milk?" - on such questions you have to act as a vegan with tact.
"I don't reject people, I'm part of this society," says Proctor.
And more precisely, the everyday world does not seem as vegan as suspected - and the vegan is not as restricted in everyday life as commonly assumed.
Fast food is also allowed.
There are fries everywhere!
“Many kebab shops offer falafel, or a vegetarian yufka,” says Proctor.
In a pizzeria, he avoids pasta dishes, or orders a pizza without cheese, all a matter of habit.
The restaurants are slowly adapting to this.
"When I started to eat vegan 13 years ago, everything was much more difficult," the New Zealander can identify a development: "You have to talk to the people, make them aware of it".
“If enough demands come, they may be inclined to supplement the menu,” he hopes.
Vegan restaurants are developing, such as the galley in Mannheim or the Café Vogelfrei.
Proctor wants other restaurants to have at least one vegan dish on the menu.
Basically, vegan dishes are there for everyone.
Anyone can eat them, so they are just the opposite of exclusive.
“Meat dishes, on the other hand, are exclusive, in the truest sense of the word, because they exclude others,” Proctor notes.
“If you want to avoid food scandals, veganism is a surefire way to make most of it impossible from the outset,” says Proctor.
However, the purchase of vegan products can be a bit difficult at the beginning.
Especially when one learns to understand that even in peanuts there can be animal additives as colorants, one seems to quickly leave courage with the observance of ethics with so many hurdles and traps.
This is not only why Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen have written a book: "Veganissimo - animal ingredients and their alternatives" explains the many ingredients that are added to food and cleaning products.
"You gradually develop a scanner look and know which signs and logos to pay attention to," says Proctor, "Sometimes it's better to take small steps than to stop or stumble."
Veganism, it is an important moral pointer that strikes at consciousness.
Maybe he doesn’t quite manage to get rid of his habits, but at least he can teach the consumer to critically question his habits.
The stock exchange operator Nasdaq OMX keeps its customers on their toes.
Trading on the Nasdaq Options Market was suspended on Friday afternoon German time.
In a communication, the operator blamed technical problems.
The other eleven US options markets, including two of the Nasdaq OMX, continued their business unhindered.
The recent incident continues a whole series of smaller and larger mishaps at the stock exchange operator.
Only on Tuesday, the Nasdaq indexes had not been calculated for an hour due to errors in the data transport.
In August of this year, there had been two breakdowns in one week alone.
First, the US investment bank Goldman Sachs had sent mass incorrect purchase orders to the options markets because of technical problems.
As a result, the exchange operators took almost a whole day to review and delete the orders.
Two days later, half of all stock trading in the U.S. came to a standstill for several hours due to a computer glitch on the Nasdaq exchange.
Facebook’s IPO also caused a stir last year.
The Nasdaq systems had not been able to cope with the flood of buy and sell orders, later determined the SEC and thundered the company to a record fine of $10 million.
Konstanz: Radler kills 63-year-old
According to the police, the accident occurred when a 26-year-old man was on Thursday evening, around 10 p.m., with a women's bicycle on the left sidewalk from the station square in the direction of Marktst<0xC3><0xA4>tte.
When suddenly a 63-year-old man stepped from a restaurant onto the sidewalk, the cyclist could no longer brake in time, according to the police.
In the following collision, the pedestrian was pressed against the wall of the house, then went down to the ground and wound his head about 15 centimetres long.
An ambulance team took the injured person to the hospital for medical treatment.
British police give Assange extradition notice
The British police today handed over a notice of extradition to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who sought refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London and applied for asylum.
Scotland Yard said it had sent the 40-year-old Australian a “invitation to stand up” and asked him to appear at a police station, adding that if he did not comply, he would face arrest.
Assange threatens extradition to Sweden on charges of sexual assault after his options have been exhausted under British law since the Supreme Court rejected his appeal against extradition earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would extradite him to the US, he sought refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London on June 19 and asked the South American country for political asylum.
"Scotland Yard has issued a request to a 40-year-old man to turn himself in at a police station at a time we have chosen," a spokesman said.
He continues to violate the terms of his release on bail.
The embassy did not comment on the delivery of the police request.
Assange fears he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States and charged with possible espionage charges after posting over 250,000 diplomatic messages on the WikiLeaks website.
Driver who raced at 210 km/h with hot drink between his legs receives <0xC2><0xA3>1,000 penalty
A motorist was fined <0xC2><0xA3>1,000 for driving at up to 210 km/h with a hot drink between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree, Essex, was stopped on 27 May with his Mercedes Benz on the A120 at Braintree.
After the police stopped him, they discovered the drink cup between his legs.
Before the Colchester District Court, Howie pleaded guilty without the necessary care and attention.
He received seven points and a six-month driving ban.
Howie was also ordered to pay <0xC2><0xA3>90 and a <0xC2><0xA3>100 victim surcharge.
Tax for foreign property owners against London's speculative bubble
The Treasury has provisionally calculated the CGT measure, but is still awaiting the final decision by Chancellor George Osborne, who had imposed a 7% stamp duty in the 2012 budget on apartments costing over <0xC2><0xA3>2 million, as well as annual fees for buyers who hold apartments as a company and not as individuals.
Already now, the revenue from the stamp duty on residential property in the Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea districts, which stood at <0xC2><0xA3>708 million in the 2012/13 tax year, exceeds the revenue for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the North East, North West, Yorkshire and the Humber region combined.
Cook said: “Following the increases in stamp duty on high-priced housing and the introduction of the associated anti-circumvention legislation, it is hard to say that high-quality real estate is undertaxed, regardless of the effects of the outdated community tax system.”
“But this move could make some foreign investors more reluctant to buy real estate in London, or prevent owners from selling,” he added.
First-class real estate – the top five to ten percent of the housing market by price – in London’s affluent South West belt, which stretches from Fulham to Wimbledon, has increased by a record 11.8% last year.
Prices in Central London showed a steady annual growth of 5.6%, but were overshadowed by an emerging "domestic market" in which the southwestern part of the city, the north (7.4%) and the east (6.5%) experienced an upward trend, according to a study by Savills.
Scientists were able to shed more light on how a dog’s tail wagging relates to his mood.
Previous research had shown that happy dogs wobbled more to the right with the tail (from the dog's point of view), while in nervous dogs it was the left side.
But now scientists say that other dogs can perceive and respond to these subtle differences.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trento, said: "It is well known in humans that the left and right hemispheres of the brain respond differently to stimuli that evoke positive or negative emotions."
Here we have tried to look at this in other species.
He also noted that in dogs, just like in humans, the right hemisphere of the brain is responsible for the movement of the left side and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres play different roles in the feelings.
To learn more about how dogs respond to their conspecifics’ lateral tail wagging, the researchers monitored the animals while watching other dogs’ movies.
They measured the heart rate of the four-legged friends and analyzed the behavior.
We will probably soon understand why the tail moves in one direction or the other.
Professor Vallortigara said: “We showed the dogs movies with dogs – either a lifelike version or a silhouette to eliminate distracting other aspects, and we were able to control the movement of the tail more to the left or right.”
When the animals saw how an otherwise expressionless dog moved the tail to the right (as seen from the wagging dog’s perspective), they remained completely relaxed.
But if the tail tilt was mainly to the left (again from the dog wagging perspective), their heart rate rose and they looked restless.
According to Professor Vallortigara, the dogs do not intentionally communicate with each other through these movements.
Rather, he is convinced that the dogs would have learned from experience what movements they should be worried about and when they should not.
He said: "If you have different encounters with other dogs and the wagging of the tail in one direction is more associated with friendly behavior and the right side produces less friendly behavior, then you react based on these experiences."
The researchers say the findings could help dog owners, veterinarians, and trainers better understand their animal’s emotions.
John Bradshaw, an expert in dog behaviour and a visiting fellow at the University of Bristol’s Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, said this was not the first study to examine whether left and right are important for dogs.
Last year, a team from the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn their heads to the left when they look at an aggressive dog, and to the right when it’s a satisfied dog.
Another research paper at the University of Victoria in Canada said: “Dogs are more likely to approach a robot dog when its ‘tail’ wags left rather than right rather than getting restless – just the other way around than in the Italian study.”
According to him, the differences could be due to the fact that the dogs in the various studies did not interpret the animals in the films or the robot dogs as dogs.
A study of how dogs respond to real dogs could help, he explained.
“While there is considerable evidence for many different mammals that the two hemispheres of the brain are used for different purposes, many of the details have yet to be determined – and dogs are no exception,” Bradshaw said.
However, since their behavior can be easily recorded, it will probably not be long before we understand why the tail sometimes moves in one direction, sometimes in the other.
Arctic Monkeys postpone gig in Glasgow due to Alex Turner's illness
The rock band Arctic Monkeys has postponed an appearance in Glasgow after their lead singer fell ill with laryngeal inflammation.
The Sheffield band was scheduled to play at Hydro on Friday.
However, due to the illness of lead singer Alex Turner, the concert must now be postponed.
The band's announcement came after they had previously postponed a gig at the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on their official website, the Arctic Monkeys said: “Following the decision to cancel the show at the LG Arena in Birmingham tonight, as well as on medical advice, the Arctic Monkeys must also cancel the show at the Hydro in Glasgow on Friday, November 1st.”
"Alex Turner has been diagnosed with laryngeal inflammation, which is why he unfortunately cannot appear."
The show at the LG Arena in Birmingham will now take place on November 20, which was moved to the Hydro in Glasgow on November 21.
All tickets remain valid for these shows.
We apologize to all ticket holders for any inconvenience this may cause.

Pope Francis appoints first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will for the first time appoint new cardinals to the Catholic Church on February 22, as the Vatican announced on Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest-ranking clerics in the Catholic Church after the Pope, and they are also the ones who elect a Pope, so Francis will appoint the first group of men who will ultimately participate in the election of his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, a cardinal who has reached the age of 80 can no longer participate in the papal election – this falls to a group of 120 “voting cardinals”.
In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, said there would be a meeting of all cardinals before the ceremony to appoint the new cardinals, also known as the consistory, was held.
“Pope Francis has decided to announce his decision to convene the consistory in February in advance so that other meetings that require the participation of cardinals from all over the world can be scheduled,” Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said the number of cardinals eligible to vote will likely have decreased by February.
He explained that a pope usually appoints as many cardinals as necessary to restore the number of cardinals eligible to vote to 120, and as many cardinals over 80 as he likes.
The consistory next year is significant because it is the first since the election of Francis in March this year, Valero said.
There is currently a certain overhang on the part of Europe and especially Italy.
“It will be interesting to see if the new Pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance,” he said.
Forty percent of Catholics live in South America, but they have only a tiny number of cardinals.
The cardinals will also be the first to be called since the formation of the Council of Cardinals, founded by Francis, a group of eight cardinals from around the world charged with finding ways to reform the Church.
In the past, the Pope decided everything on his own.
“Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him,” Valero said.
He said it was “possible” for Francis to ask the cardinals for advice.
But so far we have not been in this position – this is all completely new.
Valero said bishops would typically be called cardinals from large places, but Francis was “full of surprises – so we don’t know who he is appointing.”
GM recalls new pickup trucks in U.S. to repair seat backrest
General Motors recalls nearly 19,000 of its all-new 2014 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks to address a problem with the manually adjustable backrest, according to a statement released Friday by the U.S. Vehicle Safety Regulator.
In some of the cars, there may be a defect in the mechanism for resetting the front seat backrest.
For this reason, they do not meet the federal guidelines for vehicle safety for head restraints.
"If the vehicle is driven from behind, it is possible that the headrest does not properly protect the occupants, so there is an increased risk of injury," the message on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) website read.
The recalled models were manufactured between August 1 and September 10.
The delivery of the GM trucks began in June and marks the major model launch of the leading U.S. automaker since the bankruptcy-related restructuring in 2009.
GM informed vehicle owners of the defect in the first half of October.
NHTSA could not review the notification letter because of the 16-day government shutdown, which had a negative impact on car sales in October.
Sales of the Silverado and Sierra trucks, which were newly developed for the 2014 model year, increased by 20 percent in the first ten months of the year, GM said on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado and 16,503 Sierra pickup trucks.
GM stock on the New York Stock Exchange rose 1.4 percent to $37.47 on Friday afternoon.
An Obama Voter's Cry of Desperation
I voted for President Obama twice in the hope that change is possible.
He says Obama has made commendable efforts thwarted by Republican blockade tactics
Blockade policy does not excuse Obamacare’s website problems, drone attacks
Obama’s 2008 campaign memoirs are a sad reminder of what could have been.
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year student at Harvard Medical School.
I am currently reading a very sad book.
It is a book that I believed would cheer me up during the gloomy second year of my medical school and give me hope again.
It is called "The Audacity to Win" and describes Barack Obama's memoirs of the 2008 presidential election.
When I finish my patient records in the evening and go to bed, the book takes me back to a time when politics inspired millions and took the breath away from talking.
The election turned into a landslide victory and news anchors paused to highlight the historical significance of this hour.
My classmates cried with joy, and my parents collected all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of visionaries was on their way to the White House and the nation was ready for change.
When Obama took office in 2008, he had approval ratings of 82%.
And then I close the book.
Switching back to the present is a bad awakening, like being ripped from a dream.
It’s hard to remember these optimistic times – they seem to be a vague memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years since I first cast my vote, something has actually changed.
But it’s just not something I could have imagined.
I recognize the great and multifaceted things Obama has accomplished, from the passage of the Affordable Care Act for health insurance to the military withdrawal from Iraq, the end of the forced concealment of homosexuality in the army, and the killing of Osama bin Laden.
I, too, believe that the partisan blockade tactic has tipped too many aspirations with which our nation should be moved forward: immigration reform, a public option for health insurance, and the closing of Guantanamo Bay, to name a few.
But after defending the Obama administration countless times against colleagues and acquaintances, I have come to the end of my attempts at explanation.
I have reached a point of political desperation.
Republican blockade policies cannot explain why they allow the wiretapping of foreign heads of state or the killing of innocent children by drones overseas.
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data about the private lives of Americans and why whistleblowers are being punished for disclosing state misconduct.
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, was murdered without trial, nor why the public funding and spending limits are circumvented during the presidential elections.
It does not justify the results of a report that said the White House’s efforts to shut down the media were “the most aggressive ... since the Nixon administration.”
And more recently, it cannot excuse the inability to design a simple website in the more than three years since the passage of the Affordable Care Act.
I don't know if that's what I should have expected.
Whether I should have understood at the age of 18 that the government’s work could contradict the political campaigns that preceded it.
Obviously, the House of Representatives is not a predictable course, as an opposition party and random events such as the Newtown massacre shape public discussion.
But when I look at the above examples, they seem to be largely elected by the government itself.
And that bothers me the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney represented a confusing and untapped alternative, he seemed unable to determine his direction and positions.
I had the impression that a second term for Obama, free from the pressure of future elections, would fulfill the hope we had heard about for so long.
But with Obama’s approval ratings falling below 45% this week, the return to 2008 has become all the harder with this book.
It awakens in me the longing for the many promises that have dissolved into air.
This week, I read a section in the book that describes how Obama suffered a serious loss against Clinton in the Pennsylvania primary.
In a meeting with the electoral assistants after the decision, he told his employees that they had to get back on track and follow the purpose of their case.
"I want us to find our magic again," he said.
We need to remember who we are.
It's five years later, Mr. President, and I couldn't agree more with you.
The views expressed in this comment are solely those of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claims Prime Minister Tony Abbott has conflict of interest in parental leave
Billionaire and MP Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in a conflict of interest in his parental leave plans because his daughters are pregnant and could benefit from it.
The mining magnate, who is in a legal battle over paying $6 million in carbon taxes, made the allegation when he wanted to wipe questions off the table as to whether he was in a conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which are important for deciding whether to cut or cut carbon and mining taxes.
But Palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest and that Abbott’s daughters would personally benefit from the laws.
“He’s in a big conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave, because when one of his daughters gets pregnant, he has a direct interest in whether she gets a leave or not,” Palmer said.
Two months after the election, the Electoral Commission officially declared Palmer the winner of the Sunshine Coast seat of Fairfax by 53 votes.
Palmer called for a revision of the vote counting process to speed up the process.
Tony Abbott's daughters Frances and Bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after the end of the vote?
“We need a better system,” he said.
Why shouldn’t we have a system where you invade, enter the data into a computer, dial it immediately, and then have the result at 6:30 in the evening?
Palmer also criticized the use of pencils when marking ballots.
Do you use them because you can erase the results if you don’t like them?
Tuning in with pencils these days is incredible.
The Electoral Commission has examined the options for an electronic election and recently published a joint legislative proposal with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, stated that his policy includes an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he will take his new office "very seriously."
A public office is about serving the public.
"We seek no reward but that of history, namely that we can serve this community at a critical time," he said.
RBS suspends two foreign exchange traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange department, according to two people familiar with the situation; this is another indication that the global regulatory investigation into suspected currency market manipulations is picking up speed.
Some of the world’s largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, confirmed that they are working with the authorities on the investigation into the world’s largest financial market, where $5.3 trillion changes hands every day.
The two traders would be the first RBS employees to be suspended in the expanding investigation that the scandal surrounding the Libor interbank business entails.
The bank, which did not comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it had received requests for information from authorities.
“Our investigation on this issue continues and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and other regulators,” the bank said two weeks ago.
Last month, people close to the situation said the RBS had forwarded the records of emails and instant messages sent by and to a previous trader to the UK regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This trader, Richard Usher, had left the RBS in 2010 and is now said to have been on leave from his current position as European head of Forex spot trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of European spot trading at Citi, was suspended this week and Matt Gardiner, former chief currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended from Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders were accused of any wrongdoing.
Usher’s instant message group included bankers at Barclays and Citigroup, people close to the situation said.
UBS announced this week that it had taken steps against some of its employees after the Swiss regulator Finma said it was investigating an alleged manipulation of the foreign exchange market at a number of Swiss banks.
At least six authorities worldwide – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss competition authority Weko, the FCA, the US Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are currently dealing with allegations that bankers have agreed on transactions in the currency market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also launched internal investigations or received requests for information from authorities, people familiar with the situation said.
Banks scour instant messages and emails from several years in search of cases of misconduct.
News of these investigations has thrown traders into turmoil in an area that has been one of the most profitable of investment bank trading units in recent years, but has been under pressure this year as low currency volatility limits opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to downplay the affair, saying it is nearly impossible to manipulate the vast and highly liquid foreign exchange market, but leading traders believe this is not necessarily true.
A leading trader noted that despite the enormous daily volume in foreign exchange trading, the fragmentation of liquidity between the various trading platforms and the increasing use of its own internal platforms by banks means that “you can influence the market even with very low ticket prices”.
The news came the same day Credit Suisse announced that it had terminated a trader at its London Exchange Traded Funds office this week after causing a loss of just under $6 million late last year.
The Bank promptly informed the competent authorities and cooperated with them.
“We are sure that the trader acted alone and that the matter is contained,” Credit Suisse said.
Painted the construction fence on the Bechtle property
A group of the citizens' initiative "Schweizer Wiese" has embellished the construction fence on the Bechtle plot on the spa promenade in Bad Herrenalb.
It also cleaned and widened the footpath, according to a press release.
The planned covering of the decaying house in the rear part of the property had not been allowed for safety reasons, because the terrain threatens to slip off.
Alfred Abel, who currently manages the property, had agreed to the beautification action with his colleague Reinhard Domke from BI.
Before the action of the BI, a banner with the message "We are for it" had been placed.
However, this did not disturb the approximately 20 members of the citizens' initiative in their action.
Their motto on the large poster was "We are against construction ruins".
With this, she wanted to point out the danger of even larger ruins on the Swiss meadow - should the giant project fail one day.
Talking to many passers-by in front of the "construction site" it became clear that some citizens believe that many will be better off with the realization of the city's project, although not a few have the same questions about the dimension of the presented project as the BI.
But they are starting to resign because the city is further delaying these answers, the BI says.
The mayor’s public statements also had an impact.
May had said in the municipal council meeting that he feared the end for the thermal bath should the population vote against the plans for a bathing and wellness complex on the Swiss meadow in the citizens' decision.
Some therefore appear to be downright frightened, others perceive it as a "clumsy blackmail attempt" on the population, according to the BI press release.
The BI thanked the donors for the colour and all the helpers.
Rangnick curse for Schiris: Mane no Swallow King
As satisfied as Ralf Rangnick is with the current top form of Bundesliga table leader Red Bull Salzburg, the sporting director of the "Bulls" was disappointed by the referees.
"There is currently a dangerous tendency for Mane and Alan to be pushed into the category of Swallow Kings," he said at a press conference in Salzburg on Thursday.
The most recent reason for Rangnick’s criticism was yellow for Mane in the 3-0 against Grödig last Sunday, in which the Senegalese was an alleged actor to the doom – which, of course, was not, as the TV images showed.
"A blatantly wrong decision," said Rangnick, who described referee Harkam as "completely overwhelmed".
Harkam would also have contributed "his part" to the escalation between Salzburg coach Roger Schmidt and Grödig coach Adi Hütter after the game.
He defended his German compatriot decisively: "I would have behaved the same way as Roger Schmidt in every single situation".
Schmidt himself wants to have had no contact with his colleague after the skirmish with Hütter.
I don't know why.
“I’m the one who was insulted,” the 46-year-old said.
However, given the success, Rangnick sang a hymn of praise.
“There are only two words for that: Really good,” he stated.
There's not much to complain about.
The way the team plays is particularly impressive.
Let it go on like this.
There will be hardly any changes in the winter transfer time.
There are no great reasons to change anything.
"Unless a player approaches with the wish that he wants to leave the club," Rangnick clarified.
Supreme Court upholds Obama’s health care law
It is a great victory for the Obama administration: the US Supreme Court today ruled that the health care law closely linked to Barack Obama is constitutional.
By five to four votes, the judges ruled that the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – forcing U.S. citizens to take out health insurance or pay a penalty by 2014 – is constitutional under the state’s tax authority.
Supreme Judge John Roberts sided with the four more liberal members of the Chamber, while Judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito, and Kennedy ruled against it.
The court also upheld the remaining sections of the 2,700-page law and held that the requirement of the Health Act that states must either extend Medicaid access requirements or otherwise cancel all state Medicaid funding was not unconstitutional.
The lawsuit against the law had been initiated by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The bill had been strongly opposed by all leading Republican presidential candidates, including eventual challenger Mitt Romney, in the 2012 primary campaign.
Norway: Norwegian town lights up with giant mirrors
With huge mirrors, the inhabitants of a Norwegian village have brought light into their gloomy valley.
Due to the low degree of sunlight, the Rjukan, located in the Vestfjord valley, usually sinks from autumn to spring in the shade of the surrounding mountains.
With three gigantic reflectors at a height of 45 meters, a century’s dream came true on Wednesday.
"Finally!" enthused Mayor Steinar Bergsland at the start ceremony on TV2.
Some people in the valley prepared sun loungers, others put on sunglasses for safety reasons.
Until now, sun-seekers had to ride a cable car to a nearby summit in winter.
Ten years ago, local artist Martin Andersen proposed using mirrors to direct the rays into the valley.
However, this basic idea had existed in the town since 1913.
After several years of debate, the city council finally passed the 5 million kroner (about 615,000 euros) expensive project.
A similar construction has given the Italian alpine town of Viganella winter sunshine for several years.
Post barely reads on Sundays
"Many citizens will not have noticed it yet, the red dots for the Sunday emptying are still on different mailboxes of the core city and the districts, but if you read the small print on the yellow containers of the Post AG, you quickly find out that the emptying no longer takes place on Sundays and holidays," says the FDP.
A question from the FDP confirmed this.
On Sundays and public holidays, only in front of the post office building in Ernst-Ludwig-Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e 36 and in Jakob-Müller-Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e 1 in Hüttenfeld will be emptied.
Whether Sundays will be emptied in Hofheim and Rosengarten will not be answered in the answer to the FDP’s question.
The social and youth policy spokesman of the FDP, Fritz Röhrenbeck, wants to catch up here.
The Sunday emptying is an important postal service, especially for appointment mail.
"This one thins out this enterprise radically and unreasonably despite the price increase for letters on January 2013".
Thomas Bittner, chairman of the Liberals’ faction and city association, supports his fellow faction members: “What annoys me is the fact that emptying times are secretly changed or even deleted here.”
The post office is miles away from the citizens.
"At least the mailboxes in the districts of Neuschlo<0xC3><0x9F> and Rosengarten have to be emptied again on Sundays," said Bittner and Röhrenbeck in unison.
Especially non-mobile citizens would also have to be able to reach a mailbox with Sunday emptying within walking distance.
Röhrenbeck asked in the city parliament whether the city administration is planning talks with the post office about this matter.
Mayor Erich Maier replied that the Post had not communicated with Lampertheim.
To his knowledge, however, there is also a Sunday emptiness in Hofheim.
His party has called for privatization.
“Then decisions will be made elsewhere,” Maier said.
Frankfurt parking fees expected to rise sharply
Parking in Frankfurt could soon become more expensive.
The city's magistrate is advising this morning on a presentation by traffic officer Stefan Majer (Greens).
Parking fees are to be increased by 50 percent.
However, the aim is not to raise the prices, but to shorten the time interval of parking meters and parking ticket machines from 30 to 20 minutes.
In December, the city council will have to decide.
The retail committee of the Frankfurt Chamber of Commerce considers this "not a good idea".
Parking directly in front of the store was "a not to be underestimated advantage for smaller retailers".
The Verkehrsclub Deutschland is of the opinion that an increase after two decades is "quite appropriate and actually long overdue".
Public transport will also be more expensive.
Freudenstadt: Quick actions surprise hosts
With a narrow squad, the men I of the TSV Freudenstadt had to compete in the Schiller-Schulturnhalle in Reutlingen against the TG Gönningen from the Swabian Alb.
The <0xC3><0x84>lbler were on the other side of the net with an experienced team.
However, it soon became apparent that they, also because of their age, could not quite keep up with the fast actions of the Freudenstadters.
With the hard and placed serves, the Gönningers made themselves extremely difficult.
Repeatedly, they missed the passes and attacks played by Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz cleanly over the center of the net and were not available in the block defense.
Two high first set wins clearly expressed the superiority of the Freudenstadters in all matters.
In view of this crushing and game-defining performance, the third set was then won a little lax and listlessly to the 3-0 final score (25:13, 25:14, 25:22).
There will be a much more powerful opponent on the field on November 2 with the TV Baiersbronn, which was clearly able to prevail in Nagold.
TSV Freudenstadt I: Dominik B<0xC3><0xA4>uerle, Yannik Büchle, Sebastian Dölker, Felix P<0xC3><0xA4>lchen, Stefan R<0xC3><0xA4>ller, Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz.
In the B-Class, the second teams from Baiersbronn and Freudenstadt faced each other in the Murgtalhalle in Baiersbronn.
They delivered a hard-fought two-hour match.
Nervousness on both sides caused errors and point gifts, especially in the reception of the ball; also in the passes the precision was sometimes in short supply and in some critical game scenes the overzealousness prevented the view for possible point wins.
In this performance-wise very balanced encounter, the TSV team of Marcus Blasutto was all about the great physical effort and a gratifying commitment of both teams.
Care day at the small Engl<0xC3><0xA4>nderhütte
For the fifth day of care in the wake of the Natura 2000 project Upper Hotzenwald, a group of committed participants met at the small Engl<0xC3><0xA4>nderhütte in Ibach.
Due to suggestions from the population, the view of the valley in the area of the hut should be cut free on this day, said Mayor Helmut Kaiser.
According to Kaiser, many hikers described this area as the highlight of the Schluchtensteig, where the landscape offers the ideal setting for magnificent views.
He thanked those present for their willingness to cooperate and stressed that the day of care was a suitable instrument to strengthen the connection between man and nature.
It offers every citizen the opportunity to set accents in nature itself.
At the same time with the tourist aspect, the ecological aspect can also be taken into account.
Friederike Tribukait from the Nature Conservation Department of the Regional Executive Office of Freiburg explained this ecological aspect following the welcome by District Administrator Tilman Bollacher, who had taken over the patronage and wished the action a successful outcome.
According to Tribukait, the tourist destination of the far-sightedness coincides with the goal of preserving the now heavily overgrown old Allmendweidfeld with its specific protected habitat types by opening and connecting it to the still existing pastures.
Certain species, such as rare butterflies and grasshoppers, cannot overcome barriers in the form of forest areas.
You need these free connections to preserve the species.
Tribukait said she did not want to miss breaking a lance for the planned biosphere area at this point.
The current measure is not only seamlessly integrated into this planning.
A biosphere area also offers the opportunity for sustainable economic and ecological development on the basis of the internationally recognized UNESCO status and thus a continuous addition to what has been achieved with the Life project and the previous care days for the future.
After these various presentations, district manager Christoph Wehle and Life project manager Cornelia Bischoff divided the helpers into groups.
The larger trees had already been felled in advance, the forest tractor could be called up if necessary.
A group of helpers should take care of the clearance of juniper bushes and the care of a dry stone bar.
The goal was the clear view at the vantage point.
Löffingen: Köpfler still the only candidate
Information on the Internet: Although the small town of Löffingen with its 7514 inhabitants, an intact infrastructure, a forward-looking school, children, youth and senior citizens policy, as well as its own municipal utilities can be described as an attractive city, no second mayoral candidate has yet come forward.
The 46-year-old banker and business economist Dieter Köpfler from Löffingen has so far been the only candidate to succeed the mayor Norbert Brugger, who is no longer a candidate for reasons of age.
The application deadline is Monday, November 11, at 6 pm.
Google, Samsung, Huawei sued over Nortel patents
The group, which owns thousands of previous Nortel patents, filed an avalanche of patent infringement lawsuits against mobile phone manufacturers on Thursday, including Google, the company he outbid at Nortel’s bankruptcy auction.
Rockstar, the consortium that bought the Nortel patents for $4.5 billion, sued Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringements in the U.S. District Court in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of patent infringement in seven cases.
The patents concerned technology that matches search terms on the Internet with relevant advertising, according to the lawsuit, which thus strikes at the core of Google’s search engine business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not immediately reachable.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC manufacture phones that run Google’s Android operating system, which is in fierce competition with Apple and Microsoft’s mobile products.
In 2011, Google made an initial bid of $900 million for the Nortel patents.
Google has increased its offer several times and recently offered $4.4 billion.
After it was outbid by Rockstar on Nortel’s patents, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a deal that was also motivated in part by Motorola’s library of patents.
"Although Google has failed in its attempt to acquire the patents at auction, Google has infringed the patents and continues to do so," the lawsuit said.
Rockstar is demanding high damages from Google, as it claims Google’s patent infringement is intentional, according to the accusation.
Egypt sworn in as first freely elected president
Mohammed Morsi takes the oath of office, but his day of triumph should not mean the end of political disputes in Egypt.
The Islamist Mohammed Morsi promised a "new Egypt" when he was sworn in as the country's first freely elected president, succeeding Husni Mubarak, who had been ousted from office 16 months earlier.
With his inauguration in front of the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the Arab world’s first freely elected Islamist president and Egypt’s fifth head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy some 60 years ago.
He took the oath before the 18 black-robed judges of the court, which has its seat on the Nile and is modelled on an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We are striving for a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic," Morsi said at the ceremony, which was broadcast live on state television.
“Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom, true democracy and stability,” said 60-year-old Morsi, a U.S.-trained engineer and member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that had mostly been targeted by the respective government as a banned organization since its inception 84 years ago.
Hundreds of soldiers and police guarded the building when Morsi arrived in a small car convoy shortly after 11 a.m. local time.
Only a few hundred supporters had gathered in front of the court to cheer on the new president, and unlike the presidential pageantry from the Mubarak era, traffic was only briefly stopped so that the auto convoy could cross the usually busy street that connects the city center with the southern suburbs.
Derided as an uncharismatic “spare wheel” of the Brotherhood, his personal prestige has increased since his victory and a Friday speech in which he presented himself not only as a candidate of the Islamists, but all those who wanted to bring the aspirations of the 2011 uprising against the authoritarian Mubarak to the goal.
"Egypt today is a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," Morsi, dressed in a blue suit with a red tie, told the judges in the wood-paneled chamber where he took the oath of office.
Later, Morsi went to the University of Cairo, where he was to give his inaugural speech.
He was officially greeted by an army band that played the national anthem, which he listened to in accord.
The military leader Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi was present.
On his arrival, he was greeted by hundreds of people in the largest lecture hall of the university with speaking choirs of "The army and the people are one hand".
Built in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, Cairo University developed into a stronghold of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
On Friday, Morsi took a symbolic oath in Tahir Square, the birthplace of the uprising that led to the end of Mubarak’s authoritarian rule last year, and vowed to reclaim presidential powers that the military council had taken from the ousted head of state.
But by taking the official oath before the court and not before parliament as usual, he bows to the will of the military, indicating that the power struggle will continue.
Morsi’s speech on Tahir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
Falkenberger Discotheque ensures two great evenings
The new season in the Falkenberg discotheque "Blue Velvet" has begun.
On Friday evening it is called "Pump this party", tomorrow Saturday evening it continues with an <0xC3><0x9C> 25 party.
Bold beats and cool sounds are of course promised by the organizers on both days.
Workers fell from ladder: seriously injured
On Thursday, replacing a defective external sensor, a 51-year-old worker in Eggelsberg fell from a ladder and seriously injured himself.
The man from Lamprechtshausen wanted to replace a defective heating sensor on the outer facade of an inn.
As he climbed onto the ladder leaning against the gutter, it slipped away and the man fell to the concrete floor.
He suffered serious injuries and was taken to the Salzburg State Hospital with the rescue helicopter "Christophorus 6".
Rapist in South Africa sentenced to two life sentences
Nine months after the brutal rape and mutilation of a 17-year-old girl in South Africa, the perpetrator was sentenced to two life sentences on Friday.
This was reported by the broadcaster SABC.
The victim later died as a result of serious injuries.
John Cana had already been found guilty at the beginning of the week of the crime.
The incident caused national outrage.
The then 21-year-old had raped Anene Booysen in February in an industrial area in Bredasdorp near Cape Town.
For 14 hours, the doctors fought for the survival of the victim, but in vain.
The sight of the young people was so horrifying that the nurses and nurses needed psychological assistance.
Kana had admitted to being in a bar with Booysen during the trial on the night of the crime.
He also confessed to beating and raping her, but denied being responsible for the girl's death.
The police initially assumed several perpetrators, but released two suspects from custody because the evidence against them was not sufficient.
The prosecutor also stressed during the trial that she was convinced that Kana was alone at the time of the attack.
In South Africa, rape is almost part of everyday life: Every year there are about 64,000 sexual violence complaints.
This is almost ten times as much as in Germany, but with 82 million people it has significantly more inhabitants than South Africa (50 million).
Police and women’s associations in South Africa estimate the number of victims of sexual violence to be 10 to 25 times higher.
Jumbo visits the Black Forest ham
Jumbo in search of the "best ham in the world": For the TV program "Galileo" visited the Pro7 star Bonndorf.
The speaker makes it clear right from the start: the most important thing for the ham are the pork legs, turbomast is not a good prerequisite.
So can ham that you get in any supermarket be a quality product?
As head of the large ham factory in the Black Forest, Jumbo explains the working methods of the company "Adler" in Bonndorf.
"Germany's dearest ham", as Jumbo announces the Black Forest ham.
Only with hair protection and a coat does he enter the interior of the factory.
Jumbo also has to disinfect his hands before he can reach for the microphone.
Jumbo spotted for refreshment at fast food in Waldshut
"This is where huge amounts of work are done for me," marvel the TV makers, Black Forest ham as a mass product.
16,000 clubs a week speak for themselves.
Weight, fat content, colour: Uli explains what is important in terms of quality.
Most pigs are slaughtered at six months.
TV at a high level?
Details such as the pH value of the meat also play a role.
The darker the meat, the higher the pH value.
“I’m looking forward to seeing what happens when you measure Roberto Blanco,” said Jumbo cynically.
Here, the level of private television is presented in pure culture.
But it is worth watching anyway.
The spectator sees that the disassembling of the clubs is still manual work.
Because: Black Forest ham is traditionally found without bones on the shelf.
The secret of the ham is the spice mixture with the salt.
Smoke tower and smoke firing visually remind Jumbo of a "submarine".
The trick: Fir branches provide the special taste of Black Forest ham here in the smoke.
20 days in the smoke finally make the ham almost black.
"Now the disc disappears in the jumbo," he announces the test food.
"It's really delicious," concluded the TV star.
All those involved will be able to live with it.
You thought travel agencies were a thing of the past thanks to the internet?
Flight Centre seems to be resisting the trend.
The company has raised its full-year earnings outlook and expects record revenue from holidaymakers in Australia and the UK.
The travel company now expects an adjusted annual profit before tax of between $325 million and $340 million, compared to $305 million to $315 million in its previous forecast.
If the current target values are reached, that means growth of 12 to 17 percent compared to the record profit of 290.4 million dollars in the period 2011/12.
As CEO Graham Turner announced, Flight Centre achieved an eight percent profit in the first half of the year and had a strong start to the second half of the year, especially in the Australian and British private business.
“Since the beginning of the year, our ten countries have been profitable, and some of them are well on their way towards record-breaking year-on-year pre-interest and tax revenues,” he said.
These include Australia and the UK, which are typically among our strongest earnings drivers.
In Australia, the leisure industry recovered in the second half of the year, compensating for a slightly weaker market for business travel.
Flight Centre’s leisure business in the UK performed similarly well, while business customers also spent less.
U.S. business rebounded from the seasonally weaker first half of the year, with full-year earnings expected for the third year in a row.
Flight Centre shares rose 3 cents yesterday to $38.20.
Schools are being held to greater focus on mathematics, spelling and grammar
In courses on English literature, pupils will in future have to deal with at least a play by Shakespeare, a novel of the 19th century, romantic poetry and contemporary British novels from 1914 onwards.
The examination also includes "unseen texts" to encourage wider reading.
The combined course of English literature and language will be abolished.
Starting in 2015, students will be required to take a stand-alone GCSE exam for language, with strong incentives to choose English literature as a separate qualification.
The Ministry of Education will publish the new curricula for English and mathematics tomorrow – the first subjects that have been radically redesigned.
Other core subjects will be changed next year.
In a separate initiative, Ofqual, the audit regulator, will announce a reorganization of the GCSE structures, including a new grading system and less coursework.
In a speech in the summer, Education Secretary Michael Gove said that there is a “wide consensus that we need to reform our audit system to restore public trust,” stressing that the GCSEs will become “more challenging, ambitious and rigorous.”
Studies show that English schools spend less time on mathematics – 116 hours per year or three hours per week per school year – than most other countries.
In contrast, Australian schools teach an average of 143 hours a year and students in Singapore receive 138 hours.
While there will be no formal requirement to allow more time for mathematics in the timetable, coalition circles say the comprehensive math exam – combined with a stronger emphasis on the subject in rankings – will probably encourage schools to set more hours.
The curriculum focuses more on real-life problems, including financial mathematics.
Beautiful animals and delicious cakes lure
The most beautiful rabbits of different breeds and color strokes will be presented at the Kreisverbandsleistungsschau this weekend in the Bürgerhaus.
The evaluations were made on Thursday.
Once again, the local association W514 is hosting this large exhibition.
Breeders of the existing clubs in the district of Soest show here their best animals as well as young Wickeder hobby owners their rabbits.
On Thursday, six judges evaluated the numerous rabbits and were able to award outstanding animals.
The visitors of the show are well informed, as the assessment of all animals is appropriate on the cages.
The official opening of the exhibition will take place on Saturday at 2.30 p.m.
The rabbit show is open to all visitors on Saturday from 10 am and on Sunday from 10 am to 3.30 pm, followed by the award ceremony.
The guests are also invited to a raffle filled with stately prizes and to a deliciously equipped cafeteria.

Salem: Johanna Rahner at the Ecumenical Discussion Forum
The next Ecumenical Forum on Monday, October 21, in the New Museum of the Castle will focus on the topic "To Hell with Hell - Theological Reflections on Today's Dealing with the Last Things".
The speaker is Professor Johanna Rahner.
The Ecumenical Forum is an initiative of the Catholic and Protestant churches in Salem, Salem Castle and the Bodenseekreis Cultural Office.
Johanna Rahner wants to investigate in the forum the question of how today people classify the "last things" after death.
If people had known too much about this in the past centuries and had relied on those images of heaven and hell that still shape our conceptions today, the contemporary prophetic doctrine of the hopes of perfection is characterized rather by a certain embarrassment or even speechlessness.
"The greater hope for Christians has been driven out by the criticism of religion," says the speaker.
“I have provided us with so many question marks that we seem to have lost the exclamation points.”
Johanna Rahner continues: "But the decisive challenge remains the annoyance of death."
This is connected with the question of that longing, "who dreams that in the end everything may be good".
Johanna Rahner, born in Baden-Baden in 1962, studied Catholic Theology and Biology at the University of Freiburg from 1982 to 1989.
She received her doctorate in 1997 as Dr. theol., also in Freiburg.
The Habilitation for Fundamental Theology and Ecumenical Theology followed in 2003 at the Westphalian Wilhelms University.
Since 2010, Johanna Rahner has held a Chair of Systematic Theology at the Institute of Catholic Theology at the University of Kassel.
Geislingen: More than 100 young Catholics from the Kleines Heuberg reaffirm their creed at the confirmation
In two services 101 15- and 16-year-old youths of the pastoral unit Am Kleine Heuberg have been confirmed.
In the morning the group Laudato-Si accompanied the service, in the afternoon the youth choir The Spirit.
With the reception of the Sacrament of Confirmation, the young people said yes to their baptism and asked for the power of the Holy Spirit.
Over the past few months, under the leadership of Deacon Reiner Dehner and with the help of numerous parishioners, the firmmates had prepared for the big holiday.
In different projects they got to know different tasks of the Christian community life and experienced the Youth Day in Untermachtal together.
Illmensee: Second mountain bike race delights participants
In beautiful weather, 214 cyclists came to Illmensee to complete the circuit over the hill chains around the lake.
This was announced by Ulrich Knobel of the organizing sports club Illmensee.
Among the participants were, especially on the short distance over 15 kilometers and 300 meters in altitude, also numerous cyclists who wanted to practice their hobby once in a competitive atmosphere.
Two junior drivers of the German top class were also at the start in this competition: Felix Bader from Bad Waldsee and Pascal Treubel from Aach-Linz came with the recommendation good rankings at the German championships.
As expected, these two were able to set off from the field.
As in the previous year, Felix Bader was able to save a small time lead to the finish and defended his title as overall winner of the short distance.
Pascal Treubel was again able to place in second place.
For the ladies, it was Theresa Duelli from Team Nightmare who made it to the top of the podium.
In second and third place came Anne Adel from Illmensee and Leonie Treiber from Owingen.
An encouraging development is the increasing number of drivers who live or work in the municipality.
Not only in terms of performance, the whole range of athletes was represented.
The age structure also ranged from ten years among the youngest to over 70 years among the oldest starters.
In the main race, there were even more absolute top athletes at the start this year.
Four drivers were able to set themselves apart from the regional top drivers.
Including Philipp Pangerl, a mountain bike semi-professional from the Black Tusk Racing Team.
Pangerl, together with a team-mate, has already been world champion in twelve-hour driving twice.
This year he became European champion in this special discipline.
Also Roland Ballerstedt, who already owns two German championship titles in duathlon.
After 45 kilometers and 900 meters in altitude, there was an eyelash final in the finish line in front of the Three-Seen-Halle.
Pangerl was the first to cross the finish line.
Just one second behind, the veteran Ballerstedt was able to secure second place in the overall standings.
At the same time, Hermann and Warthmann finished third in the overall standings.
In the women’s classification, Christiane Cohsmann was the fastest time in the main race.
Areane Blersch from Binzwangen secured second place ahead of Natascha Werner from Stuttgart.
Athletes and helpers were very satisfied with the smooth and well-organized course of the event.
Travel through mud, rivers and jungles for free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle brings free medical assistance to remote villages in Cameroon
Bwelle and his team spend nearly every weekend treating hundreds of patients
There are not many doctors in the West African country, only one for 5,000 people.

Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the Top 10 CNN Heroes of 2013.
You can vote for him or one of the other heroes in the top 10 to choose him as "CNN Hero of the Year".
The winner will receive $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched as his sick father repeatedly lost consciousness and traveled to hospitals that did not have the resources to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon, in 1981.
At first, he had only one broken arm, but then an inflammation formed that spread to his brain, causing a hematoma that would affect him for the rest of his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," said Georges Bwelle.
We would have brought him out of Cameroon if we had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years accompanying his father to crowded clinics and hospitals to get the treatment they had to offer.
"It's not easy," Bwelle comments.
You can leave the house at five in the morning and run to the hospital to be the first, but you’re not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
Some people even die because they have to wait.
The situation has hardly changed since Bwelle’s father died in 2002.
In Cameroon, there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organization.
In contrast, the ratio in the United States is with a doctor for 413 people.
But even if there was a doctor for them, most Cameroonians could not afford to visit.
Two in five people in the country live below the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of the country’s health care spending is private.
“The only problem they have is poverty,” says Bwelle.
And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life.
Seeing his father and so many of his compatriots suffer in Bwelle made the decision to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer team performed 700 free surgeries last year.
He became a physician himself and works as a vascular surgeon at the Central Hospital in Yaoundé.
He also founded a non-profit organization called ASCOVIME, which travels to rural areas on weekends and offers free medical care there.
Since 2008, he and his volunteer group have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 people force themselves into minibuses and drive with the laced medical equipment on the roof over unpaved terrain to the villages in need of help.
Everything does not always go smoothly.
More than once they had to push the vehicles through rivers and mud.
But when they arrive, they will be welcomed like heroes: a feast, singing and dancing and the best accommodation the place has to offer.
In these villages, free medical care is really a reason to celebrate and Bwelle – with his wide smile and his boundless energy – is happy to be part of the joyful celebration.
The next morning, the team begins to examine hundreds of patients.
"We treat 500 people per trip," says Bwelle.
You come from a radius of 60 kilometers around the village – and that on foot.
Each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others receive crutches, donated glasses, or free birth certificates – a document required for school, but many poor families simply can’t afford it.
In the evening, the team performs simple operations with local anesthesia.
The operations usually take place in a school, town hall or apartment; after the procedure, the patients get up and go to the recreation area to make room for the next.
The lighting for the operating room and the disinfection equipment is fed by the generator of the group and so Bwelle and his volunteers work until the early hours of Sunday.
It’s a strenuous effort, but the village musicians usually help keep the team motivated.
“They drum all night so we can stay awake and continue our work,” says Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team returns to the city, tired but proud of the work done.
The group – a mix of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students – has performed 700 free surgeries last year and knows that their work makes a huge difference to the people they help.
One man explained that the free operation of a hernia, which he had received, now allows him to work again.
“It will change my family’s future,” he said.
In addition to the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon in the hospital, Bwelle also works at night in private clinics in Yaoundé.
With this second job, he finances 60% of his charitable work, according to Bwelle; the rest comes from private donations.
“I really don’t know when he’s sleeping,” says Katie O’Malley, who is a second-year medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia and volunteering in Bwelle’s group.
He is always either in the hospital or trying to raise money for the organization so that he can go on these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students like O’Malley, who come from the U.S. and Europe and support Bwelle, this is a chance to gain hands-on experience they would never get at home.
“We can be there at surgeries where we help drain blood or hold the instruments for Dr. Bwelle,” O’Malley explains.
That would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year.
Students usually pay for their trip to Cameroon themselves and often bring donated medical supplies.
But once they are in Yaoundé, Bwelle takes care of the accommodation, the transport and the instructions.
“He’s definitely a hero,” says O’Malley.
He devotes his life to this organization and his desire to help the Cameroonian people knows no bounds.
For Bwelle, the almost constant work is not a burden.
Helping others to live a happier life, fulfilling a promise he made to his father, gives him great joy.
"I'm so happy when I do this work," says Bwelle.
And I think about my father.
I hope he sees what I do.
I do it to make people laugh again and to ease the pain.

Excellently mastered the fight
The role of Santiago, the old man in Hemingway's novel "The Old Man and the Sea", is cut to the body by Horst Janson.
Janson himself is an old hare in his profession, acting.
No one can fool the old man Santiago into fishing.
So the two complement each other just great.
It is almost thought to be able to see the wrinkles in the neck of the old man, of which the fisherman boy Manolo speaks.
When Santiago is sitting in the chair bent from life, it is real with Janson.
In addition, the role of the old fisherman is through and through a character role that Janson masters excellently.
Hemingway told the story of a fighter, a courageous man who does not give up and ultimately wins the fight against the fish through his knowledge and also his willpower.
Janson is on stage for a long time as a solo actor.
He manages to focus the attention of the audience on himself, so that his monologues are not boring for a moment.
His efforts to finally pull the fish to the surface of the water are so real that the spectators forget that the sea consists only of blue-lit water bottles.
Director Jens Hasselmann lets the old man act in the boat in front of the fishing village.
In the course of the performance, he brings the active scene into the light: the Santiago hut, the bar of the singer Marie-Luise Gunst, which sings the Cuban lifestyle with her songs and her magnificent voice.
The four musicians play Cuba’s rhythm and are also guests of the bar.
Tourism: Descent to the Romans
At a length of about 120 meters, a sewer from Roman times is preserved below Cologne.
If you visit Cologne, you will not pass the cathedral.
The two towers rise 157 meters into the sky and make it the second highest church building in Europe.
But only a few visitors, who marvel at the two filigree church towers, suspect that there is also a lot to discover under the cathedral.
Rainer Schulze is an expert on the Cologne underworld.
Meeting point for its guided tours is the Service Center of Cologne Tourism directly at the cathedral.
The tour begins quite unspectacularly: "We start in the underground car park," says Schulze.
In the seventies, the city fathers wanted a car-friendly city, and therefore only what was not too big remained of the remains of the old city wall.
Most users of the parking garage therefore also rush past the Roman remains today and only park their car.
But if you take a closer look, you will discover an archaeological site separated by metal bars in Parkdeck D2.
You can see about five meters high ruins made of hand-plate-sized stones.
"They are remnants of the Roman city wall, which was built in the second half of the first century AD," Schulze says.
Before it goes back to daylight, Schulze lets the participants on the upper park level take a look into a dark, 15 meter deep shaft.
This is the fountain of the old cathedral, which unfortunately is hardly noticed either.
The next stop of the tour is the praetorium, where the participants descend back down into the depths.
Here we experience the seat of the once most powerful man north of the Alps, the praetor of the CCAA.
What CCAA means, a visitor wants to know.
"The abbreviation stands for "Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium", which in good German means as much as "city of Roman law and city of the Agrippinenser, founded under Emperor Claudius at the place of the altar for the imperial cult".
And the praetorium is the former governor's palace, the power center of the Roman Empire on the Rhine.
From the anteroom of the exhibition, a tunnel leads to the Roman sewer, which is preserved here over a length of around 120 meters.
"You can walk along the so-called Cloaca Maxima, if you want," Schulze encourages the guests.
Schulze has a surprise.
After getting the key at the ticket office, he leads the group to a 16-meter-deep, walk-in shaft.
"We are now in the mikveh, a ritual Jewish bath," he explains.
The Jewish community built their bath deep in the ground to get to the groundwater, which was essential for the ritual washings.
To this day, different water levels can be read in the lower end of the mikveh, whose origins date back to the eighth century, due to changing levels of the Rhine.
The mikveh will become part of an archaeological zone in the Town Hall Square, for which construction work is expected to begin shortly.
However, a few more years will pass before completion.
Leg almost chopped off: Reissue of Rocker trial
A bloody attack in the rocker environment is rolled up again after more than four years.
A trial for attempted manslaughter, dangerous bodily injury and property damage against two 30-year-olds has begun in Frankfurt (Oder).
It is accompanied by strict security measures.
The defendants remained silent at the outset.
They are said to have been active in the rocker scene and belonged to the bandidos at the time.
The prosecution accuses them of in June 2009 together with unknown accomplices in Finowfurt on three men in a car stabbed and smashed.
All the victims were seriously injured, one man almost lost his leg.
The victims are said to have belonged to the competing Hells Angels group.
One of them is said to have been a high-ranking member from Berlin.
It was apparently preceded by a chase with several cars.
According to the indictment, it was about territory fighting and a demonstration of power.
The two defendants were acquitted in a first trial in early 2012.
A court spokesman said at the time that it had not been possible to prove that the men had actually been involved in the bloody feud.
The perpetrators had worn masks and had not been recognized.
The Federal Court of Justice overturned the judgment after the public prosecutor’s office had revised it and referred it back to the district court for a further hearing.
One of the defendants is currently in open custody for another offense.
At the beginning, it was mainly about the reconstruction of the procedures during the night of the crime.
As a witness, the investigating commissioner was summoned.
The focus was on cell phone conversations between the defendants and other people who had been intercepted by the police.
It is difficult that rockers in court almost always adhere to a brazen law for them - and do not testify.
The same applies to the victims.
In the first trial, only one of the victims had unpacked.
Prosecutor Stefan Golfier of the Prosecutor’s Office Frankfurt (Oder) said on request that new traces had appeared since the last trial.
Eleven more days of negotiations are scheduled for the trial.
The throwaway society doesn't think
The night was long, the music loud and the mood good, but at some point it goes home.
Only in the bellies of the people in the front passenger and rear seat hunger is noticeable.
Of course, one or the other cocktail or sparkling wine may be responsible for this!
What could be more convenient than driving chilled to the next drive-in to treat yourself to a little something?
I admit, I like to be there when it’s late at night or early in the morning for fast food.
A few fries, a coke, a burger - and then nothing like going home and to bed!
But on the way home, the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco-goers become noticeable.
After all, what do you have to miss when you throw your fast food bags out the car window with constant regularity?!
Especially on the weekends, discarded paper bags are lying on road edges and in parking lots.
"Why?" I ask myself.
Are people too stupid to take the bags home or to the next trash can?
It is not only that the paper stuff spoils the landscape.
Bags have already concealed traffic facilities such as guardrails, causing accidents.
But the "disposable society" does not think about this, probably does not even know what this word actually means.
If you’re on the road more often in the evening, especially with several people in the car, you know what a back seat can look like after nights of partying: clothes, bottles and other garbage pile up there.
A few bags would more or less not matter - in contrast to the street, where no one wants to trample on the food leftovers of others.
I already see the day coming when the cities and communities are getting too stupid to clear away - and the fast food chains have to demand a deposit for their bags.
Obama's backsliding in health policy
After heavy criticism, President Obama made a withdrawal yesterday with his often repeated, clear promise: “If you like your health insurance, then you can keep it.”
After hundreds of thousands of their insurers received a letter of resignation, the Republicans accused the president in recent days of deceiving the American public.
Yesterday, Obama relativized his original promise.
“The vast majority of citizens who have working health insurance can keep them,” he said at a speech in Boston.
In response to the numerous media reports on the resignations, Obama urged those Americans who received such communications to look for new insurance in the open market.
Most citizens could get better, more comprehensive health insurance for the same price or cheaper than predicted.
"You're getting a better offer," he said.
The government described it as unsurprising that the five percent of the population who have taken out insurance themselves would have to look around for a different tariff, as their contract did not meet the new standards under the Affordable Care Act.
“I want to say to these Americans directly: You deserve better,” Sebelius said at a hearing before the House Energy and Commerce Committee in Washington.
Sebelius, who is responsible for implementing the Affordable Care Act, said that the launch of the online platform had been “miserable” since October.
"I'm just as frustrated and angry as everyone else," she said.
I am determined to regain your trust.
This statement by an angry Sebelius to an adviser sitting behind her at yesterday’s hearing in the House of Representatives was taken up after a dispute with Republican Rep. Billy Long of Missouri over whether she should be required to participate in Obamacare.
After more than three hours of hearing, Long Sebelius repeatedly questioned why the “architect” of the Affordable Care Act had not voluntarily waived a state-sponsored insurance policy to secure a tariff herself at HealthCare.gov, which she now wants to sell to millions of Americans.
Jerusalem government fails to confirm attack on Syrian air base
A U.S. government official who wanted to remain anonymous told CNN on Thursday that Israeli warplanes had attacked an airbase in Latakia, Syria, the day before.
The target was “missiles and related equipment” that the Israeli government feared were destined for Lebanese Hezbollah, according to CNN.
Syrian and Lebanese media, as well as the Arab broadcaster Al-Arabiya, had previously reported that the base in the port city of Latakia had been shelled during the night from Wednesday to Thursday, and blamed the Israelis for it.
The Israeli television channel Channel 2 showed satellite images of the base in Latakia, showing Russian S-125 Neva defense missiles as well as a battery of SA-3 missiles, which according to Channel 2 have a range of 35 kilometers and can carry warheads up to 70 kilograms.
Uncertain The government in Jerusalem has not officially confirmed the attack.
However, the Reuters news agency quoted an anonymous Israeli government official as saying he believed Israel carried out the attack, but was not certain.
A spokesman for Israel’s Defense Ministry said: “We are not commenting on these reports.”
Journalist Ron Ben-Yishai stressed in the daily Yedioth Ahronoth that the Syrian regime had already tried earlier, partly successfully, to deliver ground-to-air missiles to Hezbollah.
The Israeli government had repeatedly warned that any attempt by Syria to supply Hezbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons would mean crossing a “red line” that would be followed by a military response.
John Kerry, in an unprecedented admission, says US spying has gone “unreasonably too far”
John Kerry, with an unexpected admission, hinted at a softening of the U.S. defensive stance on its surveillance programs, saying that in certain cases, spying had “goed too far inappropriately.”
The Secretary of State also admitted that he and Barack Obama were responsible for switching to “autopilot” when the explosive revelations by whistleblower Edward Snowden about the NSA’s espionage activities became public.
The leaked information has put the US government in a diplomatic storm of outrage on the part of its allies.
Speaking via video link at the Open Government conference in London, Kerry said: “There is no question that the President and I and others in the government have learned of some things that have been done almost by autopilot, simply because the ability existed, which goes back to the Second World War and the difficult years of the Cold War and, of course, 9/11.”
He was the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government to admit that U.S. espionage had crossed a border, but also stressed that no rights had been abused.
He said, "In some cases, this has gone inappropriately too far."
The President is determined to provide clarity and therefore conducts a thorough investigation so that no one has to feel that abuse is taking place here.
I assure you that the rights of innocent persons in this process will not be affected.
Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA was a force for good and that many lives had been saved through its surveillance operations.
He added: “We’re dealing with a new world where people are ready to blow themselves up.”
There is a radical extremism in the world that is obsessed with killing people, blowing up and attacking governments.
So what if you were able to intercept that and stop it before it happens?
We have actually prevented plane crashes, attacks on buildings and the murder of people, because we have learned in advance of such plans.
Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers will travel to Europe to dispel concerns about alleged American espionage and convince Europeans of the need to continue working with the U.S. on counterterrorism efforts, the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said on Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he had spoken to representatives of the European Parliament and other individuals this week and was concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-terrorist organizations due to frustration with the National Security Agency’s surveillance.
"It is very important for the national security interests of the United States that Europeans stay on board with our joint efforts against terrorism," Murphy, who is a Democrat in the Senate for the first time and serves as chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Foreign Relations and European Affairs, said in an interview in Washington.
I also go to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism, regardless of their anger over the NSA programs.
Media reports that the NSA has collected millions of phone records in Europe have strained relations with some U.S. allies, although the head of the intelligence agency said this week that the reports were inaccurate and were based on a misunderstanding of the metadata collected by NATO allies and exchanged with the United States.
Other revelations cited from documents leaked by Snowden, according to which the NSA has monitored the mobile phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other heads of state worldwide.
The head of national intelligence, James Clapper, defended spying on allies as necessary, saying it was common practice on both sides.
In all the tumult, Murphy said his agency is preparing the trip for Congress this year and hoped the delegation would include members from both parties and chambers.
The names of the other participating MPs will be published in the coming days.
He said the exact itinerary will still be worked out.
While Murphy stressed that the purpose of the trip was to improve relationships, he also said that there would be some “serious words.”
He said European governments must be honest with their people about the kind of spying programs they have used themselves for years.
"While we can change our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, they must also come to terms with the fact that we are not the only ones spying," Murphy said.
Meanwhile, John Kerry is on a trip to the Middle East and Poland over the weekend to grapple with the resentment over U.S. strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as U.S. surveillance activities.
A persistent injury to the ankle joint threatens to prevent the use of Nicolai Müller in the Bundesliga away game of FSV Mainz 05 at FC Augsburg.
Mainz gnaws at a deployment of Nicolai Müller.
Tomorrow he will try to train with the team.
So far, he has only been able to do this individually.
"We will decide on his deployment in the short term," said coach Thomas Tuchel.
The 40-year-old hopes to have his best scorer with six goals.
Because the Mainzers already have to do without the injured performers Niki Zimling, Julian Baumgartlinger and Niko Bungert.
Australian appeals against jail sentence in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney, who was sentenced to 15 days in prison in Phuket for falsely claiming to have been raped by a taxi driver, appealed the verdict and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially found guilty by a Phuket provincial court on June 15 of making a false statement after she told Thai police that a local taxi driver raped her in the morning hours on Sunday, June 10, while two other men held her.
Later, however, the footage of a video camera showed that she had arrived safely at her hotel after being separated from her Australian boyfriend.
Police in Phuket interrogated Bamford for two days until she confessed to making up the story.
Until the court hearing, she was held in police custody on the spot.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in a low-security detention centre on the outskirts of Phuket, rather than a prison for adult women.
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks, a former player of the Australian Rubgy League, who has contacted the Canberra State Department to ask for help for his daughter.
Tunks told the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney that the whole family was “extremely concerned” about his daughter’s well-being and wanted her back in Australia.
"We're obviously very worried, but we hope she'll be home as soon as possible," Tunks said.
Bamford has appealed the verdict and is on bail of 50,000 baht on the loose.
In Australian reports, it was read that in the meantime, she is vacationing in the resort of Krabi in southern Thailand.
The court heard that Bamford was being represented by a local lawyer in Phuket and warned that the appeal could also lead to a higher sentence of up to two years in an adult prison.
However, it is also possible that Thailand, after the recent murder of travel agent Michelle Smith in Phuket, could be trying to improve its battered tourist image, and therefore it comes to an acquittal.
