Barack Obama is awarded the Nobel Peace Prize as the fourth president of the United States
American President Barack Obama comes to Oslo, Norway for 26 hours to receive the Nobel Peace Prize here as the fourth US President in history.
In addition, he receives the degree and medal and a check of more than 1.4 million dollars for his extraordinary efforts to strengthen world diplomacy and cooperation among the peoples.
The head of the White House will arrive tomorrow with his wife Michelle in the north-western metropolis and will be busy all the time.
First of all, he makes a visit to the Nobel Institute, where he meets for the first time with the five committee members who elected him from 172 people and 33 organizations in October.
The couple of presidents then planned a meeting with Norwegian King Harald V and Queen Sonja.
In the afternoon, the visit reaches its peak with the ceremony, at which Obama takes over the prestige prize.
He receives this as the fourth president of the United States, but only as the third, who receives the prize directly in office.
The White House has already avowed that Obama will speak in taking over the price of the war on Afghanistan.
The President does not want to avoid this issue because he knows that he is taking over the prize as a president who is currently at war in two countries.
A few days ago, he reinforced the efforts of war by sending more troops to Afghanistan, which none of his critics forgot to emphasize.
At the ceremony Obama also received the Gol Medal, the diploma and the check over ten million Swedish crowns (about 24 million Czech crowns).
The money he intends to donate for benevolent purposes, but he has not yet decided on a concrete karitative work.
The event programme then provides for a banquet with the president and his wife, in which, apart from Norway's king and queen, the Prime Minister and more than 250 invited guests will be present.
Obama was very reluctant from the beginning to the price.
He argued, for example, that he felt that he didn't deserve the price completely.
He also repeated several times that the price is not just for him, but for all those who seek the same values as he does.
Immediately after the announcement, he stated that this is for him "a challenge to action".
Nature protectors are accused of extortion
The Leitmeritz Police accused the chairman of the "Nature Protection Community of Leitmeritz" civil society for extortion.
In several cases he introduced appeals against some building procedures last year, for the withdrawal of his appeals he demanded money from the investors for his favor, said the head of the police officer, Alena Romova.
The chairman of the Leitmeritz-Natureschutzgemeinschafter Lubomir Studnicka.
Now he is in prison and it threatens him a prison sentence of up to three years.
The sorting waste container in Brno doesn't smell well
In Prague, people can sort the packaging of drinks, in the South Moravia villages you can find again step by step and step up the sorting-waste containers.
And in Brno?
There you would have to reserve a few minutes to find the appropriate garbage tons.
I don't want to claim that the waste separation in Brno wouldn't work at all.
But I think it is necessary whether the Councillors are sufficiently concerned about this problem, even if we are the second largest city in the Republic.
Brünn is located in the waste race in the Urwaldliga, not only because as a citizen we can always dispose of only paper, glass and plastics in the sorting containers, but above all by the amount of waste to be disposed of for such waste.
Have they tried sometime in the center to dispose, for example, of PET bottles in a basket?
That's just art, before all it takes time and strong nerves.
The only place I've found by chance so far is the mooring area in front of the affected geese.
Mr Unterka should not be annoyed by his colleagues, but that is far too little for me.
Apart from the fact that the separation of waste is not a honey lick in other parts.
That's why a whole series of my friends don't sort the waste at all.
Out of laziness.
It's too far to the garbage tons.
I don't wonder.
I even offered after the celebration to dispose of some glass and plastic bottles.
But on Konicova Street, I didn't see any colour trashes in sight.
Fortunately, I came to the right place when I was driving the tram.
But the trash almost passed over.
This is still the centre of Brno, which represents the whole city, isn't it?!
However, ecology and some kind of aesthetics probably leave the Brno socialists cold.
They prefer to buy the city an ice hockey league that makes us ashamed throughout the Republic rather than buy a few garbage tons more and offer the sorting of additional raw materials for a cleaner Brno.
I am glad that I was able to confirm my acceptance with official statistics after looking for a while on the Internet.
According to the data of the company EKO-KOM, Brünn is really the worst in the whole district of South Moravia.
The "Paroubek" budget has withdrawn the money for pensions and sickness benefits
After the Left Party gave more money to farmers and officials, despite the government's view, there is no money in the budget for pensions, sickness benefits and building savings business.
But also not for the public debt or for the international court disputes.
This will cause even more problems to the government in the second half of next year, says Minister of Finance Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists have enforced the salary increase for a number of groups, they are counting on the government to provide additional funds for sensitive expenditure, old-age pensions or sickness benefits. "This is just a postponement of problems to the future, mine laying," says Janota.
Of the loans, the interest rates are higher and higher, and you have to pay back the money at some point.
Too much to choose from, the state funds are empty.
If the social benefits or costs for the public sector are not reduced, the tax must be increased.
For all those to whom the left party now gave more money: the fire brigade, the teachers, the farmers.
And later on for her children.
People don't have to be afraid of the pensions or the sickness allowance, from whose account is 1.8 billion, they get this money.
But at the price that the state owes itself even more - next year, not only 163 billion will be missing in the public funds, but much more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, debt will rise faster and faster and, together with that, costs and interest.
The state will need the money for compensation, then no longer will be sufficient to increase VAT only slightly or to reduce maternity money as the government did in its district deficit package.
Because of the money decline in favour of a number of constituency groups, five billion will be missing next year for the development of motorways and railways.
It is mainly the competitive sections that can no longer be reprojected and eventually reduced.
Mostly get what is not free of charge.
This means delay or cessation of thirty large buildings, is also at risk of Europe's money creation, warns the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka.
The CSSD has proposed that it solves the flow of money by salonically - it attacks the CEZ share dividends in which the state is the owner of the majority, and from which the money is distributed into the transport fund.
The problem is that the height of the dividend is never safe and it is not an infinite source.
Last year, 18 billion went to the budget from CEZ.
Every year, the dividends pay the environmental damage liquidations, the pension account is filled up and this money is also used as a reserve for the planned pension reform.
This trick also increases the actual budget deficit on the level of 5.7 per cent of GDP in line with EU rules.
However, this does not end the carnival of the revolutions.
Almost three billion fell in the budget for various compensations for the victims of communism and crimes or for expenses for the court disputes, even for the construction of the land.
Whether the state manages without this money is not sure.
That's just gambling.
If we lose an international court case, we have to pay for it anyway, Janota makes it clear.
The Minister then has to save the money from ressorting or in the worst case attack the government budget reserve.
A hundred million are also missing for the already started two-billion project "Staatskasse", which is intended to enable on-line monitoring for what the individual authorities are spending the money.
The first stage starts in January.
If the Minister of Finance did not find the money elsewhere, the project would have to be stopped and in this case sanctions would come, Janota warned.
Your next smartphone will master two operating systems
For the future, Americans expect a mobile phone that allows the user to switch between different operating systems by pressing a single button.
The plans presented are promising.
It's enough to just press one button, and from Windows Mobile, it's going to change Android within a few seconds.
This is exactly what American society wants to introduce VMware, which focuses above all on the development of virtual software for computers.
We allow you to run two user profiles on your mobile phone at the same time.
You can switch between them, you can separate them into two home and work profiles.
Both will work in parallel, suggested Srinivas Krishnamurti by VMware in the interview for the magazine Computerworld.
It was presented in November last year and presented for the first time a few days ago.
There will be 2012 on the market.
Virtualization of smart phones is not a fiction.
VMware introduced the journalist the smartphone test pattern with two operating systems successfully.
One was a modified Nokia N800 with a 128 MB RAM memory, on which simultaneously the mentioned Windows Mobile and Android systems ran.
The development of the new technology for mobile phones is in full swing.
The company VMware now works with European and American operators on the smartphone virtualization and to the customer the equipment should come within the year 2012.
The hotel owners suffer from lack of snow on the mountains
Scneeless slopes not only worry about the Giant Mountains inhabitants.
The lack of snow also scares people from ordering ski stays in hotels and pensions.
That's why you can still get free rooms in Giant Mountains for all winter dates including Christmas and New Year's Eve.
Our pages are often visited.
People go through the offers, set the prices, but now they are afraid to order binding.
And when they call us, they immediately ask if, in our opinion, this year's Christmas festival will be on snow or "on Matsch", the operator of the information portal Spindl.Info, Martin Jandura, led.
If you want the Silvester stay in the spindle mill exactly according to your ideas, you should not hesitate with the order anymore.
Who prefers saving and where the quality of the stay comes only in second place, who can try to wait a few more days.
The Spindelmühle hotel owners now offer mostly only weekly stays for New Year's Day.
I think they're going to try to sell them for a while, but then they're gonna have to give up, and go for shorter times.
And then the free rooms will disappear quickly, Jandura appreciated.
The travel agency Ingtours in Vrchlabi always offers free beds on all winter dates.
Now we are most interested in the Christmas week, which has not yet been sold out.
In our offer, about half of the places are still free.
That is why we have already prepared some cheaper Christmas stays for the last moment, led by the director of the travel agency Ingtours, Petr Schiefert.
The New Year's Eve Day in Giant Mountains can also offer the Vrchlabi travel agency, but there are fewer free places here.
Good sales also find the first fourteen days in February, the remaining winter dates are sold on average.
This year the interest in winter stays is also negatively affected by the fact that in Giant Mountains there is always no snow.
People are waiting for snow to fall.
No one wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
If the slopes are snowy within a week, Christmas will also be sold out, says Schiefert.
Reverse and a little better than last year, the rooms at the Hotel Horizont in Pecpod Snezkou manage to occupy.
We're about five percent better than last year.
On New Year's Day and on Christmas we only have a few free rooms.
There is great interest in the Polish holidays in Janua, and in February the business will also run well, informed the director of the best Pec hotel, Karel Rada.
At 80 percent for New Year's stays, the Hotel Omnia is also occupied at the central parking lot in Janske Lazne.
On the other hand, half of the beds remain free at Christmas in the latest hotel in Janske Lazne.
We were pleased to be surprised this year of January, for which we are already about 60 percent occupied.
A bit weaker is now in February, but at the moment when the snow comes, the interest in the stays in the Giant Mountains is definitely increasing, led by the director of the Hotel Omnia, Erik Sporysch.
In the meantime, the Giant Mountains hotel owners are waiting for a larger snow creek.
On Thursday it should cool down and if precipitation occurs, it should be snow on the mountains.
But after that a warming will come again, Jiri Jakubsky informed from the location of the Czech weather office in Hradec Kralove.
USA: Replay is Mother of Cleverness
It is almost comical, with which student rigidity Barack Obama, the president with his call of clumsy, repeats the strategy of his predecessor in the Afghanistan question that he himself considered to be the stupidest.
When he finally sweated out his longingly expected Afghanistan doctrine, it became apparent that he had written it over the copy paper from the Busch Iraq scenario three years ago.
Not only that in the text, he himself used the kind of speech "as in Iraq" several times, he even used the name of the Bush Declaration of January 2007 as the name of his own declaration: "New way forward", without provoking.
Three years ago, he himself criticised the Bush Idea - fresh military quotas in Iraq plagued by the civil war - as "inresponsible and in its conclusions karastrophic decision".
The following months, however, showed that the Bush strategy, based on military recommendations, was the only possible and to the extent very successful today in the news about Iraq at all.
The call for Bush was not improved by this, because objectively he left a much more grateful starting situation to his successor than it was expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle will repeat itself.
In order to increase the military quota, the military asked him again, especially the Chief Commander of the Afghanistan Operation General Stanley McCristal, who even despite subordination habits severely criticized the shattering shooters in the White House.
He called for 40,000 soldiers to be able to reverse the situation to the better.
The president hesitated for three months, but did not come to a better idea and so he used to cheat on the general by 10,000 soldiers.
From Europe he pressed the commitment for another 5,000, even though he originally counted at least 10,000.
His project to withdraw the troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and to complete this process within three years is highly problematic in the whole Obama Strategy. The entire Obama doctrine leaves more questions than answers.
Some doubt that the half-up will bring the same effect as the Iraq measure.
Despite the brotherly war of recent years, Iraq's society is relatively well structured, its leaders honor its values.
The Afghan situation is influenced by contraindication - no one can rely on and no agreements are held.
Under these conditions it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces who are used to changing their opinion every day.
The political institutions, even if they were formally established correctly, remain only flaws behind which patriarchal relations will continue to grow.
The balance of interests between the different ethnic groups is unusually complicated, especially because of the incomprehensibility of the conditions that further complicate the Pakistan and Iran influences.
The establishment of a "responsible state", which is the minimalist goal of the whole operation, is also very unrealistic.
Time horizon of Obama strategy alienated by its voluntarism
Over the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has deteriorated, and now it is on the brink of explosion.
The small soldiers who broke out in the war cry about the early return to their home can only create a truly romantic soul that is not impressed by facts.
From the political point of view, the date for the withdrawal of the troops is clear responsibility, because the Taliban will accept this as the indirect confession of the American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that the willingness of Europeans to participate in the fights in Afghanistan is not enough.
Europe's politicians can and do not want to explain to their voters how the security of Germany or Italy is related to the war in the Hindukush Mountains.
Another possible factor that can radically influence the situation is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the increased sanctions do not affect Iranians, the United States has a very serious question as to whether the problem should not be solved with troops.
This question has to be answered during the period in which America is going to move to Obama for a winner's deduction from Afghanistan.
Every solution will also mean a dramatic change in the Afghan situation.
The only pavement for Barack Obama is the fact that it remains for three years until the presidential election, and thus remains enough time for it to reach a different strategy, it would fall into total failure.
Bank Managers Goldman Sachs no longer receive premiums bonuses in cash
The executives of the American Bank Goldman Sachs will no longer receive premiums in cash this year.
This has been announced by the company, which reacts to the sharp criticism of their wage practices.
A group of 30 top managers receives shares instead of the money, but they are only allowed to sell in five years.
In addition, the shares may be removed from the manager if they are excessively risky.
According to the Reuters agency, Goldman Sachs puts itself at the head of efforts to combine Wall Street's premium bonuses with long-term performance.
I believe Wall Street is aware of the further direction in which it has to go, led the former banker of JPMorgan, Douglas Elliott.
The problem lies in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs made herself the target of criticism after she had put almost 17 billion dollars aside for the first three quarters of this year.
According to the Reuters agency, the overall level of premium bonuses over the course of this year is likely to exceed 20 billion dollars even despite the measure shown today.
The high premium bonuses in the banking sector have become the hottest political issue in a number of countries at the start of the financial crisis.
On Wednesday, Great Britain reported that it intends to tax the bonuses of the bankers, which exceed 25,000 pounds, once with a 50 percent tax.
Similar steps are also being taken by France.
This year, women won the Nobel Prizes in all disciplines, except in physics.
Five record women have taken over this year’s Nobel Prizes in the professional categories and literature in Stockholm from the hands of the King of Sweden Carl XVI.
In addition to the four women, the German writer Herta Müller was among them the origin of Romanian writers.
The Nobel Prize in Medicine has received two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, together with their compatriot Jack Szostak for research in the chromosone field.
The Israeli Ada Jonath, together with the Americans, Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz, received the prize for the Enlightenment of the Ribosom Structure and Function.
The last Laureate gave the Nobel Prize for Economics, which the American Elinor Ostrom and her compatriot Oliver Williamson received for analyses of the economic report.
The only category in which no woman received a Nobel Prize this year was physics.
Today, the scientists Charles Kao for research in the field of fiber optics and George Smith, along with Willard Boyl, have taken away this prize for CCD chip invention, which is the basis of all digital chambers, fax devices or astronomical telescopes.
Each of these winners received the diploma, Nobel Medal and certificate on the acquisition of the money price.
It is ten million Swedish crowns in each category.
If there are several winners in each category, the money price will be split among them.
Traditionally, the American President, Barak Obama, has already received the most expected Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo this afternoon.
He has recognized in his speech the controversy of his appointment, because he is only at the beginning of his path, and beyond that is at the top of the country which is leading two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
In keeping with his policy, however, he added that, in certain situations, wars are necessary to combat world peace, even if the price for it is high.
Minister Janota is considering retiring. Klaus invited him to the castle
President Vaclav Klaus received the Minister of Finance on Friday, Eduard Janota, who thought about his remaining in the government because he did not agree to the execution of the State budget for the next year in the form that was released by the Assembly of Deputies on Wednesday.
It is assumed that Janota's budget and perhaps also Janota's stay in the Cabinet will be the topics of the Friday meeting.
The budget is also criticised by Klaus.
According to him, the budget deficit is too high, which also further increases the crisis of public finances.
The president, Radim Ochvat, informed about the meeting.
Janota wants to negotiate with the Prime Minister, Jan Fischer, about his further stay in his role on Monday.
According to the Budget Act, which is now receiving Klaus's signature, the Czech Republic should manage with a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
On Wednesday, however, Parliament voted on the Left Party proposals for a change in money and increased the money for civil servants, for the maintenance of the social benefits and direct wages of farmers.
The government has opposed the proposals of Social-Democraty to cover up the budget deficit.
Between the Left Party on the one hand and the Government, Klaus and the Legal Party, on the other hand, a sharp internal political dispute has emerged, for this reason the question mark arises about the further work of the Fisheries Office Cabinet, on which the ODS, CSSD and Green Party agreed in spring.
Critics claim that the budget, as it has been adopted by Parliament, practically liquidates the package of austerity measures, which was enforced by the fishing government in autumn, and which, according to their understanding, is to end public debt.
Klaus, who can sign the law on the State budget, but does not have to, said today in the debate breakfast with the entrepreneurs that the politicians have neglected the "serious problem" of "the unsustainable deficit" of public finances for a long time.
In his opinion, there is no good solution today.
An improvement could only bring about a strong government that could build on a wider consensus of political parties.
The ODS president, Mirek Topolanek, argued that the budget was cruel and that the government should weigh its further existence.
The ODS president, Petr Necas, told the CTK that the concept of the civil cabinet with the support of the CSSD, ODS and Green Party obviously no longer works.
Prime Minister Fischer referred to similar words as "strong statements".
The CSSD boss, Jiri Paroubek, responded to the Topolanek words that the budget deficit was horrific that the former government of Topolanek had prepared for this year and exceeded 200 billion crowns.
Already on Wednesday, the CSSD assessed the approval of the State budget for the next year as a success.
The People's Party was also satisfied.
Mandela was played in the new movie by Morgan Freeman by Clint Eastwood
The South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film "Invictus: The Unbeated" of the world shows much of the country, whose struggle and victory despite some criticisms that the main role was occupied by an American actor.
The story tells of sport, racial relations and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in the South African Republic and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, represents Morgan Freeman in his life story of American Oscar actors.
Freeman said that he was asked by the ninety-one year old Mandela if he could represent him in the Eastwood film.
Matt Damon plays another significant role.
I told him, "If I'm going to play you, I have to meet you.
The seventy-two-year-old actor, who had received the prize for his role in the Eastwood drama from the box area "Million Dollar Baby", already represented the leader of the movement to abolish slavery, from which at the end became a slave holder, a fictitious US president, and also God in "Evan Almighty", but rarely anyone who still lives and is as important to many people as Mandela.
The former South African stateman was in prison for 27 years for his active activity in ending apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was set free in 1990 and for four years he became president of the country.
In 1993, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
"Invictus" is the Latin word for "unbeated", and at the same time it is the name of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The requirement was how to speak
The film depicts a true event in which Nelson Mandela closed his forces with the captain of the South African rugby team, Francois Pienar, to meet the country. The new President Mandela knows that even after apartheid his people still remain racially and economically divided.
He believes that he can reach out to his people through sports, so he decides to join the rugby players, who are outsiders worldwide.
Finally, the South African team rises to the 1995 World Cup.
Freeman worked for several years to bring Mandela's story to the cinema screen.
He had no other goal than to play this role in order to approach it as closely as possible to reality, said Freeman.
The biggest challenge was to speak as he did.
The actor said, if he and the world politician were in the same country, he would try to meet with Mandela, eat with him tonight and be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to shake Mandela's hand.
I found out when I shook your hand, I took over your energy, it was transmitted, and I had the feeling that I knew what you felt, he said.
For me, it's important to have become another person.
In the film François Pienar, captain of the national rugby team, Matt Damon presents the white players.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for the role in the hard rugby world.
It was a big surprise for him when he first met Peter in his house.
I remember when I sounded at the Turklingel that he opened and the first thing I said to François Pierer in my life was, 'I look much bigger in the film'.
Despite the obvious differences in the status of the actors compared with their actual models, he received positive reviews under the director Eastwood "Invictus: Unbeated" and one also speaks of prospects for an Oscar.
The film critic of the newspaper Daily Variety, Todd McCarthy, summarized his evaluation in the following words: "That was very good history, very well executed film."
In the film reviews on the web pages rottentomatoos.com, Invictus received 76 percent positive evaluations.
Light secret over Norway dissolved: Russians have tested a rocket
A special lighting effect of unknown origin was observed over Norway.
The Russian Ministry of Defense only admitted yesterday that not far from the Norwegian border, an intercontinental ballistic missile was tested.
However, the launch was not successful again and the rocket called "Bulava" which was originally to be the pride of the Russian army will slowly become the nightmare of the Russian generality as well as the premiere, Vladimir Putin.
His repeated presence on site during the rocket test also had no positive effect on the success of the pilot flights.
Bulava has usually not been started or damaged in the air at all.
In the Russian newspapers, one already writes about "Bulava" as about a "rache that does not fly".
A rocket that does not fly, but lights
This already 13th attempt, was normal at the beginning.
Only at the end of the flight did technical damage occur to the rocket.
The engine probably exploded in the third level of rockets.
This time, "Bulava" started from the Atom-U-boat Dmitry Donskij, which drove under the waters of the White Sea.
This type of rocket allows the shot out of the submarine.
Therefore, it is likely that the mysterious light caused by an undetermined flying object over the north was actually the damaged "bulava".
In addition, the Norwegians have not doubted since the first moment that it is a Russian rocket.
This time, the generality has taken care of it and claims that one cannot speak clearly of a failure.
The first two stages of the rocket did not fall off and the accident only affected the third level.
In the previous cases, the engines were damaged in the first stage.
Even if no test was carried out without error, the Department of Defense considers only six out of thirteen unsuccessful.
The almost fifty per cent success therefore fulfills the generality with optimism and thus continues to claim that the "Bulava" will fly once without problems and will even carry up to ten hypersonic atom heads with a total weight of up to 1.15 tons.
The legendary Fetisov signed an annual contract with CSKA Moscow at the age of 51
The legendary defense player Vjaceslav Fetisov introduces himself to a professional ice hockey game at the age of 51.
The former world champion, Olympic winner and Stanley Cup-inhibitor is helping his team CSKA Moscow in distress, and is likely to compete against Petersburg in the Fridays duel of KHL.
Fetisov, who finished his career with forty years, in 1998, is currently President of the CSKA.
After Denis Kuljas got hurt, we urgently need another defense player.
Fetisov regularly trained and agreed to support the team.
We only need to clarify some remaining formalities, the agency AP quoted the coach of the Moscow Club of Sergei Nemcinov.
In the meantime, it is not clear whether the comeback of the famous hockey player will only affect one game.
I mean, Fetisov is one of those who can raise the morals of other players, led co-player Nemcinov.
When Fetisov comes back to the ice surface, he becomes the oldest Russian professional hockey game after AP.
In the NHL, the legendary Stürmer Gordie Howe played a whole season for Hartford with fifty-one years and was able to credit himself with 15 hits and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous five, Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful hockey players in history.
In the dress of the Soviet Union he won two Olympic gold medals, seven World Championships, and he also triumphed in Canada Cup and the Junior World Championships.
In the second part of his career he also gathered successes in the NHL, where he twice raised the Stanley Cup over the Detroit Dress.
Since 2001 he has been a member of the Ice Hockey Star Room.
Hyundai gave up the trade unions. All overtime is lifted
The management of the Nosovice-Automobilfabrik Hyundai agreed with the trade union on the withdrawal of all overtime.
Because of often arranged overtime hours, the union announced the readiness to strike on Monday.
This was confirmed by the spokesman of the Hyundai car factory, Petr Vanek.
However, management wants to agree with the trade unions on a Saturday shift this week.
We must not give up our production plan, that is a principle, so on Saturday, December 19, voluntary overtime was proposed for the reason that two shifts would be worked, Vanek said.
The website Sedmicka.cz wrote that the company offered a bonus of 400 CZK to employees who would work the Saturday shift.
The staff will also receive the Saturday shift from November 28.
According to Vanek, the company has decided to change the type of motivation of the employees for the proposed overtime.
Either they pay the overtime supplement or they can take replacement vacation on December 28th and thus extend the Christmas holidays, Vanek performed.
In addition, all employees of the Saturday shift are paid the fare and lunch.
With regard to the fact that the overtime was the most urgent and burning point with regard to claims and complaints of trade unionists who had stopped production last week, the management decided yesterday afternoon with immediate effect on the withdrawal of all overtime hours for December, Vaněk launched.
Until last week, the employees of the automotive factory had been forced to work almost every day after the eight-hour shift for another two hours.
Upon signature of the agreement, the union's willingness to strike will be withdrawn.
Further negotiations between the management of the automobile factory and trade unionists are scheduled to take place on Friday afternoon.
The trade union leader, Petr Kuchar, said on Wednesday that if they can sign to meet the demands and sign a joint document that they are willing to cancel the readiness to strike.
Last week, on Wednesday, the location in the automotive factory was rising when about 400 employees spontaneously strecked because of constant overtime hours.
They also protested against the poor payment conditions and alleged shocks.
The management held that employees had to do overtime to meet the automotive needs.
The trade unionists also demanded that the employees who interrupted production on Wednesday be fined.
In the case of overtime, the unions call for overtime work to be reduced to a minimum.
In addition, this year, they are calling for the payment of 5000 crowns.
The Nosovice car factory Hyundai now employs 2000 people.
Series production was started in the company last November.
By this September about 80,000 vehicles were manufactured here, the current production capacity is 200,000 vehicles per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that also works in ́chosen ́ HIV viruses
The team of Czech and German scientists is testing new connections to prevent the spread of HIV viruses in the organism.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also works with viruses that are already resistant to drugs.
This fact predominates against the disadvantage that the connection to common virus variants does not work as strongly as one of the already existing medicines.
The AIDS disease cannot be healed yet.
Patients may, however, extend their life and prevent the increase in HIV viruses in the body.
However, your intake is accompanied by a whole range of side effects.
In addition, incomplete suppression of virus reproduction has resulted in the development of resistant viruses against which no longer medicinal products are effective.
The work of the experts from three institutes of the Academy of Sciences CR, VSCHT (Chemical-Technology University) Prague and the University of Heidelberg opens the way for dealing with virus resistance.
They have shown that the substances described as metalokarborans act on the protein responsible for the reproduction of the HIV virus.
Metalocarboranes are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block virus reproduction in a different way from all medicines used today, so they can overcome the resistance problem.
In their work, the scientists come to new ‘improved’ compounds prepared on the basis of the knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding on the virus protein.
Metalocarborans have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-faceted cages consisting of boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms and are coupled by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
Secret and Prosperous Virus
HIV protease is protein of the HIV virus, which is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without the HIV virus breakdown caused by the HIV protease, no mature infection virus particles would occur.
When we turn off the HIV protease, we also disable the propagation of the virus in the patient's body, the scientists explain in the press report published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences CR.
In the work published in the journal of Medical Chemistry, the scientists describe whole series of compounds in which two pairs of cages (see table) are coupled by a short organic chain, which is then systematically changed.
Something weaker but more reliable
The effect of this series of substances against the HIV protease is tested in the test tube, also against its resistant (resistant) variants obtained from HIV infected patients.
The effects of metalocarborans on the usual enzyme variants are not as strong as in the clinically used medicinal products, but they do not lose their effect on the resistance variants against which the medicinal products used are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of action and its further properties, such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and possibility of further chemical designs, make the Metalocarboranians interesting for further development of effective medicinal products directed against HIV, says Pavlina Rezacova, Head of the Laboratory for Structural Biology of Institutes for Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute for Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
Dispute about budget. ODS went on to fisherman who was wedding
The president of the ODS, Mirek Topolanek, called the approved budget "beautiful" for the next year, and the government of Prime Minister of Jan Fischer, in his opinion, was to consider their further existence.
The President of the ODS referred to the term "strong statements".
It's supposed to be time for analysis.
The deputy ODS chairman, Petr Necas, said that the concept of the official cabinet with the support of CSSD, ODS and Green Party obviously no longer works.
According to Necas, the Prime Minister must decide whether he intends to rely on the minority in Parliament when it comes to fighting the rising deficit or whether it is his remaining in office with the help of Parliament's left.
The approach of the ODS and the Social Democrats to the problem of public deficits is diametrically different, Necas pointed out.
On Wednesday, Parliament adopted the budget for 2010, although it has proposed changes to the left-hand party over 12 billion crowns.
Parliament has increased the money for civil servants, for the maintenance of social benefits and for direct payments to farmers.
In doing so, the government has opposed the proposals of Social-Democraty to cover up the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should handle 163 billion kroner in arrears.
The ODS has left the room before voting, so it has complied with the government's desire, because the amended budget is only a less bad version of the budget provisorium. Frase not clear
Disillusionment and senselessness
The Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota, spoke about his disappointment and sense of senselessness, whereas Prime Minister Jan Fischer pointed out that the government still assessed the current situation.
Necas is convinced that if Janota had seriously resigned from the case, the amendments would be accepted, the situation would look different.
According to Czech television, Janota signed up to the Prime Minister for Monday after the government business.
He indicated that he was still in office.
The reason for this is his disappointment about the negotiation of the budget.
According to Necas, fishermen are in favour of the further fight with the budget deficit, so that according to Necas, the nominees of the Social Democracy (CSSD) who have enforced the changes in the budget have nothing to do in the government.
The prime minister should also make it clear that he will withdraw if Parliament continues to adopt deficit-enhancing laws, for example those concerning sickness benefits and pensions or the service law novels.
Topolanek: Ministers nominated by ODS did not err
This is the case of Prime Minister Fischer and the entire government.
The ministers nominated by the ODS did not make any mistakes, Topolanek highlighted in a text message from the US.
It has mentioned that in some ministries sitting in alternate function people who confess to TOP 09 who voted against the budget.
Necas stressed that if fishermen choose to refrain from the fight against the deficit level of public finances, "it is perfectly logical and correct that they are based on the majority of the left that is currently in Parliament".
Then he is not supposed to expect the support and tolerance of the citizens' Democrats.
I have not thought about it, and if this is what will happen, I will deal with it, said the Minister of Defense, nominated by the Democrats, Martin Bartak, to the journalists in Parliament.
Prime Minister Fischer flew to Brussels in the afternoon at the European Council.
The ODS resigned at the request of the premiere
At the same time, Necas stressed that the ODS would probably vote against the revised budget in Parliament on Wednesday, if the prime minister explicitly asked the members of the Democrats to allow them to adopt the budget.
We do not appear to be orphans, we are not small children, so he responded to the question whether the ODS was not repressed during the political negotiations on the budget by the absence of the party chairman in Parliament and in the Czech Republic.
I didn't notice that my voice would be missing.
Even when I did not give up the mandate, I knew that in the next few months, above all, it would be the Bolshevikization of Parliament and destruction of everything positive, Topolanek himself responded.
According to the new schedule of the CD (Czech Railway) fewer trains will drive for about the same price.
The Czech Railway will terminate or restrict some less charged high-speed and local trains as from 13 December, while other connections will be reinforced.
The whole range of transport will be reduced by two percent from the validity date of the new roadmap.
Most tariffs including basic and customer driving tariffs are not changed.
For example, the inhabitants of the Ostrava region receive several connections to the capital, the railway uses Pendolino trains for this route.
The express train will no longer drive to Bratislava (Pressburg).
Few express trains will also drive on the Prague - Pisek - Budweis route, and the direct connections from Prague to Letohad are basically reduced.
The largest reduction in Hradec Kralove (Königsgraz) is planned for the railways in the Hradec Kralove district, a total of eight percent.
Two night trains on the Prague - Tabor - Budweis route and on a few days a week, the operation of some quick trains on the Prague - Pisek - Budweis route is reduced.
One of the biggest changes is the introduction of the new direct route from Milovice to Prague, currently the inhabitants of Milovice have to change to Lysa nad Labem.
It is the fifteenth route of the Esko suburban transport system, whose opening is possible thanks to the railway electrification from Lysa nad Labem to Milovice.
The long distance routes to the capital will end in the destination station of Prague - Hauptbahnhof.
The CD introduces more connections to SC Pendolino between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Sumper/Isenik will drive at the time of two hours.
The Pendolino will no longer allow passengers to travel to Bratislava since 13 December.
This year's regional railway bill: increase by 200 million
The express trains are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport, all in all, the railway receives to compensate for the so-called liquidity loss in the next year four billion crowns, exactly as this year. Local trains provide the districts, they pay eight billion crowns in total next year, with the state shooting three billion.
This year, regional trains are more expensive than 200 million Czech crowns.
For local trains and express trains, the railway has concluded a ten-year contract, until now the contract has been concluded for only one year.
The railway praises the system, and perhaps it has not been used to increase prices in the vast majority of tickets.
There are only one-day network tickets CD Net and low-cost eLiska tickets.
For passengers without the customer card, the price CD Net is increased from 450 crowns to 600 crowns.
The price eLiska will then depend on the driven plug, until now he was uniform for the journey between any district cities and cost 160 crowns.
Philippine Millitants arrested more than 50 people, the children were released.
Millitants today kidnapped 75 people in the South of the Philippines, including some primary students and their teachers.
That is what the AFP agency referred to, which originally only informed about 65 abductees.
All 17 children detained were released after eight hours, including a teacher.
There was a kidnapping in the province of Agusan del Sur.
About 19 millitants reportedly used the hostages as a living shield in fleeing the police.
The local negotiators are now trying to produce the remaining hostages.
According to the AFP agency, the billions belong to the New People's Army (NPA), this is the arms fraction of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CCP).
According to AP, the police persecuted the kidnappers because of the violence demanded by revenge between the two local family clans.
In the south of the Philippines, in the province of Maguindanao, the right to stand was imposed because of the recent massacre in which 57 people were killed.
30 journalists were among the victims of the massacre of November 23rd, which was associated with the election in the Board of Governors.
Because of the suspicions of participation in the massacre, the governor of this South Philadelphia province and his father Andal Ampatuan, Patriarch of the influential Ampatuan clan was arrested.
On the island of Mindanao, Muslim separatists are also active.
But on Tuesdays the peace talks with the Phillippinian government were resumed.
The story of South Africa affects everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Nelson Mandela
In the next few days, the new Hollywood film Clint Eastwoods comes to American cinemas "Invictus: The Unbeated", which includes part of the life story of the former president of the Republic of South Africa, Nelsona Mandela.
The role of the world-famous fighter against apartheid has been given by Morgan Freeman, who had been supposedly chosen by Mandela himself some years ago.
Matt Damon received the role of the legendary South African champion in Rugby, Francois Piener.
At the start of the film, reactions from critics and the public are also voiced.
Nelson Mandela
By name he is Nelson Rolihlaha Mandela, born 18 July 1918 in South Africa Mvez.
In 1988 he received the Sakhar Prize, then in 1993 together with the Klerk the Nobel Peace Prize.
He was elected President of the Republic of South Africa in 1994-1999.
Great expectations are placed in the film because it comes to the cinemas in South Africa, where preparations for the World Cup are being cultivated, but at the same time the media are shaking world public with frightening news about the increasing racial hatred and discrimination of the inhabitants by the black majority.
According to the news agency AP, the reactions to the new film in South Africa are at first positive, despite numerous reservations against the occupation of the main roles with American Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman is still proud of his own words on the new film.
I have dreamed of this role for many years and have prepared well for it.
Several times I also met Nelson Mandela personally so that, as one says, I can receive his energy, he performed in the interview after the film's festival premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it's good to be able to get along with this film to the personality of Mandelas and his message.
This is a history of South Africa, but it concerns every human being, he added.
In the dress of the Rugby national team
The film is based on the book template of British writer John Carlin, freely translated ́In the role of the enemy ́: Nelson Mandela and the game that united the people, portrays the South African champion of human rights within his first presidential term.
Morgan Freeman, in the course of the film, strives to bring together two racial and day-to-day groups of separated people and, like Nelson Mandela in 1995, also takes part in the South African national Rugbydress on the World Cup that won then South Africa.
For entering the lawn in the dress, which is almost a sacred act in South Africa, Mandela reaped large ovations, mostly from the white audience, and thus gained the recognition of the white population.
The Rugby Championship may succeed in reconciling the people to a single people, led by the Rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" in the national team in 1995.
Whether the exciting situation in South Africa improves will only show up.
But the white South Africans are skeptical, as in recent interview for LN of the Rugby fan, Christopher Dawson, who fled from the country to the UK.
The championship starts on 11 June 2010.
In the Louny area, transformers burn for several 10 million crowns
The fire broke out in the morning at the transformer of the company Ceps in the control system near the municipality of Vyskov in the Louny area.
In the fire, six units were attacked in accordance with the spokesman of the District Fire brigade Usti nad Labem, Lukas Marvan.
Originally, the fire brigade wanted the transformers to burn out, but later it changed the view and now the fire is removed with a mixture of water - foam and special solvents.
The cause was a technical defect, a transformer-in-short closure.
No one was injured, the Havary threatened according to the company spokesman, Pavla Mandatenova, the safety operation of the management system.
The damage was estimated at several 10 million crowns, and the damage will only be estimated after the fire.
The modified transformer must be replaced by a new one in accordance with mandateova.
For more than 10 years, there has been nothing similar about the Ceps company, mistakes of this kind are rare, complementary to them.
The power supply was not interrupted according to the spokesman of the company CEZ für Nordböhmen, Sona Holingerova, due to the fire of the Trafostation the functionality of households, authorities and companies was not affected.
A.G. Ceps is active in the Czech field as the sole operator of the wiring system, the electrical lines of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, renovated and develops 39 switchgear with 67 transformers, with which the electrical energy is transferred into distribution system and line with a length of 4339 kilometers.
Jancura raises punishment for slandering against three leaders of the CSSD.
The owner of the student agency, Radim Jancura, today raises criminal charges for slandering against three social-democratic leaders.
Against Michal Hasek from the district of South Moravia, Radko Martinek from the district of Pardubice and the head of the district Olomouc, Martin Tesarik.
Jancura said this in a twenty minute inteview in the radiojournal.
The action is linked to the company's efforts to operate regional transport in some districts.
However, all regions have finally signed the long-term contracts with the Czech Railway.
All three ladders attack us and say that we take out the raisins, we have only submitted the offer as to the extent to which it was agreed with them.
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech Railway because we would know the prices of the Czech Railway that were completed last week.
There's nothing left for us but to defend us.
Because of this slandering of society Student Agency, Jancura told the radio journalist.
At the same time, he argued that he had evidence from all the districts that they had taken their steps in accordance with European law.
That is why we are preparing a charge for the European Commission.
Hasek considers the collection of the criminal notice for the further continuation of the medial show of Jancura, which serves him as a free advertising for his society and for his own person.
I am of course prepared to defend my good name and the reputation of my district, and I also call for further leaders to do so.
I believe that it will also become clear in this matter that it is Jancura, who manipulates the public in the matter of regional one-way transport and uses lying and untrue arguments, said Hazek.
Jancura reported last week that he had invested several million crowns in advertising, which will point to the adverse step of the districts.
He told the Radiojournal that he was interrupting the campaign after Christmas, and he wanted to continue it after New Year's Day.
He specified that he would lead the campaign against corruption as such.
The campaign started Jancura after the districts agreed on the operation of regional railways with the Czech railway and did not tender for the contract in a high of 150 billion crowns.
According to Vancura, such conduct is illegal and contrary to the requirements of the European Court of Justice.
According to Jancura, because of the criticism of train traffic in the districts, a member of the CSSD had already threatened him.
The only threat was if we don't mind losing the bus licenses.
He introduced himself as a member of the CSSD, I know who it is, I don't say his name, today Jancura told the radio journalist.
Vaccination against pneumococcals free and voluntary
Infection against pneumococcal changes the habit from January onwards.
It is said to be the first for families free of charge and voluntary.
But now there are voices that the duty enforcement would be more effective.
The preparations for the introduction of the free vaccination against pneumococcals culminate.
The medicine institute already sets the maximum prices of vaccines that health insurance must pay.
The experts are also aware of the vaccination procedure.
New vaccination
Vaccines for August children free of charge
From January, children can be vaccinated against pneumococcals, which were born on 2 August last year and later.
The condition is that they have not yet received a dose of the vaccine.
Anyone who started vaccination in the past year or earlier must also pay for further recovery vaccination itself.
The first dose must be given between the 3rd and 5th months of life of the child.
Last year, a quarter of the families had their children implanted against pneumococcals.
The parents paid 1600 crowns and more for a dose.
Four doses are required for the vaccination of the youngest children.
In general, experts estimate that health insurance for the doses spends 300,000 to 450,000 crowns a year.
However, they save on the treatment that children would need without vaccination.
So far, the state has spent about 500,000 per year on all the area vaccinations of the children.
The mandatory vaccination was introduced with the so-called Janota package.
Pneumococcal causes medium-earth inflammation, but also severe infections including brain inflammation and blood poisoning.
Because of pneumococcal infections, we die after examination in hospitals per year up to 28 children aged up to 10 years.
Outside the Czech Republic, the compulsory vaccination of children against pneumococcal was introduced in about 40 countries.
Will the vaccination be mandatory?
At the same time, it is said that this vaccination could be mandatory in the future.
From January onwards, this will be paid and voluntary by insurance companies.
For example, the chief of the civil society of Nahlas, Rudolf Kalovsky, mentioned that enforcement would be better.
His association is already throwing for pneumococcal vaccination in the long term.
The experts at the international conference in which our association was involved were not very satisfied with our voluntary vaccination.
It's not quite ideal.
On the other hand, we are happy that we have succeeded in at least doing so.
I think that's the way we've got to go now, Kalovsky led.
However, the Ministry of Health does not want to change the vaccination procedure against pneumococcals.
At that moment we don't consider it at all, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sesen.
The voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages, the doctors claim.
The chairman of the specialist society of practical pediatricians, Hana Cabrnochova, admits that voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages.
If all children were vaccinated, then one could think about reducing the number of re-vaccination "In a situation where the vaccine is so expensive, we understand the political decision that this vaccination was started as a voluntary vaccine," says Cabrnochova.
Specialists expect more than 80 percent of parents to have their infants implanted against pneumococcals from next year.
The vaccination against pneumococcals is also groundbreaking in that it is the first area vaccination paid by health insurance and not by the state.
Insurance should spend the money for prevention so they save for further treatment, Cabrnochova explains.
The doctors have to buy the vaccines themselves.
However, this is a concern of the practical pediatricians concerning the purchase of the vaccines.
According to the original project, the vaccines should be bought by insurance companies and the doctors should then receive them on the same path, as well as other vaccines issued by the State to them.
Some Members, however, feared that the insurance system could "make the money out of the health insurance system".
Therefore, doctors will have to buy the vaccines themselves and wait until the insurance companies pay them.
It is estimated that the individual practical doctors will need to invest 40,000 crowns per month, which is a significant sum.
That won't be easy at all, says Cabrnochova.
US artist son involved in "Museum theft"
The son of the famous American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta was accused of trying to steal 20 million dollars of paintings from his father's museum.
According to Pennsylvania police Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught in his vehicle with trailers when he invited 90 paintings.
It is said that Frank Frazetta junior and another man used a excavator to enter the museum into the Pocono mountains.
The 81-year-old Frank Frazetta Senior is famous for his representation of figures like Conan der Barbar and Tarzan.
The artist stopped in Florida at the time of the incident, as reported by the Associated Press agency.
AP quoted an unnamed police officer who said that Frank Frazetta Junior could have been motivated by a family feud.
According to a police affidavit, Frazetta Junior claimed that he was instructed by his father that "he should enter the museum with all means to bring all the paintings to a camp."
The Agency announced that Frank Frazetta was a member of the senior government of France.
Labour defends budget and tax increases
Ministers have defended the tax increases and expenditure stops announced in the previous report against the criticism of opposition, the economy and trade unions.
Conservatives said that Alistair Darling had left an opportunity to "strengthen" to show that he was serious about reducing the deficit by pushing out the decisions until after the election.
The chancellor also found himself shot at workers with low and medium incomes.
Its main proposals include a 0.5% increase in social security and a 1 % cap of public wages accounts for 2011.
Social security sufferers
The trade unions, on the other hand, protested that low-paid workers were punished for a recession they did not cause and warned of upcoming "problems".
The increase in social security - to around 3 billion pounds a year - has annoyed the private sector, which says that this is a tax on jobs, although the focus should be on the economic upturn.
The increase that is limited to those who earn more than 20,000 pounds a year will affect about 10 million workers.
PREVIOUS ETAT REPORTS
An additional 0.5% increase in social security from April 2011
This year's decline in the economy by more than the expected 4.75%
New 50% tax on bankers bonuses
1 percent increase in corporate tax for small businesses rejected
Pressures for electric vehicles and wind turbines
Increased government pensions by 2.5 %
According to estimates of the Treasury, someone with an annual income of 30,000 pounds will be poorer by 90 pounds per year and someone with 40,000 pounds per year will be poorer by 190 pounds, while a person with 10,000 pounds of annual income will be 110 pounds richer.
Ministers said that their deficit compensation target by 2013 meant "poor decisions", but they also said that 60% of the additional tax burden would be paid to the 5% of the top-earners.
Minister of Finance Stephen Timms disputed that the sketched tax increases and expenditure stops would be "a drop on the hot rock" compared to the necessary measures.
"These are large figures. You will bring us the deficit balance and this is absolutely necessary over the period of the next four years," he told the BBC.
Timms said he was confident that the economy would return to growth by the end of the year.
The Labour Party's predictions about future economic growth – which affects the volume of new debt and the speed of deficit reduction – were questioned after the chancellor was forced to revise earlier figures.
He said in his opinion that the economy is likely to shrink by 4.75% this year - much more than the decrease by 3.5%, predicted in April - while debt would be higher by £3 billion than previously estimated.
Missed Opportunity
The conservatives who want to launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday to warn about Labour's "crisis" said that the planned debt of 789 billion pounds over the next six years is unsustainable.
They added that ministers have failed to present a credible plan of how they will repay this and press "zynically" before difficult decisions until after the election - which must take place at the latest in June 2010.
"They didn't say anything of importance about what they're going to do," said shadow finance minister Philip Hammond. "They had their chance to do this, and they let it pass."
"The important announcements are made only after the election, whoever they win."
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour insists that schools, hospitals and the police will be protected against future cuts, unlike in the proposals of the Conservatives, which see the deficit cap coming faster and more quickly.
But the Liberal Democrats said that the money that is won by tax increases and expenditure stops is used to cover the expenditure for the next year, not to reduce the deficit, and therefore argues that the plans are "built on sand".
The BBC political editor, Nick Robinson, said that at the time of the announcements - such as the above inflation adjustment at some invalids' pensions next April - some would delay the treasurer's accusation of voting, as the money could simply be recovered next year.
Labour insists on providing the extra assistance if people need it most and that the situation will be reviewed again in September 2010.
Hohler Etat.
Although ministers have not announced any budget details beyond 2011, economists say that the pressure on public spending will only come into being in the medium term.
The recognised Institute for Tax Investigations said that the treasurer's figures would mean strong demarcations in many areas, perhaps also in the areas of transport, higher education, science and defence in the future.
"It only shifts pain to later," said Robert Chote.
"The important announcements are made only after the election, whoever wins them," added Roger Bootle, economic advisor to the business audit firm Deloitte.
"This was just the hollow pre-eating report. The markets recognize that."
FBI examines "Consequences of US citizens in Pakistan"
The FBI investigates the arrest of five reported US citizens because of the suspicion of extremist connections in Pakistan.
The men were arrested in the Eastern Panjab Province in a raid on a house in Sarghoda, the American Embassy in Pakistan told the BBC.
The FBI said it was examined whether the same men were reported as missing in the U.S. state of Virginia last month.
The U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs said they were looking for information about the men.
Three of them are supposed to be Pakistani descent, one is Egyptian and the other has a Yemeni background.
"If they are American citizens, we are of course very interested in the charges that are accused of and under what circumstances they are being held," said Speaker Ian Kelly.
FBI spokesman Katherine Schweit said the authority was informed of the arrests and was in connection with the families of the missing students.
"We're working with Pakistani authorities to find out their identities and the purpose of their stay there, if it's actually the missing students," she said.
The Pakistani Embassy in Washington announced that the men were arrested in a house that belonged to the uncle of one of the students.
He said the local police had already been interested in the house before and that no charges had been filed against the arrested men.
The Reuters news agency reported that it rejected Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton from commenting on the arrests, but she said that the United States must "more closely cooperate with Afghanistan and Pakistan in eradicating the infrastructure of terrorism, which continues to recruit and train people".
The five students were reported as missing by their families in North Virginia at the end of November.
Amnesty condemns "misuses" in Iran
According to a report by the human rights organisation Amnesty International, human rights in Iran are still as bad as it has been over the past 20 years.
The report details "misuse patterns" by the regime, both before and after the campaigned presidential elections in June.
One man quoted in the report said he was beaten and burned with cigarettes. Another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran rejected earlier criticism of its human rights balance.
Officials said such criticism was politically motivated.
After the campaigned election of President Mahmud Ahmadinejad, thousands of people were arrested in Iran and dozens were killed, leading to the greatest street protests since the Islamic revolution of 1979.
Dozens received prison sentences and prosecutors said that at least five people were sentenced to death.
BBC Teheran correspondent Jon Leyne, who is now in London, said that at the beginning of the protests the highest leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, recognized some of the abuse claims and ordered the closure of the Kahrizak Strafanstalt.
But since then, the authorities have had no more tolerance for criticism, said our correspondent.
"Falsh confession"
Amnesty International quoted the report of 26-year-old computer scientist Ebrahim Mehtari, who said that he was accused of "working with Facebook networks" and of protesting the election results.
"They used to beat me in the face," he was quoted.
"I was burned with cigarettes under my eyes, in my neck, on my head... they threatened me with death and they humiliated me."
After five days he signed a false confession and, still bleeding and half unconscious, was released on the street, Amnesty communicated.
The beaten presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said that some demonstrators who had been arrested after the election were tortured to death in August and others were raped.
The Iranian authorities denied the charges of rape, but admitted that abuses took place.
Amnesty also mentioned the case of a former prisoner who said that he had been detained in a container at a prison in Kahrizak with 75 more than eight weeks.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian Parliament and the judicial authorities had set up a committee to investigate the disturbances after the election and the government's reactions to it, but that Amnesty, the mandates and the power of these institutions would have been unclear and that the results obtained by the parliamentary committees had not been published.
The group said that in the last three weeks at least 90 people have been arrested to prevent further demonstrations.
Skihang was established in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow were used to turn a landmark into a competition track in Bristol.
The ski slopes of this park attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders who fought for money prizes.
On the top of the slope in the Brandon Hill Park there was a short jump at the beginning of a 100-metre slope.
The student John Hickman, who studied medicine in the fourth year, said that there was a beautiful view from the top of the slope, but it was also quite intimidating.
It's a great view with all the lights of the city shining below.
He added: "There are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the country here - some right talents."
Prizes were awarded for the best pieces of art or tricks performed on the slope.
After the event on Thursday evening, the snow is left to melt.
Still her and we
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters voted for a ban on the construction of minarette and the spread of concern about the alleged Islamization of Europe, John Bowen, an American academic, wrote a well-founded and well-thought report on whether Muslims can be integrated into one of Europe's most secularized societies — and integrated.
Some readers will read this new book out of admiration for the author's last work: "Why the French don't love headscarves" (Original Title: "Why the French Don't't Like Headscarves") (2006), an elegant and densely reasoning study of a dispute question that has shared and occupied the country over a period of one and a half decades and whose effects are still to be seen today.
Bowen's latest book offers a wider and more bold spectrum.
As a good anthropologist, he not only wants to know what politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what really happens in the field.
He spent months in mosques, schools and institutes that now offer the 5 to 6 million Muslims in France, as Bowen calls it "Islamic open spaces".
He is a good listener, he returns debates between teachers and students on the questions they are most concerned about.
Should a Muslim marry (or both) in a mosque or a town hall?
Should young Muslims be taught about evolution and the rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it possible for a Muslim to use a sentence-oriented banking system to obtain a mortgage?
It is these apparently prominent matters, he claims, which make up daily life, quite contrary to the political dramas involved in the media.
The author recognizes a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, none of them with a known name, possibly with the exception of Tarik Ramadan, an arab-Muslim scholar and academic born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open up the debate on how it is possible to be a good Muslim on the one hand and a good citizen in a modern secular society on the other.
You don't have all the arguments on your side.
Conservatives are suspicious of the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists, who interviewed Bowen, are, in most cases, indisputable with their Salafi counterparts – the editors of purist Sunni Islam, which is associated with Saudi Arabia – who nowadays show a small but influential presence among European Muslims.
Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But a convention requires a give and take on both sides.
He questioned to what extent French political decision-makers (and intellectual elites, so passionately guarding the separation of Church and State) really feel committed to pluralism.
He suggests that Muslims may experience a harsher treatment than Catholics, Protestants and Jews who, in turn, had to make their historical compromise with secular Republicanism.
He recognizes a "strengthening the value screws" rather than a growing pragmatism.
Can Islam be French? After reading this book one tends to say "Yes, but not yet".
The most dismal view of the world
The Arctic changes faster and more dramatic than any other environmental region on earth.
The ice that marks it melts with alarming speed and takes life with it that can't survive anywhere else.
Oil, gas, shipping and fishing interests have entered the recently open water, with diplomats, lawyers and now authors in their keel water.
Richard Ellis, an author and illustrator, paints a natural story of the icon of the north, of the polar bear in "On thin ice" (the original title "On Thin Ice").
Moved into the complicated history and politics of whaling, he describes the long tradition of the Arctic researchers who proved themselves in hunting for the polar bears.
Admiral Nelson's encounter with a polar bear as a brave 14-year-old flag to the lake, which only fought with the rifle piston of his musket, is certainly a legend, but others are true.
Young bears caught swimming behind the bodies of their recently killed mothers were brought to zoos and circuses.
A circus performance at the beginning of the 20th century showed 75 polar bears at a performance.
Even today, zoos still typically have a millionth of the living area of a wild old animal. The climate is rarely suitable: The polar bear in Singapore has grown very green by the algae growing in the hollow hair of its fur.

Ellis refers to the reports of other authors and historians and often returns to the threat that hunters represent for the survival of the species.
Although banned in Norway, America and Russia, the creation continues in Greenland and Canada, where hunters in helicopters and motor-sleighing inuit use powerful storm guns to bring their prey to the track.
Ironically, the ice will remain the longest in the waters in the north of these two hunting nations.
In his new book "After the Ice" (Original title "After the Ice") Alun Anderson, a former editor of the scientific journal "New Scientist", offers a clear and disturbing description of the science of the Arctic and a catchy insight into how the future could develop.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can explain the speed of the changes appropriately.
But this is not due to a lack of explanation.
For the first time, the pioneer journeys of Fridtjof Nansen at the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries led to the confusion of the package.
In the Cold War, submarines consummate the moving grate while going under.
A useful supplement are satellite measurements and large-scale operation of measuring probes on icebergs, but still much is achieved by unafraid people who camp in the cold outside.
Anderson takes a look at the strange, tiny world of the inflow system within the Arctic ice, formed by salt water cinnamons that are put together during freezing.
But, starting from the bear on the ice to the microscopic little wonders in the ice, all of them are threatened once the summer ice goes away, which is expected to be between 2013 and 2050.
"In a few months, that could be us."
Marine infantry were among the 6,000 who laid down in Arlington cranes
The upper-free De'Angello Robinson traveled seven hours by bus to lay a single crown on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other naval infantry who made the trip from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina, to the National cemetery in Arlington to decorate graves, the day was a tribute to the men and women in whose footsteps they walked.
In a few months, wherever we're being brought back, we could be, Robinson said about the fallen soldiers.
If we were, I'd like someone to do the same for me, so I'm trying to show my respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who had gathered on Saturday morning to lay cranes on the graves of veterans in several sections of the Arlington cemetery.
Morrill Worcester, owner of Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, founded this tradition in 1992 when he and some others decided to decorate several hundred graves at the cemetery in Arlington.
It is now an 18-year-old tradition and Morrill and his wife Karen, who make this journey every year, stop in various cities along the way to perform events dedicated to the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit organization, Wreaths Across America (cranches throughout America), which also extended the event to other states.
This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 cranes on the graves at the Arlington cemetery, in areas on Pentagon, on the graves of the Fayetteville National cemetery in Arkansas, in the Battery Park in New York, and at the Memorial for the United Airlines flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second time, the Walmart Foundation donated more than $150,000 for the purchase and transport of cranes.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster said that she made the trip to Arlington in memory of her husband, a deceased professional soldier.
Although her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said, this is her way of giving back something that brought the victims.
She said that's a small contribution to how we can support our civilians.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Packed in layers of warm clothing, the volunteers migrated across the wide lawns and hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers had older graves from World War 1 and 2 and the Vietnam War as a goal, since they are not visited as often as the newer graves, said the organizers.
The mood was happy, children played, and couples held their hands while carrying the fresh pine branches to the gray-growing tombstones.
Each round crown was dark green with a small red loop attached to the upper part.
The section 60, which is nearby and where mostly veterans of the wars are buried in Iraq and Afghanistan, remained almost calm.
The United Service Organizations donated 1,000 cranes to decorate this section, but the gloomy mood of the current wars fulfilled this area.
Individual cries were open, other prayers and families and friends held together in the icy air.
Some read aloud the names measured in stone, while others bow down to small black and white cards that had been placed for those in the damp mud whose tombstones had not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who forgot bitter tears in front of her son's grave.
It took 8 hours of Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the tomb of marine infrared sub-official officer David Shane Spicer, who fell in battle in July.
No one should ever forget why we're free ..., my son paid for it, she said.
"If I haven't been a long time, I want someone to remember him."
Contractor of the U.S. Government arrested by Cuban authorities
The Cuban government arrested a contractor of the U.S. government who sold mobile phones and notebook computers in the country, said representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Saturday.
The contractor, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc. based in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for customers, such as USAID, the US Department of International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officials from the United States' representation of interests in Havana are trying to gain access to the prisoner arrested on December 5.
The special charges have not yet been published, although, according to Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be arrested for almost everything, under the charge of "risk".
All so-called counterrevolutionary activities, including light protests and critical writings, pose a risk of arrest.
Government-enemy graffiti and statements are considered to be serious crimes.
Cuba has a growing blogger community, led by popular reporter Yoani Sánchez, who often describes how she and her husband are persecuted and attacked by government representatives.
Sánchez has repeatedly requested permission to leave the country to receive prices, but this has always been rejected.
The arrest of an American contractor is likely to increase tensions between the communist government of the Castro-Bruder in Cuba and the Obama government, which had sought a "slow" approach to improving relations with the island.
The news of the arrest was first reported on Friday night by the New York Times.
The new U.S. policy focuses on the fact that the United States will provide a contribution if the Cuban government takes concrete steps in this direction, such as the release of political prisoners and the creation of more space for opposition.
Mobile phones and notebooks are legal in Cuba, although they are new and sought-after products in a country where the average earnings of a government worker are $15 per month.
The Cuban government has only allowed ordinary citizens to buy a mobile phone this year, they are used to send text messages, as a 15-minute telephone call would cost a daily wage.
Internet usage is extremely limited on the island.
It is available in expensive hotels and there for foreign visitors and at some government offices, such as universities.
Cubans who wish to log in often have to report their names to the government.
Access to too many websites is restricted.
In Cuba, the arrest of an American is rare.
Most of the few U.S. citizens in Cuba are in prison because of crimes like drug smuggling behind bars, said Gloria Berbena, the press speaker of the U.S. intervention office in Havana.
Berbena said she could not give any more information about arrest.
The arrest and detention are clearly wrong.
An activity that would be legal in any other free society - the provision of free mobile phones - in Cuba is a crime, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, director of the American section of the group "Human Rights Watch", which recently produced a hard report on freedom in Cuba entitled "New Castro, the same Cuba", an allusion to the establishment of Raul Castro as the leader of the country that replaced the sick older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said that the defendants would be arrested, sentenced and detained very often within one day.
He said that any solution would probably be political and that the Cuban government often provoked a negative reaction in the United States, right at the time when both countries are moving towards more dialogue.
Pakistani government representatives cover plan to send men to Afghanistan
Pakistani authorities discovered on Saturday a supposedly leading head of a conspiracy aimed at sending five men from northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill U.S. soldiers, and said that they hoped that this case could help to discover an extensive network of terrorist recruits who are looking for radicalised young men to access the Internet.
Investigators said that they had been looking for an opaque insurgent, known as Saifullah, who had invited the men to Pakistan after finding them out because one of them on YouTube's Internet video page had made comments on terrorist attacks.
Saifullah became the leaders of these men after their arrival in Pakistan and tried to help them reach the remote area of Pakistan's stem belt, which is the home of Al Kaida and his terrorist training camps.
But a representative of Pakistan's intelligence service, who was informed about the matter, said on Saturday, Saifullah could not convince the Al Kaida leaders that the men are not part of a CIA conspiracy to subvert the terrorist network.
As a result, they were held for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the inhospitable mountains in the northwest, which have become a terrorist refuge.
They were considered part of a hidden operation.
They were therefore rejected, said the government official who wanted to remain anonymous due to the sensitivity of the matter.
The government official said that the men were by no means discouraged and continued to try to get the right recommendations to get access to the Al-Qaida camps when they were arrested by Pakistani criminal enforcement authorities.
The case of the five men - who continue to be in Pakistan and who are questioned by the FBI - highlights the key role of the recruiters in identifying future terrorists and possibly even more important in deciding who is trustworthy.
Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, the U.S. intelligence service has made it a matter of utmost urgency to accommodate human assets within Al Kaida.
The recruiters of the organization act as gatekeepers who do not let in those whose commitment to the Holy War is not serious enough and those who could be spies.
American potential recruits are subjected to a special examination by A Kaida, said analysts.
However, due to their potential access to US targets and propaganda values, they are also considered to be extremely attractive to the group.
Evan Kohlmann, senior analyst of the NEFA foundation based in the USA, said that in recent years terrorist groups have also become much more cautious in terms of allowing access to whom the US intelligence services have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you try to put someone into these groups, what better way could you go than to follow the recruitment model that so many have already followed?, said Kohlmann.
The model is now based much more on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of demonstrators demand climate action in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of demonstrators marched through the streets on Saturday and demanded from the negotiators at the Bella Congress Centre of the city more bold action in climate protection.
Demonstrators said that 100,000 people had joined the event, whereas the police estimates amounted to about 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists lit small explosives near some government buildings in the city center.
One day, when little happened in the climate negotiations funded by the UN, thousands of activists wandered through the city, on which there was "There is no planet B" and one in Spanish, which said "The Earth says "Genug".
Some stars joined the protest, for example the Danish model, the photographer Helena Christensen, who said that the journeys to Peru, the country of her mother's birth, make her aware of the heartrending problems the country has to struggle with due to the already noticeable effects of climate change.
That is part of the reasons why I decided to take part in the great demonstration - to pass on the word and to appeal to the world leaders, to bring about a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It's no easy task, but it has to be done now and there's no way that's going around.
The police stopped the demonstrators from coming too close to the Bella Centre and said they had arrested 19 people, mainly because they were either masked or carried pocket knives.
Under Danish law, these actions are prohibited at demonstrations.
According to a spectator who did not want to be called, because he was involved in the climate negotiations, masked demonstrators in black clothing lit several explosive bodies near the main Copenhagen channel, near which several ministries are located.
They threw them near the buildings, he said, adding that they started as a light rocket, but then they were followed by "a few large explosions".
Inside the convention center, people gathered in front of TV screens to follow the demonstration all afternoon.
But the protest did not seem to have reached the awareness of the main functionaries, such as Su Wie, China's chief climate negotiator.
When asked if he thought that the demonstration had a constructive effect on international considerations, he replied in English: "This is something I was not aware of at all."
He then went to Mandarin and said, "Because the venue is large, I can't hear what's happening outside."
He found that it depended on the perspective of the individual whether the demonstration would harm or help.
It shows the concentration of the general public and various sectors on the issue of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "we can also say that they are disrupting the negotiations or the freedom of other people".
Test data show persistent racial gap
The testimonies for mathematics last week were welcome good news for the public schools in Washington D. C.
Although Washington is still far behind the schools of the country that produce peaks, the testimonies show that in the past two years, the fourth and eighthsmen have made faster progress than cities including Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what is included in the latest figures of the National Assessment of Education Progress (NAEP) is the persistent gap of performance between African and white students, both at local and national level.
The average score of white fourth graders from Washington D.C. increased from 262 to 270 in the last two years (on a scale of 500), but their afro-American equations only rose by three points from 209 to 212.
The power gap actually rose from 53 to 58 points between 2007 and 2009.
The progress of the Afro-American octagogues basically remained the same, it fell to a statistically negligible point from 245 to 244.
The average score of white students was not included in the test data as the sample range was not large enough.
Nor is the picture more encouraging over a six-year period.
The gap, which separated white and black fourth graders in 2003, when the first NAEP was recorded in this district, was 60 scale points (262 to 202).
And although the score that children have reached of both groups has grown in this period of time, the difference with 58 points has hardly been reduced.
Some educational advocates of the district expressed concern last week that most of the results of school Chancellor Michelle A. Rhee and Democratic Mayor Adrian M. Fenty have been promoted to white students who are already powerful children.
This indicates that we have raised the overall rating by treating those at the upper end of the scale, which is problematic and difficult, said Jeff Smith, member of the board of D.C. Voice, a non-profit group that advocates education equality in Washington D.C.
I do not jump up and down for a span of two or three points, said Democratic Washington City Councillor, Kwame R. Brown, who has a daughter in the fourth class of the Eaton primary school.
Brown, a common critic of Rhee's management style, said that the message of the checkpoint figures is that the city's middle schools urgently need attention.
Of course, you always want to see the positive signs that I respect.
But what scares me is that we do not nearly spend the time and energy we need to use for our secondary school.
Rhee said that the district must continue to find better ways to meet the needs of the weak students.
In this autumn, for example, some teachers will be trained to use a new curriculum, the Wilson-Lese-System, aimed at students in the upper classes of primary and secondary school, which have not mastered the basic skills of reading at the beginning of their school career and which are significantly behind their similar classmates.
Daily Mathematics, a curriculum that takes priority from kindergarten to sixth grade games and life-like experiences, was brought to Washington under the former head of school inspector Clifford Janey and this curriculum is attributed to some of the NAEP progresses reported last week.
I believe that we must continue to work to make the best measures beneficial to the students who are below the level of grades, said Rhee.
Others say that NAEP results highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to improve the overall performance of the system while still providing the additional money and resources for low-performance schools that are necessary to reduce the gap.
This is a serious dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, Professor of Education at the University of California in Berkeley, examining the results of the urban exam.
The conventional remedy is to focus its resources and management reforms on schools located in the poorest areas of Washington D.C.
The objective could lead to political consequences that are working against this important item on the agenda.
The weak point is of course, as with other city school inspectors, that she tries to keep the white and black middle layer.
Our focus is to ensure that we build a system of great schools.
We need to strengthen our schools in the districts so that all families, regardless of where they live, can be sure that their children can receive excellent public education.
Janey, who is now a Newark school inspector, said in an interview this week that one of the most important elements for closing the performance gap is to extend the traditional public school year, which is currently 180 days in Washington to compete with charter schools.
One must increase the school year to nearly 200 days to have the power to change, said Janey, who came to an agreement with his teacher union last year over 185 days a year, which he considered as "a milestone" on the way to a greater increase in the next contract.
Higher education for more people than future prospects
The bus reaches the Gettysburg-College with a loud pipe.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, rises and blinzels a moment at the sight of the white columns, the brick facades and the emerald green lawn.
Graciela's parents have hardly completed high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela, who was buried in Silver Spring and now lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a college campus.
Their attitude and the attitude of the other eight-letters of the group who explore Gettysburg, where teaching per year costs $38.690, was more of an awe - inspiring visitor than that of an enthusiastic future student.
"Yes! I'll be here soon!" said Graciela, who would like to study medicine when the leader announced that they had now entered the building for natural sciences.
"Wow, really?" she said thoughtfully when she was reported to the school's low professor-to-student ratio.
The College in Pennsylvania was the 7th one that the children have visited on their three-day tour and now they have fully recorded the message they wanted: the question is not whether or not you go to college.
The question is where.
On the one hand, there is growing concern over the large number of children born in the United States who do not end high school or become pregnant as a teenager, on the other hand, there are also hundreds of thousands who receive the college education needed to enter the middle class.
In fact, one of five of this "second generation" of Hispanic Americans concludes college – which is a remarkable achievement because many of their immigrated parents, mostly from Mexico or Central America, came to the United States without completing high school.
Their success stories are important, researchers say, because they show the way forward for a generation that will play a huge role in the workers of the country.
Those who study powerful children say that they often have a natural affinity for school and an inherent drive to success.
Many of them also have parents who set high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But advisory programs also play a major role by helping Graciela and millions of children like them to come to college, especially when these efforts persist over a longer period of time.
If you look at low-income children whose parents do not have the experience and skills to help them find their way through the system, then at some point a single measure will not solve the problem either, said Patricia Gándara, researcher at the University of California in Davis, who examined hispano-American students.
We need to think about providing a supporting network for these children from preschool to high school.
The federal program, which was financed by Gracielas College Tour, is a useful example.
It is known as GEAR UP - a gang up - and makes more than 300 million dollars a year available for local school systems to start college preparation programs that begin when low-income students are in secondary school and continue until they have completed high school.
According to the U.S. Department of Education, the programme has helped more than 10 million pupils since 1999, more than 60% of whom went to college.
Iraqi Oil Ministry concludes contracts with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, at two auctions concluded on Saturday, the Iraqi Government has been able to restore its damaged infrastructure to larger oil companies.
The 10 contracts concluded with foreign oil companies by the Iraqi Ministry of Oil suggest that China, Russia and European oil companies are ready to play an important role in the renovation of the Iraqi oil industry, which for decades has been paralysed by war and economic sanctions.
American companies have only been able to book shares in two of the 10 auctioned fields for themselves.
Seven American companies had paid for participating in the second auction which started on Friday.
The only company that made a bid has pulled the shortest.
Two American companies were able to conclude contracts for fields auctioned in June.
The thin-saturated representatives of American oil multis at the opening of the Iraqi oil industry surprised the analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its gates after 6 years of war and instead of US companies, Asian and European give the way, said Ruba Husari, editor of Iraq Oil Forum, an online news service.
There will be no further offers in Iraq for a long time.
Security concerns, underlined by massively coordinated bombings on Tuesday, and political instability due to the withdrawal of the U.S. military, probably prevented American oil companies, said analysts to become more involved in Iraq, which has the third largest proven oil reserves in the world.
In some cases, US companies were disadvantaged because competitors, especially Chinese and other state-controlled energy companies, have significantly lower wage costs and are more likely to take risks because they do not have to account for shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies able to conclude contracts with the Ministry.
Bigger US companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, who maintain close relations with the Iraqi oil ministry and have been with technical advice in recent years, have gone out empty.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main actors in two of the contracts agreed this weekend.
The state China National Petroleum Corporation has offered more contracts than any other company and has been able to go home with large packages of contracts for two larger fields.
We all know, said the oil minister's spokesman, Assam Jihad, that China is on its way to becoming one of the greats of the world economy and a technological power.
We are convinced that the Chinese company can measure with its associates and fulfil its commitments to Iraq.
For the bid charge, pre-selected companies issued bids, which were then compared with the fee per barrel of oil that the ministry was willing to pay to increase the output of each field beyond the current level.
Top-planner of Al Kaida apparently killed in Pakistan
In the event of an obvious U.S. missile attack along the Pakistani border with Afghanistan, Al Kaida was to have been killed this week, representatives of the US anti-terrorism campaign reported on Friday.
This would be, if it were confirmed, the second deadly attack on a high representative of the terrorist organization this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arabs who, according to U.S. sources and Pakistani authorities, were killed by a number of rockets who met their vehicle near Miran Shah in the province of North Wales on Tuesday.
Local authorities reported that the rockets were fired by a drone type used by the CIA in the lawless stem belt of Pakistan.
They drove in a white vehicle towards the Afghan border when the car was hit, said a representative of a Pakistani civilian intelligence service from Miran Shah by telephone.
Locals suspected of being among the militants ran to the place and quickly took in everything that was left of the "fully destroyed bodies".
The local authorities could not confirm the identity of the victims, but two U.S. anti-terrorism representatives led undetermined evidence that Somali belonged to the dead.
Somali was described as the leading military planner of Al Kaida, who conducted operations of terrorist groups outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He was involved in conspiracys around the world, noticed a senior official who wanted to remain anonymous, and pointed to the delicate character of US air raids on Pakistani soil.
If one assumes its central role as given, this included planning attacks against the USA and Europe.
He accepted strategic instructions from the top leaders of Al Kaida and put them into operational plans for possible terrorist attacks.
The second U.S. government representative said that Somali had quickly ascended in the Al-Qaida hierarchy and had best connections with other extremist groups in the region.
He may not be aware of some Americans, said the second representative of the government, but this in no way reduces the risk he presented for us and our allies.
If his death were confirmed, Somali would be the second leading Al Kaida or Taliban leader who had been killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a military group in the tribal area and three other top activists.
The pace of attacks by CIA drones has decreased since summer, according to a summary of the Long War Journal, a website held by a non-profit organization, from an average of six operations per month to two.
The decline can be based on improved tactics of terrorist groups that have taken steps to reduce their vulnerability while at the same time brutally killing suspected informants, the site reported.
Leading UN envoy in Kabul will withdraw
The UN's leading UN messenger in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would withdraw from his office in March, which would end a stormy term of office that was plagued by allegations of widespread corruption in the Afghan presidential election supported by the UN.
Eide's departure takes place when the Obama government decided to send another 30,000 US soldiers to Afghanistan.
The UN sending said that he was supporting the military increase, but he also expressed concern that the U.S. military withdrawal timetable, which should begin in 18 months, could lead other NATO governments to withdraw their armed forces.
We need to speed up the construction of Afghan security forces and thus send the right signal to Afghans that they can trust the international community, said Eide in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military forces to increase the number of international civilian helpers to help in the political changeover of Afghanistan.
The military rise on the military side must correspond to an increase on the civilian side, he said.
Eide said that he did not take up his duties, but only fulfilled an agreement made in March 2008 against his family to stay in Kabul for only two years.
He said he wanted the notification to UN-
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now to ensure that he has time to replace him.
What I've said is that he's better off looking for a successor, said Eide.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
Ban has begun searching for a replacement according to UN representatives.
The UN representatives say that he considered the Swedish-Italian-stammed Staffan di Mistura, who recently led the UN mission in Baghdad and the French Jean-Marie Guéhenno, who had previously led UN peace operations.
Eide's position in Afghanistan was tested after his former deputy Peter W. Galbraith had accused him of preferring President Hamid Karzai in the presidential election in the country in September and hiding evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide rejected all accusations, but he also said that Galbraith's allegations - who was fired - had "unquestionably caused damage to the mission because already a great deal of skepticism existed in relation to international interference in the election".
Eide said that he recommended the appointment of a leading civilian representative to coordinate the assistance of the American-led forces in Afghanistan.
He also insisted that the UN leadership allows his successor to employ more staff from the United States and other Western countries who donate for the Afghan mission, and said that this would strengthen their confidence in the proper use of their money.
Eide expressed his disappointment at the restriction of his forces in Afghanistan and said that the cumbersome UN regimes have undermined his ability to bring in qualified people.
The UN rules are designed in such a way that I have been able to recruit only one person since May, he said.
This is catastrophic and must not continue.
US Minister of Defense Gates: Iran must expect additional sanctions
Minister of Defense Robert M. Gates said Friday that the world powers will soon impose "important additional sanctions" on Iran, because he did not participate in talks about his nuclear plans.
Gates spoke on a 7-day journey through the war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq to a group of about 300 U.S. soldiers in northern Iraq and played down the prospect of a military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran.
In Iran there are no good choices, he said in answer to the question of a soldier to the probability of such a development.
"One of the things that lie upon me in the soul is, if we have learned something from Iraq in the last six years, which is its own unpredictability to the war."
The Obama government is considering a sanctions package aimed at Iran's military and political elite, but Gates has announced that some sanctions could also affect average Iranians.
He said that a "package of positive and negative incentives" is required "to convince the Iranian government that it is actually less protected with nuclear weapons", because "their people will suffer the sanctions."
On Friday, in an opinion from the spokesperson of the White House, Robert Gibbs, the U.S. government has joined the top European politicians in warning that Iran must expect "believable" consequences if it does not meet the demands of the UN Security Council and its nuclear surveillance organisation, the International Atomic Energy Authority, with its nuclear programme.
Iran continues to claim that the knowledge of nuclear technology should only be gained for peaceful purposes.
In talks in Geneva on 1 October, Iran said that it would resume the talks on the limitation of its nuclear programme and waive a substantial part of its stock of enriched uranium in exchange for urgently needed nuclear fuel for its medical research reactor.
The US government has urged this kind of agreement to build confidence between the two parties and to gain time for negotiations.
However, Iran seems to have left negotiations on the provisional agreements since then -- in part, experts say that the Iranian leadership disagrees on whether to commit itself to the United States.
That Iran has simply left the international community in relation to some of the proposals that they had already agreed to at the beginning of October, has, openly said, brought together the international community, including the Russians and Chinese, in a way they have never been in connection with important additional sanctions for Iran, Gates said.
President Obama has set the 31st Dec. as a deadline for Iran to respond to these proposals before he will pursue other options, including those called the Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton once "expressive sanctions".
In an opinion delivered in New York, the Iranian representation to the United Nations condemned what they called on Thursday "unfounded and unfounded allegations" by some Security Council members on Iranian nuclear activities and said that they are willing to continue the talks with the United States and five other world powers "to achieve an appropriate long-term solution".
Gates, who was to return to Washington last Friday, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki in the morning before he flew to the oily Kurdish region in Iraq to meet with soldiers in Kirkuk and with Kurdish authorities in Irbil.
The tensions between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq remain high, particularly in terms of borders, property rights and the distribution of public revenue.
Gates forced both sides to reduce conflict potential to prevent delays in the US plans to reduce the American force from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also tried to disperse Kurdish concern about the imminent withdrawal of the troops. U.S. representative quoted Gates to Masud Barzani, President of the Kurdish regional government, said: "We will receive your security, prosperity and your autonomy within a united Iraq.
We will not leave you."
A change in the price of ageing China
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters, which gave them lectures that "Mother Earth is too tired to entertain other children" and "A baby more means a grave more".
These lessons they have learned so well that, as government officials in Shanghai, who, due to the low birth rate and the ageing population suddenly began this summer, to change the course and encourage young couples to have more than one child, their answer was immediate and final: "In no case".
We have already invested all our time and energy in a child.
For a second child nothing is left, said Wang, 31, a staff manager with an 8-month old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one-child policy in China, which has produced two generations of notorically thick, retired children, whom are lovingly called "little emperors", a population crisis raises in the country.
The average birth rate has fallen to 1.8 children per couple compared to 6 at the time this policy entered into force, the
Population issues are determined, while the number of population groups aged 60 and over in 2020 is expected to increase from 16.7% of the population by 2050 to 31.1% explosive, well above the global average of about 20 percent.
The imbalance is stronger in rich coastal cities with educated populations, such as Shanghai.
Last year, 60-year-olds and older people made up almost 22 percent of the reported inhabitants of Shanghai, while the birth rate was under one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, head of the Shanghai City Population and Family Planning Commission, said that couples of childbearing age need to get babies to "help reduce the ratio of older people and reduce the labour shortage of the future".
Shanghai will soon be "as old -- but not as rich -- as the industrialized countries, such as Japan and Sweden, are," she said.
A gradual relaxation
In the country's Constitution in 1978, China's one-child policy is likely to be the most controversial available, which has been introduced by the ruling Communist Party to this day.
Couples who violate this policy must expect huge fines -- up to three times their annual salary in some regions -- and with discrimination at their workplace.
Chinese representatives have attributed to this policy that critical claims of natural land resources could be avoided, whereas human rights representatives have condemned abuses in the enforcement of policies.
In rural areas, some officials who had a child have forced pregnant women to leave.
Many couples also had sex-selective abortions carried out, resulting in an unnaturally high relationship between men and women.
Over the last few years, government representatives for the population have gradually weakened their attitude towards a single-child policy.
In 2004, they granted more exceptions to the rule -- including city dwellers, members of ethnic minorities and cases where both husband and wife were single children -- and in 2007 the tone of many hard slogans was reduced.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute of Population Research at Beijing University, said that government representatives recently discussed even more radical changes, for example, allowing couples to have two children in whom a partner is a single child.
Shanghai became the first Chinese city in July, which launched an aggressive campaign to promote more births.
posters that taught families to have only one child were replaced almost overnight by guidelines that describe in detail who is in question for a second child and how to apply for approval.
The city administration has sent out city employees and volunteers for family planning to visit couples at home and to move information sheets under the doors.
She also asked to provide psychological and financial advice for those who had more than one child.
The reaction was not exactly encouraging, said family planning representatives.
Disappointing reaction
Although officials from a rural small town in the external areas of Shanghai said that an upsurge can be seen in the applications of couples who want a second child after the start of the campaign, the urban districts do not report any change.
For the Huinan municipality, with a population of 115,000 inhabitants, only four to five applications per month continue to apply.
Disappointed Shanghai officials say that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city expected for 2010 will still be about 165,000 -- slightly higher than 2009, but lower than 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the Family Planning Committee of the Shanghai Municipality of Caolu, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people no longer want children.
They want to give the best to their first, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said that they would like to have two children, and this was also legally permitted.
But they have, like many Chinese, only a minor health and life insurance of the government.
Without a social network, they say, this decision would be irresponsible.
People in the West misrepresent the one-child policy as a human rights question, said Yang, a civil engineer whose wife is pregnant in the seventh month with her first child.
Yes, one robs us of the opportunity to have more than one child.
The problem is not simply a policy issue.
The problem is money.
Other couples give psychological reasons for their hesitation.
Wang, the head of the staff, said she just wanted a child because she was also a single child. "We were the center of the family and used to that everyone cared about us.
We are not used to taking care of others and do not really want to do so."
Chen Zijian, a 42-year-old who belongs to a translation company, said it was more blunderous.
For middle class parents with double careers through which the birth rate decreases, he said, it turns to be successful and for this one must be selfish.
The age group of today's 20- to 39-year-olds grew up to see their parents fighting during the early days of the Chinese capitalism experiment, and they don't want a life like this for themselves, he said.
Also a single child, he said, makes huge demands on the time of the parents.
A mother must give up her social life for at least two years.
Then there is the space question -- "You have to rebuild your apartment" -- and the life planning -- "When the child is 9 months old, you must already have a CV for the best preschools."
Most of his friends are willing to go through this once, Chen said, but not twice.
Our generation is the first to achieve a higher standard of living, he said.
We don't want to bring too many victims.
UNO Group Develops Emission Reduction Plan
The climate conference, supported by the UN -- which has so far been characterised by wild poses and mutual accusations -- again set a focus on Friday with the publication of a document, which will record an ambitious reduction in greenhouse gases for the next 40 years, with the industry having to cope with the greatest burden in the near future.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement on greenhouse gas regulation, has shown both the remaining obstacles and the way forward.
But he was considered to be important progress in a negotiation that will end the time, as next week more than 100 top politicians from all over the world will arrive in Copenhagen.
The text, formulated by a UN working group specifically for this purpose, is silent about the amount of money that rich countries should give to poor countries so that they can master global warming in the short and long term.
It also offers a range of key issues options, including how industrial and large emerging economies can limit carbon emissions and how high the upper limit of global temperature increase that policy makers would contribute to.
The process is given a great flexibility, according to John Coequyt, senior representative of the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who designed the six-page document, has compiled a 180-page negotiating text to put this into focus what the leading UN climate protection representative Yvo de Boer called "the grand whole".
It shows the basis of a possible agreement in which the industrial nations would jointly reduce their emissions by 25 to 45 percent by 2020 compared to the 1990 limit values, while larger developing countries would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 percent over the same period.
Together, countries could reduce emissions by 50 to 95 percent by 2050.
The European Community has also given the talks on Friday a boost through its assurance to provide for 3,6 billion US dollars per year over the next three years to help poorer countries adapt to the impact of climate change, from the master of floods and droughts to the prevention of deforestation.
Friday, however, brought the same verbal fireworks that had determined the talks during the last week.
The US Climate Commissioner Todd Stern has refused to demand binding reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for industrialised countries compared to voluntary reductions for larger emerging economies, if not financed by the industrial nations.
This train announced that the Obama government was running a harder line with China than it was a Bush government representative not even two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without larger emerging economies and taking action, so Star, who also argued that the text is not going far enough to ensure that the reductions could also be confirmed by outsiders.
Stern gave his opinion one hour after the Chinese Deputy Minister He Yafei declared that the leading American climate negotiator lacked either "the reason" or it was "highly irresponsible" of him that he said at the beginning of the week that the United States would not help China financially to master global warming.
The future economic trend of the major world powers is at stake, and break-line lines have been opened both within the industrialized nations and between the industrialized nations and the emerging economies.
The current struggle relates equally to the rescue of individual economies, as well as to the rescue of the planet, with China and the United States acting for their corresponding obligations, while poorer countries claim that the two dozen most influential countries would ignore the scientific need to take more courageous measures.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it is not surprising that the great powers are fighting for those who should bear the costs for the brake of greenhouse gas emissions, as even affected countries have gone on to aggressively take the countries with very high greenhouse gas emissions for their actions to account.
This is clearly a game that will develop a new economic domination, according to Ulate, who is also a regional climate change advisor for Conservation International in Mexico and Central America.
Some countries that are most exposed to the impact of climate change indicated that they would continue to fight for a legally binding agreement in Copenhagen, although the leading participants say that the talks will in the best case lead to a political agreement.
The alliance of the small island states with 43 members presented a 24-page draft contract on the early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who heads the international climate negotiations for the European Commission, said that the offensive of the small island states "exercises political pressure on the entire political process," partly because they are now united and call for action from emerging countries, such as China and India.
The talks got a new urgency when the delegates focused on the fact that most open questions need to be clarified before the arrival of the government leaders in order to reach an agreement.
High-ranking representatives, such as Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Deputy Minister, escaped their aircraft and raced through the Bella Centre's alleys to meetings behind closed doors and press conferences to put claims that will be negotiated during the next week.
The pure extent of the assembly -- 13,000 people go daily in the convention center, guitar-playing activists organize night shows in which they make fun of the countries they think are betraying and selling, and draft contracts are presented by hand instead of by e-mail -- is already a challenge.
The intensity is only building up: almost all the important ministers will be here now and from Wednesday 60 leaders will be in Copenhagen.
We are coming to Oberliga, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Vice President of Global Policy of the Conservation International Organization.
The weights are coming.
Britain's first 225 km/h faster train redefines Monday's feeling
Monday morning at 5 a.m. 13 a pipe will penetrate the darkness to announce a train departure that represents a revolution in traffic in Great Britain.
The first high-speed passenger train in the country will be reached from Ashfort, Kent, to London St. Pancras 225 km/h and 93 km back in 38 minutes.
To Lord Adonis, the Transport Minister, Dame Kelly Holmes will return to London on board the first Javelin-Pendler service.
He hopes that the new service will finally connect Britain to an international rail network faster, more reliable trains and connect the large conurbations of the Midlands, North and Scotland to London.
The neglected province could become living donor cities, working hours would radically reduce, and the switch from aircraft and car to rail would reduce national carbon emissions and traffic congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three major parties believe in this vision.
But the many billions of British pounds required for the construction of a new national rail network, the inevitable planning slaughter and fear of environmental damage could still cause the brakes in British high-speed slides.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company founded in January to submit a feasibility study to the government, will, according to the Times, hand over the report on December 30.
This gives it a detailed route map of the next planned stage of the high-speed rail network.
The new railway line, which will connect London to the West Midlands, will pass a five-metre space of urban areas and places where the impact on the environment is controversial.
In the open terrain, the plan will show the concept within a distance of 25 meters from the final route.
HS2 is also intended to create three options for a larger, north-east leading high-speed rail network.
Lord Adonis will respond in spring.
The preferred option is a Y-shaped route, where a single high-speed route would lead to the West Midlands.
The route would be in or near Birmingham and a branch would lead west of the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another to the northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would lead to Scotland.
"It seems to be the best working option," said a railway insider.
After completion, the travel time between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to two hours 40 minutes.
The first section, which would not be opened before 2025, would allow travellers to withdraw the London-Birmingham route in 49 minutes, compared to today a little over an hour.
The drafts offered trains the opportunity to travel at a speed of 400 km/h, which would make the British rail network the fastest Europe.
The first route was planned in such a way that 400 metres of trains with a maximum capacity of 1,100 people can ride on it.
Up to 18 trains could be in service per hour on the London-Birmingham line.
In turn, this would mean that London would require a terminal station where 20,000 passengers could be finished per hour.
Given the spatial restrictions in the capital, it is expected that an existing station will be expanded to accommodate the high-speed network.
Railway experts say only St. Pancras International or Euston have this potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether this plan should be continued or not, but the lengthy public consultation and planning measures mean that a final decision will not be taken until after the parliamentary elections.
However, even if it puts the wheels in motion, the rail network must be built in sections.
The trains would first have to switch from the high-speed railways to existing railways in the north of Birmingham, which would continue to make the travel time between London and Scotland for over three hours.
This is true as a crucial crack in order to ensure a change from the plane to the railway, a guide to the railway revolution.
Tax payable on mortgages for 75,000 pounds of a conservative organ
Alan Duncan, the leading sub-house member of the Conservatives, charged the taxpayer with thousands of pounds a year for the cost of an orangery that he could build in his home in his constituency.
The party's prison spokesman, who was degraded by David Cameron because he begs that underhouse members have to live "of leaner ratios", has increased his mortgage by 75,000 pounds in order to have an oak-wood factory cultivation on his second house in Rutland.
He was allowed to charge the taxpayer the additional interest rate, a sum of hundreds of pounds per month.
Those responsible for the house approved the applications at the time and they were also not questioned by Sir Thomas Legg, who carried out a review of the expenses of the members of the house. Last night Duncan said that the applications could have been "not even cleaner or more understandable".
Duncan, one of the richest underground members, has a two-storey house in a village in his constituency Rutland and Melton.
Nearby houses have achieved a purchase price of almost one million pounds (1.1 million euros).
The ground floor includes kitchen, living and dining room, but the fees office, an spending control point of the house, has agreed that Duncan needs more space.
Last year he has grown a winter garden, which is referred to in the plans as "orangery".
Neighbors described him as a "glasshouse for entertainment".
During a recent investigation of his previous mortgage contracts, Duncan was not invited by the Committee on Standards and Privileges to comment on increased money collection.
The Committee released it last month after an examination of its expenditure from the breakup of the rules.
In 2004, Duncan transferred the security for a mortgage over 271.406 pounds (300,000 euros) from his London house to his constituency, which he had purchased in 1991, one year before his election as a Member of Parliament.
This week, documents published show that by March last year, Duncan received a refund of approximately 1,400 pounds (1,500 euros) per month as mortgage interest.
In April, its claims increased to more than 1,800 pounds (2,000 euros) per month.
The interest rate of Duncan's RBS mortgage has not changed during this period, which suggests that the total increase in the financing of the 75,000 pounds (85,000 euros) was used.
The normal rateless RBS mortgage interest fell from 7.94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March this year, where it is still standing.
The latest documents published by the Unterhaus show that this May Duncan continued to assert its right to 1,250 pounds (1,400 euros) per month.
Duncan lost his post in September as the opposition leader of the House after an undercover reporter filmed him at the time he said after the spending scandal that Members of Parliament would live "from leaner races".
"In essence, if one works for the state, it means that one has to live by leaner races and is treated like S*****e."
He said, "I have spent my money on my garden and have a claim to a dire small part, as measured by what belongs to it.
And I could have demanded the whole damn sum, but I don't do it."
Member of Parliament, a millionaire from his former career as an oil wholesaler, was attacked the first time in May because of his expenses, when it became clear that he had invited thousands of pounds for his garden before he had explained with the fees office that this could be considered "as an exaggerated demand".
As a protest in Duncan's lawn, an activist dug a hole in the form of a pound mark, after having become known that he had asked for 4,000 pounds (4,500 euros) over three years.
When he was asked about the increased mortgage last night, Duncan said: "This was approved by both the fees office and the following by Legg for an increase in value."
He added: "There is no debate about evasion and languishing or a bending of the rules or similar.
Everything is perfectly clear and moves strictly within the rules, is approved and everything.
It could not even be cleaner and clearer."
Come all you faithful to admire Brightons beach huts event calendar
Beach cottages in Brighton have found a new life content for the winter months as an interactive Advent calendar.
"Beyond", an alternative church group that stimulates spiritual discoveries through creativity, has invited 24 owners to decorate their huts for every December day with Christmas songs as the theme.
The event started on December 1st and visitors were allowed to see the latest cabin every day from 17:30 am to 18:30 pm with free light wine and traditional Mince Pies, filled with dried fruit pastries.
The Christmas songs selected so far are "I saw three ships", "O come, o come, Emmanuel" and "The first Noël", where the cabin decoration is the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is an honorary clergyman of the Chichester diocese and head of Beyond.
He said, "We want to make religion more important to people in a post-Christian society.
Why do we as a church expect people to come into a strange old building? I think the church should go to the people and organize enthusiastic celebrations.
The idea of the beach hut event calendar began as a conversation with some friends during dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastic creative and living place and we try to express this through our spirituality."
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and in the world for the climate.
Tens of thousands of people have demonstrated on Saturday and Copenhagen to demand an ambitious and mandatory agreement on the fight against climate warming, where the police have taken several hundred arrests.
According to police, at least thirty thousand people, hundreds of thousands, according to the organizers, are marching in the cold of the Danish capital, at the edge of the United Nations Climate Conference, which should lead to a conclusion by Friday, which could enter into force from 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish chairman of the Climate Change Conference, increasing world mobilization contributes to the climate, which is illustrated by these demonstrations that the "political price" of a failure in Copenhagen would be very high.
The incidents in the Danish capital took place shortly after the train passed, when a group of 300 demonstrators, dressed in black, had broken windows with paving stones and hammers, found a journalist of the AFP.
Anti-unrest police immediately and without consideration, intervened.
The police have announced that, according to your assessment, 600 to 700 persons were arrested mainly members of the Blacks Blocs, these extremely violent splitters who have already made themselves famous at the Nato Summit in Strasbourg, in the east of France, in April.
The Coalition Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organizers of the demonstration, has been arrested the conditions under which hundreds of militant followers were "without distinction", severely criticised, and has underlined that about one hundred of them were "not even held in the streets on Saturday evening", despite the extreme cold with handcuffs and position.
The more peaceful train has gone from Parliament towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations took place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 meters away from the building without trying to enter.
A stage was installed to welcome the intended speakers for an evening with candlelight, with the participation of the former South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu.
Most of the demonstrators have traveled with bites and trains from the major European cities, but also many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, as well as some Africans.
About 3,000 people, most of you with sky blue rain coats, have made a first morning run in Copenhagen, as you have followed the call of the friends of the earth to form "blue tides" for the "climate justice".
Today we are going to the streets to demand a reparation of the ecological debt in favour of the south, explained Lidy Nacilil, Philipinian activist of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can't continue and say we have time, Angelique Kidjo, singer from Benin.
There are rivers in Africa that dry out, watercourses where you can walk, just as it has never been in the past.
For the first time in the history of climatic diplomacy, founded in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Agreement, the movement of globalisation critics has approached environmental organisations.
European Member of Parliament José Bové, the figure of globalisation critics, announced that he came to Copenhagen to link "climate justice and social justice": "Today there is no difference between the fight against climate warming and the fight for another world."
The Asian Pacific space, where many islands are located, which are particularly vulnerable as a result of warming, has given the launch shot for the demonstrations.
According to the organizers in Australia, about 50,000 people have gone on the streets.
In Manila there were several hundreds of people, mostly students marching in red and heating bandanas, in which you celebrated solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Djakarta, but also in Canada, marches of several hundred demonstrators took place to demand an energetic approach against climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the network "350" have gathered a few hundred people, namely Paris, Marseilles, Lille (Norden), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).
In Geneva some people gathered.
The separatist Abkhasia has chosen his president, Georgia argues that this is a "rich" business.
Abkhazia has elected his president on Saturday, this happened a little more than a year after Moscow had recognized this pro-Russian separatist Georgian territory as independent, Tbilissy declared the "rich".
About 131,000 people were called to take part in the first election after the Russian-Georgian War of August 2008 for control of the South-Oscetic territory, another Georgian Secessionist territory recognized by Russia.
The constituencies have closed at 5 pm GMT.
The election attendance was approximately 58% a few hours before the election venue, according to the Abkhasian election commissioner.
The first preliminary results should be announced during the night from Saturday to Sunday.
The five candidates, including the previous President, Serguei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, who condemned the election.
These elections are a farce.
On the other hand, the Georgian President, Mikheil Saakachvili, regrets that Abkhazia is now under rest assured total occupation, explained his press speaker, Manana Manjgaladze.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognized the independence of this area with 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world perceives it as a part of Georgia occupied by Russia.
After it had separated itself from Georgia during the conflict between 1992 and 1993, with several thousand people dying, Abkhazia wishes to prove by this choice that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage in our new life, a new era, as an independent state, has explained Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian who claims to have chosen Mr. Bagapch.
She was one of the electorate who went to vote in a constituency which was in a school in the capital of Soukhoumi, a beautiful white building with a few palm trees before the entrance.
The question of Russian domination is the heart of this presidential election, in a region with beautiful landscapes on the black sea.
Large signs on which Bagapch can be seen on the side of the Russian President and the head of government, Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, are located everywhere in this small area that has 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, located in the eastern part of the country, the head of district, Beslan Archba, has prepared a warm welcome to the Russian representatives who have come to monitor the election execution.
We, the Abkhasian people, are grateful, he said at a small celebration as an allusion to Moscow's support, in particular with regard to the decision to recognise Abkhasia's independence.
I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian Parliament, replied and raised a glass of vodka.
The opposition in turn, represented by the former Vice President and two Russian businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticised the agreements made with Moscow in the previous year, as the one in Abkhasia left the railway control for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Banba, claims to support neither the current government nor the opposition.
A majority of 50% plus one vote is necessary to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this limit, a second round of elections must be organised within two weeks.
Climate: Demos worldwide, incidentals in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people have demonstrated all over the world on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding contract from the Kopenhagen climate conference, where the police, at any time ready for action, have arrested about 700 people at the edge of an important demonstration.
According to police, thirty thousand people, hundreds of thousands, according to the organizers, have demonstrated in the afternoon cold in the Danish capital, which will receive delegates from 193 countries until December 18th, in search of an agreement to enter into force on 1 January 2013.
From Parliament, the peaceful train marched towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations take place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the center and did not try to penetrate.
A stage was set up to welcome the intended speakers for an evening with candlelight, with the participation of the former South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu.
A few moments after the train had passed, a group of demonstrators, dressed in black and armed with bricks and hammers, started to take discs, found a journalist of the AFP.
Anti-unrest police immediately encircled you and intervened without consideration by throwing some of you to the ground.
The police have announced that 600 to 700 people have been arrested and have made it clear that they are mainly members of the Blacks Blocs, these extremely violent dividers who have already made themselves famous at the Nato Summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
In the evening, during the incidents in which, according to the police, about twenty people were arrested, a police officer suffered an injury to the chin by a patch stone. Four vehicles burned near a occupied house.
"We have the extreme groups under control," said Henrik Jakobsen, the police spokesman, while the helicopters of the forces in the air were creating in the air.
Most of the demonstrators who drove by train or with their own vehicle from major German cities, from London, Amsterdam or Milan, were Europeans.
However, there were also many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, and Africans.
Almost 3,000 people, mostly in the sky blue raincoat, formed in Copenhagen in the morning after the call of the "Friends of the Earth" to a first group to represent the "blue seas" for "climate justice".
"Today we are going to the road to demand that the ecological debts be paid back to the people of the south," said the activist Lidy Nacilil of the Jubilee South Coalition of the Philippines in Copenhagen.
"We can't tell ourselves anymore: we still have time," says singer Angélique Kidjo from Benin.
"In Africa there are rivers that seal up, there are watercourses through which one can walk, which was never the case before."
The first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was launched in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the movement of opponents of globalisation has approached environmental protection organisations.
The French MP of the European Parliament and globalisation critic José Bové, told AFP that he had come to Copenhagen to "connect climate justice and social justice." "There is no difference today between fighting global warming and fighting for another world."
The organization Oxfam has mobilised several personalities, such as the Danish Model Helena Christensen or the former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson, who is addressing the masses.
The Asian Pacific space where many islands are particularly vulnerable to global warming has given rise to the demonstrations.
In Australia, about 50,000 people have walked the road, according to the organizers.
In Manila, a few hundred people, in the majority of students, dressed red with bandanas, have made for the sun energy advertising in front of the city's capital city administration.
In Hong Kong and Djakarta, hundreds of demonstrators have also gathered in an action against climate change.
In France, during the demonstrations organised by the "Net of 350", several hundred persons were joined, especially in Paris, Marseilles in the south, Lille in the north, Bordeaux in the west and Lyons in the east.
Several people gathered in Geneva.
According to Chatel, the subjects of geography and history are strengthened by the school reform of the Lycées.
In an interview published in the Sunday newspaper "Journal du dimanche", the Minister of Education Luc Chatel stated that subjects of geography and history are strengthened by the school reform of the Lycéen, even if they are not required in the terminals (12th school year).
"The students of the première (11st school year) now have every four hours and the same programme," confirms Mr. Chatel.
For the minister "must overcome this sanctity", because after him "the scientific profile is no longer a scientific profile", but in general a concentration "the best student."
"The economic-social and literary profile (ES and L) must not become an under-profile of the scientist," he continued. He stressed: "I have not yet heard many historians and intellectuals who would have embarrassed themselves about the lack of historical-geographical education in the terminals on technical Lyceen."
On Saturday, an IFOP survey published in the Humanité revealed that nearly seven out of ten French (69%) criticised the state project of the deletion of compulsory education in history and geography in the terminal S (12th school year with scientific profile). Many teachers and intellectuals also complained about this project, as well as the left and some representatives of the Right.
The Minister replied that there was no question as to a limitation of the philosophy of the Terminal S program.
Luc Chatel also defended the educational reform for teachers, while 16 organizations (students and trade unions) called for a protest against the project for Tuesday, which in their opinion falls victim to the educational training of future teachers.
The Minister stated that they had a professional qualification examination in Master 2 (M2) at the beginning of the year, and that they had to examine their teaching skills at the end of the year.
In addition, they carry out internships during the year in the M2 and then teach one year before the students as a teacher in the internship.
He continued: "If you add all the internships offered before the performance exam, you can reach even more hours that you have spent before the students, i.e. more than 300 hours."
The Minister finally stated that he wanted to offer "the individual right to education" - a "things that do not exist in popular education."
He confirmed that he wanted to cancel the school card "by 2012".
15 minutes for the climate at the "Ecole Normal Supérieurre"
Fifteen minutes to talk about the deployment at the Copenhagen summit: this is the challenge that Jean Jouzel, Vice President of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, had to deal with on Saturday morning at the Ecole Normale Supeure in Rue d'Ulm in Paris.
As a journalist of the AFP noted, the Nobel Peace Prize winner Jean Jouzel opened the first of the "Ernest" conferences, in which experts each turn fifteen minutes with filmed contributions to the audience.
You want to do something with which to reach the people and make them feel like you want to learn more, explained Edouard Hannezo, 22 years and one of the organizers of this day, at the edge of the conference. The name of this event goes back to the name the students gave to the fish in the bassin of the school.
"The experts selected the twenty participants, even according to their charisma," he explains.
"It is possible to speak for hours for climate warming, but the core targets can also be set in a few minutes," said Jean Jouzel of the AFP, who spoke only with the help of foils before about 50 people.
"This is part of our role as a scientist," he stressed in the hope that the audiences might see that "the Copenhagen conference is based on an absolutely serious scientific matter."
The videos shot by these conferences will be online on the school's page from December 15.
The next Ernest day is scheduled for February and will take place every two months.
Payment delay: angry prison guards, actions planned
On Friday, the unions of law enforcement officials called for a general day of action to ensure that the premiums and overtime paid for budgetary reasons until January are transferred before Christmas holidays.
The 2nd labor union ("FO-Pénitentiaire") called on employees who had no service to demonstrate and block them on Tuesday morning in front of the penitentiary to draw attention to the "theft of what they are entitled to".
The third union of penitentiary officers ("CGT-Pénitentiaire") called for "to unite to a strong mobilization in the various prisons", to which the non-payment of overtime hours, night supplements and Sunday and holiday supplements in October is being burned as a "damaging and unacceptable" market in December.
The first union of law enforcement officials, the Autonomous Federal Criminal Union (UFAP/UNSA), called for "general mobilizations (...) to demonstrate dissatisfaction and anger."
The management of the penitentiary and the Ministry of Justice stated that the overtime hours in 2009 had increased significantly and not all had been planned in the budget. However, they guarantee that the remaining claims will be paid in January.
As the Ministry of Justice announced in the evening, Michèle Alliot-Marie sent a letter to the unions of law enforcement officials, which guarantees that the payment will take place next month.
"I know very well about the staff's efforts to keep and modernise our criminal enforcement system," the Minister of Justice says in this letter.
"I have instructed the administration of the penitentiary to take immediate action to ensure that such a situation, created by a lack of assessment of the overtime, will not be repeated in the future," added Mrs Alliot-Marie.
Thus, the December wage is lean, except for the management staff who benefit from high service and target premiums, the UFAP/UNSA explains for which the "household constraints" must be met.
"This is an absolute scandal", the interregional trade union FO in Marseille is indulging and announces to boycott "all gatherings and convenings" up to new instructions.
"The staff do not go to work on Sundays and holidays if the hours from October in December are still not paid. This also applies to their overtime," the FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne also threatens.
"At a time when more and more tasks are being placed on us without more staff being recruited, the attempt to enrich the staff's funds is more than inappropriate," said Bordeaux's CGT union.
According to trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions. Some are less affected than others.
In any case, however, it is wrong, states the Secretary General of the UFAP, Jean-François Forget.
Obama thinks he always distributes better gifts than he gets himself.
The American president, Barack Obama, who will spend Christmas with his family in the White House for the first time, has plummeted with the TV talkmaster Oprah Winfrey that he will always distribute better gifts than he gets himself.
During a special show broadcast on Sunday evening on the ABC channel, the President and his wife Michelle gave an insight into how they will spend the holidays in their new illustrated home.
Even Bo, the small four-legged companion of the family, will be with you from the game.
"Santa Claus also loves Bo", says Michelle Obama, adding that the dog of course also gets a gift.
Michelle Obama decidedly rejected her husband's claims on the quality of the gifts. "I made you beautiful gifts last year," she says to the president.
"Please," he said to her sickly and pointed to the pearl chain of the First Lady: "And who gave it to you?"
During this one-hour broadcast in an unconventional atmosphere with the well-known television presenter, who had supported Barack Obama so vehemently during his campaign, the President and his wife also talked about gifts she had most loved as a child.
Barack Obama remembered a bicycle with ten courses and also a basketball that his father, whom he very rarely saw, had brought with him for Christmas from Kenya.
"I remember when my father once visited us for Christmas and brought me a basketball," said the president.
"Only much later in my life did I understand that I had this ball of him."
The First Lady remembered her doll house.
"I didn't know how to arrange the furniture in a house at all, so I put it all on the wall instead of grouping it around the fireplace. But I loved this little doll house," Michelle Obama said.
Johnny Hallyday re-operates, RTL confirms that he was transferred to the artificial coma
Johnny Hallyday was once again operated in Los Angeles for significant damage after surgery in France. According to the surrounding persons, the situation was "under control", although RTL confirmed that the singer was put into the artificial coma in order to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rock musician was re-operated in the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles in the night of Wednesday to Thursday after the American doctors had found "damage caused by the operation of a tape disc incident", which he had suffered in Paris on November 26, according to his production company in Paris, which added that these damage would have required a new operation.
The singer's production company still wanted to clarify that the situation was "under control" and announced that a new medical opinion would be available no later than 48 hours.
However, according to RTL, the partner during the last tour of the singer, Johnny Hallyday was put into an artificial coma to avoid "smelling and complications".
However, it was only after 48 hours that one had a little more certainty about the patient's condition than he opened his eyes, adding RTL.
At the request of the AFP there was neither a confirmation nor a comment from the production company.
RTL also confirms that "from certain sources" shows that after his first operation in Paris, "no pressing was done".
The rocker had been operated in Parc Monceau's international clinic for a band's incident.
The surgery planned for several days was performed by the neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known doctor who had already treated many stars.
This was not available for comments to RTL on Thursday evening.
After the operation of Johnny Hallyday, the singer was delivered to the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles on Monday due to a follow-up infection after the operation.
The singer Eddy Mitchell, who is very close to Johnny Hallyday, felt that his friend was going through a "deep valley" on Thursday. However, he assured him that you don't have to worry about the rock musician because he was "a good fighter".
"He had called me before his departure to Los Angeles. I told him it was stupid to put himself on a plane for twelve hours after such an operation," Eddy Mitchell said.
On Wednesday evening, the singer Jean-Claude Camus confirmed that Johnny Hallyday "reacts good to antibiotics" and that "infection has been inhibited".
Mr. Camus also explained that he had spoken to Laeticia, the singer's wife, and he did not feel any particular anxiety.
Nevertheless, the concern for the health of the singer had been growing ever since he had spent nine days in a hospital in July after he had crashed on his yacht.
Two months later, to general amazement, Johnny Hallyday had a "small colon cancer surgery", which resulted in a slight infection.
At the end of September, the singer recorded his long "Tour 66" as a farewell tour.
Since then, however, every health problem has been commenting extensively. Fans and journalists have not escaped that the singer on stage has had trouble moving.
It was not until mid-November that the surrounding persons had to re-enter the hospital.
Euro-2009/Kurzbahn: First place for Bousquet about its favorite distance
On Thursday, the Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, three-time medal winner at the 2009 Summer Olympics, won an international title on his favourite distance, 50m freestyle, at Euro-2009 on the short track in Istanbul.
On the first day of this competition, which allowed polyurethane suits for the last time, there were only three world records, while a true flood of record had been expected.
A record was improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto over 4 x 200 m layers and the other two by Russia at 4 x 50m positions of the gentlemen.
Shame for Bousquet, who wanted to grab after the world record at 50m freestyle, whose record he holds in the great basin (20.94).
At one of the two royal distancers in swimming, 50m-freestyle, 28-year-old Frenchman claimed himself in 20.53 sec,. in a final with ten swimmers at the start (usually it is eight) - a premiere at international level.
Bousquet forced the Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and the Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but he did not manage to break the world record (20.30) as planned.
"You can believe in ever greater, and in the present case I have said that if the world record is in my reach, I will try."
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers started in polyurethane suits, which are banned from 1 January 2010.
With 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations end their Epos in Istanbul, which began in 1999 at the same competition for the first time.
The use of the combination did not pay off this time for the German Paul Biedermann, twice world champion in the basin this summer in Rome and world record.
The young swimmer has not managed to improve his best time over 400m freestyle (3:32.77), yet he has spent the second best time in his career (3:34.55), before the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Danen Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
"I didn't give everything this time.
I knew I couldn't get a world record today, but I defended my title and fulfilled my job."
"Lobintsev will be a serious opponent in the future," said Biedermann.
USA : Tomb at Zola estimated at 1.5 million US dollars
A Roman tomb, which appeared with the French writer Emile Zola, was estimated at $15 million on Thursday, according to the art dealer Sotheby's.
This plate is two meters long and 63 cm high. It dates back to the IIIrd century AD and has always been rated at $150,000 to $250,000.
The marble, on which "four scenes of the Dionysos are represented in a sophist architectural décor, surrounded by satyren and Bacchus figures, is a rare piece. There are only four or five of them in the world," said Florent Heintz, vice-president for auctioning Roman and Egyptian antiques at Sotheby's, on Tuesday in front of the AFP.
It was sold among hundreds of pieces.
"The sale is still running, but this part is certainly what the buyers have offered most for so far," says Sotheby's spokesman Dan Abernethy to the AFP.
The discovery of this acquisition of the marble part by Emile Zola goes far back.
The record was at home in Rome for almost 300 years in the famous collection of the Borghese family, after which she appeared piece by piece with the French actress Cécile Sorel, who found use in her bathroom of her Paris hotel, and with Paul Reynaud, Minister of the III French Republic and President of the Council before Marshal Pétain came into power.
The next fifty years are in the dark.
When searching the database of the Louvre, Florent Heintz discovered that this record was part of an "heir of Emile Zola" which was opened in 1903, one year after the death of the author of the "Thérèse Raquin" and the fresco "Rougon-Macquart".
Zelaya's exit from Honduras to Mexico has been destroyed
On Thursday, Mexico had declared the conditions for the transfer of the crashed Honduran President Manuel Zelaya on domestic soil to be no longer compatible after this guide had been rejected by the coup government as unacceptable.
After a telephone conversation with President Zelaya that took place at night, everything seems to suggest at the moment that we disagree with the possibilities of carrying out this transfer, the Mexican Minister for Foreign Affairs Patricia Espinosa explained.
According to the Immigration Authority, the plane provided by the Mexican government, which had arrived in Salvador on Wednesday for the purpose of the transfer to M. Zelayas, was returned to its starting point.
The coup government wanted to require M. Zelaya to "abdicate" and to seek political asylum for him abroad under guidance.
However, the overthrown president rejected this, as he wished to return to Mexico as the most welcome, official head of state.
The coup regime "has suffered a further failure by wanting to give up on my expense (...), they wanted me to abdicate," said M. Zelaya to Radio Globo on Thursday, in which he has often spoken since the beginning of the political crisis that has lasted in the Central American country for five months.
I can stay here well and enjoy ten years, here I have my guitar, added the fallen president who had fled to the Brasilian Embassy of Tegucigalpa two and a half months ago, with attacks of some chords.
The Mexican Embassy has presented us with a request for guidance, which we unfortunately cannot accept, as it does not include a request for asylum, on Wednesday Oscar Raul Matute, Minister of the Putsch Government, had declared to the Honduran Radio HRN.
I did not seek asylum in any country at all, had Manuel Zelaya answered in an interview with the Telesur canal, whose seat is in Caracas.
A possible exit from Honduras, he had stressed, would only be a president of the Honduran people.
On Wednesday, the rumors about a departure from M. Zelayas had mobilized the followers of the fallen president who had made their way to the Brazilian Embassy and gathered around it, and then the military had strengthened his operations there.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticised the position of the coup government.
This, according to his assessment, revealed the marginal character of this government in the face of international standards.
Zelaya, who had approached the socialist Venetian president Hugo Chavez, had been thrown down on 28 June, on the day of the popular survey organised by him in preparation for his re-election, contrary to the advice of the Supreme Court, the army and the Congress.
From his exile in Costa Rica he had returned surprisingly on September 21st and had fled to the Brazilian Embassy.
If he leaves, he is detained for treason of which he is accused by the justice, according to the coup government.
The coup president Roberto Micheletti managed to organize a presidential election on November 29 to replace M. Zelaya.
In the course of the controversial election, Porfirio Lobo was recognized by the United States, but was rejected by the Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil.
Three days later, Kogress had voted massively against M. Zelaya's return to office until his mandate ended on 27 January.
Wall Street in the upturn, the U.S. trade balance nourishes optimism
The New York Stock Exchange has completed a high level on Thursday, with the figures of the US trade balance showing a price recovery of the United States' shares and their partners: the Dow Jones has increased by 0.67%, the Nasdaq by 0.33%.
According to the numbers for stock exchanges, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has risen from 68.78 points to 10.405.83 points, the Nasdaq, which is dominated by technology, from 7.13 points to 2.190.06 points.
The extended Standard & Poor ́s 500 index was written at 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1.102.35 points.
There are good news from various industries, Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial judged.
However, this remains anecdotal under the premise that the market focuses only on "half glasses", so it declined.
According to Avalon Partners' Peter Cardillo, investors are primarily focused on the figures of the American trade balance, "which has an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter".
In October, the United States' trade deficit fell by 7.6% to 32.9 billion dollars in relation to September.
In contrast, the analysts had expected a deficit increase.
Imports as well as exports have increased.
The great innovation is the increase in the total volume of trade, especially in goods exports, which reflects the economic growth of the US's main trading partners, said Christopher Cornell of Business Research Economy.com.
In return, unemployment reports in the United States rose at all expectations last week and have now reached the level of 474,000 requests.
However, during the last four weeks, the average for new jobseekers "has fallen to the lowest point in the year," said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has fallen.
The profitability of government bonds to 10 years has increased to 3,482 % compared with 3,432 % from Tuesday evening, the profitability of bonds to 30 years to 4,492 % compared to 4,408 % from the previous evening.
Cuba: Hundreds of partisans standing in power pipe "Dammen in Weiss"
Several hundreds of partisans, standing at Cuban power, have exploited the wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana for the purpose of the World Day of Human Rights and have also eroded another rally, because of which a good dozen dissident was temporarily arrested.
In order to get the forty "Dammen in Weiss", wives, or close-to-be political prisoners, partisans of the government under Raul Castro were plucked out on the open road, just when they were on foot march into the center of the Haupstadt to demand the liberation of political prisoners, a AFP journalist confirmed.
Down with the Yankie!, "Söldner!", "The street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "There live fidel and Raul!", the authorized partisans with a raised fist scandalized the dissidents.
The latter were escorted by civilian agents who had appeared to "guarante their protection."
A similar demonstration against the "Dammen in Weiss" had taken place in Havana on the eve of the evening, in which it was neither injured nor arrested.
In the Havann district of Vedado, on Thursday, a dozen dissidents who were also present at the demonstration taking place in the face of the International Day of Human Rights, were temporarily arrested by civilian police, confirmed a AFP reporter.
The police, according to this journalist, have forced the partisans of the government to enter civilian vehicles under violence.
The temporary detention of dissidents under such circumstances is usually limited to only a few hours.
As candidates for the Sakharov Prizes awarded by the European Parliament in 2005, the Women in Weiss organized an unauthorized march for the "Please for the release of all political prisoners", the number of whom, according to dissident list, is around 200, said Laura Pollan, one of the leaders whose husband Hector Maceda is responsible for a prison sentence of 20 years.
M. Maceda belongs to the group of Cuban dissidents detained in March 2003, of which 53 are sitting behind bars until that date.
The Cuban authorities consider the opponents to be "söldner" or "agents" in the service of the declared arch enemy, the United States.
A rarity in itself is that Cuban television returned the demonstration events between militant pro-government fighters and "contra-revolutionary" reports that took place on Thursday.
The Cuba, led by a single party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of evaporation of rights and freedoms, in particular of freedom of expression.
A mad man kills eighty years with the knife and leaves 5 injured in Clichy-la-Garenne
On Friday against late afternoon at the main business time in the city centre of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine), a knife armed with two knives killed an eighty year old and injured five more people.
According to the first information of the survey, the 28-year-old attacker had injured the eighty-year-old in or in front of a pharmacy on the Boulevard Jean-Jaures with two knives, correspondingly, police statements, with witnesses present.
The old man, born in 1929, reported by a police syndicate, Alliance, in the hospital, to have suffered the consequences of his injuries.
In or before the same pharmacy, he precipitated a couple with a pregnant woman.
The man, about in the trissies, intervened and was injured.
The first two victims were sent to the hospital, where the eighty year old died.
The other injured is in danger of life, as, according to police sources, it appears that vital organs were affected.
The pregnant woman has become sick as a result of the events and is said to have been hospitalized to a police source in the "shock state".
The armed man, who, according to police statements, seemed to be under alcohol or drug influence, should immediately be on the road, the same Boulevard Jean Jaures.
He would have injured two more passersby, apparently by chance: a thirty and forty years old, the latter of both heavy.
The scenario remained in the dark in the evening.
He had been armed with two carnivores, which he carried crossed behind the back, declared Arnaud Pressé, a responsible person of the Syndicate Alliance of the Hauts-de-Seine area.
Several passersby, including young people, are said to have tried, according to the witness reports of the AFP, to hand over the mad.
I saw a guy in the trissies with a green vest.
Three young people tried to step in.
They didn't make it because the guy was well built, reported Alberto, a waitress of a nearby bar.
A horde fell over him, he added, including a city police officer who broke his wrist.
Still on the Boulevard Jean-Jaures, at the height of house number 61, two city police, including their superiors, tried to arrest the armed man and were injured with knife-stitches, so police statements.
The event has taken place in one of the main hits of Clichy-la-Garenne, where there are a number of shops.
Passersby came to me to tell me there's a injured person out there.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old person lying on the ground, I brought them in first aid position and noticed a clumsy wound in the stomach area, said Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist, the AFP.
Five minutes later, a second person, about thirty years old, was injured by cuts.
Finally, the state police forces arrested the man who did not carry any papers.
The Nanterre Procuratorate has commissioned the District Office of the Criminal Police of Hauts-de Seine (SDPJ 92) to provide information on the case.
The madman has been hospitalized on Thursday night.
In view of his condition, he has not yet been heard in court.
A police source doesn't rule out being delivered to a mental hospital.
According to another police source, six police officers were able to hand him over to the Clichy police commission, where he had been discharged.
He was "in a state of exaggeration" like "all the mentally confused of this kind in which the forces are released during the Tathergang".
USA: Polanstis Lawyer again calls for the prosecution of the prosecution
The lawyer of the French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski, for the repeated time on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, western United States), demanded that the prosecution against his client, who is currently at his place of residence in Switzerland due to a moral ban of more than 30 years ago, be brought before court.
Chad Hummel, lawyer of the director of the "Pianist", has in front of three judges of the appeal court in the second district of California of gross trial errors in the negotiation period in 1977.
I demand punishment at the place, M. Hummel explained before he added that the conduct of the judge Laurence Rittenband, appointed at the time of the trial, "was running down a cold back".
According to him, the - now dead - Judge Ritsband, before he fell down his judge's appeal, had discussed with a prosecutor who should have told him that Roman Polanski had earned a breeding home -- which is a serious procedural error.
This discussion was published in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski: persecuted and coveted), especially by the questionable prosecutor David Wells.
Finally, at the end of September, M. Wells had declared that the authors of the documentary had "been lied".
If the Court of Justice refuses to terminate the criminal proceedings, Mr Hummel requires the conduct of a process which would enable it to submit the evidence for its argument.
In turn, the charge repeated the evidence already explained at the first instance, i.e. that a discussion on the abolition of the offences imposed on the defendant cannot be taken seriously into consideration until Roman Polanski appears before court.
The 76-year-old director had fled the United States in 1978, even before the denunciation of the penalty for "illicit sexual relations" with a minor of 13 years.
Since then, he has no longer traveled to the United States.
The deputy prosecutor of Los Angeles County, Phyllis Asayama, had explained that Roman Polanski "must be there to attend the trial".
In this matter, would you like to spread the message not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other defendants who are fleeing is a way out?, asks Ms. Asayma.
In her opinion, "the filmmaker prays the Court of Justice for a favor and thus despises his authority".
One of the three judges – who now have 90 days to announce their decision – even pointed out "that there were other anti-talternatives".
Hummel was not the only one who had requested the termination of the prosecution against Roman Polanski.
The lawyer of Samantha Geimer, the victim, also demanded the annulment of the criminal proceedings.
She recalled that her client would no longer bear to be harassed by any resurgence of the Affaire Polanski and added: "No one in this room can say that this procedure was just.
Thirty-two years are enough".
Roman Polanski was arrested in Switzerland on 26 September, on the initiative of an American arrest warrant.
After spending two months behind bars, he was sentenced to house arrest in his chalet in Gstaad, in anticipation of any extradition.
Wall Street is inhibited by the rise of the dollar and closes without course.
The New York Stock Exchange closed on Friday without price in a market that was torn between better indicators than in the USA and a rise in the dollar: the Dow Jones won 0.63%, while Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
On the basis of the final figures available for closing, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has risen by 65.67 points to 10.471.50 points, while the technologically dominated Nasdaq has given 0.55 points to 2.190.31 points.
The extended Standard & Poor's 500 index has risen by 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1.106.41 points.
"The market is quite quiet to say," noted Mace Blicksilver from Marblehead Asset Management.
"It remains narrowly limited, the volume of trade has become very low and I think this will remain so until the end of the year."
The trend was supported by the publication of better economic indicators than provided for, "to help improve the market view on the solidity of the recovery of the economy", Charles Schwab's analysts summarized.
In the US, retail sales increased by 1.3% in November, thus already two months in a row and much more than planned.
Furthermore, US consumer confidence improved significantly in December, at 73.4 compared to 67.4 in the previous month, according to the Index Preview of the University of Michigan.
However, the indices were slowed down by a new rise in the dollar price, which has reached the highest level over the euro for two months, thereby reducing ''the sectors affected by the economic situation," said Owen Fitzpatrick, Deutsche Bank.
The technological values have thus lost a little to the ground.
The bond market has gone down.
On Wednesday evening, the yield of the debt bond increased by 3,540 % compared with 3,482 % and the bond remained at 4,497 % over 30 years compared to 4,492 % of the previous day.
Miss World election again in South Africa
After a month of tour through South Africa, the 112 candidates will cross the last obstacle to the title of the Miss World on Saturday to realize their dream: to be elected the most beautiful woman in the world and to watch this in front of a billion TV.
During this great beauty fair, which is held for the second time in a row in the vicinity of Johannesburg, five of them have already given their ticket to the semi-final.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma from Canada were chosen as Miss Sportive or Miss Top Model during their African stay.
This was a true strudel of pleasures.
Beautiful cities to visit, such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Horn, was simply exceptional.
I've seen many things and had a lot of experience, said Miss Sierra Leone with full enthusiasm.
This competition will take place for the ninth time in South Africa and will be broadcast live on Saturday, at 5 p.m. (15 p.m.) from Midrand, north of Johannesburg.
I couldn't imagine a better country to hand over my crown.
This experience was simply fascinating.
I am happy to have made this experience twice, underlined Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the South African summer.
For the young Russian, her second stay in South Africa was characterized by numerous exchanges of experiences with candidates and the discovery of "atmorous landscapes".
After a month of Galas, samples, encounters with the press and Safari, the Mass is now focusing on the competition.
The Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to step into the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, who was elected in 2000 and will also be present at this election, as well as to imitate Aishwarya Rai, who was elected in 1994 and both became Bollywood stars.
Of course, it's every woman's dream to be crowned as the most beautiful woman in the world, but it's not just about the appearance here.
We are ambassadors of our country and I want to come home with the crown, so Miss India throws in with a wide smile.
According to the organizers, this 59th edition is underlined with music and dance.
The female candidates defil in traditional costumes and not to be forgotten in the swim suit.
The performance is presented by a television presenter, the Chinese woman Angela Chow, by the ex-fine queen from South Africa, Michelle McLean and a responsible of the Miss World Committee, Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it knows how to receive the world with an unsurpassed warmth and pride, assures Julia Morley, chairman of the Miss World.
The candidates made a safari last year, visiting the famous township in Soweto, but this time they tasted with the bike and the local cuisine.
But the meeting with the South African President Jacob Zuma, who gave them the hand, was exceptional.
Not usually for a head of state, Miss Sierra Leone noted.
Its most beautiful memory, however, will undoubtedly remain the trigger in Cape Town (Southwest) at the World Cup in June 2010, a kind of country to advertise for this event a little more.
I'm wrong with people I'd probably never be able to approach.
I will surely return to the 2010 World Championship, enthusiastically promised Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
According to his son David, Johnny Hallyday's news is "very positive"
The news about Johnny Hallyday are "very positive", his son David assured on Friday at his arrival at Los Angeles Airport, where he visited his father who has been in the hospital for a few days.
The news is very positive.
He is very strong, everything runs very well, said David Hallyday to the press on exit from the plane, in which he arrived shortly after 1 pm local time (21:00 C.E.) from Paris.
The son of the singer, who made a relaxed impression, assured that he would go "fastest" to the Cedars-Sinaï hospital, to which Johnny Hallyday was delivered to Paris on Monday for a bacterial follow-up infection after an operation at a band disc incident on November 26th.
The singer was "moved that night in Los Angeles into an artificial coma to relieve his strong pains and to carry out his treatment, the press service announced.
Johnny Hallyday was transferred to an artificial coma by the doctors at the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles, where he was delivered to Paris on Monday for a bacterial follow-up infection after a band disk operation on November 26th.
The singer had to undergo surgery again in the night from Wednesday to Thursday due to the sick changes caused by the last intervention.
His wife, Laeticia, attended a school event in the French gymnasium of Los Angeles on Friday morning, where her daughter Jade went to school, found a photographer of the AFP.
The head of the Orthopaedic and Traumatological Surgery Department at the Hôpital Pitié-Salpêtrière, Yves Catoné, announced that he would visit the singer at the Los Angeles Hospital on Monday.
The producer has severely burdened the neurosurgeon Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, who operated on November 26 in the Clinic international du parc Monceau in Paris.
We were told he did the purest massacre.
Los Angeles surgeons said they were completely disarmed, Mr. Camus explained.
I heard that you might be going to start a trial, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus believes that Johnny Hallyday "has traveled far too fast and this with the permission of the Paris surgeon to Los Angeles".
I made a personal phone call with this doctor who assured me that he saw this journey as completely unproblematic, which was very surprising to me, since I already had two disc operations behind me, he added.
Shortly before, he announced to RTL that the singer had apparently left the hospital after the operation "without drainage, without anything".
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is very well known in the artist environment.
He had operated the actress Marie Trintignant, a few days before her death in Vilnius, in a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine where he practiced at that time.
In 2007, he also operated on the actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to resorb a hematoma after a brain hemorrhage.
However, he is also a doctor with a dubious reputation, who has been sentenced several times by misconceptions and not to be forgotten, because of tax evasion and fraud.
Me Olivier Metzner, lawyer of the doctor's chamber, has called him "a man without scruples" who has to be responsible for "regularly" before the board of the board and "all things are as recommended".
After a few days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux gave a statement on Friday about his lawyer, Me David Koubbi.
This stated that the intervention would have been "perfect" and post-operative investigations would have been "normal".
The surgery "does not cause bleeding and therefore does not require drainage," he added.
In any case, the tour of the singer, whose health problems have been voiced since last summer, seems to be questioned.
It is quite clear that for a continuation of the tour on January 8 (in Amiens), something is too scarce, said Mr. Camus.
The party alliance UDF (Union for French Democracy) becomes energetic and calls on the Nouveau Centre Party to stop using its seal
The Party Alliance, which is supervised by François Bayrou's MoDem Party, has vehemently responded on Friday to an attempt to take over the seal, once founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, from the chairman of the Nouveau Centre Party, Hervé Morin, and invited him to use this seal on no longer a document under threat of judicial persecution.
Hervé Morin publicly announces his intention to take over this UDF seal, as he believes François Bayrou would not be worthy of defending this political heritage after he had delivered his hand to the left.
By the way, the Minister of Defense, whose party is the UMP, wanted to reaffirm this strategy before the NC's National Council on Saturday.
He was supported by Mr Hervé de Charette (formerly UMP, now NC) who claims to be owned by the UDF brand, since he was the first to apply for this brand at the "Institut national de la propriété industrial" in 2004.
However, the office of the party alliance UDF, supervised by François Bayrous' friends, silenced and made it clear that they did not allow themselves to be denied and set a time limit for the Minister and the honourable Member, under threat of judicial persecution, to stop using this seal and to transfer her the property rights of the brand.
You have made numerous statements in recent days that you would propose to your political movement to take the UDF seal+, the party alliance wrote in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 office members, including François Bayrou and Mariale de Sarnez, the MoDem party and the Senator Jean Arthuis des centrist alliances.
You also believed that you would have the right to have the name of this movement +Nouveau centre+, the slogan + today's UDF + printed on their political material as well as on the website of your website.
As you know, you have no right to use this seal, explained the UDF's office and asked the NC party to remove "without mentioning the name UDF from all the material as well as from (their) website".
In addition, Hervé de Charette required "to transfer the trademark's property rights to its legal rights."
If you refuse to do so, we will bring action against you to respect the law and to defend the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatory warned.
In her letter, they emphasize that "since 1978, the UDF has been a fully-fledged political movement and recalls that Morin and his friends have "made the choice" to leave this 2007 to establish a competitive movement, as others had already done in 2002 to establish the party "UMP".
According to the undersigned, the Nouveau centre party has no rights to use the UDF seal (Union pour la démocracy française).
They continue to recall that the last UDF Congress in 2007 adopted the three-year accession to the MoDem Party as well as the establishment of a branch for the defense of "material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As far as Hervé de Charette is concerned, the office continues, "when he applied for the brand name, he had not been a member of the UDF for three years, but the UMP.
He benefits in a scandalous and fraudulent way from the lack of deposit of the acronym UDF to carry out this for himself.
In addition, consider that this carelessness is the best way to turn into a criminal offence, and ironize the NC's strategy: "It seems more dignified to us in politics and in life to make ourselves a name, instead of trying to get out of anonymity by taking a name, in a deceptive way, upon which one has no legal claims."
Affaire Liliane Bettencourt : François-Marie Banier is condemned for exploitation of weakness
On Friday, the Nanterre Court of Justice decided to judge the artist François-Marie Banier to determine whether, as the daughter of billionaire Liliane Bettencourt claims, he took advantage of a weak moment of the eighty-eight years in order to hide part of her wealth.
The 62-year-old photographer, who is known for his star photos, will have to be responsible for exploiting weakness in court on April 15 and 16, 2010, a criminal offence that is punished with a maximum imprisonment of three years and a fine of 375,000 euros.
This decision means that there will in fact be a process in this affair which is worthy of the Saga one of the richest families of France, in which mother and daughter fetter and at the same time have the reins of the cosmetics empire L'Oréal in hand.
However, the 15th Chamber also ordered a medical examination of the 87-year-old Liliane Bettencourt, jointly conducted by three doctors.
The Erbin and main shareholder of L'Oréal has so far refused to conduct such an investigation, above all not under the conditions presented during the investigations by the Procuratorate of Nanterre.
The doctors appointed on Friday should present a report before 10 March 2010 in which you will clearly state whether and at what times Liliane Betscourt may have been in a state of weakness.
I think she'll go through this investigation.
I'm going to talk to her, explained Mrs. Bettencourt's lawyer, Me Georges Kiejman, after the trial.
As regards the lawyer of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Me Olivier Metzner, he is very pleased with the court's decision.
This is an excellent novelty (...). The opinion will prove that he (Banier) manipulated this old lady, which one must protect, he confirmed.
For two years, the only daughter of Liliane Bettencourt has launched a criminal charge against François-Marie Banier, photographer and all-round artist, and accuses him of taking advantage of her mother's weakness for years in order to hide donations of a total of one billion euros in the form of bank checks, insurance policies or paintings.
For her part, Liliane had always resisted being manipulated by the photographer she saw as a long-standing friend.
Although the court would have to consider the admissibility of the action brought by Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers, the Plaidoyers of the lawyers led to a large family debacle on Friday.
For example, the lawyer of Liliane Bettencourt called on three letters sent by his client to her notary (1999, 2003 and 2005), in which she wrote that she was tainting the husband of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers.
According to her lawyer, Liliane Bettencourt added: "Please explain to my daughter that for fifteen years, I wrote to Banier one to two times a day.
Françoise I have never been able to speak again since her marriage".
The Procuratorate of Nanterre is once again of the opinion that the applicant had no right to respond in this way, especially because, in recent days, a court judge has refused to initiate a judicial proceedings against her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "is fully legal, is not under protection and has no guardian.
No one has the right to act in her place," said the prosecutor, Marie-Christine Daubigne.
The court has now decided to give a judgment after the trial on the admissibility of Mme Bettencourt-Meyers took place.
Manager revolution or the end of the Strategic Early Enlightenment?
If nothing changes to the leadership of the large French companies, our struggle for the development of economic intelligence has been free of charge ...
For over a decade, the attitude of the management of large companies in relation to its employees, said the position of the companies vis-à-vis the consumers before the marketing revolution: For the staff to join "values" determines the best of how it used to be to depend on the consumer products designed by the technicians in the factory.
By focusing on the customer in the focus of the companies, the marketing revolution has given the strategies of conquering the markets in the area ... although the authoritarian temptation products separate factors favor the customers again regularly!
Demobilisation of the employees can lead to fatal demoralization.
The suicide of France Telecom, PSA or Renault is only the tip of a much larger phenomenon that affects employees in particular.
This demobilisation has a negative impact on the development of all the company's intellectual functions, especially those of R&Eand, which is even more crucial, on those of economic intelligence.
In fact, the IE (Intelligence Economique = Economic Intelligence) " calls for a proactive approach and a forward-looking approach by all parties (...)", claimed by the employees, to be used to contradict the instructions of authoritarian management.
That is why we call for an operational revolution, which would insist on placing employees in the middle of the company's concerns equally in addition to customers.
The very conditional benefits of internal polls
Will internal polls, such as the questionnaire that Orange has submitted to its payees, stimulate this revolution in terms of management practice?
I'm afraid not.
- First of all, because I could see that the whole structure, in view of a new situation after many detours, finally reached priority to do what it always did.
Also because authoritarianism - one of the pathologies of power-proportionally increases the importance of its own failure.
And finally, because most managers have a very simplified idea of human behavior.
Her interpretation of psychology has been mechanized by the large engineering schools.
Through intellectual comfort, they take over the old behavioristic theory recently reactivated by the American "Neurosciences" and unknowingly widely spread by research institutes and the media.
Thus, and by suggesting that it is possible to promote the "heavens" (sic) to the engagement of employees, a current Le Figaro.fr survey of Ipsos encourages leaders in an attitude to a mechanistic control system that is inappropriate for today's world.
Identifying and measuring the mobilisation factors
Instead, an operational revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern enterprises presupposes the adoption of a definitive view of human behaviour.
It consists in integrating a fundamental protocol into any consideration or practice of the management: for the payee the commitment to the company is possible only if it clearly appears as a means to achieve part of its dreams, their ambition and its projects.
At present, only the studies from multifunctional analysis take on this conception of the motivation of the employees.
These studies have shown that they assess their business on the basis of a given doxa, which allows them to assess, through their perceived image of the company, what it offers them to achieve their life objectives.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of these mobilization factors, the managers of companies can control their "social performance", predict and anticipate and reposition their human resource management back in the right place.
In this way they create a fertile soil that is favourable for the coordinated development of robust and efficient economic intelligence.
Oslo's speech: the "just war" brings Obama praise from the right
The American rights welcomed the speech held by Barack Obama on the eve of Oslo and was pleased that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States.
The Conservatives who had mocked the allocation of the prize to Obama on October 9 this time applauded the President's speech, following the example of former Vice-Presidentship candidate in the 2008 elections Sarah Palin.
I liked what he said, Palin explained the face of the right wing of the Republican Party in the US Today newspaper and added that she had raised the subject of a "sometimes necessary" war in her newly published memoirs.
The war, of course, is the last thing I think the Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
We have to stop the terrorists down there, she says.
Obama, who inherited two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, was trying on Thursday in Oslo to justify the use of violence; a way of explaining his decision nine days ago to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, expressed the opinion that the Presdent had done "very good work" in Oslo.
I found the speech really was very good, the former president of the House of Representatives, who, in particular, acknowledged the reference to "the existence of evil in the world" in Obama's words.
In some parts, he felt that this speech was a historical one, said Ginrich, who was interviewed in the radio broadcast "The Takeaway".
The previous MP, considered by some as possible candidate for Republican nomination for the 2012 presidential election, said he was pleased to have seen a "President of the Left" who reminded the members of the Nobel Committee that "they could not be free and would not give a prize for peace if the use of violence did not exist".
For Michael Gerson, former author of George W. Bush and now editor at the Washington Post, Obama has given "a very American speech".
In addition, that he is a "cosmopolitan" as "he always does", he has "speaked like an American president" when he pointed out that the Europeans "live like in a security bubble that they did not create themselves and for whose protection they do not do much", says Gerson.
Among the few unconvinced rights, former UN ambassador John Bolton, a falke of the Bush era, described the speech on the National Review Online website as "durable, high-end and inspirationless".
On the left hand of the president, democratic representative Dennis Kucinich is concerned about how Barack Obama defends the use of the armed forces.
If the war is packed under the cover of the justice, the massacre can simply be justified by the innocent, he warns.
However, the press of the moderated left remains praising on the side of the President.
The Los Angeles Times, which is still of the opinion that the Nobel Prize has been awarded early to Obama, called the address itself for a speaker like him, who is known for his talent, as "monumental work".
The Oslo speech "provides a timetable for managing international decisions against conflicts, poverty and oppression," says the California daily newspaper.
The New York Times believes Obama "proclaimed the necessary discourse" and calls his speech "dark and exemplary at the same time".
Fernvers: Three Marathons for an agreement that secures the provision of Christmas
After a three-week negotiation marathon, the unions of the Road Association and the TLF - the only employer's organization that remained until the end - reached an agreement on Friday evening that put an end to the strike warrant and the threatening heavy supply shortage at Christmas.
At the signature meeting on Friday evening, the State Secretary for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, welcomed the agreement that was started on Wednesday morning after several weeks of negotiation.
After a second night of negotiation, the negotiators agreed on the early Friday morning in the hope of a rapid signing of the agreement on the late morning.
And that is what the three employers' associations (FNTR, Unostra and OTRE) had decided to leave the meeting.
However, more than six hours passed from the beginning of the meeting at 11:00 a.m. until the conclusion of the agreement and the agreement was signed only at 6 p.m.
The conflict "had done a lot of damage to the companies" and "it was to be feared that he would affect the holidays at the end of the year," said Bussereau.
The agreement provides for a 4% wage increase for the lowest wages (local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest wage groups (international transport).
Thus, the hourly rate for workers with the lowest wages is rising from EUR 8.72 to EUR 9.06.
"That's not a lot, but we'll start small first," says Patrice Clos (FO).
The activists are now instructed to stop blocking the supply centres.
"However, there will always be some contradictions which are not satisfied with the agreement," he added.
TLF Chairman Philippe Grigot spoke of a "good agreement", although it was "slow to grant these wage increases in the face of international competition".
According to him, the increase is 170 euros per month for the low and 100 to 120 euros for the high wage groups.
"This agreement is based on the common sense and respect for employees," said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), whereas Thierry Douine (CFTC) spoke of "an historical agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) spoke on this subject about "an acceptable compromise".
The agreement also provides for the increase in travel costs by 3 % and the maintenance of the overall road transport budget in the first half of 2010, which will enable in particular the issue of 13 months' salary and the modernisation of collective agreements.
M. Bussereau recalled that "the reduction of taxes for employers of 100 million euros" was the subject of an amendment by the government to the 2009 draft law on the adjusted finances, which was adopted by the National Assembly in the night of Thursday to Friday.
The government calls for "an identical" vote from the Senate.
The TLF signature allows the agreement to apply initially to the companies associated with this organisation and, in the event of an extension by the Minister of Labour for the entire profession.
This will be the case "in the shortest time", assures Bussereau.
The opposition of employers' associations can only delay the procedure.
The FNTR association launched a "deceptional trade" because the 100 million euros "had already been promised to the sector to compensate for some of the carbon tax".
The State Secretary for Transport forced us to negotiate as soon as possible, but not on the basis of a joint analysis, but in order not to tear down the Gans eaters on the approaching Christmas days, the Unostra laments.
For the Otre Association, the agreement threatens to "buy a large grave for small and medium-sized enterprises in the industry over the next 12 months".
Line RER A: Disorders this weekend, trade unions dissatisfied with the proposals of the RATP
The disturbances on the RER A line, the largest high-speed rail network in France for the Greater Paris area and the Île-de-France, continued on the weekend, while a meeting on Friday, the second day of strike between the trade unions and the RATP (independent Paris passenger transport administration) continued to wait for strikers with their demands for pay increases.
At this important shopping weekend before Christmas, there were no trains between 10:00 and 20:00. On the central line (between La Défense and Nation) only one of two trains and outside the central line was ready to use only one of four trains.
Connection to SNCF trains was interrupted in Nanterre Préfecture, which forced travellers to change.
The department store chain Galeries Lafayette, which counts every day 200,000 customers, welcomed the fact that "the RATP is trying to connect the big business to traffic".
The RER A line runs through the Paris conurbation room from west to east.
The RATP section connects Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre as well as Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one of two trains was scheduled at the main traffic time, and almost none during the low traffic time.
As already on Thursday, there was no human feeling on the railways, as the inhabitants of the Île-de-France had adjusted to the situation.
So early in the morning, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was far less flooded than usual, especially because of the lack of gymnastics.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, engineer (29), said he would have been extra "one and a half hours earlier up to get to work on time".
SNCF, who had planned to care for travellers by staff and officers, pointed out that there were no bottlenecks in the Saint-Lazare station.
The trains operated by SNCF on the RER A line or in the direction of Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or left the Saint-Lazare railway station to ensure the connection to the metros.
On Saturday and Sunday, general meetings of the strikers were held again, during which the results that the associations had classified as "poor" after the meeting with the leadership leader on Friday afternoon were checked.
The RER Managing Director proposed the specific preparation of a protocol for line RER A with regard to all relevant aspects, working hours, careers, etc.
However, this is not what the drivers want. According to Thierry Garon (Sud), they demand a long-term wage supplement.
The CGT was indignant that the RATP itself put its wage proposals in parentheses and stressed that the leadership "is not capable of solving a problem, while this was also possible for the long-distance drivers and SNCF."
The RATP made it clear that a new meeting on the "comprehensive examination of working conditions" was planned for Monday.
This also shows the associations that the company "Ignores the weekend drivers".
In the morning, about 150 drivers visited the establishment of a committee in Paris.
Once again, it was the leadership that until now rejected any discussion during the strike, and suggested a meeting after a calming of the situation.
On Tuesday, the conflict threatened to extend to the RER B line after a prior announcement of Usa and Indépendants.
The associations demand a wage supplement of 120 (usa) to 150 euros, of which 30 are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud, Indépendants), and also complain of the deterioration of working conditions on this route, on which millions of travellers are travelling daily.
The RER line, which has many years of professional experience, includes a gross wage of between 2,200 and 2,700 euros and a wage supplement of 600 to 650 euros for shift services as well as Sundays and holidays.
Turkish Constitutional Court dissolves pro-Kurdian party. Decision with serious consequences
On Friday, the Turkish Constitutional Court announced the resolution of the country's main pro-Kurdish party, a decision following immediately angry demonstrations in the Kurdish community in the south-east of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision threatens to make the work of the government extremely difficult to reach the Kurdish community in order to put an end to the conflicts that have lasted for 25 years.
The "Party for a Democratic Society" (DTP) was dissolved, as it had become a "stop for activities which are detrimental to the independence of the state and its indivisible unity", said the president of the Constitutional Court Hasim Kiiç four days after the decision against the press.
According to Kiliç, the decision would have been taken unanimously by 11 judges, with a majority of seven votes required to impose the resolution. He also pointed out that 37 of the party’s executives, including Chairman Ahmet Türk and parliamentarian Aysel Tugluk, had been excluded from political action for five years.
The judge also announced the abolition of parliamentary immunity, which is enjoyed by Turks and Tugluk, as well as the confiscation of the party's goods.
The DTP now has 21 seats in Parliament (of 550).
The party leaders stated before the ruling that the parliamentarians would rather leave Parliament than meet as partyless parliamentarians.
The decision followed a procedure initiated in 2007 by the prosecutor of the Turkish Federal Court Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya. He accused the DTP of following the "wisdoms" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) which is regarded by Ankara and many other countries as a terrorist organisation.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political window of the PKK rebels.
The party assures that it has no connection to the PKK, but refuses to call it a terrorist organisation and calls on the government to negotiate.
The ruling of the Constitutional Court between the Government is aimed at countering the Kurdish community and proposing a series of measures to strengthen the Kurds' rights in order to break down the support of the Kurds and put an end to conflicts.
The leaders of the DTP confirm that a resolution could lead to a re-emission of tensions in south-east Anatolia, where numerous demonstrations against the detention conditions of the PKK chief Abdullah Öcalan have led to clashes with the police over the past few weeks.
Since the announcement of the court, thousands of demonstrators have gathered in front of the premises of the DTP in the millions of cities of Diyarbakir in the southeast, mostly populated by Kurds.
The forces used tear gas grenades and waterthrowers when the demonstrators began to throw molotowcocktails and stones.
Hundreds of people also demonstrated themselves in Istanbul.
According to the judgment, Türk assumed that the court's decision "will further deepen despair".
"Turkish cannot clarify this question (Kurdish, anm. d. editorial) on the basis of the ban of a party," he explained to the press.
The government, consisting of a party that emerged from the Islamist movement, also regretted the decision.
"We impose on the parties on the basis of principle.
That doesn't solve the problems," said Taner Yildiz.
"This decision is a goalping of the democratic opening promoted by the government," said Ahmet Island, political market observer.
"One can obviously look at a PKK reaction," he adds.
On Thursday, the PKK became aware of an attack that killed seven soldiers in northern Turkey three days earlier. This was one of the most brutal attacks in recent months.
The snowfall can come
A really crunchy winter, that's what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not because he wants to harass the citizens, says the FES Winter Service Manager.
So that his employees can try out and master the entire vehicle technology.
In the weekend, according to meteorologists, it could be that far for the first time.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of snow and ice.
The FES is based on an accurate plan.
As soon as it is snow-covered in Frankfurt and the temperatures are below zero degrees, 20 "A" routes will be driven off with large-scale vehicles, Brauburger explains.
These include major transport and transit roads such as the Neue Weg and the Hanau Landstraße.
But also fire brigades, public transport routes, pedestrian zones and routes with accidents, such as the Atzelbergstraße.
The service of the FES starts at 3 a.m.
The approximately 1040 kilometres would need to be spread in a maximum of three hours with moisture salt, which is better liable.
That's why FES starts at three o'clock at night, "so that the routes are free until professional traffic starts".
It becomes difficult when it's only snowing at 7.30.
Then we have a problem, says the winter service manager, "because then no one is willing to make the scattered vehicles a place".
Only after that, if it is no further snow, are supply and development roads, including the Council-Beil-Straße, on the line.
The last priority is side and sideways.
There will be complaints, Brauburger knows.
At five o'clock in the morning, the foot population of the FES is getting on the road, danger points and transitions are cleared.
The FES can't usually take care of all bike paths.
There is a special service in Frankfurt, which keeps an eye on the bridges from 22 to 4.30 p.m., says Brauburger.
As there is on these fast smooths, as soon as the temperature falls below two degrees, the scatterer is on the way.
If necessary, the police will also call it.
The cradle of dinosaurs
Tawa hallae looked like many other carnivorous dinosaurs: the two-metre-long and 1.50-metre-large animal ran on two strong hind legs, had a long skull with sharp, bent teeth, short arms with sickle claws and a long tail.
If the species had lived a few million years later, it would have been nothing special.
But Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these body characteristics, reports Sterling Nesbitt from the University of Texas in Austin and colleagues in the journal Science of Thursday.
The animal lived in today's New Mexico about 215 million years ago, which was on the equator in a dry zone of the supercontinent Pangäa.
Tawa opens a new window to the early evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
He shows us a lot about the relationship, the spread and characteristics of the early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other palaeontologists began digging at Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico.
We have sometimes found a dozen dinosaur bones in one day, which is unprecedented for Trias deposits, reports team member Randall Irmis of the Utah Museum of Natural History.
Some of the bones quickly identified the researchers as new species.
During the excavation, they carried together the remains of a total of five individuals.
Fund confirms theories about Dino early history
The name "Tawa" comes from the Sun god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt, it is an extraordinary find: "Dinosauric fossils from the trias are extremely rare, usually only single fragments are found."
Other dinosaur experts do not necessarily share the enthusiasm.
Especially spectacular is this find not, but it confirms some theories about the early history of dinosaurs, says for example Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
According to the current teaching opinion, dinosaurs first appeared about 230 million years ago.
However, many of the oldest fossils are incomplete, which is why the assignment of these Ur-Dinos is mostly controversial.
For example, the experts discuss when the ankles split into their three main development lines: the carnivorous theropods, which later included the tyrannosaurus rex, the Velociraptor and also the birds, which were known as "long heels" of four-legged sauropods and their relatives, and the plants refreshing Ornithischia (Vogelbassauriers), among which were, for example, the species Triceratops and Stegosau.
After the analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa hallae is an original theropod.
It has an interesting combination of primitive and advanced properties, says Nesbitt.
On Tawa hallae’s skull, for example, the researchers found evidence of airbags as they also possess the descendants of the theropods, the birds.
Thanks to the air bags, the breathing of birds is more efficient than that of mammals.
At Tawa hallae, the bones of the spine were apparently partially filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive Theropod with air bags, says Randall Irmis.
As the related line of the huge Sauropods later also owned air bags and lightweight construction bones, probably already the common ancestor of both groups had produced this useful innovation.
At least three waves of migration to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs in South America have lived so far, the researchers follow that the ankles appeared there for the first time.
Thus, the three lines of development separated early and spread from South America over all parts of the earth, which at that time still formed a single land mass as Supercontinent Pangäa.
The fact is that together with Tawa hallae, the team found the remains of two other, not particularly closely related theropods.
The three cannot derive from a common immigrant ancestor, the researchers argue.
We believe that there were at least three waves of migration to North America, says Alan Turner from the American Museum of Natural History in New York, a co-author of the science study.
There are, of course, contradictions.
An even older species, Silesaurus, which belongs to a sister group of dinosaurs, lived in today's Poland, says Bonn's palaeontologist Martin Sander.
His opinion could be distorted, because in South America just a lot of primitive dinosaur fossils have been preserved, while on other continents there is hardly anything to be found.
As the dinosaurs managed to develop from a relatively rare sideline of the reptile strain to the ruling agricultural vertebrates of the earth’s Middle Ages, is still puzzling.
During the Trias, the dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, for example, with the ancestors of today's crocodiles and the saurs of flight and with numerous other axes.
Towards the end of the trias, the dinosaurs spread around the world and developed many new species, while the relationship on the border from the Trias to the Jura died.
Success Story Has Not Endured Forever
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There could have been a mass mortality that survived the dinosaurs by chance, but the other reptiles did not.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted so they could beat the competition out of the field.
The success story did not last forever.
150 million years later, a meteorite impact of a group of animals on flowering, which had also developed in the Trias and since then had a shadow: mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the Signatories are international.
Professor of University Toronto, University of Cambridge, University of Vienna or Berkeley in California.
Teachers from Naples include Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin and Bremen.
The police space of the occupied casino of Frankfurt Goethe University is beating waves worldwide.
278 professors and teachers from Goethe University, but also from universities throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America, solidify themselves with protesting students on campus Westend.
In a statement written in German and English, they "disapprove" them to use the police force ordered by the Bureau.
Uni-President Werner Müller-Estler had left the building occupied by students and lecturers in the educational strike empty last week because walls and works of art had been mutilated.
Five students were injured.
The property damage, judge the Signatories, did not justify "the violent resolution of self-organized courses of students and teachers by a police commission".
The space represents a "non-acceptable intervention" in the freedom of research and teaching.
The exclusive focus on vandalism is on "deligitimisation and criminalisation of protest" and diverts from the content.
The Bureau rejected the necessary discourse.
The lecturers demand the immediate recruitment of criminal persecution.
The majority of the invaders did not support damage to property, it says.
Protest legitimized
The youth of the Verdi trade union and the German trade union union union association also solidify with the students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of a growing concern for its own future, says Verdi-Landesjugenge Secretary Alexander Klein.
Hessen's Minister of Science Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) defended the action of Uni president and the police.
We are grateful to the university president.
Destruction and occupation are totally unacceptable means, she said in a current hour on Thursday in the Wiesbaden country day.
We have an understanding of the protest, but no understanding of vandalism, according to CDU countryman Peter Beuth.
Otherwise saw the opposition fractions SPD, Green and Left.
The CDU takes painted walls to the pretext to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (left).
Instead of dealing with the students' arguments and demands, one has cleared.
The left has submitted a request to the Minister of the Interior to report to the police.
New Silicon Valley
For many years it was considered a secret city, inaccessible to Western visitors.
Selenograd, one of ten districts of the capital Moscow, was a strictly guarded location for secret arms research in the Soviet Union.
Today, the municipality with its 216 000 inhabitants, 37 kilometres from Moscow's centre, is considered the "Russian Silicon Valley".
Significant research and production facilities for microelectronics and nanoelectronics are located here.
Since September 2008, representatives of Selenograd had established contacts with the Frankfurt science site Riedberg - with the university institutes and the companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Center (FIZ).
There were several mutual visits and on Wednesday, Selenograd and Riedberg signed a "protocol for closer cooperation" in Frankfurt.
The Moscow Vice Mayor Juri Rosljak and Prefect Anatoly Smirnov of Selenograd led the Russian delegation, signed for Frankfurt planning director Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises will travel to Selenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
It is about continuous scientific exchange.
But it is also about economic relations.
Companies of the FIZ will be able to take a foothold on the growing Russian market.
Conversely, Russian science companies want to get orders in Germany.
Selenograd is the seat of major Russian research institutes and companies.
These include the Moscow Institute of Electron Engineering, the major companies Sitronics and Rossijskaja Electronics.
The municipality was founded in 1958 as a so-called "socialist plan town" for armament research.
Selenograd (literally translated "Grünstadt") received its name from the wooded hill landscape in which the research institutions are embedded.
Stuttgarter Brakeklotz
The dimensions of Stuttgart 21 cannot be placed at all high enough.
For the project's supporters, it is simply about "the new heart of Europe".
S21 is much more than laying down a railway station, more than a monstrous construction project that will overthrow the city of the Baden-Württemberg capital of the state for a decade into cureless building chaos.
Stuttgart 21 was born from the spirit of the 1980s.
Railway stations with tracks that ended in the middle of the city then considered 19th century traffic fossils, which worked like the brakes of modern rail transport, as it once took a huge amount of time to revolving locomotives from the back to the front.
Get in, hold on, continue driving - that's how it should go.
And that's why the main stations should disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a transit station, which lies about half the trans-European rail magazine between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava - therefore the slogan of the "Herz Europa".
S21 is actually being addressed, although the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even very ambitious planners have recognized that in the Hessian and Bavarian capitals it is almost priceless to implement the deep settlement.
Headway stations, however, also have no access and exit problems since there are modern turning trains with motor vehicles and trucks at both ends.
Nevertheless: Stuttgart 21 next to the ICE new construction route to Ulm is now underway.
It has been enforced by national and local politicians.
Railways are involved, even because the risks of the biggest infrastructure project of the Republic of the taxpayers and not of the state group are involved.
The project can still be justified by urban planning.
New urban space is created, which - you think the computer-generated graphics of the planners - is equipped with a lot of greenery.
S21 is harmful to the rail transport system.
The transit station and the route extension are intended for the passenger traffic, which - typically 80s - is attributed to huge growth.
At that time there was not the competition of cheap flyers.
However, modern transport policy must first be to strengthen freight transport, as transport on rail is considerably more environmentally friendly than by road.
However, the new construction line is not suitable for freight trains because of fierce slopes.
Even more serious is that S21 indirectly attacks many other railway projects.
A total of about six billion euros are expected to be lost in the Swabian language.
That's the official number.
Experts consider ten to 15 billion to be realistic.
It stands firm in the next decade that money will be missing at other nodes and close points in the network.
A total of sixty major projects are on the list of the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the expansion of the 180-kilometre route through the Rhine Valley.
Since 1987, the track has been built at a slow pace.
It would be necessary to press the tube right here.
But S21 will act as a brake clot.
The Rhine Valley route becomes a bottleneck for international freight transport: in the heart of Europe.
Government examines judgment at the airport
In Wiesbaden's Landtag, the state government has left it open to review whether it will proceed against the judgment of the Hessische Verwaltungsgerichtshof (VGH) to the night flight ban.
The CDU/FDP coalition has commissioned experts to have the more than 400-page-wide VGH judgment examined legally, said Minister of Economic Affairs Dieter Posch (FDP).
On that day, the VGH in Kassel had stated in writing that in the event of the construction of the planned north-west runway at Frankfurt Airport, the country had to reorganise the night flight ban.
The approval of 17 flights between 23 and 5 o'clock, as provided for by the state government, should not be compatible with the legal protection of the population from night flight noise.
The coalition must decide by 4 January whether it is going against the judgment in revision.
The opposition criticised this delay and urged government representatives to refrain from a revision at the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
SPD fact-finding chief Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel called on CDU and FDP to return to their pre-election promises for a no-night flight ban. Otherwise, this should be considered as a "broken-up".
It's damn hard if you can keep your word, Green Chief Tarek Al-Wazir said in allusion to the FDP election slogan "We keep word".
Minister Posch rejected the accusation of Schäfer-Gümbel, the state government is trying to come to their night flights with "right-winging and trickery".
An accurate legal review takes their time.
The coalition does not want to operate on the basis of a "fast first impression".
We need legal compensation, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
Just as they represent the opposition, the statements of his group on the ban on night flights would never have been.
US banks pay back help
The crisis-shattered U.S. major banks strip off their state bonds.
On Wednesday, the Bank of America paid back the aid from the Tarp Bank Restitution Fund to a total of 45 billion dollars (about 30 billion euros) on a strike.
And the Citigroup also plans, according to a report from the US-Sender CNBC, to refund state aid.
The institutions want to get rid of the restrictions associated with the adoption of the money, such as the restriction on the payment of manager bonuses and the payment of high fees.
The Bank of America had been worried about changing bonds for over $19 billion of fresh money from investors.
She took the rest of the sum out of her own cash register, which was well filled, among other things, by savings sales.
Bank chief Kenneth Lewis thanked the US taxpayer explicitly on Wednesday evening: The money injection has helped over a very difficult time.
The money house had increased at the height of the financial crisis with the takeover of the investment bank Merrill Lynch.
The Citigroup also intends to obtain money on the capital market to exempt itself from its liabilities to the State.
On Thursday, the US Bank could announce an increase of about $20 billion in capital, reported CNBC on circles.
A Citigroup speaker didn't want to speak out.
In June Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had already paid back their aid.
Quick Choice
Then everything went faster than thought.
For two weeks after the ZDF Board of Administration had pushed Nikolaus Brender out of office, the station can present a successor.
Last night the panel wanted to vote on the personnel.
As a favorite, Peter Frey, head of the ZDF capital studio in Berlin.
However, there was no confirmation by the transmitter - officially in order not to preempt the procedure.
However, it is also expected that this proposal should not be passed on to the Board of Directors if ZDF's agents did not continue to harm Markus Schächter.
Frey, Schächters candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 members of the panel.
The result of the vote was not yet adopted at the end of the editorial procedure.
Two weeks ago, Schächter had failed in the Board of Directors with his proposal to extend the contract with Nikolaus Brender for another five years.
Only seven members spoke for Brender, seven voted against him. Brender’s election was a terrible defeat for chess, but an expected one.
For the majority of the Union in the Board of Directors had already signaled weeks before the election not to confirm Brender in office.
Hessian Prime Minister Roland Koch had organized the resistance to the editor-in-chief.
With the argument that under Brender the ZDF's messages had lost to switching quotas, he rejected another term of office of the highly respected editor-in-chief.
Until shortly before the election, there were protests in which the political influence on the ZDF was setup.
Last, even 35 state lawyers had interfered in the debate, which estimated the approach of cooks as unconstitutional.
It didn't use anything.
To the person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and romanticism.
After that, he worked at the Südwestfunk and the Frankfurter Rundschau.
In 1983 Frey moved to ZDF, initially to "today-journal".
Next stations: 1988 to 1990 personal editor; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 director and moderator of the "Morgenmagazine"; until 2001 head of ZDF's foreign policy; since then head of the ZDF Main City Studio.
After the election of Brender, which was elected by the Media Magazine industry magazine as the journalist of the year on Wednesday, the Greens announced a constitutional complaint.
Koch's opposite to the Board of Directors, the Rhineland-Palatinate Prime Minister Kurt Beck, said last week that the countries should change the ZDF State Treaty in such a way that staff proposals of the intensor cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
However, one extract of party politicians from the supervisory bodies of ZDF also ruled out Beck.
Brender's likely successor Peter Frey had recommended to the Board of Directors with a wise check move - by vehemently criticizing the panel immediately after the Brender election.
Thanks to this evidence of journalistic independence, he could be nominated for the position of the Chief Editor without any loss of face and also elected by the Board of Directors without suspecting that he would have a party leader in office.
In fact, Frey is credited to the left-wing liberals in the party.
Study Untwappled
Part of the success for the students: After a year of educational strike, the Ministers of Culture of the Countries finally agreed on Thursday: At a meeting of the seminar of the Minister of Education and University Rectors Conference, both sides agreed to want to improve the terms of study at Bachelors and Masters.
Students should be able to cope with their studies in the future.
In particular, they agreed to reduce the test loads: in principle, each study module should only complete with a single test.
The aim is also to review the work load of the students and to ensure "a realistic and acceptable measure".
Politics and universities also want to simplify the recognition of examinations between universities within and outside Germany.
Countries committed themselves to making joint structural targets for Bachelor's and Master's degree programmes more flexible.
There should also be no different country arrangements.
Less tests
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, Minister of Culture and University Rectors have carried the winged word of better studyability in the mouth.
Now it was filled with a concrete content for the first time.
The so-called Accreditation Council decided to reduce the number of tests in part dramatically: "Each module usually completes with only one examination," says a 30-page paper, which is intended to partially reorganise the admission of study programmes.
With the "clear reduction of the test load", the accreditation board chairman Reinhold Grimm said, "the process of a "resistance of the study was to be halted which significantly affected the studyability."
In addition, "study" is to be "the crucial criterion" in design in the future.
Modules such as content are "severe to review", whether "necessary submissions of students in the choice of the
Events" would be avoided.
Students would have "appropriate to receive spaces that allow and promote their own initiative".
The rules should apply to the admission of new and also to the review of existing courses.
They have to be "react-credited" every five years – which means, however, it will take up to 2015 until all the degree programmes have been reviewed.
Ten accreditation agencies are responsible for this throughout Germany and are subject to the Accreditation Board established by the countries.
In October, the Ministers of Culture had called on the countries to act so as to ensure that the substance fill was not too large and that the examination regime was not too strict.
In individual Länder, universities and universities have already agreed with the national ministries on appropriate measures.
As the only country in the past, Rheinland-Pfalz agreed to further develop the Bologna process.
The main aim of the funds is to set up colleges and to strengthen study advice as well as audit and foreign offices.
Countries and universities want to spend ten million euros on this.
At the beginning of 2010, the government intends to introduce a novel of the Higher Education Act into Parliament.
After this, only a single examination is to be required for the completion of a study model.
The aim is to make study design more flexible, to ensure recognition of credits at other universities and to facilitate access to the Master.
By the end of next year, all of the country's study programmes will be reviewed for their studyability.
Government and opposition had once again argued about the terms of study in the country on Thursday.
In addition to praise, however, there was also criticism of the decisions.
The Federal Board of Directors of the Juso High School Groups demanded that the design of education policy should no longer take place "under-closed doors" of the ministers and university rectors.
At the latest after the educational strike, students as affected should "speak a word".
The future academics received support from the president of the University Rectors Conference (HRK), Margret Winterjade: "We need the students' experience," she said on Thursday at a meeting with the Ministers of Culture, with which the HRK discussed a joint reform paper.
The trade union Education and Science (GEW) did not go far enough in the Bonn decisions: it requires a legal claim that will allow each graduate to have access to a further Master's degree program.
On the other hand, countries must ensure that enough Master's places of study are available for today's generation of Bachelor's students tomorrow with the best possible study conditions, according to GEW's board member Andreas Keller.
Countries have to recruit significantly more lecturers.
However, the Ministers of Culture did not express themselves to a more free access to the Master.
More than one footnote to Herta Müller
Entering into Germany and out is almost no control..." is the starting line of a poem by the poet Werner Söllner, in which this in disturbing language fetters addresses the arrival experience of a dissident who has won freedom but at the same time lost his speaking space.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 in the Romanian Banat, had worked as a German and English teacher in Bucharest and later as a lecturer in a children's book publisher before he moved to Frankfurt am Main in 1982.
Söllner was awarded several literary awards, in 1993 he held the legendary Frankfurt poetic lectures at Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been Head of the Hessian Literature Forum in the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
Last Tuesday, during a conference in Munich, he caused considerable extra-literary attention, which included "Deutsche Literatur in Romania in the mirror and Zerr Spiegel der Securitateacten" (German Literature in Romania).
Söllner is visibly insecure and has left a statement in which he obtained his cooperation as IM for the Romanian intelligence service, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmut Frauendorfer.
Together with some of the present, Söllner had received the German Language Prize in 1989.
The applications had begun sluggishly, first in 1971.
I'm, Söllner closed, "so someone who didn't resist enough intimidation attempts of the Securitate."
The poet Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
At the same time as the Nobel Prize ceremony for Herta Müller and its unprecedented literary discussion with the mechanisms of dictatorial rule, the literary scene and, in particular, the community of the German authors from Romania are shaken by a case that makes the backgrounds and defeats of a political system based on surveillance and constipation.
Werner Söllner is, as far as one can say after the previous state of knowledge, not only perpetrators, but also victims.
In his securitate act IM Walter played a role, said according to the confession of Söllner of literary scientist Michael Markel and referred to the positive influence for him by IM Walter.
He had "cut him out" in all the difficulty points for him at the time," says Markel.
It is a moral need for him to make this remark.
Söllner's statement was unexpected in the form and in front of this audience, but the confession of a former dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian intelligence service is not surprising.
Germany had been a cozy reserve for Securitate Spitzel, had already written Herta Müller in July after reading her own file, 914 pages.
The persons concerned, one may suspect, are speculated and in some cases also knew which name was hidden behind the cover name Sorin, Voicu and also Walter.
Unlike the now highly procedural-secured view of the Stasi-acts in this country, dealing with the legacys of the Securitate surveillance is still very diffuse.
A systematic education has been suppressed and hindered in recent years.
A related National Council for the Improvement of Securitate Acts (CNSAS) was founded only in 1999 but the issue of the files has since been rather slowing.
Only since 2005 has there been a law governing the administration of the files.
After the announcement of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller, the influence of former securitate members in Romania is still very large, an interview was received by an earlier secretary from Temesvar, who had given the prize.
She's got a psychosis, and after all, she's only been questioned once.
Infammy of power meant being able to express itself in the form of freedom of expression.
Certainly, the case of Söllner, as so often in connection with hidden debt, is bound up with inevitable questions.
Why is it only now? Who was hurt? The prudent reaction of those listening to Söllner’s confession suggests that the continuation of this chapter will be determined more by a desire of knowledge than by a debt and shame.
On the recovery of the Herta Müller factory, which received the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a footnote.
Saturation Supplement Champions League
It seemed as if there was just a horsedressed outsider from a very nice Christmas party on which a sports article manufacturer had distributed Goodies, when the new VfB trainer Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange plastic bag of the equipmenter, rose to a traditional C-class a quarter of an hour after midnight.
The man with the distinctive glamour was able to chafise himself because of the strange city.
Otherwise he could have driven himself - alcohol was not at play after all, and drunk with luck the 55-year-old was just as little.
It's been a pleasant evening, but tomorrow's work will go on.
Or just let's go.
In the words of the Swiss pledged only three days earlier: "We have reached the eighth finale", that is, in the Champions League thanks to the 3-1 success against Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we must not let ourselves be blinded by the success: it will be a brutal hard fight against the descent."
The "more important task" will be on Sunday.
Then it is in Mainz to repeat the royal classes performance in the daily league.
And to put off the flaws after the fast three gates by Marica (5th), Träsch (8th) and Pogrebnyak (1st).
Discharge
The eighth finale of the Champions League (Hinspiele 16/17. + 23/24 February/ Rückspiele 9/10. + 16/17 March) will be released in Nyon on 18 December.
Therefore, the joy over the brilliant unity of the Babbel successor remained.
Not only the supposed healer, who had given the unsecured Stuttgart professionals confidence, willingness to use and delight in playing in the short period.
I went to the players and told them to look at their strengths, and I stopped them from being more courageous, explained soul clutterer Gross the so easy-sounding success recipe, which under Therapeut Babbel had no more effect.
He sparked a certain magic, admitted Babbel advocate Jens Lehmann, "when a new impulse comes in football, sometimes things happen that you would not have thought possible."
And Sami Khedira, who, thanks to his dynamics, was the best player in the place after weeks of injury, tried to describe the recorded "phenomen" with the proverbial "fresh wind" and the workings of the new superior: "He is a man who requires intervention and discipline.
That's what we need in the current situation."
Under Babbel, this had obviously been lacking.
The VfB Stuttgart is not yet above the mountain, warns Sports Board Horst Heldt
But the VfB Stuttgart needs mostly constanz.
Like Gross, players and managers guarded against over-valuing the victory against a weakened and completely over-compulsory defense of Romanian guests.
They also won in Glasgow before the evil awakening came to Khedira four days later in Leverkusen at 0:4.
And sports director Horst Heldt warned that although a seasonal target has been achieved, the other one is still in a distance.
We're not over the mountain yet.
The fact that Herodt was not to date on his 40th birthday even after the first home victory in three months was due to the events of the weekend, which in the form of a TV interview by Torhütler Jens Lehmann, broadcast immediately before the start of the game.
There are decisions that others make and not the Jens, hero the harsh critique Lehmanns.
He had shown a lack of leadership to the Board of Directors and had decided to change the trainers on pressure from publishing fans.
Also that his day off had been deleted after games, Lehmann was valued as a sign of lack of sovereignty and disfavor.
Lehmann's statements were "influenced by pure egoism", hero returned and announced consequences for the final man.
They're probably no longer going to be friends for life, the two forty years old.
After all, they agreed with everyone else that without the preliminary work by the replaced team of trainers, the playful and combative strong idea would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants had "a large share of the success," said Heldt and Lehmann unisono - and the man also agreed with the plastic bag.
WM-Fight in Heavy Weight
Hot Duell in Bern: Time and again challenger Kevin Johnson World Champion Vitali Klitschko provoked with words and gestures.
But after twelve hard rounds, the Ukrainian defended its heavyweight title after version of the WBC.
The decision of the referees was unanimous.
Hamburg - Vitali Klitschko remains box world champion in weight.
38-year-old Champion, after version of the WBC, defeated American Kevin Johnson unanimously on Saturday in Bern after points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klitschko it was the third successful title defense after his comeback in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian was already twice the world champion of WBO and WBC associations.
Unfortunately, the K.o., which everyone expected, did not work out.
Klitschko built his balance sheet on 39 wins in 41 professional fights, and twice had to be beaten due to injuries.
In the 24th battle, Johnson had to take the first defeat.
Before about 17,000 spectators in the Bernese Arena, the 2.02-meter-large Klitschko wanted to dictate the fight with his left hand.
The 11 centimetre smaller Johnson, who had announced the end of the Klitschko era before the duel, did, however, repeatedly escape the blows of the world champion, so Klitschko could not reach the goal of his dangerous rights.
Overall, the passive Johnson did too little for a challenger and only tried to get over the rounds.
Although he provoked Klitschko with words and gestures, his beatings only rarely met the world champion.
After all, he is only the second boxer after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who went with Klitschko over the full distance of twelve rounds.
The challenger had provided some vortex before the fight in the Swiss capital.
He insulted Klitschko as "a ugly zombie" who "can't do anything right".
When weighing, on Friday, the champion was able to provoke Johnson to push the sunglasses off the nose, "to see his eyes."
Fourth victory after Klitschkos Comeback
Klitschko was also victorious in his fourth fight after his comeback on October 11, 2008.
After almost four years of absence, he had beaten Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin at the time, and he had to recover "his" WBC belt, which he had previously left unarmed.
This year, he then forced Juan Carlos Gomez from Cuba and Chris Arreola from the USA in September.
In this fight, I only got one stroke and I am physically very good in form, had Klitschko founded the quick return to the ring.
His dream, however, remains the union of all four important titles in the family.
Brother Vladimir is world champion of WBO and IBF associations.
But the belt of the WBA is worn by the British David Haye, after having been able to dethron the 2,13-metre-large Nikolai Walujev in November.
Haye had previously canceled a struggle against Vitali Klitschko planned for September.
It is said that his PhD company is already planning the fight against Klitschko at the Wembley Stadium in London.
Case Kunduz
Frontal attack from the opposition: Green faction chief Jürgen Trittin called Guttenberg a liar because of false information about the Kunduz affair.
SPD and Left demand Enlightenment from the chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin - Following the recent findings on Kunduz's air raid, the opposition Minister of Defense Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) underwent a conscious deception.
The Minister said "knowably the untruth" to the deadly bombardment on two September tank trains, Green-Group chief Jürgen Trittin said on Saturday in the ARD news broadcast "Day Show".
It's called a country-by-country: He lied.
The order for killing had been issued in disregard of the rules of the International Security Force for Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the substance of the report that NATO had read by Mr Guttenberg, said Trittin.
On Friday, it became known that the attack was not only about destroying the kidnapped trucks, but also about killing two Taliban leaders.
In the US air attack requested by the German Kunduz commander Colonel Klein, up to 142 people were killed or injured, according to the Nato investigation report.
On Saturday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) asked Green, SPD and Left to express themselves immediately before the Bundestag and to clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Mrs Merkel has to clarify whether a strategy of targeted killing is part of the government's Afghanistan policy - and whether the Chancellor's Office, the Federal Government and the intelligence service have approved this new strategy, Jürgen Trittin and Grünen-Kolegin Renate Künast demanded.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm decidedly rejected the criticism.
The Chancellor's Office did not influence concrete operations of the Bundeswehr in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, there were also doubts about the presentation of the Ministry of the backgrounds of the release of General Inspector Wolfgang Schneiderhan and State Secretary Peter Wichert.
According to SPIEGEL, the two Guttenberg have correctly and fully informed about the backgrounds of the tank truck attack.
Officially, it was said that they had denied the existence of the NATO reports and denied the Minister sensitive details.
However, from the point of view of the two senior officials, they stated that they had even pointed out several reports to the Ministry of Defense, including a two-page document by the commander Klein and a field hunter report.
Wichert is now supposed to have asked for clarification of the facts in a letter, reports the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung".
He has not received an answer so far, it says.
On Saturday, the Ministry did not answer the allegations and pointed out that this would be clarified in the Bundestag's investigative committee, which is planning to establish itself on Wednesday.
Dream Worlds
Some see images and hear voices that others do not see or hear in a awake state.
Not only in psychiatric diseases and drug noise, the boundaries between imagination and reality are fading.
As long as it happens in sleep, everything's okay.
If we are in our dark rooms with our closed eyes, we can give ourselves unhindered the wildest ideas and imaginations.
Whoever, however, experiences traumatic conditions in the wake, sees and hears things that others do not see or hear, in the modern Western world is usually considered crazy or drug addicted, at least as a special.
However, such images and voices are not only caused by mental illness or drug noise.
Debt has our imagination: the same neural processes that enable us to design houses, paint pictures or write novels, sometimes make sure that the boundaries between dream, madness and reality float.
Dream-like changes in awow consciousness can occur in the most diverse forms, in the best case we call them visions, in the worst case of a fool.
Even if triggering and effect may differ, the visions of mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the New Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, Shamanic rapture, psychosis and hallucinations can be traced to similar processes.
Hallucinations or misconceptions arise when the balance of the brain's neural messenger substances - first and foremost dopamine, noradrenalin, serotonin and acetylcholine - is disrupted and the interaction of various brain parts is disturbed.
Complex hallucinations and crazy thoughts occur very often during schizophrenic psychosis.
The gravity has no power over him anymore
The connection of madness and dream has occupied philosophers and physicians since ancient times.
Aristotle described hallucinations as a form of a dream in a awake state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, found in 1861 a "great similarity of the error with dream states", for Sigmund Freud the dream was "a psychosis, with all inconsistencies, madnesss, sensory disappointments of such".
It is autumn 2001 when Henning T. turns into a comic figure.
His body is two-dimensional and quietz-colored.
The gravity has no power over him anymore, he floats on the ceiling.
He's feeling a third.
Behind him winged devils with red, distorted fractures, tenacious.
They hunt him, kick him with heavy, flaming boots, throw him against the walls, he feels the pain all over the body.
Loud, evil voices drink from walls and radio.
He can't bear them anymore, the voices that insult him and insult him.
Henning T. pulls two cables out of the stereo system, knocks them into a loop and sticks them to a hook on the ceiling.
He rises on a speaker and puts his blade around the neck.
Jumps.
The blade is loosening.
That's supposed to be a teaching to you, yell the voices in drum-fisting choir, "go to the clinic and let yourself be healed!"
Today, Hening T. is 40 years old, he has experienced six acute psychosis, the last one is 2 years back, the first almost 20 years.
It was triggered by LSD.
His diagnosis is schizophrenic paranoid psychosis, and also manic-depressive, he takes medications, against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, he has been married for three years.
In the psychosis, I have experienced worst fear and deepest despair, he says.
The trick images are cruel reality
About one percent of the population suffers from schizophrenia at least once in life, in psychiatric clinics it is treated as the second most common disease after depression.
In an acute schizophrenic psychosis, affected people can usually no longer distinguish between the inner and external world, they come into an overly upright state that can lead to hallucinations, size, relationship or persecution.
Voice listening is particularly common - voices that command, comment or dialogue.
Also optical hallucinations are not rare.
The affected person can no longer separate important from unimportant, the brain can no longer filter out disturbing signals, the consciousness is flooded by impressions.
Like the dream, the psychosis also opens the locks for a flood of ideas and imaginations, the deeper layers of consciousness emerge.
The perception of reality in the psychosis is subject-centred, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, Senior Doctor of the Hospital for General Psychiatry at Heidelberg University Hospital.
The schizophrene is located in the center of the event, everything has a meaning directed to it.
At the same time, he gets into a passive role, he is overwhelmed, as in the dream, by the events and cannot actively shape them.
Thus, schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
A reality settlement is usually not possible to them, the trick images are cruel reality, the awakening is excluded.
Once in a lifetime a hallucination has been experienced
Unlike in the dream, Fuchs says, "but in principle the sensual and spatial structure of reality that is perceived in the psychosis remains."
The crazy thoughts and hallucinations are in reality, the alienation of experience takes place within the real framework.
Why exactly our brain beats caprioles, researchers are still baffling puzzles.
Exceptional circumstances may cause any human being to lose reality in the short term, says Fuchs.
But not everyone will develop a psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but twin studies have shown that genes are not alone determining factors.
Researchers assume that there is minimal brain damage for those affected.
We suspect that the neuronal maturation of the brain is disturbed at an early stage of development, for example, by a viral disease of the mother during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But it remains a mystery as to how the disorder of the neural system happens, which, moreover, initially does not manifest itself for many years at all.
Environmental influences also play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can trigger a psychosis when the disposition is present.
Also, hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychosis, as they intervene in the transmitter system.
When our brain runs hot
The crazy one is, psychologists suffer from their hallucinations and swallow expensive drugs to get rid of them, others spend money on drugs to get which, says Lübeck's psychology professor Erich Kass.
Whether trust images are considered pleasant or unpleasant is often just a matter of the point of view.
Boxes has been collecting reports on hallucinations and miscarriages for ten years, and last year he evaluated his results in the book "The False World in Our Head".
Although hallucinations belong to the typical side effects of psychosis, they are also of surprisingly many other diseases.
In addition to psychological disorders such as borderline or depression, these include diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer's and skull brain traumata.
Surprisingly, under certain conditions, the brain of healthy people is hallucinated.
Hallucinations, such as box, are composed of memory contents that are normally held back.
They arise when brain areas in which sensory perceptions are processed are overactive or too little inhibited; if our brain runs hot or even if stimulation is missing.
Drugs can cause this condition as much as brain damage or psychosis.
But it is also a thrill, stress, pangs of love or other mental state of emergency.
In recent studies, up to a third of respondents reported having experienced hallucination at least once in life.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. is 16 years old, living in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and visiting the gymnasium.
A normal girl, actually.
If there were not the pictures and voices.
In the break it may happen that a sluggish boy with long, dark hair addresses it.
When it answers, the fellow students look at it surprisedly - nobody else sees or hears this boy.
They think the shy girl is a fucking daydreamer, but Sarah K. doesn't dream, she knows.
She's awake, she hears and sees this boy, just as she hears and sees the girl in the bank next to her.
She can even feel his presence, at least for moments.
A pleasant feeling is that she likes the boy.
Am I crazy?, she sometimes asks.
But she knows that this boy and the other trick images are not real and disappear again.
At night the apparitions are mostly frightening
Often the dirty images are also a burden.
When she sits in the classroom, she sometimes cannot follow the teaching substance because the teacher in her eyes and ears just introduces a new fellow student, while explaining for all other hearing and visible at the table mathematical equations.
At night the apparitions are mostly frightening.
When she waits for sleep in her dark room, which comes much too rare and much too late, she often cannot distinguish whether she is awake or already dreams whether the pictures she sees, the fractures or the girl with the bleeding cuts on the arms and legs, appear in front of her open or closed eyes.
Leave me alone, she yells at the figures.
Parents and friends don't tell them anything, they think they're crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
She passed the Abitur last year and lives with her boyfriend.
A year ago the hallucinations stopped.
Since she's been in contact with the psychologist box on the Internet, she knows that she's not crazy.
Wahn is also a work of art from despair
If a person is socially isolated or suffers from friction, he is likely to have hallucinations after a while, says box.
I suspect that the brain will be under-worked and will make it his own entertainment.
Sarah K., a single child, was afraid of other children when she was a little girl, often playing alone.
Her hallucinations began when she was 13 years old when she learned that the man she was called father since she could think was not her physical father.
Since the same brain areas are active in visual and acoustic hallucinations, which also process real impressions and noises, it is difficult for those affected like Sarah K. to distinguish trust images and reality. "Every experience," says Box, "is taking place in the brain, reality is falling apart there.
Hallucinations are also images that cause the brain to develop, so they seem so real."
Also nocturnal dream pictures treat box as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from those of acute psychosis.
In contrast to schizophrenia, psychologically healthy people are able to recognize their trust images as erroneous.
Box therefore advises its patients to also value hallucinations as a special ability.
The boundary between dream and hallucination
Unfortunately, in our too very conscious world, imaginary experience is mostly pathological, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor in Heidelberg and professor of psychiatry and psychotherapy at the Florence-Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a severe, painful disease, but it also carries positive, creative - crazy is also a work of art from despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has researched the so-called oneiroide experience form, a special form of traumatically changed watch consciousness.
Oneiroides are highly complex, detailed Quasi dreams, which the person who is alive considers to be real and which he cannot differ from the state of alertness even in the aftertaste.
The oneiroid state of consciousness is created in trauma or disease-related extreme situations, for example in polyradiculitis patients who experience motor paralysis in full consciousness.
When a person is threatened with self- and world loss, for example, by sustained, complete inability to move, he replaces the life-threatening real situation with a unique, imaginary world that is decoupled from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
A kind of border state between dream and hallucination.
Since the handling of a situation in reality is not possible, a change of the world takes place, but the real situation is represented in the imagination.
An intense form of sense-building and meaning in a situation that in itself unbearable, which allows us humans to develop their own ability to design, does not perish in nothing of the loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memory
The Zurich art historian Peter Cornelius Clausen also describes his oneiroid experiences in his book "Heart Change" as a rescue action of the soul.
He is 49 years old when his consciousness, following a heart valve surgery with subsequent heart transplant, travels for days, while his body is sentenced to motionlessness in the intensive care unit.
Claussen dives into a self-created world, visits foreign times and places: he experiences himself as a bedridden, old man, aboard a train anatorium, a robot watches over his health.
In the early Middle Ages, he lives among nobles who produce drugs from blood.
Being dragged by a Greek on the motorcycle in his homeland, he surfs with his hospital bed in the front of the Alps and meets a Korean mafioso.
He goes completely into the imaginary event, everything is real, even later in memory.
These inner journeys are fundamentally different for Claussen from any dream.
Dream is another state, he describes his experience.
In contrast, the memories from mental travels are clear to me even after years and in minor details.
Clearer and more intense even than truly experienced.
The intensity of this experience spreads the horizon of our other life-life experiences, says Psychiatr Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, oneiroids, psychosis, hallucinations and drug noise show how fragile our inner images of external reality are also in guard.
Any change in the state of consciousness, the psychologist box summarizes, "can lead to a distortion of what we call reality."
An experience that can also be enriching.
The snowfall can come
Burda
Children should take over the publisher at the age of 27
The new publishing director Kallen is a temporary solution: Hubert Burda wants to put his company in the hands of his two children in the long term, he said to SPIEGEL.
The holding is expected to belong to 100 percent of the family in the future.
Hamburg - Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children in the long term.
Both children inherit at the age of 27 and have the firm desire to enter the company, the 69-year-old told the SPIEGEL.
The details of this have been carefully regulated.
The question whether they are active in the company arises only after that.
The question of whether they are in a position to do so.
You can't introduce 7500 employees to their children if they are not adequately qualified.
This kills the children and the company.
Burda announced on Thursday that he was withdrawing from the Chairmanship of the Board from January and appointed Paul-Bernhard Kallen as his successor.
The 52-year-old Kallen has been a member of the board of Burda since 1999.
First, he was responsible for technology.
Later on, the Treasury division was responsible for corporate assets, and after the retirement of Jürgen Todenhofer, the responsibility for direct marketing, foreign trade, printing and finance.
For the first time, no member of the family is at the top of the publishing house.
Burda's children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who is now 42 years old, died a few years ago.
The designation of Kallen also serves to bridge "10, 15 years", says Burda.
The holding should also belong to 100 percent of the family in the future, said Burda.
In view of the Schickedanz and Schaeffler cases, Burda said that family companies are not sure about the downfall: "It was always families that were infected by a capital addiction that completely speculated and thought they could get up to the very big player.
My strategy was never.
He had "non-World Power Dreams," says Burda.
I don't see myself as the political preceptor of this country, as it was Springer, and I don't want to play with 'Time' in the World League, these stores have become too big.
Perfect Beauty
Everything you want in terms of beauty and well-being is available to you now.
At least this is what El Corte Inglés has done, which recently opened a shop with an area of more than 1000 m2 in the shopping mall in Callao, Madrid, where everything is just about body care.
In the wellness area, which is on the eighth floor, one can find among other well-known companies such as Hedonai, who provide for dehairing with lasers; Spxión, with spaces for relaxation and beauty treatments; the hairdressers Luis & Tachi, Marina d'Or with a fitness studio or L'Occitane with their natural cosmetics.
However, there is also a food department that highlights her tea house with more than 130 different teas.
Enjoy a relaxing massage together with your partner while at the same time having a fantastic view of the capital, or for two hours rent the relax area to put your own "beauty party" on the legs with eight girlfriends and then relax in the hot tub or with massages and a glass of champagne, these are just a few of the many possibilities that Spixión offers.
The total area is 250 m2, which is divided into 12 rooms for the latest facial and body treatments as well as hydrotherapy.
For example, for cavitation in the fight against cellulitis or with vibrating surfaces.
The fitness studio also has this kind of equipment, besides there are also virtual trainers who take care of the training units of the customers and thus offer them a completely personal training.
You start a training unit with entering a personal password on a touch screen that is opposite the devices.
After that, different videos show you how to do your training sessions properly.
The head of the gym ensures that 15 minutes (including warming up and stretching exercises) are fully sufficient to train the body muscles.
And if you still want to pass the hairdressing salon after training your body, Luis & Tachi has a room in which treatments for regaining the hair's beauty, shine and health are offered for your hair in a personalized way.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to be the key words for this wellness area in the middle of the city, which is always open from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. in the evening 365 days a year.
The Different Decolletés
Christmas is getting closer and closer and that is why it is a good opportunity to copy the appearance of the stars and bring their fixed clothes into our wardrobe.
The form of the decolleté, which is very important for highlighting the silhouette, is one of the points that needs to be considered.
Here are some proposals.
The singer Fergie has chosen an exuberant and very complex decolleté, which can only be discouraged.
Endesa and Barcelona by electric car
The Endesa electricity company, together with the city of Barcelona, has created the "LIVE office".
This is a project for the development and promotion of the electric car in the Catalan capital.
The "LIVE office" (Logistics for the introduction of the electric car) will define and coordinate the road map for the introduction of the electric car in the city, coordinating agreements on mobility by managing, coordinating, subsidizing, etc.
On the other hand, the project M.E.LE is to be developed to promote the electric car and to sum up opinions and actions of the areas involved.
This is an attempt to push forward the means of transport of the future.
3 "electric cities"
However, Barcelona is not the only city involved in the introduction of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville are also participating in this project.
These are the three cities selected by the government in the project ÁLE to speed up the introduction of the electric car.
The electricity company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Government of Catalonia (la Generalitat).
This framework agreement aims to promote the activities of research and technological development in the autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These activities are, among other things, related to energy and, in particular, to its performance.
However, it is by no means the only initiative at which Endessa participates with regard to the promotion of the electric car.
The company participates in standardisation groups across Europe and maintains a number of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees "a horizon of peace" for the automotive sector
The president of the government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, prophesies of the Spanish automotive industry, which is the country's largest exporter, "a horizon of rest".
In the presentation of the 2009 economic report by the president of the government, Zapatero recalled once again the measures that the government has launched to support the automotive sector during the government year.
"Without the plan on the competitiveness of the car industry, we would today have a panorama of neglect and closure of some of our main production plants," said the president.
"Thanks to this plan and the willingness of the automotive manufacturers to produce in Spain in a very competitive industry, we can see a quiet horizon for the success of this industry, which is our largest export industry," he added.
He also recalled that the competitiveness plan, which is part of the overall plan for the automotive industry (PIA), has provided 800 million euros for projects from 19 vehicle manufacturers and 137 suppliers, which in turn provided investments of more than 3 billion euros.
The Head of Government stated that these investments are intended both for the development of new models and for the modernisation of existing products and processes.
Zapatero also underlined the government's measures to stimulate demand, in line with the 2000E plan, which is to be applied in cooperation with the Autonomous Communities and car manufacturers.
According to the head of government , this plan allows for an average reduction of emissions of new vehicles sold on the Spanish market by 6%, which in turn led to a "strong increase" in approvals which rose by "40 percent" in November.

Mazda3 i-Stop: Environmentally sustainable sportiness
Mazda wants to prove that sport is quite compatible with the protection of the environment.
For this reason, Mazda recently introduced the automatic stop and drive system of the engine, which is called i-stop, to the model Mazda3, a device which, at the moment, is only available for the 2.0 petrol engine with 150 hp.
This second generation of the Mazdas 3 stands out in the overall picture through its good grades.
The final processing, the execution of the vehicle, the comfort, its street behavior, the mechanics, the i-stop system ...
All these aspects are "very good" at the new Mazda3.
Starting from the front seats you can see that the front seats offer excellent ergonomics and good hold.
In addition, the game of the steering wheel is excellent.
When considering the unit, which consists of the instrument board and the dashboard board, it can be noted that Mazda, with a variety of buttons and switches, is located in the striking colours red and blue, on the same line as the Japanese trend towards a futuristic interior design.
This style partly reminds us of the style of Honda Civic.
Therefore, it can be said that both the Mazda 3, and the Civic, both Japanese models, are removed from the soberness of German cars, especially from the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to exceed.
The passenger space of these two Japanese compact cars offers more than ever the appropriate comfort so that four adults can easily drive by car.
All of this comes with a large and clearly shaped trunk.
The stop and drive system is now only available for the 2-liter petrol engine with 150 hp and a 6-speed switch.
This engine is a real pleasure. It stands out by its subtleity, its quiet sound, its performance and its low consumption.
And all those who do not drive many kilometers a year should consider this i-stop with petrol engine due to its great comfort in gear switching and its low consumption, even though at Mazda above all the diesel models are the best sold.
With regard to the equipment, the so-called sportive model chosen for the test drive is a special feature, as it has a significantly larger number of elements from the series equipment.
From the series equipment, especially the RVM assistant for the lane change (RVM) stands out, thus removing the dead angle, as well as the controls for the traction and stability, the speed control, the light-sensitive inside mirror, the on-board computer with a large screen, the sensors for parking, an independent air conditioning, rain and light sensors, Bluetooth and audio bluetooth as well as the chromed 17-inch waves.
Moreover, this version also includes, as if it weren't yet enough of equipment, the Premium package, which includes additional 1,500 euros: in addition to additional elements, especially the capable Bixenon headlights and the sound system BOSE with CD loader.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars in its class.
It is particularly outstanding in terms of the materials used, due to its behaviour and variety of equipment.
Besides, those who don't lay down many kilometers a year can also buy the i-stop version, which is only available with a 2.0 petrol engine with 150 hp.
The only negative thing about this model is its slightly high price, which is between 21.770 Euro for the luxury model and 23.270 Euro for the trial model Sportive.
In return to this high price, however, the Mazda3 offers us every day to the new highest driving pass.
A premiere with a lot of glamour
L. A. rolls out the red Teppik of sensuality for Penélope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
At the premiere of "Nine", the stars, dressed in models that look just as elegant as sexy, shined more than ever.(Photos: Gtresonline).
Our "Pe", as elegant as always, chose a dark "Lady" dress.
FonPeek's promises
Peek is too limited, a device with which you can only read its emails, without having a chance to see certain attachments or to surf through the Internet.
It enjoyed its five minutes fame when it chose Time magazine as one of the products of the year.
It is rather unlikely to see it on the road, but the idea in itself is nevertheless especially of interest to young people.
Unlike the smartphones, Peek costs very little and has a very cheap flatrate, for example only half of the price of the flatrate of an iPhone.
After the company has seen the success with it, it has launched two new devices: one that is only intended for Twitter, the other with a lifelong free service for data, quite unlike the peek, in which one has to pay a six times higher price.
Fonpeek, presented at the Le Web event yesterday, is the European version of this invention and thus its third version.
It has the same limits, like its American counterpart, however, has a surprise prepared.
The monthly maintenance price for the telephone, about 12 euros a month, includes roaming for the whole of Europe.
Those who travel around the world with a smartphone already know what it means to refrain from all the data in order to read their emails once you have crossed the country border or if you are desperately looking for a café with WIFI (or a connection with Fon).
The idea of flatrate roaming is incredibly seductive and should actually have been possible for a long time.
It is true that some telephone providers already offer special contracts and prices for stays abroad, but my experience is that you already need a doctoral title in physics and a good glasses to read all the small prints.
The repeated criticism on the part of the European Commission regarding affordable roaming tariffs for all Europe was almost always ignored.
Outside of your own country, you are always afraid to read your emails and that is right.
That a small device such as FonPeek (which is always surprising that it has the name Fon, although it does not have a WIFI/WLAN) can offer this kind of tariff, means that telephone providers need to think slowly, but safely, and start to consider different ways of using their data network.
Kindle is another good example for this, and its prices include downloading books and further requests on the Internet.
Without vets and no hooks.
It is an Internet-enabled device and it is only paid once for it, that is, when buying, and not month after month.
And that's exactly what I expect from FonPeek one day, a purchase option with lifelong Internet access as the peek already offers in the USA.
And that's not because I want to buy it.
I read my emails by phone, thank you.
But I expect this because I believe it would be a more appropriate model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
Michelle's fetish colour
Yellow is undoubtedly the favourite color of the American First Lady.
She appeared in a dress and a coat of this color when Barack Obama took office as President of the United States and chose the same color again to accompany him with his second most important moment in his life: the award of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama wore very similar models on both occasions: especially that it was almost the same color - a shiny green yellow -, the clothes consisted of three parts - dress, jacket and coat made of the same fabric, and they wore a slightly large embroidered or necklace.
It even goes so far that at first sight it seemed that the First Lady of the United States wanted to follow the model of the Princess of Asturias and had decided to wear the same dress on more than just one occasion.
However, the two dresses differ very much in the fabric from which they are made.
At the time of the introduction of the office, she wore a dress of lace and a patterned velvet in Oslo.
The accessories were also different: at the first time green shoes with half-high heels and on the second time a similar model, but gold-coloured.
The hair was also different every time: on this occasion, the hair was put up as a hair wreath, while on the previous one she wore the hair open.
75% of women in work have had problems at work because of their motherhood
Discrimination in work has increased in recent years, especially among younger women who want children.
This results from the study "Fruitability and career of women in Spain" carried out by CSIC in cooperation with the Institute for Women.
The survey of 9.737 women aged 15 to 75 leaves no doubt about this: 75% of women in the labour market see their career prospects limited because of their motherhood.
The study reveals that there are wide differences in the decision to establish a family and there are the number of children depending on whether the women work or not, and if so, what kind of profession they pursue.
Those of them who do no other work outside the house only work half-days or have no fixed employment contract are more likely to be mothers and have more children.
In contrast, women move with a fixed job, especially in the public sector, the establishment of a family and motherhood and therefore have fewer children.
"The women in the age group between 35 and 49 years of age with a fixed position receive their first child on average only 3.7 years after moving together, a number that increases to 4.1 years for women with fixed employment who have used longer to achieve this and who have brought her together and the first child realized much later.
Moreover, the type of work also has a major influence on motherhood, although less than the calendar with regard to conception," explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that must be taken into account in the age of women in marriage and in the first child.
According to the survey, age at the time of marriage and the first child is the higher, the higher the level of education.
This difference could also be established between women of the same age.
For example, the women in the group were between 35 and 49 years of age, depending on whether they had only the primary school degree or a higher education, on average with 25.1 or 32.1 for the first time mother.
In addition, there is another difference between women depending on their level of education.
While the women are already married before their first permanent position and are given their first child, with a middle or high degree of education, the women are doing exactly different and are looking for a permanent position and then getting married and then getting their first child, Delgado finds out.
Diane Kruger is also worth it
L'Oréal Paris recently added a new name to his well-beyond list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From the coming year the German actress will be the image of various products of the brand and also say the well-known advertisement "Because you are worth it".
The main actor from "Joyeux Noël", one of the most elegant actors at international level, will become another famous sign like Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before her were the last to join this exclusive club the actress Evangeline Lilly ("Lost") and Frida Pinto ("Slumdog Millonaire").
For men, the cosmetics company also has only exceptional ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey (" Grey's Anatomy") and Matthew Fox (co-playmate of Evangeline in "Lost").
The award ceremony of the British fashion industry
The British have an important word to say in the fashion world.
Their highest representatives - fashion designers and models, both yesterday and today - met at the annual award ceremony held in London at the Royal Court of Justice.
On this occasion they were all published.
The ex-model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, who was elected the best model this year.
The poker game by Manuel Vicent
Manuel Vicent presents in "Poker der Asse" (Alfaguara, images by Fernando Vicente) to the three-dimensional X-ray images of writers who accompanied him in his literary life (and, in some cases, in real life).
He does not use a predictable and frightening genre (a short-term biography, life and work), but is looking for a similarity to the glowing heart of the Creator.
The journey is exciting and vicent does not save from horrors or enlightenments.
Besides that this book is a delicious reading pleasure, it is also a moving invitation to read and read again and again.
Here are some excerpts from the book.
About Albert Camus: "When reading his pages, I found out that the Mediterranean is not a sea, but rather a spiritual, almost sensual impulse, just as I have always felt it without having found words for it: the joy in contrast to the unhealing destiny, the morals without guilt and the innocence without any god".
About Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, allegorical Christian, he wrote about what he had in the blood, not in his mind, between powerlessness and ignorance, with an overwhelming poetic humor, without any sense, such as the knife blades that had almost killed him."
About Graham Greene: "Our husband was joined by this woman with a passion that lasted for thirteen years in her flesh, in which the emotions of adultery united with the pleasure of repentance, a spiritual privilege that consisted of coming to heaven on the way of destruction."
About James Joyce: "The Odyssey" was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the 8000 summits in global literature, one has to climb up the north wall, on the wall, where the best climbers are always trying on the new one."
About William Faulkner: "He was a strange caustic.
He sometimes said about himself that he was the heir of the county's estate, and again he said that he was the son of a black and a crocodile.
Both dreams bore witness to a certain gröbé."
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: This writer recorded the mad cry, which was cast out from a bridge by that personality from Munich, so that his echo sounded deep into the night of the 20th century in his literary way. This he made on a journey on which he fled himself and with a speech full of violence appealed to the worms the afterworld.
About Dorothy Parker: "One day they knelt down and prayed: my dear God, I ask you to do everything in your power, so that I may finally stop writing like a woman."
About Joseph Conrad: "On his grave these verses of Spencer are engraved: 'Sleep after the effort,/ after the thunderstorm of the port,/ the rest after the war,/ after a full life you find pleasure in death."
About Virginia Wolf: "In her luggage she also had her depressions.
The husband took it with complete normality when she told him that Eduard VII was spying on them between the azaleas or singing the birds in Greek.
There is no other case known where the man was so patient and in love with a neurotic whose literary talent was still far grander than her madness."
About Pío Baroja: "What else did Martín Santos do, as if trying to get Joyce into Baroja?
What did Benet intend, if he did not lead Baroja to the weapons of Faulkner?
What did Cela do, except to destroy the glory of that man, so that he might put himself on this pedestal?"
Fuzzy Aggression
My 70-year-old mother walked through our district in the village of Fuenlabrada last week, when suddenly a group of young people between the ages of 15 and 18 came along with her and our dog, our dog is a mixture that we brought out of the shelter and which weighs just six kilos, and then they missed him two steps from the sky and so badly injured him.
We can't get our disarmament into words at all because it's incomprehensible to us, where the fun should be in a cheap aggression against a small and helpless animal, which has naturally been executed on the leash.
In addition, the suffocation attack, which a woman who was walking in a comfortable manner, came when she wanted to correct these persons on the basis of the incident, even feared for her own life, because if such a madman attacks a dog, he may also be doing the same with a woman, a child, an older master, or probably even with anyone who is weaker than himself.
The incident occurred in a normally quiet city district at five o'clock in the afternoon on a very ordinary Tuesday.
The dog's been holding all day.
Of course, we have returned an advertisement in a nearby police department, but we have great doubts as to whether this will bring something at all and in order to prevent any prejudices from the beginning, we only want to make it clear that the cowardly criminals were Spaniards.
Our disarmament over the events has prompted us to display this incident.
We cannot understand what needs to happen in the minds of these young people, that they find a cheap attack on a helpless animal funny to an animal that gives us love, society and friendship.
We do not know where good education and respect for the animals and the persons have remained.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of the helmet
In cooperation with the Spanish Transport Safety Foundation (Fesvial), the tyre manufacturer Michelin launched a campaign to promote helmet use, particularly among the younger motorists, as both companies announced today.
This initiative aims to draw attention to the importance of helmet use, as it is ultimately the only protection element that can prevent head injury or even death in the event of a motorcycle accident.
Michelin pointed out that this campaign is part of its commitment to road safety, which " covers far more than just the design and manufacture of products that are becoming more and more secure every day", and confirmed that it also contributes to the achievement of a step closer to this goal every day with other actions of educational and informative character.
This new campaign to promote helmet use on the motorcycle, which runs under the slogan 'To be or not to be', will distribute posters to more than 500 motorcycle workshops in a first phase in order to achieve the best possible distribution.
Finally, Michelin stressed that transport safety is "a constant concern" of the company, and precisely because as a tyre manufacturer for two-wheeled vehicles, they are always committed to one of their main objectives being the development of more and more secure products.
The sale of small trucks is rising again
After almost two years, the car market for small transporters finally begins to see some light at the end of the dark tunnel.
The 9.425 vehicles registered in Spain in November represent an increase of 12.6 % in 2008 and, more importantly, they are the first increase even after 22 consecutive months with a steady decline, according to the figures presented by the manufacturer association Anfac and the Autosellerverband Ganvam.
However, these good figures should only be used with great caution at present, as the reference data used for comparison were November 2008, which was a particularly bad year of sale with a reduction of 60% over the previous year.
However, it must be noted that, apart from the increase in last month, the total approvals of these 11 months are still 40% below the sales figures of the previous financial year.
A total of 95,853 vehicles have been sold since January, but all vehicles consisting of the small transporter market have been included in this number: passenger cars, pick-ups, small transporters, small vans and lighter small trucks/cars.
Furthermore, the same thunderstorm clouds in the sky are still the most affected by demand, because even if some of the vehicles are purchased from private individuals, the majority of sales to small and medium-sized enterprises, which in almost 100% of all cases make the purchase with a third-party financing.
For example, on these restrictions, which are the consequences of the credit institutions' cash flow, there are other factors that need to be included, such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the duration of the bad economic situation.
In this panorama and in contrast to the passenger cars, the financial support for buying a vehicle from the 2000E plan has helped little.
However, this plan is not only intended for private individuals, even self-employed and small businesses have a right to buy a small transporter up to 3.5 tonnes with a CO2 emission that is not allowed to exceed 160 grams per km, but the low sales figures speak for themselves.
Just yesterday, Ganvam reminded us that it is essential for the state to also pay special attention to these small trucks and, of course, also the industrial vehicles (burden cars and buses).
The Autoretailer Association prophesies for 2010 a year similar to the one that has just passed, for which it expects a sales failure (in the case of passenger cars and off-road vehicles) of 19%.
Support for brake maneuvers in critical situations is now mandatory
As was the case with the ABS anti-blocking braking system at that time, and just as the ESP stability control system is doing, the emergency braking aid systems have to become a compulsory equipment in the European cars.
In fact, they are already required for all newly approved passenger cars and light small hauliers, for the remaining vehicles a time limit was set until the end of February 2011.
The measure adopted by the European Union aims to improve the protection of the walkers, but these braking systems can also help to prevent many accidents due to their working methods.
The task of the emergency brake assistant is to exert more pressure on the brakes in the case of a critical brake maneuver, which recognizes the system on the brake pedal based on the brake strength performed by the driver.
However, this system does not exercise this pressure until the end.
According to a survey commissioned by the component manufacturer for Bosch vehicles, a third of the drivers involved in an accident were no longer able to step onto the brake pedal before the collision and half of them had not braked with full force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The brake aid, on the other hand, enters the brake system with maximum force and thereby reduces the braking time and thus also the brake distance which a car returns during the braking process.
According to a study conducted by the EU, up to 1,100 fatal accidents that damage Fußgangers could be prevented every year if all cars were equipped with this type of emergency brake assistants.
There would be even fewer accidents - one expects that every fourth accident with personal damage could be prevented - as soon as the so-called intelligent emergency braking systems become popular.
Then the vehicle is equipped with a system that detects (by radar or camera) obstacles and warns the driver, while at the same time exerting a slight pressure on the brakes.
If the driver responds, the system helps him to increase the pressure on the brake pedal if necessary.
If the driver does not respond to the warning and even if the collision is inevitable, the brake assistant exercises the maximum pressure on the brakes in order to minimise the damage.
General Motors Shifts the Plan for Opel until January
While the staff of the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) was already informed by Nick Reilly, the new Chairman of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva will start in the first week of April, probably on 8th, according to Javier Ortega, the American vehicle manufacturer points out that he needs more time to complete the Opel rescue plan.
Nick Reilly, the new chairman of GM Europe, wants to achieve that the site concerned already gives its consent to every single point of the plan in advance.
And for this reason, it may be that the final document, which will first be presented to the workers and then to the governments of the countries in which there is work, will be postponed by the beginning of 2010.
On the other hand, GM is assured that a decision on the sale of Saab will be made in the next few days.
It is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased pressure on the American car builder to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to be in contact with some possible new buyers.
One of these buyers could be Geely, who also likes to buy Volvo, but the option of the Dutch manufacturer of Skyper sports cars, who has a back cover of the Russian group Conver, is gaining ever stronger appeal.
If none of these buyers agree, GM could sell some assets to the Chinese BAIC.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year if it has not been sold until then will continue to be maintained.
At the wheel of Porsche Boxster Spyder
For the development of their latest and very expensive jewels, the engineers used the Boxster S as a basis and managed to make it even easier by 80 kilos, so that now only 1.275 kilos are added.
In order to create something like this, they were the first to refrain from the automatic folding roof, which was replaced by a tent-line roof with manual drive, so that only 21 kilos were saved; thanks to the aluminium doors used in this model such as the GT3's "lost" another 15; due to the reduction of air conditioning even more than 13; besides, the fuel tank was reduced from 64 to 54 litres, thus further 7 kilos were saved; by the installation of sporty Bacquet seats again 12 and with the light 19-inch rims again five were saved.
Then, too, by abandoning the audio system CDR-30, another six kilos less was achieved and by replacing the door handles with handles made of fabric the missing kilo reached.
Although it is also available with the double-coupling PDK, the test drive was carried out with a 6-course hand geared vehicle, mainly on the smaller country roads of California, on mountain tracks that were really very curly.
In his driving behavior, only the note can be given to him flawlessly.
However, the reduction of its weight has by no means led to the fact that it would no longer be so safe on the road.
It's rather the opposite of the case: we haven't tried such a small and light model for a long time, which gives you at the same time a feeling of great safety at the curves, even at high speed.
He's a little athlete, able to warm his muscles during a low gear in the required time, until we give him the orders to shave, brake, recover and then get everything out of his engine again ...
He does everything he has to say to him. The car does everything we indicate with our hands on the steering wheel, thanks to its steering, which is as communicative as it is precise.
And he does it with the precision of a surgeon.
An engine sound for all tastes
The sound of his V6 boxer with 320 hp (10 more than the boxster S) has been very successful and one can even increase it with the 'sport' option as well as with a system that can change the engine noise which was already used for the first time in the Panamera.
The acceleration capacity is unimaginable brutal, whether out of the stand or during re-accelerating.
The suspensions are strong, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt on the country streets where we drove with the Boxster Spyder was already quite damaged, but the car mastered the hitholes well.
The electronic assistants had almost nothing to do throughout the course; and that, although we found ice on some of these curves in the morning grey and roll split on the morning.
In summary, one can say that it is an ultra-light car, a car with which one has an indescribable driving pass, as it might otherwise be rare and in it there is much more than just a small improvement of the boxster Ss.
The car will be on the market in February 2010 and will cost 70,831 EURO.
Bag Girl'
The singer, a bus friend of Karl Lagerfeld, is the face of the cosmetic line Coco Cocoon and an opportunity starette in the fashion shows of 'maison', she presents her evil face with the same neck rigidity as her pockets by Chanel.
Much more than "Bad Girl" or "It Girl", she's a "Bag Girl".
Baskonia gives itself a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral, despite the many outstanding players in the Dusko Ivanovic team, celebrated an excellent triumph with 82-91 while visiting the complex football field of the Maccabi Electro and thus came to the first place within his group after Mirza Teletovic, who was with eight three times the best of his team (29 in the rating).
The Vitoria team was able to replace the significant failures of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with a large dose of deployment and teamwork, even though they have to wait until the bitter end of their victory.
The great hits from the perimeter out with 16 rated threefolds contributed to their final victory.
The game began with the lead of the Blue Reds, who were at the top of the scoreboard from the beginning.
Since the first four baskets of the team from Vitoria already came out of the perimeter, one could already imagine that they had come to the field with well-heated wrists.
They were English and Teletovic, mainly responsible for the 18-20 at the end of the first quarter.
The second quarter was hardly different, only that the team from Álava opted for an inner side game of Barac and for the game of Eliyahu, which was received on his return to the team with pews and applause, which is his home to further extend their advantage until the break (34-43).
Teletovic already began to highlight himself as the best of his team with 13 points, even though the "minus six" evaluation of Splitter was already imagining that this would not be the best evening of the Brazilian.
Nevertheless, despite the obvious advantage in the break, the game had not yet been decided and the Maccabees once again wanted to remind the vitorians that not everyone won on their field of play, and thanks to the constantly attacking "Hand of Elías" they came back into the game.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to the fact that the "Yellows" turned the rowing around (50-49).
Even More Disadvantages
The team of Ivanovic, injured, but everything but dead, had to prepare a couple of game trains to get air again and in one of them suddenly came the gun of Mirza Teletovic, who with three almost consecutive triples and with the support of English and Ribas made sure that on the ad board was again a calming distance of (54-67) which the host could decorate with (57-67) at the end of the third quarter.
The alves were bluffed in the last quarter, and English and San Emeterio (60-75) had already announced that they would not allow anyone to take away the victory they deserved in the first three minutes honestly.
Nevertheless, Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team, did not sign off and tried to give their team back by three points from the line (70-77).
Nevertheless, and although Splitter was put out of the place because of Fouls, Ivanovic's team did not give up, defend itself well and although the Israelis picked up in the last minute (80-85), the game had already lost a winner and Tel Aviv for the first time this season.
Infringements prevented Unicaja from being offered the forehead
Unicaja lost loud in Greece against Olympiacos and had to take the lead in the group B of Euroliga to him, and that was marked in a game marked by the failures of the players of Unicajas (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), especially during the indoor game, which facilitated the Greeks' victory.
The team from Malaga was not afraid of the mood in the hall of peace and friendship, or of the opposing team, which is perhaps one of the strongest in Europe and has a lot of money.
Thanks to their presented game in the first quarter, the Andalusians were allowed to begin dreaming. An aggressive defense and three consecutive triples, two of them through Omar Cook and one through Guillem Rubio, blended the hosts with 12-18 in the 9th minute.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the one Unicaja, even though the local team with an inner game between Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis managed to display the ad board in the 13th minute 22-20 in their favor, the minute in which, due to an action, it almost came to the beating between the two Americans Beverley and Williams and why both were disqualified.
The Greek team finally started to get warm and its superiority on both sides of the game, while the exit of Englishman Joel Freeland due to an injury and the three self-inflicted mistakes of Carlos Jiménez left clear traces at Unicaja.
Among their players in the inner field and the Lithuanian forerunner Linas Kleizas, with his triples, they increased their advantage in the 19th minute to 44-32.
A pick-up was impossible
The third quarter of the game was characterized by many attacks against the Olympic team, which were superior despite its 19 losses and even managed to offset the difference of 66-48 in the 27-minute game in Malaga, which in turn brought the leadership in the group.
Unicaja tried to get rid of the many failures and the exit of Robert Archibald, who was injured during the game.
Despite the many disadvantages for the Unicaja, in the 31st minute thanks to the Federleitung and the triples of Cook and the use of Lewis again came a little hope for 66-57.
Nevertheless, it was actually impossible because the Olympiacos was unable to brake as soon as he attacked and showed his superiority with centimetres within the basket area.
In the 37th minute, the Croatian captain Nikola Vujcic managed to raise the basket difference to 81-62 and Unicaja had to be beaten and the lead had to stop atOlympiacos.
How much should you earn on Facebook due to his profile?
Facebook users can now learn their salary due to the new application Trovit, the search engine with most ads of real estate, job offers and cars in Spain, due to their profile.
The tool "How much should you earn?" calculates the salaries of the users on the basis of more than 140,000 job offers available at Trovit in Spain. A form is available to users on Facebook to enter their profession, professional experience, age and the city in which they work.
Already after a week after the application was available for the first time, the search engine found that, on average, the Spanish employee "feeled badly paid", explains the Trovit responsible Albert Ribera, in a press release.
The Spaniards are the worst paid according to the data that Trovit has through its search engines in Great Britain and France.
A British programmer receives an annual gross salary of 45,226 euros and a Frenchman 31.059, as opposed to the 24,000 euros that a Spanish earns.
Consequently, a truck driver has an annual net salary of 34,247 euros in England, 25.751 in France and 16,420 euros in Spain.
According to Trovit, the worst paid work in Spain is net to a waiter with 11,592 euros a year; followed by the work of a seller with 14,725 euros and that of a worker with 15,667 euros.
The most sought-after jobs on the Internet in the last three months are those of a driver, half-day jobs and social workers.
Brazil calls Zelaya a date to leave
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya's stay in her message in Tegucigalpa.
The President of the Office shall leave the diplomatic office by 27 January 2010 at the latest, if his mandate expires officially
Francisco Catunda, the trade delegate of the Brazilian Embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knew that before that date he must have left the message in which he had found asylum since 21 September.
"He is aware that he has to go on 27 January, because his mandate expires on that day and he has to look for a new accommodation."
The station also quoted the ex-President who confirmed his intention to leave the message before the set deadline: "My position is, as soon as possible, logically with the back cover of the government of Brazil," Zelaya said on the phone.
After the elections on November 29th (who produced Porfirio Lobo as a winner), Zelaya assured him that he would remain in the Brazilian Embassy until January.
However, this week he tried to get refuge in Brazil.
This failed, however, with the refusal of Zelayas to recognize the status of an asyl-seeking politician who wanted to impose on him the "de facto" government chaired by Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you!
After the most tempting days since last spring, when the inflation of the assets was the dominant mood in the markets, uncertainty has returned to the markets, which is in no way surprising, as this is their natural state, in an environment in which the brokers make decisions about a natural future.
The measure used to stabilise the markets was to settle the debt with the direct purchase of assets and to leave the liquidity free indirectly at interest rates moving around zero so that banks can buy assets for settlement.
The central banks have already confirmed that assets' direct purchases are as good as they have ended and, without questioning their heterodox liquidity policy, they are beginning to spread some sand into the gear, as the BCE näc already presupposes with its annual auction, which will take place next week.
Therefore, investors doubt the ability of the world economy to maintain economic recovery without these heterodox measures, and we are just going to witness a reversal in reducing risk premiums.
Refugees in the stock exchanges and differences in corporate bonuses are rising again, even though they are still far from the paranormal amounts they reached at the beginning of the year.
States were forced to nationalise the private risks and sovereign debt is rising again.
Now we rely on quality and the US, Japan and Germany are the preferred haven of investors, which in turn leads to an increase in the differences of the eurozone countries in terms of Germany.
Spain had hardly been affected by this episode of instability, but then came standard & poor's and threatened with a new revision down with regard to the assessment of Spain.
On the other hand, a certain uncertainty does not harm the defenders of moral risk, who once again tried to create a consciousness among those responsible for world economic policy, for what they had caused, because they had slowed down the devastating effects of limiting credit to the loss of jobs when they would have decided to take a new day to give thanks.
Nevertheless, what happened in Dubai points to a tribal war between the Emirs in order to restore power in the Emirates, and the development in Greece was predicted earlier.
A government that refuses the public debt, elections and a new government that takes the same line.
Prodi made it in Italy to Berlusconi and Sócrates in Portugal to Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense for Ecofin to save Hungary from non-fulfilling its foreign payments at the beginning of the year, allowing a euro-member country to no longer fulfil its obligations.
On the other hand, it is logical that Ecofin has forced the Greek government to be transparent and to take its citizens into account in the need for proper measures to maintain the stability of state funds.
Yes, as expected before an episode of normalization of risk premiums, after some exaggerations on too high amounts, this would now lie within the expected.
In the case of Spain, there is no need to worry as long as the differences in public debt increase at the same rate as the European company bonuses.
However, if Europe's differences were to be reduced and the Spanish were to increase further, this would be a special Spanish risk.
Standard & Poor's is a farce. While the local preferred indicators force a major part of the market research institutes to prefer their scenarios for recovery and to correct their 2011 scenario, including the OCDE and the European Commission, which again come with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy, all this does not promise a long lifetime despite warnings.
Once again, it seems quite that it is an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish shares, although at the moment "view while driving" is announced.
Related branches
The president of Iberdola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, first appeared yesterday before the subcommittee of Parliament, where the Spanish energy supply strategy is being debated in the next two decades.
After his appearance, followed by the chairman of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Galán gave the press a few points about what he had submitted to the subcommittee behind closed doors.
According to the president of Iberdola, Spain will need to invest 50 billion euros by 2020 and a further 60 billion from that date until 2030 on the assumption that current nuclear power plants will continue to operate.
If this were not the case, the investments needed would not amount to 60 billion, but to 95 billion.
However, Iberdola believes that one should no longer invest in an increase in energy production capacity, but in distribution networks and international alliances.
As of 2020, the question will be changed and the performance should be increased.
His proposal focuses both on gas and coal plants with facilities for collecting carbon dioxide and, of course, on renewable energy.
In this case, it assumes that 18,000 MW is more needed, under the conditions of naturality by other "storage energies".
Galán, who believes that the draft law for a sustainable economy, which has just been adopted by the government, is in line with what his company has called for, in no case wanted to say something about this law as to how to create incentives for national coal consumption, which would be exactly the opposite of all policy strategies in the fight against climate change.
In his opinion, "in the long term, this direction, despite some "individual" measures, is clearly stated by the president of Iberdola.
Be it as it is, Galán believes that decisions on investments should be made now, even if they are long-term, as it will take some time and a stable remuneration framework must be established to tackle them.
Ferrovial gets the "handling" of Aer Lingus at ten airports
The subsidiary of Ferrovial for services at airports on the ground, Swiss airport, is the preferred partner of the Iranian Flugesellschaft Aer Lingus for the luggage service at ten European airports where they are represented.
Paris, London, Frankfurt and Brussels are some of the most important.
The agreement, which has not yet been published, is based on five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Government of Castile-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares yesterday signed a protocol to cooperate to create an innovation centre for intelligent infrastructure.
The alliance plans investments of 20 million by 2012, of which 50 % of Ferrovial will come from.
One of the tasks of the Centre will be to examine energy efficiency at motorways and airports.
Acciona competes with Hochtief and Bouygues for its first motorway construction in Australia
Acciona is fighting for the approval of his first motorway in Australia, a market in which they are already represented as energy and water companies.
The construction that is involved is a tunnel that will cost 1.7 billion Australian dollars (about 1.047 billion euros).
The French company Bouygues and the German high-level companies are his competitors.
A five-kilometre tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, has become the best opportunity for Acciona to establish itself as a construction company and highway operator in the country.
The city administration wants to have completed the construction at the end of 2014.
After the administration had chosen a public-private cooperation (PPP is the English abbreviation) to advance the project according to a business plan established by Ernst & Young, the administration is already in possession of a final list of candidates for the construction and toll management.
In anticipation of the offers presented in May, the estimated investment amounts to 1.7 billion Australian dollars (1.047 billion euros), with three consortia, mainly made up of European construction companies, competing in the last phase.
The group named Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first company is one of Australia's largest construction companies, while the second is based in Italy, one of the best in-house specialists.
Against Acciona's team, the Northern Direct consortium is formed from the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian Transfield, which is responsible for the infrastructures and the French Bouygues.
The third and last consortium, which is in the narrower choice, is called LBRJV, formed from the capital of the Australian Leighton (the subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief, which in turn belongs to ACS), the also native Baulderstone (in the possession of the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the French company Razel, which has specialized in public construction.
However, the Australian infrastructure market promises to overcome enormous construction works and privatisations, as only the purchase of a local construction company will give you access to it.
A strategy followed by these companies, Hochtief or Bilfinger, in addition to Asian references, has yet to be pursued by the Spanish builders.
Even the ACP countries have gained access to this market only through their 30% participation in high-level, owner of the Leighton.
Millions of assets
Acciona places great importance on this geographical area for the sector, in which it is already very well known because of its activity as an energy supplier and in the desalination industry.
Among other assets, it already has its largest windmill park (192 MW) in Victoria and leads the group of companies that have been commissioned to build and manage Adelaide's desalination plant with a budget of 700 million.
Its intention is now to consolidate in these two areas and use these synergies to get access to the construction and infrastructure branches.
The underground toll route, supported by the Brisbane City Infrastructure Office and called Northern Link (Nordzuser) has the purpose of connecting the western highway in Toowong with the transhipment road in Kelvin Grove (see map) at a length of 5 kilometres through tunnels. This is the largest measure of traffic reduction on Brisbane's roads.
The timetable issued by the city administration foresees the award for summer 2010 and the start of the construction work in December next year.
Even though this toll line is already to be opened for traffic in the last months of 2014, it is expected that the construction works will continue until 2016.
The tunnel was designed in 2005.
It has two lanes in each direction, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Queensland government participates in financing with 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euros).
Brisbane is already a big business for a high-level business.
Australia is continually awarding substantial orders to the high-level, which yesterday signed a contract with the government of 154 million.
The ACS division will improve the infrastructure of the domestic broadband network with fiber optic cables by means of its native subsidiary Leighton.
This improvement will create fast Internet access for 400,000 people and the German company will work for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has received the King George Tower's construction project with 27 floors in the Australian city of Brisbane. Construction work has not yet begun and high depth has received 129 million for it.
Also in the United Kingdom, in Manchester, it competes with Laing O'Rourke for the construction and administration of two schools in 25 years.
Initial investments amount to 75 million euros.
FCC receives the order for a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
Through its subsidiary Alpine, FCC has provided itself with the construction of a tunnel of over 2.1 kilometres for a motorway in Slovenia over the sum of 64.5 million euros.
The company received this contract only a few days after it had received the supplement for the construction work to expand the Bosruck tunnel (Austria) over 130 million.
In this way Alpine strengthens its experience in tunnel construction.
The construction work is scheduled for early 2010 and its execution will take more than 32 months to complete.
Sra. Rushmore receives advertising from Renfe
Renfe has attributed the advertising and marketing services to the Sra agency for the next two years. Rushmore announced about three million euros a year, the railway company announced.
In this contract there is also the possibility of two extensions of 12 months each. Sra. Rushmore was selected among 16 agencies that presented itself for this competition, of which 4 came into the final round, among them TBWA, who had been responsible for advertising for the last three years.
From now on, Sra. Rushmore will be responsible for the design and production of the campaigns.
Penalties over 63 million for France Télécom for the removal of competition.
France Télécom has imposed a penalty on the regulatory authority for competition in France for anticompetitive behaviour in the Caribbean.
According to the Authority, the telephone provider has restricted competition in fixed network and mobile phone by signing exclusive contracts, pricing plans and loyalty programmes for consumers on the margins of regulation.
Together with this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state-owned company has accumulated more than 560 million euros in fines since 1994 because of the disability of its competitors.
The fine imposed yesterday was even increased, since the authority that is watching the competition is of the opinion that France Télécom has committed similar crimes in the past and has therefore returned.
Application trade
On the other hand, the French company's subsidiary has followed the example of other telephone providers and has opened an application website on the Internet to increase revenue from transactions that do not originate from the telephone connection.
In principle, this application website of Orange is active in France and the United Kingdom.
One has to wait until 2010 for this site to be available in other countries, such as Spain.
The game at the Champions League has brought Madrid and Barça in 476.4 million since the beginning.
The Champions League has developed its origin in 1992 as a source of revenue for the football club.
So much that Real Madrid and Barcelona have taken 476.4 million since, bringing them third and fifth place of football clubs that have earned the most money in the league.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
To win the Champions League of UEFA not only brings fame. It is also one of the main sources of revenue of the major clubs.
According to the UEFA, the league has distributed up to 5,362.5 million euros to 105 teams (including 12 Spanish) who have participated in this event since its foundation in the 1992/1993 season.
Real Madrid and the F.C. Barcelona have benefited from this distribution.
The white club is third in Europe, which has earned most money through its participation and the only one who has won three times the trophy next to the AC Milan.
The final winner of the former European Cup in 1992 was the current Catalan champion.
The list leads Manchester United and Bayern Munich, two teams which also took the most money through their participation in the past Champions League.
And that, even though they lost to Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only third in the countries that were able to take money through the champions, although it has more titles than everyone else (five, unlike four bee Italy, three at England and two at Germany).
Distribution
This obvious contradiction is explained by the complicated method of sharing funds used by UEFA.
In this financial year, the organization, whose chair is Michel Platini, expects revenue of 1.090 million through the Champions League.
The UEFA 413.1 million of this money is for fixed payments: each of the 20 football clubs taking part in the pre-qualification (including the Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
Moreover, those who fought for a match received 3.8 million by their mere presence, in addition to the 550,000 euros for each game they fought.
There is also a bonus for winning (800,000 euros) and for a draw (400,000 per team). The clubs that have come to the eighth finals each receive three million; the four that have come into the quarter finals, 3.3 million.
The last four will each receive 4 million.
The winner earns 9 million, unlike the second, who receives 5.2 million.
For example, a football club receives at least 7.1 million and a maximum of 31.2 million solids.
Barça again earned 2.5 million with his victory at the European Supercup in August.
However, the variable payments for which 337.8 million are planned are still to be made.
This money is allocated proportionally to the value of each single television market.
The Spanish is one of the first and has 4 assigned places.
Last year's champion receives 40% of the money allocated, 30% of the second, 20% of the third place and 10% for fourth place.
The other part is distributed according to the number of games they play in this year's edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million for 29.9% of Sos
The Nueva Rumasa group sent out details about the purchase of shares yesterday, with which it intends to purchase a ceiling of between 25 and 29.9% of Sos's capital.
A percentage which does not force them to make a public invitation to tender (opa) because of the number of shares.
In concrete terms, Nueva Rumasa offers 1,5025 euros per share, which are paid out for ten years and with an interest rate of 1% per year on the basis of this shift.
Yesterday, the Sos shares ended with EUR 1.85, which is why Nueva Rumasa rated the company 18 % below the market value.
According to Nuevan Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the real rating of Sos.
The offer is linked to the appointment of eight of the 15 consultants.
The Group from Jerez gives shareholders 15 days to share their interest in selling their shares.
CNMV assured that it had not been informed about this offer, although Ruiz Mateos confirmed that it had come into contact with the Authority.
At a conclusion, the deposit would amount to 611.7 million, while the value of Sos is 254.27 million.
Meanwhile Sos further restructures his management.
In an attempt to remain on the brink of possible purchases and the judicial circles of his ex-managers, the brothers Jesús and Jaime Salazar announced the appointment of María Luisa Jordá as head of the internal audit.
A decision that will make her the first woman to hold a high position in the food business.
This is a newly created post, which is directly subject to the chairman of the group.
This is far from free from polemics, because the company is involved in a judicial battle because of the suspicion of diverging more than 230 million of Sos into other societies of the Salazar family.
It cannot be excluded that, over the next few months, Sos shifts further capital.
In view of the Salazar loan, ex-advisor Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (CCM and Unicaja representatives) came before the National Assembly yesterday and confirmed that they had approved the shift of 212 million without knowing their destination.
CNMV approves Paternina's public exclusion invitation to tender submitted by the investment company Mer
The national Stock Exchange Commission (CNMV) approved the public exclusion invitation to tender for Federico Paternina presented by the investment company Mer last October.
The Supervisory Authority stated that it approved this invitation to tender after it had been demonstrated that the conditions laid down in the laws of law were complied with, and therefore the content of the explanatory leaflet submitted, after the amendments of last 2 December, could be considered as sufficient.
CNMV has also announced that this offer aims at the acquisition of 550.008 shares of Federico Paternina at the price of 7,65 Euro per share, which in turn represents 8,95 % of the company's capital, which is composed of 6,142,786 euros in shares approved on the Madrid and Bilbao stock exchanges.
In addition, it has been announced that 5.592.778 million shares have been fixed, which can in no way be transferred until the conclusion of the tender and whose price has been fixed by Federico Paternina in accordance with the laws of law.
New programmes for the assessment of vehicles
In these days of storms and accidents, not only do the car workshops deserve
Every day thousands of vehicles involved in an accident are dragged into the workshops, where a assessor has to assess the damage caused and the costs of repair.
No accident is the same, and calculating the cost of parts and hours of work can be a long and complicated task.
The calculation of the repair costs of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros per hand, including parts and working hours, may take up to two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the support of the latest IT tools, it is a matter of minutes
Therefore, almost 100 % of the assessors use this type of system.
The service and application providers for the assessment of accidents and repairs collect the information they receive from the manufacturers to process them afterwards and provide them to their customers in the form of a useful program.
In Spain, Audatex, part of the American group Solera, is the market leader; 80% of all opinions are produced with their products.
The other two companies competing with the tool market for assessment and preparation of a report are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data provided by the manufacturers is anything but easy.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, Sales Manager of Audatex, 63 manufacturers and importers are working together, each of which provides the information in a different format.
In addition, the volume of data to be processed is becoming greater and larger, to the point that over the last five years even more versions, variants and motorizations have come on the market than over the entire fifteen years before.
As soon as a new car enters the market, the company starts working.
It is a laborious task, because each of the thousands of vehicles must be catagolized and their price entered.
In addition, each model creates an "intelligent" graphic image that allows you to "click on" different parts of the vehicle.
In the case of a much-sold model, work can be completed in one week if the procedure progresses quickly.
In the case of a less common car, it may take up to three or four months. At present, Audatex has a total of 99.2% of the cars sold in Spain.
Among the more exclusive models, they have information about Porsche models, but not about Ferrari or Lamborghini.
With regard to the vehicle park running on the roads, it is over 99%.
For the purposes of carrying out documentation and the production of databases, Audatex has eight centers distributed worldwide (Spain, France, Germany, the USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) and each of them has specialized in certain brands.
The national headquarters is located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There more than one hundred technicians (usually mechanics) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests 90 million euros a year in the preparation of these databases.
Every month they collect 2.5 million data and their customers receive the updates every second day.
The development of this enormous flow of information enables companies to use it in different ways and thus to offer different products.
The most common use is the use for repairs and repairs, but, depending on the country, there are also tools for the management of scrap parts or for calculating the loss or residual value of a car.
The only company that informs about the value of the used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer this offer in Spain, but in the United States.
When looking through the products that Audatex offers, you can easily get an overview of the type of support it provides to industry experts.
This company offers ten different tools, with the star of the products AudaPlus, a standard solution for the assessment of accidents for the assessors.
It includes vehicles, motorcycles as well as light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it includes the repair times or painting prices estimated by the manufacturer.
This tool is paid according to the purpose of use, i.e. for each opinion.
Most expensive it will be for customers who rarely use it at a maximum of ten times a month, namely 5,75 euros per month.
On the other hand, any insurance company that produces thousands of reports negotiates the price with Audatex.
With other products, such as AudaVIN, you can completely identify a vehicle and the equipment with which it ran from the assembly belt using the chassis number.
AudaGlass deals with the vehicle discs, and AudaSubastas is a service on the Internet open to the specialist market, with which one can provide for vehicles that have been declared total damage.
Your statistical service is very useful in identifying trends, carrying out geodemographic analyses or in obtaining information on deviations by brand and model.
One can examine, for example, how many models of a particular car brand had to go to the workshop due to pans or how many of them were involved in a serious accident during a given period of time.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this kind of computer tools.
It distributes among others Gt Estimate, which is also intended for assessors and provides in the same way digital images, access to parts or prices and official working hours of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa Group, founded in 1971 as a provider of services and solutions for the assessment of damage, pans or maintenance of vehicles.
The GT guide for advice is a reference product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in workshops, 3,100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Its volume of business has increased by 20 % per year over the last three years and sales in 2008 amounted to 10.8 million euros.
At the beginning of last year, they started to go to the international market with the opening of an office in Paris.
Audatex, on the other hand, was founded in Germany in 1966 and established in 1979 in Spain.
According to the company's sources, 62% of its business is in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% in North and South America. They work with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 workshops, 3,000 of which are in Spain.
The total turnover in the world of the Solera group (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABS, Hollander and IMS) amounts to 557 million dollars, 3.35 more than in 2008.
In this respect, the company has revenue of 19.1 million euros, 7.2% more than in the previous year.
In 2005, the Solera group was worth one billion dollars on the stock market and today its shares are traded at a value of 2.4 billion dollars.
Since 2007 they have been on the New York Stock Exchange and part of the reference index Standard & Poor's.
Internet auction of accident cars
In the last October, the Solera Autoonline group bought a flat-foma on the Internet for the sale of accident vehicles and motorcycles.
This purchase meant the payment of 59.5 million euros for 85% of the company's capital, which could increase to 15 % next year.
The purpose of this purchase was to offer its customers more services and value-added, with the possibility of gaining access to a huge international market.
This assessment and purchase service applies exclusively to industry professionals, such as insurance companies, assessors, car hire companies, workshops, scraps and car dealers, who have to register before their activities.
This platform was founded in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650,000 operations throughout Europe, 500,000 of them in Germany alone.
Its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
Today, the website has more than 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 reviewers.
Every day, 3,000 ads are managed and 100 new ads are added to the Spanish market.
According to Spanish legislation, a vehicle whose chassis numberer has been declared must no longer drive on the roads, but certain non-harmful parts may be used as spare parts.
The historic-value cars may, however, be re-approved even if they have been declared after difficult administrative procedures.
The workshop's cost estimate in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, the company Audatex ensures that the user receives a cost suggestion in just four steps: identification of the vehicle, search of the spare part, creation and creation of a cost suggestion.
The easy handling of these systems is a basic condition, especially in order to convince older professionals who are usually more or less opposed to the use of these new computer techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, 666 of which are passenger vehicles, 109 off-road vehicles, 137 motorcycles, 78 small transporters and 44 trucks.
Of course, you need to use a computer with Internet connection.
After the model to be repaired has been identified using the chassis number, a graphic of the respective model appears and then the required spare part is selected.
The user can include variables such as the price for working hours, surcharges or discounts and then print out the cost estimate and pass it on to his customers.
However, AudaTaller is not a tool to assess such as AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalog.
The main difference between the two systems is that the workshop does not include estimated hours.
The cost of using this tool is 350 euros a year, an amount which the customer can pay without further delay.
The company Audatex is currently working on being able to offer these images in three-dimensional formats.
This is an innovation that automechanics have been waiting for a long time, for example, because you can select a door with it and then you can turn the picture completely to look at the inside.
