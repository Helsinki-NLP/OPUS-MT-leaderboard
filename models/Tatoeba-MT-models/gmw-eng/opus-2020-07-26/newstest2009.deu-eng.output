The Prague Stock Exchange falls into the Minus at the close of business.
After the steep waste in the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange was able to correct the losses.
Transactions with ČEZ shares reached almost half of the normal daily business.
At the beginning of the Tuesday business, the Prague Stock Exchange joined the collapse from Monday when it dropped by another six percentage points.
This time was the reason for the break-in on Wall Street.
In the Czech Republic too, the market’s response to the outcome of the American House of Representatives’ vote, which had refused to support a stabilisation plan for the financial sector there.
Case of shares in Asia
A dramatic case occurred on Tuesday, although the indices were able to offset some of the losses during the day.
The Hang Seng Stock Exchange index in Hong Kong lost almost four percentage points during the business day, but was later able to make part of the losses, thus reducing to about 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index, which observed the movement of Chinese shares on the Hong Kong stock market, fell by 3.8 percent, in Shanghai the markets were closed.
The stock market in Sydney lost more than five percent, but then the losses decreased to 4.3 percent.
According to the index, the stock exchange in Taiwan fell by 3.6 percent.
"The timing for the rescue operation in the US is uncertain and will influence the financial markets worldwide," said the head of the monetary authority in Hong Kong Joseph Yam.
Although it belongs to China, Hong Kong determines its monetary policy itself, regardless of the Chinese Central Bank.
The Hong Kong interest rates are at the same level as in the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, US legislators should return to the negotiating table as soon as possible and adopt the draft support of the financial system.
Otherwise, other countries would also be affected by the collapse.
A bloodbath of American shares
On Monday, the American House of Representatives rejected the plan to support the financial system, for which up to 700 billion dollars (almost 12 trillion Kč) should be spent.
The legislators thus ignored President George Bush's invitation to support the plan.
Bush believes that the plan would regulate the fundamental causes of the financial crisis and thus help to stabilise the entire economy.
The American shares experienced a bloodbath on Monday, and the most important stock indices recorded the biggest collapse in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones index sank by almost seven percent, a similar collapse he had last recorded in 1987.
The index had already fallen before the vote, but there were hardly any signs that the draft would not get through in the House of Deputies, the index experienced a free case.
Congress makes concession: US government is allowed to pump 700 billion dollars into the banks
The U.S. Congress's top representatives and President George W. Bush's government have agreed on a broader form of an agreement on financial support for the American financial system.
The vote will be taken at the beginning of next week.
The American legislators, in discussions about the adoption of a rescue plan in the form of financial assistance to the American financial system, achieved a breakthrough of 700 billion dollars (about 12 trillion crowns).
However, this does not mean a victory.
The Congress members must negotiate some details of the agreement before they are allowed to publish and vote on the final version of the law.
The financial system support plan will be negotiated at the U.S. Congress on Monday.
On Sunday, the Chairman of the Committee on Banking and Financial Services, Barney Frank, told the Reuters Agency.
According to the Senate, it is likely that different information could be voted on the plan at the earliest on Wednesday.
According to economists, a communication about the adoption of the plan should be the first important psychological factor for a recovery of financial markets.
After that, however, "retirement" is due to the complex mechanisms that could be used to help markets in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made significant progress.
We have clarified our differing views on what a package of market stabilisation should look like," said Democrat Nancy Pelosi to the agency Bloomberg.
According to their words, there could still be an final vote on Sunday.
Representatives of the legislators met with US Finance Minister Henry Paulson at night on Sunday to give the Government Fund its final form.
This provides for the purchase of unsaleable mortgage assets from the financial companies that are causing serious losses and endanger the stability of the entire system.
"We are on the verge of a definitive agreement on a plan that will work and which must also be effective on the market.
One has to continue the health plan even further, but I think we are at the goal", says Paulson.
A signal for Asia business
The global financial crisis is also falling significantly in the stock markets, which are falling sharply.
According to the words of the Democratic Senator of Nevada, Harry Reid, the legislators were trying to reach a final agreement even before Sunday in Congress.
This is a way of calming investors in front of business on the Asian financial markets, which are in the first time zone where a decision by the Congress could affect the business on Monday.
However, it is still not clear when both Chambers of the American Congress will vote on the law, and there is also uncertainty as to whether negotiations could fail in the last minute.
The legislators hope that it will be adopted in the next few days.
But the law will still experience some changes.
The total amount of aid to the system is to be divided into two parts.
The initial $350 billion will be made available as soon as possible, as President George Bush demanded.
Congress can block the distribution of the rest of the money if it has the impression that the program does not fulfil its function, with an additional 100 billion dollars and later the final 350 billion dollars.
Bush Has Positive Progress in Negotiations
Although the President has a veto right in this decision, the Congress can ignore his veto.
Despite these changes, however, the programme's basic idea has remained, which is based on the acquisition of finances for the purchase of poor mortgage securities, whose value has fallen, because hundreds of thousands of Americans are no longer able to repay their mortgages.
"We've worked everything out.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on Sunday on the law, the Senate then on Monday", says Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
The American President Bush was also satisfied with the progress.
His spokesperson Tony Fratto said that Bush was satisfied with the progress of Saturday and "estimate the mutual effort to stabilise our financial markets and protect our economy."
Limitation of golden parachutes
The Chairman of the Banking Committee of the Senate Christopher Dodd, the leading negotiator, stated that the legislators had agreed on a responsibility for the money programme, the protection of taxpayers from losses, the conclusion of benefits and a timetable for financing the plan.
The new law should also restrict the so-called golden parachutes for directors of companies involved in the programme and set up a committee to which supervision of the Fund is to be exercised.
The Ministry of Finance is responsible for this.
"We have worked very hard on this and achieved great progress towards an agreement that works and is important for the market and for all Americans," said Paulson.
The plan also expects help for homeowners who have problems with repaying their mortgage.
The government should negotiate new rates at mortgages which it buys, with the aim of reducing the monthly costs for the debtors and enabling them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological assistance
The proposed plan is a good idea after Patria Finance David Marek's main economist, but implementation is becoming very difficult.
"That's why you don't know what mechanism and at what price the problematic assets are bought up.
This will be crucial for how the financial sector and the government divide the losses among themselves," Marek said to the iHNed.cz server this week.
According to Marek, whether the plan is adopted now or at the beginning of next week is not decisive.
"It is much more important that the Congress members agree to support the plan and that they adopt it as soon as possible.
The psychological importance of the agreement on the adoption is the most important at this time," said Marek.
Duell on knife cutting: MP3 player against mobile phones.
We will advise you on your choice
While almost any mobile phone can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can make calls yet.
So, of course, it looks like it's better to just buy a phone.
In spite of everything, there are sufficient reasons why you should make yourself an independent player.
The choice depends entirely on the type of use and the claims of the future owners.
Surely you can hardly buy yourself a great expensive record player at home to listen to Maxim Turbulenc's latest album.
Once such musical innovations do not appear on LPs, and from a qualitative point of view there is no objective reason for this.
However, if you have LPs with Art Rock, Jazz or Blues in the shelf, you probably dream at least of such.
This is also the case with the music on trips, i.e. with compressed music, simplified - music in MP3 format.
There are price and quality categories here too.
For one thing, it may not be acceptable to spend eight thousand crowns for a player, but a Pink-Floyd fan will probably be difficult to get headphones from the market for twenty crowns.
Two extremes between which there is enough room for everyone.
The selection is wide-ranging.
The life of the batteries is also crucial.
Some good music players can play much more than just music, but what mobile phones can do doesn't even make them significant.
No modern device is as universal as the phone.
In addition to the primary functions, the phone and the sims, it can play music and videos, record both, it has a better, sometimes a worse camera and may also navigate.
And if you still include the smartphones and communicators, you almost have a small computer in your pocket.
It's a little miracle, because no fridge can grill and no TV photograph.
But the universality of mobile phones also brings disadvantages.
The more functions you use on your mobile phone, the more often you will need to reload it.
And playing music is one of the greatest energy eaters.
Few phones can play music for longer than ten and twelve hours, mostly it is much less.
In this respect, music players (especially the easiest) are much more powerful.
Therefore, you should expect cheap phones to be unable to play music for more than a few hours.
If you make a phone call from time to time, you would prefer to buy a charger for the office - this also applies to more expensive devices.
For MP3 players, you will not have this problem, even those who keep at least 9 hours of continuous operation with one charge off.
Another problem exists if you want to replay the music on your mobile phone.
Unfortunately, only a small part of the devices has a USB connection, and no mobile phone can be connected directly to a PC without special software.
Of course, you can replay the music directly to a storage medium, but few card readers will be ready without a reduction with the tiny memory cards used in mobile phones.
For players you do not need any special software except for exceptions (iPod).
You only need to feed the device via USB port with music from your PC.
Most mobile phones and players create a music library themselves, ordered by the name of the interpreter, the title of the album, the genre or, for example, the user's evaluation.
Some devices only make up the tree structure of the address directory, similar to Windows Explorer, some can both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, intelligent phones with operating system).
Players are easier to operate, mobile phones can do more
When selecting a specific device, you should explore the life of the battery, the storage capacity, the quality and the type of sound and, of course, also the ease of use.
If music is especially cool for you and you only hear it in the tram every day, for example, then any mobile phone that plays MP3 files is enough.
What really can almost any cell phone.
You also don't have to control which music formats a mobile phone or a player can process.
MP3 create everyone, and most of the music you get will be in this format right now.
The format is one of the most widely used and most devices can also play music in WMA format.
AAC is less common (a format that Apple and its iPods use).
Better mobile phones also enable the purchase of music online.
You only need to call the respective pages of a provider (or other provider) via mobile internet, and you can purchase a song or album.
This service can already be a striking argument for why you should apply a music handy.
Unfortunately, the offer of providers is bad and is mostly limited only to fast radio hits.
The prices are not the lowest either.
In general, however, it is assumed that just this type of sale of music (such as via GSM, Internet or wireless internet) will in the future dominate the music industry.
The cell phone carries most of it.
If you want to listen to something, grab your phone in the jacket pocket while the player is forgotten at home.
It is important, however, whether you always wear headphones or at least a wireless voice unit.
If not, you can use the integrated speaker, which almost any mobile phone has, but only the least MP3 player.
The greatest advantage of the music handys will probably be in the price for many.
The cheapest costs are usually less than three thousand crowns.
For three and four thousand crowns you get a very decent walkman.
The biggest handicap will be for most people that no normal headphones are in there.
The best and technically matured phones with a 3.5 mm opening for normal headphones cost up to fifteen thousand crowns.
The advantage of the players is in turn easy to use.
The easiest - and not necessarily cheapest (see selection) - player can really serve anyone.
A minimum number of functions that are similar when operating with the previously normal cassette recorder or, for example, the record player is obvious.
It does not threaten a collision in the form of an erroneously employed mobile Internet and a subsequent horrendous bill for data transmissions.
Which device should now be grasped
Also the cheapest phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) have usually a slot for removable storage media (type M2, microSD etc.).
Even if you buy a corresponding card, two thousand crowns are sufficient.
But respect.
The basic models usually only support maps with a maximum capacity of 2 GB.
Only the most expensive can read 8-GB memory cards.
If you already own a mobile phone and want to buy yourself a cheap MP3 player, you can access Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB), you do not have to put more than 1100 crowns on the table.
Listen to the more demanding listeners, take more specialized phones - Walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some of Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have separate control buttons for MP3, and the ease of use comes to that of a single MP3 player.
The most important thing here is Sony Ericsson, whose phones from the series Walkman have the same user interface as the individually sold MP3 players.
The same services in the same price category of up to four thousand crowns, but with a higher storage capacity (up to 16 GB) and a long battery life (normally 15 hours, maximum up to 35 hours) provide you with MP3 players from the above mentioned manufacturers.
The first virtual provider is coming to the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite mature, the Czech suppliers offer virtually all services, as they are offered by their partners in Western Europe.
Nevertheless, something is missing here - a virtual provider that forces the classic at lower prices.
Maybe it won't be long to wait.
The fact that Czech mobile communications providers work among the most expensive in Europe at all, we have often reported on this on Mobil.cz.
This also confirmed the ČTÚ Telecommunications Authority, which drew attention to the fact that the price of text here is higher than the rest of the European Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission in the field of roaming charges, there is so likely to be a paradoxical situation - for some Czech mobile communications providers SMS will be cheaper from abroad than at home.
How is it that prices in the Czech Republic are so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, it lacks the competition that really makes a combat attack.
Perhaps it sounds paradoxical, in the Czech Republic there are three mobile networks and a penetration of well over 100 %.
The mobile service providers, on the other hand, like to scramble that there is an extremely high level of competition in the Czech market.
The chairman of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Authority (ČTÚ) is often a member of Pavel Dvořák, who often said in the past that there was no room for another provider in the Czech Republic.
It is likely that a classic provider with its own network no longer has a lot of opportunities (by the way, it would probably find hardly any frequencies).
But there is one more possibility - a virtual provider.
Especially the entry of virtual providers into the mobile market brought a significant price reduction, to which the classic mobile service providers had to respond.
Before the entry into the market of such companies as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile, there were similar voices in the UK as in the Czech Republic.
However, it has been shown that there is room for such providers and that they can really be successful.
By the way, you don't need to look for examples for a long time.
In February of this we reported on the launch of the virtual provider Mobilking in Poland.
In just half a year, this provider succeeded in winning more than 100 thousand customers and thus ascending to the five largest supplier in the country.
The Penta financial group, which owns U:fon in the Czech Republic, is behind Mobilking.
The advantage of virtual providers is that one can focus on a much more specific target group.
In order to function effectively, virtual providers need much less customers than a classic provider.
They do not need a relatively high cost for the construction, operation and maintenance of a mobile network.
In the world, virtual providers normally stand out as low cost companies - they offer cheap phone calls and SMS, which is often accompanied by a less extensive service offer.
For example, Tesco Mobile in Great Britain offers SMS at least half cheaper than its competitors.
However, as the example of mobileling in Poland shows, it may also be quite good to put on a non-clear target group.
This supplier is specifically aimed at men.
"Real guys choose Mobilking - the provider they like and trust," says David Seibert, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, the operator of this virtual provider.
It is hard to say whether a similar concept could be taken into account in Poland, as well as in the Czech Republic.
The press speaker of Vodafone Miroslav Čepický also doubts: "The Czech market is relatively small for a market segment on which most virtual providers are based.
In addition, it is relatively saturated from the perspective of the supply of services."
In the Czech Republic chanceless, the mobile service providers mean
It is almost certain, however, that if a virtual mobile service provider conquers the Czech Republic, this will not be mobileking.
"We are talking about an expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations do not look particularly hopeful.
There will be a market entry of mobileing in other countries in our region," says a phone call for mobile phone call.cz Jana Studničková, press speaker of the Penta financial group.
Indirectly, it confirmed that the present mobile communications providers in the Czech Republic are not specifically committed to this idea.
On the contrary, they try to do everything they can to ensure that no potential competitor is created.
Their interest in launching a virtual mobile phone provider has long been shown by the group GTS Novera, who wants to take another step to become a real competitor of Telefónica O2 in the field of corporate customers.
"We have a great interest in offering our customers not only fixed-line, but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the sooner, the better.
We have repeatedly negotiated this opportunity with all Czech mobile service providers.
With some of them we have already been able to achieve progress in negotiations," said the press speaker of the Pavel Kaidl group.
Maybe better times will come now.
Non-official information shows that the first virtual provider may be expected by the end of the year.
So far, however, this is surrounded by an insurmountable wall of silence.
"At this point we do not assume that in the Czech Republic there is room for a full virtual provider.
The Czech market has major specificities compared to other markets.
So far, we have not yet addressed a subject with a complex and serious project in this field", says in his statement for Mobil.cz Vlastimil Srše paper from the Press Department of Telefónica O2.
Other providers also refer to the specifics of the Czech market.
The press speaker of T-Mobile Martina Kemrová adds in rare agreement with the statement of O2: "Until now we have not yet found a viable and beneficial project to which one could build further."
And she adds: "A virtual provider will hardly appear in the T-Mobile network until the end of the year.
At this point we must have had a concrete offer to think so in the short term."
Vodafone focuses its attention more on meeting the requirements of its own 3G license.
Miroslav Čepický says: "For negotiations with potential virtual providers, we are open, especially in the area of sharing costs and infrastructure.
This is precisely what we consider to be the best from the point of view of our customers.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a shared network for a fast mobile Internet."
The responsible authorities - hand in hand with the providers
The approach of mobile service providers is easy to understand, another provider was more competitive, this would lead to falling prices and thus also to a fall in profits.
So why make it easier for such a competitor to enter the market?
That the suppliers can pull at a stroke when it comes to something also proves the long coming and forth about the origin of U:fon.
The strongest pressure towards ČTÚ went out from the company T-Mobile at the time when U:fon came onto the market.
This also demonstrates the publicly available information from the ČTÚ websites.
But now it is just U:fon as an argument why you should not allow a virtual provider.
Martina Kemrová commented: "The competitive environment of the mobile market was recently strengthened by the entry into the market of a fourth mobile communications provider.
Taking into account the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that a new player would impose high requirements on the market itself and, above all, its services."
However, in view of this approach by mobile service providers, the absolute interest of Czech regulatory authorities is surprising.
This is not just the attitude of ČTÚ, who unfortunately does not have the competence to intervene in economic competition in the Czech Republic, in contrast to the United Kingdom and other highly developed states.
It is exclusively owned by the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (ÚOHS).
But this involved his typical attitude to this whole problem.
"The entry into the market of a virtual mobile phone provider would then be possible after a contract was concluded between a mobile phone provider and a virtual provider on the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
So far, no such contract has been concluded, because the offer of potential interested parties was probably not sufficiently interesting for the classic providers," said Kristián Chalupa in his reply to our request from the Department of External Relations of the ÚOHS.
Such a formulation would not be surprising by the representatives of the providers.
This is more than worrying by an authority representing consumer interests and, among other things, to ensure that no one abuses its position on the market.
In particular, when Kristián Chalupa adds: "Foreignly, where virtual providers work normally, it can be observed that their entry into the market has contributed to a price reduction in mobile telephone services."
However, it is likely that the pressure on the correct functioning of the market and a price reduction is not one of the interests of the ÚOHS.
In this case, the almost already touching harmony of the three mobile telephone providers, resulting from their reactions, is really shocking.
The question of whether this really is just a coincidence is obvious.
Just as the absolute same fuel price at the petrol stations is certainly just a coincidence and the result of a hard competition.
"In this case, the Authority has not discovered any signs of a competitive action, and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way in the matter.
None of the suppliers has a dominant market position, so they also do not have the appropriate increased responsibility for their activities on the market.
The necessary tools for opening the mobile market for virtual providers are likely to be lacking from the Telecommunications Regulatory Authority," said Chalupa in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many controversial points.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets, prepared by ČTÚ, after which telecommunications is a single market from the perspective of economic competition.
On such a market, no one of the Czech mobile telephone providers will of course have a dominant position.
However, some legal experts offer a different view - the consent of the network operator is always necessary for the entry into the market of a virtual provider.
And the mobile service provider - logically - has the monopoly for its network.
This means that in a certain segment it necessarily takes a dominant position.
But even if you do not go along with this argument, it should at least be a warning to the ÚOHS that three mobile service providers are strikingly similar.
In doing so, complaints from a number of interested parties (including the aforementioned company GTS Novera) prove that they encounter very similar obstacles in negotiations with all suppliers.
The removal of responsibility for ČTÚ is then a fairly common trick in the telecommunications services, with which the ÚOHS distance itself from the whole matter.
This has already been observed in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, the amendment to the Telecommunication Act recently adopted does not allow the extension of ČTÚ's competences to the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although a number of experts had promised to improve the situation.
The representatives of the ÚOHS must know this too well, but they probably have other interests.
It's going to happen if no one looks at it.
Only the operation of any pseudovirtual provider, of which there are several in the Czech mobile networks, remains unnoticed.
These are companies that issue their own price lists for mobile telecommunications services, but which are only partially public.
Usually it is companies operating in the field of multilevel marketing.
Mobile telephone services, for example Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and others.
The price lists of these companies usually only reach the chosen ones.
The joke of the matter is that the company is acting towards the operator as a classic company expert, who orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer, he will then receive special price offers (and other offers).
The problem is that the terms and conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit similar resales.
"If there should be cases that you describe, then it can be a violation of the contractual conditions that we will then deal with, which can lead to an end to cooperation with the corresponding society," replied Martina Kemrová to our question about this problem.
However, it is quite unlikely that this is not the case with those responsible for mobile communications providers.
Especially in the case of the three mentioned companies, it can be thousands of customers.
However, no operator opposes such action.
Indeed, the activities of these companies do not lead to negligible profits, at the same time they are not affected by the actual official marketing, in contrast to the actual virtual providers.
Miroslav Čepický draws attention to possible problems: "The law allows such types of speculation, despite all, the services of these companies are used only by a very low percentage of customers.
Moreover, they must accept that the SIM card on their phone does not run on their name, so they cannot have full value as the normal customers of mobile phone providers."
This alone, however, would have to be at least strange to the ČTÚ.
There is also another question for the ÚOHS.
The mobile service providers close their eyes to such an approach, why do they lock themselves against a virtual provider?
It must be added that the ÚOHS has quite strong competences to discover such activities, and if it does not, it does not have to satisfy itself with the statement of the providers, they do not know anything about them and their terms and conditions would prohibit them from doing so.
When Czech Republic is no longer the most expensive
As has already been pointed out several times in the text, the market entry of virtual providers brought a significant price decline in the various services.
Practically in all countries where virtual providers have been created, the classical providers have tried to prevent their origin from being practically more or less.
The arguments used by them were virtually identical - a market too small or too saturated, problems with the quality of services, etc.
In the highly developed countries, however, the regulatory bodies at the very moment tried to protect the interests of mobile service providers, but those of their customers.
Whether it was through formal measures or non-formal pressure, they achieved that the first virtual operator was created and then followed.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory bodies all fall to the whole case like a hot potato.
Based on our experience, we cannot escape the impression that uncertainty in the competences in these cases is more than favourable.
But we don't throw the flint into the grain.
If the background information is correct and a virtual provider appears soon, perhaps the Czech mobile market will start moving again.
If a provider allows the creation of a virtual mobile phone provider, the ÚOHS will not remain inactive when it comes to rejecting other interested parties (to discriminate).
And finally the Czechs will no longer call more expensive than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Select the best from
Listen to the four versions of the new Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek presented the new recordings of the national anthem Where is my home country on the day of Czech State.
The anthem was replayed by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available - with male or female solo vocals, in choral version and in an instrumental version.
The song was written by Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
The editors of the Hymn versions are Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček.
You can listen to all four versions on the iHNed.cz server.
For Bělohlávek, the Czech national anthem is one of the most beautiful anthems.
Previously he had told Czech radio that he had chosen singers with young, representative voices for the solo versions, which are striking and popular.
"From the beginning I tried with both and then also with the choir to maintain a clear section so that the text could be understood well in order to be consistent", says the conductor.
The Czech national anthem is about 175th anniversary next year.
The song Kde domov můj was first performed in 1834 on the stage of the Ständtheater in the original Czech piece Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetán Tyl, the music was by František Škroup.
It became popular, and people spontaneously accepted it.
The first verse of the song became an organic part of the national anthem after the development of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
One of the seven symbols of the state remained after the development of the independent Czech Republic.
How does the "new" anthem sound?
The Prague transport companies transport on Wednesday for the first time also on a chip
Wednesday, October 1, 2008, will enter the history of Prague's transport companies as a date when passengers will enter a subway, tram or bus that will carry an electronic coupon in the pocket instead of a paper ticket.
These can currently buy about a hundred thousand people who own the Chipcard Opencard.
The passengers can buy a 30-day, 90-day or an annual coupon (since from 1 January 2009) and simultaneously record it on their chip card, in the information centres and branches of the transport companies at the metro stations Muzeum, Můstek, Nadraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letőany, Kmobilisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
The coupons have been available on the website of the transport companies www.dpp.cz since yesterday.
The service was used up to the afternoon hours by over four hundred customers.
Those who use Internet sales can really forget the output window at the subway stations, where they had to wait regularly in long queues for their paper driving licenses.
They buy the coupon over the Internet, it is played on the open card in one of the thirteen branches of the city library.
"There is also a switch with trained staff available to travellers in these places, which advises interested parties when buying the Internet and also plays the coupon on the map", says Martin Opatrný, spokesman for the project.
In addition to the libraries, the electronic coupons can also be played on the open card on self-service machines, which are installed in some subwayvestibules.
What do such machines look like?
They are red, reminding of ticket values, the passengers may have noticed them already in the subway stations Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"At present there are five of them in the city, but it is supposed to be eighty by the end of the year," Opatrný adds.
The coupon controls an automatic instead of the driver
The operation of the machines that will work from tomorrow's onwards is simple.
You just have to insert the chip card, and the previously purchased coupon plays itself.
The electronic coupons will apply from tomorrow not only in the capital, but also in the surrounding area.
So in the suburban trains and on the bus lines with the numbers 300 to 499, with which the inhabitants of the Central Bohemia region in particular reach the capital.
"In the trains that belong to the Prague integrated traffic, the train attendants have read equipment that allows them to check the validity of the coupons by time and zone," says Filip Drápal of the Ropid organization. This organization compiles the schedules for the Prague transport companies.
The suburban buses have ticket readers at the checkout at the driver.
When entering, the chip card not only needs to be shown by the driver, but the open card must be placed at a marked spot on the side of the checkout.
The driver thus controls the validity of the listed coupons.
"If a passenger wants to check the validity of the listed coupons, nothing is easier than asking the driver for this information," says Drápal.
A passenger who doesn't ride suburban buses and doesn't know when the coupon's validity ends can go to the automats, where the coupons are played on the card.
The information on the validity of its documents is displayed here on the display of the device.
Sudetes asked the U.S. for a referendum
The Sudeten Germans had asked for the integration of the Bohemian Forest to the United States in 1945.
This is evident from a letter stored in the collections of the South Bohemian scientific library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, at least we want to live under the auspices of the United States of America.
With such a wish, a number of Sudeten Germans should have turned to the US President in 1945.
This can be seen, among other things, from a letter that has been preserved in a private archive that is now kept in the collections of the South Bohemian scientific library.
In the letter, the Germans of Krumau ask the American President not to allow the return of the "Sudetgau" - which was taken on the basis of the Hitler Munich Agreement - to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation correctly and we really want to be sure that the American units enter, not as oppressors and enemies of German territory, but as liberators," it says in a letter signed with the words "people who are at heart with the fate of the Sudetes".
Since the connection to Czechoslovakia makes the Sudeten Germans - aware of the Czech national character - suspect that they would expect brutality, carelessness, inconceivableness, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the American President to take over the protection of the Bohemian Forest for today and forever.
"We cannot believe that, without regard to the view of a quarter of a million inhabitants of this area, you are addressing a foreign state that has tried to suppress and eliminate minorities and has done nothing to win the Allies," read the letter.
The reason why the authors cannot sign is said to be the fear of revenge of the "Czech Oppressors".
If the President of the United States had doubts about the attitude of the Bohemian Forest Germans, it would be sufficient for him to initiate a referendum in the Bohemianwaldgau on whether the inhabitants would become part of the United States or live under the protection of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may sound somewhat naive in today's knowledge of post-war history, in the opinion of some contemporary witnesses, it paints a good picture of the then expectations of the Sudeten Germans.
Even though the Bohemian Germans at least had to know that one would negotiate about their deportation from the Republic, only a few of them came to have such a possibility at all.
Some were waiting for the United States and Great Britain to negotiate some kind of autonomy for the Sudetes.
Still others believed they could just stay in Czechoslovakia.
This also confirms the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, who comes from Budweis.
He was used in the war as a Budweiser by the Navy on the Baltic Sea.
When he came to British captivity at the end of the war and took him to a prison camp in Holstein, dozens more Bohemian Germans came to him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that if they got home, the Czech would pass them," said Chalupa.
None of the German prisoners of war, who had lived in Czechoslovakia before the war, believed that he would be expelled from the Republic on the basis of the Beneš decree.
You don't think - then pay!
An emotion-charged campaign is aimed at drivers
Most expensive action on road safety in Czech history.
The emotion-packed media campaign, which the Ministry of Transport intends to launch on Wednesday, was also reflected.
The Authority of Minister Aleš Łebíček promises to abandon drivers of dangerous behaviour behind the steering wheel.
The campaign for 150 million crowns will run on television, on radio, in cinema, on the Internet, as well as on flyers.
It is intended to remove drivers from too fast driving and alcohol at the wheel.
And they also remind themselves that they were attracted before the trip.
In particular, the campaign wants to talk about young drivers, motorists, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional drivers.
And what is shown in the spots?
Above all, stories of people who appeal to emotions.
The "bloody" slogan of the whole campaign also testifies:
You don't think - then pay!
The words "don't think" are in capital letters on a sign.
And the word "pays" is then in a blood layer.
This means that one can pay inconspicuousness to one moment with one's own life.
The spots will "sock" the viewers until 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where you can see normal pictures with dramatic photographs of accident victims.
It is expected that the number of accidents and the number of road deaths will fall on Czech roads.
The spots have been compiled by the Euro RSCG agency.
Sugar bread and whips for drivers
"The motto of sugar bread and whip is valid for the riders.
Sugar bread means that if, for example, they drive red, they save time.
The whip is then the threat of a punishment or an accident.
The driver must be reminded of the risk," said the traffic psychologist of the Na Homolce Martin Kořán Hospital.
And that's why information campaigns in the press and, above all, negative advertising are necessary, the psychologist says.
In his opinion, it is less effective to draw the attention of the drivers to a danger.
"If you create a static table that warns of a danger, it will probably flow with the surroundings soon, and the riders will no longer perceive them," says Kořán.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace
The president of the provisional Israeli government Ehud Olmert has expressed his support for the return of practically all areas occupied in 1967, including Jordan, East Jerusalem and Golan heights, if one could make peace with Palestine and Syria in exchange for them.
He stressed this in an interview printed on Monday by the newspaper Jediot Achronot.
"We need to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all (occupied) areas if not all," said Olmert to the newspaper.
"We keep a certain percentage of these areas, but we will have to give the Palestinians a similar percentage (Israeli territory) because there will be no peace without them," he added.
He admitted that a possible return would also include Ostjerusalem.
"The one who wants security in Jerusalem and, above all, does not want tractors or bulldozers to roll over his legs, as one of my best friends has happened, will have to give up some of Jerusalem," said Olmert, allusing two attacks in the city in July, killing several people and killing dozens of people.
According to the prime minister, it will be necessary to find a "special solution for the temple bears and sacred and historical places" located on the territory of the old town.
"The one who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty throughout the city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work," he continued.
Removal of the Golan altitudes
Olmert spoke for a withdrawal of Israel from the Golan heights, which in his view is an indispensable condition for the conclusion of a peace agreement with Syria.
However, this would also require certain efforts on the part of Damascus.
"My proposal is not to conclude peace with Syria only on the basis of a deduction from the Golan heights," Olmert said.
"The Syrians know all too well what they have to do to get back the Golan heights.
They will have to refrain from their present relationship with Iran; they will have to refrain from their relationship to the (Shiite) Hisbollah movement; they will have to refrain from the constant support they will give to the terrorism of the (Shiite) Hamas movement, the terrorist network Al-Khaida and the Jihad (the Holy War) in Iraq," the Prime Minister emphasized.
Questions about the accident: Are stewards in the bus illegal?
The law doesn't know it, in a long-distance bus it is not allowed to go around
In connection with the tragic accident of a bus of the company Student Agency near the Italian Padua, the question arises whether Stewards and travellers are allowed to go down and down the bus during the journey.
"If we are to comply strictly and formally with the law, the activity of a steward is contrary to the law on road transport," says Karel Hanzelka, the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport.
The accident, which killed a twenty - two - year - old stewardess last week, was probably caused by the driver of the truck who crossed the bus.
The young woman was sitting at this moment at all the accident next to the driver, on which least safe place in the car, although she had two more places at her disposal.
However, a bus can also have an accident at the moment or brake sharply in which the Steward coffee or newspapers carry out.
It also plays a role in whether the bus is equipped with parking places after the letter to the vehicle.
If this is not provided for in the bus, travellers have to sit.
Student Agency's long-distance buses have no standing places; what the director of the company, Radim Jančura, confirmed to Aktuálně.cz.
"We have discussed this with the ministry, and this has not agreed to the movement of travelers at first.
Later on, this was taken back, and we reached a consensus that the travellers could go to the toilet during the journey, if they had their seat," he said.
The law doesn't know any steward
"There is no clear legal interpretation for the role of a steward - no legislation describes this role.
There is no legislation, however, which prohibits the carrier from providing services.
The Road Traffic Act only knows the concept of vehicle crews, but its rights and obligations do not define it," the spokesman of the Ministry of Hanzelka clearly adds.
The Director of the Department of Road Vehicles of the Ministry of Transport Josef Pokorný, on the other hand, believes that the law covers this problem afterwards.
"It is important whether the bus also has standing places in the product approval.
That's all then," he emphasizes.
Buses are divided into city buses, where there are standing spaces and the maximum speed is limited, local buses with standing spaces and higher permitted speeds and long-distance buses without standings with the highest permissible speed and seats equipped with safety belts.
As in the plane, says the expert
The BESIP car for road safety Jaroslav Hořín sees no fundamental problem in the movement of Stewards on board a bus.
"In case of a liquid mode of driving, not many risks threaten, the situation is comparable to the service on board an aircraft.
Also here is not sure when turbulences come, and the stewardess can hit his head."
"But if a bus breaks sharp, then of course the laws of physics also apply.
Just like in the city bus or on a tramway.
The safety of the stewards must be clarified by internal regulations," he says and also believes that this problem is not completely resolved from the point of view of the law.
Jančura is ready to delete the services
Student Agency is the only bus company to provide Stewards services.
The company employs about two hundred people in this function.
The Director does not regard their profession as risky even after the accident.
"As soon as I get the impression that the career of the steward is risky, I'll delete it.
Coffee and newspapers can be obtained by travellers on arrival.
That would also reduce the cost," he says.
As an interest in security, the director of Asiana Alexej Litvin explains the lack of stewards in his buses. His company operates only a fraction of lines compared to Student Agency.
"We don't have Stewardssen, but we're already resisting ourselves from the beginning.
Sooner or later, this ended with some fatal accident," he had said not quite a year ago for Týden.cz.
That was an incredible tragedy.
A young stewardess from the Pilsen region, who had worked for the society for two years, was unhappy in the accident of a line bus to Naples.
The Slovenian truck was probably turned off from the stand without flashing and had blocked the bus.
The driver of the bus tried to escape by a sharp maneuver, but collided with the right front with the truck.
Jančura argues that the two places were sold for the stewards.
"These places can't be reserved for remote connections, they're blocked."
Company wants to sue truck drivers.
With compensation for the young woman's family, the agency will not wait for the court judgment, but will expect a financial compensation from the debtor as well.
A change of law?
Not in view
A more precise regulation of Stewards' movement on board a bus could bring a legal regulation that has been in operation for more than a year by a thirty-member team of experts from the Ministry of Transport.
"But this has not yet come to any specific conclusion.
Buses are also not necessarily on the agenda, rather the point system, the maximum speed on the motorway and the use of mobile phones on the journey," said professional Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the operations of the Stewards to be something that could significantly endanger the safety of travellers," said Hanzelka, with the control of the safety of buses in the competence of police and occupational safety authorities.
Düsseldorfer Hopes rest on Frankfurt
In the letter of the WestLB Board of Directors to the employees of the house, there are no major words.
By combining the units of the Düsseldorf money institution with the Frankfurter Deka bank, "the central capital market house of the Sparkassen-Finanzgruppe" (Sparkassen-Finanzgruppe) could be created, according to the letter that became known on Monday.
The WestLB introduced a "competence block" with sustainable profitability into such a business.
In any case, such a link could be the decisive reason for further mergers in the Landesbanken sector.
This is how it reads when a board wants to demonstrate its ability to act in a difficult time.
Because the hit WestLB is still under enormous pressure.
Not only by the European Commission, but also by the Federal Financial Service Supervisory Office, which the North Rhine-Westphalian state government recently made clear that it was time to find a future solution.
A connection between the Deka bank, which has always been connected with savings banks because of its investment funds, has been established, and the WestLB has been talking for some time, even on the Frankfurt side.
Although Deka-Bank-Chief Franz Waas, when presenting the half-yearly figures at the end of August, made known in a merger of the house on Mainz Landstraße with a Landesbank, such as the Helaba or the WestLB, he sees no meaning.
However, the Board of Directors of the Deca, which is each half borne by the Landesbanken and the savings banks associations, has commissioned the Executive Board to hold talks with the WestLB on joint business activities.
This could include capital market operations or parts of them.
The discussions have begun, of course, so it is at the financial centre.
The Deka Bank, which, with its 3000 employees, is one of the more important employers in the Frankfurt financial centre, is not the first time when it comes to consolidation in the savings banks sector.
In 2003 it looked like the Deka bank could merge with the Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and the Helaba for a moment.
But there was nothing out of this Trinitarian League.
As soon as the plans had become public, the Hessian state government opposed the participation of the Helaba in them.
The two other houses did not then find each other.
The Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz went to the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart instead.
However, there has always been thoughts about a connection between the Deka bank and Landesbanken.
Günther Merl, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Helaba, spoke against planning games about joining his house.
Regardless of this, however, it seems to mature the realization that a collapse of the various homes of the public-law sector is making trouble.
After the Landtag election in Bavaria is over, the BayernLB could begin by connecting it with the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg.
For the Helaba this is not necessarily a good news.
If the pressure is to rise to further mergers, you can gradually assume it by the partners.
In the south, she would only be a junior partner, although she has been much better able to cope with the financial crisis so far than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
In turn, the Sparkassen- und Giroverband Hessen-Thuringen, which is involved with 85 percent in the Helaba, introduced a barge at the beginning of the year.
In any case, remain the Nord LB.
Such geostrategic considerations are, however, only the one side.
On the other hand, it is about how the different business models of the individual houses fit together.
In June, Merl stated that the key question of which business model to ensure the future of the Landesbanken was not answered by the Deutsche Sparkassen- und Giroverband.
In the end, the West LB could also be disbanded, but it is not self-evident.
This is also the case in the letter from the Management Board there that a "total solution" will definitely be sought for the house.
How this can be done with the combination of individual units with the Deka bank, will show up.
The second weekend is known as the Italian weekend
For Elena it is the first, for Luca already the third or fourth time.
But this time Elena is there as his girlfriend, and so is everything different, he says.
Behind them, at the five-liter bierfass of the Kaiser brand, stands a massively built bearer and proves the about 200 Octoberfest travelers, which deep tones can produce his throat.
Elena gives Luca a bite, then a kiss.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From here, the bus park next to the Puorta Nuova train station, four buses will begin this evening at 23.45 a.m., "destinazione Monaco, festa della birra", arrival expected 6.30 a.m.
Three buses are mainly reserved for Italians, on a bus travel exclusively to Brazilians.
In a corner of the parking lot, the South Americaers already sing next to their flag, they have already celebrated at night.
And so loud, says Marco Guarda, that's nothing for Italians.
Marco, who wears a long coat with furzimitate lining and glasses with wide silver irons, is part of the buses.
They've been going to the Oktoberfest for five years, three tours alone this year.
At night, during the day on the Wiesn, back at 2.30 p.m.
Staying would only mean unnecessary donations, Marco says.
75 Euro costs the journey, the welcome sum with Kaiser-Bier, brewed faithfully to the Bavarian purity command, the health insurance and the German-speaking tour guide - Marco visited a language course in Frankfurt - including.
And the buses already roll into the night, on the Autostrada direction "Brennero".
There's no beer, not yet.
Quickly it will be quiet on the bus that travelers sleep.
Well, they're gonna need their powers.
In Brexen and in Holzkirchen, there will also be several other buses with Italian registration marks on the motorway 8 just before Munich.
When Marco's group finally arrives at the parking lot near the Theresienwiese at half past seven in the early morning, the 50 other buses from all over Europe are already standing there.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco holds a final address, explains the attack plan.
First of all, put on the yellow cup.
On it is left "Oktoberfest", in Fraktur, next to Marco's travel agency's internet address: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Secondly, "When the doors go up to the beer tent," Marco calls in the morning.
Run and occupy the squares in the rear part of the tent.
"Not in the front, otherwise we block, and not all yellow hats spread to the same benches, in the room!"
The measure, roars Marco, cost 8.25 euros.
And don't forget to drink.
"The security officers show that we are well behaved!
As soon as you leave places, they'll be gone!"
Third: "Today, point half eleven again in here!" You understand?
And it's gonna be all right.
On the way connects a yellow cap as a sign to the trees, to signs and even to the election poster of a large Bavarian People's Party.
You want to be used for the retreat.
It is the second weekend of the week, known as the Italian weekend.
There are no accurate figures; the mention is of 50,000 who are heading for the Alps and entering the beer tents, ten percent of all visitors are expected to have come from Italy on this weekend.
The Munich police are reinforced by seven police officers from South Tyrol, Italian volunteers support the Bavarian Red Cross, which leads a national statistics in which the Italians take first place in front of British (about 60 stakes) and Austrians (about 80) with around 200 medical care.
The farm is particularly popular with Italians.
Sleepless Nights for creditors of the Hypo Real Estate
The German banking system was relatively stable, emphasized Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück only last week.
How good that the politician used the word "relative" and also intervened that the German banking sector would not be spared from the crisis-like developments.
Because this is what happened on the weekend.
The Munich real estate financier Hypo Real Estate (HRE) listed in the Dax receives a billions of credit from a consortium of German banks in order to shield itself from the turbulences in the markets.
A person familiar with the situation said Reuters on Monday, the loan aid amounted to up to 35 billion euros.
The Hypo Real Estate only had to pay the part which it also claimed.
The money comes from both private and public banks.
The background is the loss of the daughter Depfa.
According to a newspaper report for long-term projects for which he has given money, the State financier had financed himself extremely short-term - which is no longer possible because of the distrust in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's cash reserve was reduced by 95 percent to EUR 2.37 million, and the equity ratio had also slightly declined from 1.6 to 1.45 percent.
The current income and net income from financial transactions fell to zero compared to the previous year's period, the proceeds from subscriptions to bonds and certain securities and the resolution of provisions in the credit business fell by more than 70 percent to EUR 5 million.
Only thanks to higher revenue from refunds from post-deposited conversion costs from the restructuring of the former Depfa Group and from the reimbursement of interest under the tax regulations and from the business services for group companies, the profit minus had fallen by around 16 percent even more moderate.
After his privatization in 1990, the former state financier had initially speculated with commercial real estate loans, which had then been distributed in the Aareal Bank.
Because it was too little to earn in the classical state financing, the Depfa had become more involved in infrastructure projects and the financing of joint projects by private investors and the state (Private Public Partnership, PPP) and internationally diversified.
On the value of the daughter, the Hypo Real Estate must now make depreciations that will have a "essential material effect" on the group's profit and loss account, it is quite undetermined.
The fact is that the dividend was deleted.
It had already been shortened by two thirds for 2007.
The Hypo Real Estate has been a major state and infrastructure financier since the takeover.
It is more dependent than other institutions on refinancing on the interbank market as it has no customer deposits.
With the collapse of the American investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, lending among the banks is again largely closed, as banks hear their liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate needs short-term funding for a part - around 50 billion euros - of the credit portfolio of the Depfa.
According to the statement of the Hypo Real Estate, the Group's financing needs are covered by the loan for a foreseeable period of time and shielded the company "from the influence of the currently largely infunctionable international money markets".
From other sources it can be heard that, thanks to the funds, refinancing is secured by the end of 2009.
HRE Chairman Georg Funke stated that the Hypo Real Estate Group would no longer have to use the money markets at a foreseeable time.
Bundesbank and the Federal Financial Services Supervisory Office (BaFin) assume that the marketability of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now guaranteed.
This is for shareholders and creditors of the Bank to hope.
But, given the dynamics and uncertainties of the crisis, there is probably no certainty.
It is not even inconceivable that funding should not be fully used.
But the opposite is not to be ruled out either.
After the late Sunday evening hearing after the bank was still ahead of insolvency, the at least temporary rescue could not calm the mind.
The share price begins by 75 percent at EUR 3.30.
The bond rates, on the other hand, are quite good.
While priority debt is scarcely moving, the rates of subordinated bonds are more clearly indicated.
The main concerns are the bonds of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo and, understandably, the durations beyond 2009.
There is a lack of hypo-real-estate bond previously a speculative investment alternative, so their relevance must be considered to be dependent on the stability of the international financial system after the significant tightening of the banking crisis and the institution itself, which with the adoption of the deppa, the crisis had only come into the house.
As long as the central banks, governments and less-favoured commercial banks are still ready to support the system, as long as the pensions can be reduced in time.
Or it does happen, which hardly anyone at present dares to hope - that the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
However, in view of the news of the sub-nationalization, only a legitimate hope has become due to the likelihood of security.
In particular, long-term believers should make up for some sleepless nights to decide whether to separate themselves from their engagements.
Short-term investors can nevertheless use a closing line to make a loss proposal for future tax payments on price gains of later years.
Sylvana and the Secrets of the Bento Box
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, is supposed to be introduced to Tachibana High School on the first day of school, the girls start to kick: Germans are "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from Mangas - in the new exchange log she tells of Japan.
"The first day of school in Japan.
I was excited.
I had Bammel before school.
I live on the edge of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and drive 40 minutes by train to Tachibana High School.
I had to find the way alone. Luckily, I didn't go.
The beginning of the class doesn't seem to be as strict at the Tachibana as it was with us at home in Lower Saxony.
The students enter from 8 a.m. until about twenty before nine a short meeting round begins with the teacher, the 'home room'.
But before the class began, I was ready to introduce myself.
I'm not the guy who likes to talk to people about it, even in front of a class of 40 students.
Because I had no school uniform yet, I put on an old skirt of my host mother, including blouse, blue knee stockings and black leather shoes.
So in this elevator I put myself in front of the pult and tried to say everything right: 'Sayonara Where she Sylvana...' - I'm called Sylvana, come from Germany and have a week's birthday.
At that moment, I was very happy that I had started learning the language just two years ago.
The 31 girls in class have all been buffed, ticked and won, and I have heard the word "Kawaii".
I already knew that from my mangas.
It belongs to the vital vocabulary of Japanese girls and means 'low, sweet'.
Then I went to my place quickly.
The girl next to me has limited quite wide, she found it an honor that the exchange student should sit next to her.
The rest of the hour was quite quiet, but when the Gong sounds, I was really bombarded.
Everyone talked through each other and tickled and asked me holes in the belly - it's really hard to understand Japanese English.
In the break, all of her bentos took off.
My host mother had made such a lunch box for me - that's something different from the öden German intermission bread.
I had rice with herbs, small sausages, salad of cucumbers and algae, fruit and some kind of meat in tofucoat.
Mostly I don't have a pale shimmer, which is exactly what I eat here in Japan.
Things look strange and taste completely new.
It says that everything is really delicious.
Well, perhaps to the salty plums, Brrrrr!
The Bentos are not just lunches at Japanese schools.
It sometimes happens that a girl gives a self-prepared bento to a boy, which she makes especially artisticly - hoping to get to know the boy in the breakup snack.
I read about that in my Manga comics.
I'm excited to see if I can watch this.
'Why Japan?' my girlfriends asked me when I told them that I wanted to go to school for a year in Tokyo.
I always said:
"Because I'm fascinated."
Finally, I have been reading Mangas for years.
And to make me better understand the comics and the culture in them, I also eventually started to learn a little Japanese.
So it was quite clear to me that I had to travel here sometime.
Because I also have a fable for tradition, customs and customs.
And on that one is very valuable here.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends - on the other hand, it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I have not felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the largest city I have ever seen."
Rats too have feelings
A rat or shawl flies in danger means that she feels fear too?
Neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux is convinced: many animals also have feelings.
Just how could you check if they feel the same thing if they behave like we do?
For several years, contributions from famous scientists have been published in the Internet journal " Edge".
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series selected answers to the question "What do you think you are true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have sensations and other states of consciousness, without I or anyone else having been able to prove this to date where we can't even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case we can at least hope that all human brains have the same basic configuration.
However, as soon as we turn to other species and raise questions of feeling or generally of consciousness, we enter a rigid terrain because the hardware does not agree.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same as many other animals: it kills, flees, or attacks.
People behave similarly, from which some scientists conclude a similar subjective experience.
However, I do not believe in that.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to transfer our subjective experience to that of animals.
For one thing, the circuits associated with human consciousness almost always include the side prefrontal cortex (because of its involvement in short-term memory and in the execution/control functions).
This broad region is much higher developed in humans than in other primates and seems to be completely lacking in other creatures.
At least in those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, including the knowledge of who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, there is reason to assume that man even differs from the other primates.
Another dramatic peculiarity may lie in the linguistic nature of man: since such a large part of his experience is associated with language, it is often said that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
But even though consciousness does not depend on language, it would certainly affect it, so that animal consciousness, as it may be acquired, probably differed very much from most of our state of consciousness.
Therefore, it is difficult to identify what consciousness may look like in other animals.
If, as something internal and subjective, it cannot be measured or, because of the special hardware, can be analysed by our own experience, then his research presents us with great problems.
Most of my statements relate to the content of conscious experience, but there is also another aspect of consciousness that should be scientifically accessible.
One could examine the processes of consciousness of animals without regard to their contents, and this is done in studies of the short-term memory of primates, especially in the example of visualization.
But in this approach, which Christof Koch and Francis Crick followed, one places rather on the neural correlates of consciousness than on the causal mechanisms: both may be identical or not.
Interestingly, this approach also emphasizes the importance of the prefrontal cortex for the state of visualization.
What results from the sensations?
I refer them back to the fact that an emotional system such as that of fear is activated in one of his own brains conscious of his own activity.
So what we call "fight" is the mental state in which we are located, when the activity of the immune system located in the brain (or its consequences, such as physical reactions) is evidence of memory.
In this way, sensations are closely linked to the regions of the Cortex, which mark primates and especially the people.
In combination with the linguistic nature, fine gradations of feeling arise because with the help of words and grammar we can differentiate and categorize states in order to attribute them alongside ourselves to others.
On the other hand, Antonio Damasio says that sensations result from more primitive activities in the body-feeling regions of the Cortex and the brain trunk are similar to Jaak Pankseep, which, however, concentrates more on the brain trunk.
Since this network has not changed very much in the course of human evolution, it may well be involved in cross-challenge sensations.
I can't disagree with that purely theoretically, but I think it is unproveable.
Pankseep argues that what appeared like fear in rats and humans is likely to feel that way in both cases: But how can one verify whether rats and humans feel the same thing if they behave similarly?
A sheep flees in danger, or does it feel fear?
In my eyes, mere behavioral similarity cannot yet prove equality of life.
Although the neural comparison helps: rats and humans have similar brain strains, shawls do not even have a brain.
But is the brain stem responsible for sensations?
And even if one could prove this to man: How did one want to prove it by rats?
I believe that rats and other mammals, perhaps even sheep (who knows?), have feelings.
But I don't know how to prove it.
And because their feelings are probably fundamentally different from ours (because human consciousness is based on special circuits and on language), I prefer to explore emotional behavior rather than the emotional sensations of rats.
In any case, progress on the neural level is taking place if one measures the same in rats and humans.
Just as I don't study language and consciousness in rats, I don't know if they exist.
You might think that's short-sighted, but I'd rather move on than run against a wall all the time.
I'm just a practical emotionalist.
Uefa President Platini: Time of grace for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Wasjunik said that preparations would soon be put under the direct responsibility of President and Prime Minister.
"The government sees Uefa's decision in Bordeaux as evidence of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organise the EM together with Poland," said Wasjunik.
"But this is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun and there is still much to do in both countries."
On the schedule for the construction or reconstruction of the stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, the two hosts hint behind.
Even the number of EM stations may be reduced from eight to six.
"We can no longer waste time.
We must now work at maximum speed," said Ukrainian president Grigorij Surkis.
"UFA will keep an eye on us all the time."
An even more radical step was taken in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish association PZPN has been suspended after numerous scandals by the National Olympic Committee and replaced by independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The Commission met at the request of Minister for Sports Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
"There is a serious risk that the PZPN will not be able to act according to the rules," said Drzewiecki of the Polish news agency PAP.
"We have assured Uefa President Michel Platini in a letter that the preparation for the EM 2012 will not suffer."
Several first-persons had been sentenced to a forced descent in the past season alone because of manipulation, after all, even the start of the league had to be postponed in the short term.
Empathetic Dennis Quaid Strikes Back
She wanted to promote a new film, talked about privates in an interview - and now has trouble with the ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan out of her lost Dennis Quaid as a adulterer.
He foams - and beats back.
Late Rose War with the ex-Ehepare Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors now have an unpleasant dispute with each other - all in public.
In an interview with the U.S. magazine InStyle last week, Meg Ryan had said for the first time on the reasons for the failure of marriage: "I had been unfaithful for a long time, and that was very painful."
The extent of the fraud has only brought them into experience after the divorce.
The reason for the soul striptease was Ryan's press work for her new film "The Women" - the story of a adultery is told.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his outing as an unfaithful husband was clear: "It's so bad," said the 54-year-old of the "New York Daily News" that "Meg repeatedly re-cooks and surrounds the history of our relationship".
It should also be "apprehensive" that the joint 16-year-old son Jack is again "remembered of the pain and the upheavals that mean divorce for every child."
While Ryan has lived alone since the divorce, Quaid has been married again and recently became father of Zwilingen.
And so he concludes his inceptions with the lateral hit: "My life goes on anyway.
I appreciate having a wonderful family that works well."
Check rates for tickets and hotels
In the first half of 2008, flights and nights in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
According to a current study, flights in Germany were reduced by up to 50 percent.
Flights and overnight stays in hotels have become cheaper - this is the result of a study by the American Express travel and financial service provider.
The company analysed its booking data from the first half of 2008 and, following an increase in prices in the first quarter, established a significant fall in the second quarter.
After years of rising prices on the hotel market, overnight stays have already been reduced in many places.
From January to March, prices in 41 out of 48 European cities were still rising by 6.9 percent on average compared to 2007.
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6% lower than in the previous year.
The trend was most evident in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than one year earlier.
As a reason for this, American Express sees the weak dollar price that has led to a "decreasing travel of American tourists".
Financial sites such as Frankfurt or London were also more affected by the decline in hotel prices than industrial sites such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices with an increase of 26.3 percent even keep the record in Europe.
Even during the flight prices, the trend in the first quarter was still up:
Due to the kerosene digestion, travellers in the economic class had to pay 7.1 percent more than 2007, fuel-intensive long-haul flights were even more expensive up to 29.2 percent.
From April to June, prices for economic-class tickets fell by an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, but in business and first class, price changes were much lower.
In Germany, prices broke down even more than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices had risen by 11.9%, and in the second quarter they fell by 23.6 percent.
According to the study, prices have even halved on German domestic flights.
The reason for the price collapse is, on the one hand, the downturn in economic growth, explains the company.
Demand in many segments of the air travel market is fragile.
On the other hand, the open-skies agreement, which liberalises air traffic between the USA and Europe, gives rise to increased competitive pressure.
Signs of the tense situation were the removal of unprofitable routes at airlines, as well as the high number of airlines that had filed bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 – in Europe alone, this was 24 airlines.
HSV Strikes Gladbach 1:0
With a gate and simple methods, the Hamburger SV will become a table leader.
At Borussia, Luhukay is still unable to find a functioning elf.
By Kristoffer Klein magnified rupture landing for national players Marko Marin.
The Gladbacher came into play late and failed with a lift to the Latte.
His message was precisely formulated, she went over the lips convincingly.
He simply knew he was right.
"We need the second gate," said Hermann Rieger at the Hamburger Arena cabin.
Much was not done in the catacombs, the half-time break had ended, and most of them sat back in their seats.
Rieger was the HSV's physiotherapist for almost three decades, and he enjoys a higher reputation than some lost player.
And so his request also found hearing in responsible place.
The assistant coach Cornelius Jol nodded and raised the thumbs accordingly.
Cornelius is the brother of Martin Jol, head coach of Hamburg.
His command will have been similar: Here with gate two!
The implementation was not completed.
"There wasn't everything nice to look at today," Marcell Jansen later admitted.
Bastian Reinhardt would also have wanted to be "more relaxed".
The 1:0 (1:0) are due to Mladen Petric's headball hit (11); and the fact that very weak Gladbachers could not hurt the weak hamburgers.
"It was a dirty victory," put Martin Jol together.
The Hamburg SV will be 121 years old this Monday.
On Saturday afternoon the spectators had already celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena and the lightning table on the video wall, which showed their club as a class primus.
It will be a birthday without a real party.
"We know that," Marcell Jansen said.
He suspects that the tabular intermediate product stands more for the unpredictability of the league than for the dominance of his HRV.
The team with its late-intentional entrances - the Brazilian Neves and Silva, the goalkeeper Petric and the Jansen rejected by FC Bayern - finds itself slow, but still does not manage to shine.
"We need more flair and more dribblings," Jol demanded.
After the vote
At Wall Street, fear is about.
First news of the failure of the rescue package temporarily allowed the Dow Jones to break in by 700 points.
That was the biggest point loss within one day in his history.
Later, the Dow caught something again.
At about 8:30 p.m., the world's most important stock exchange barometer recorded at a minimum of 10.579 counters.
The Nasdaq Technology Exchange was at 1548 points with more than seven percent in the minus.

No track could be added.
Bank Goldman Sachs' shares accounted for almost 10 percent.
Only a few days ago, large investor Warren Buffett had participated in the company.
As part of the rescue plan, the funds are to be allocated for the purchase of so-called lazy mortgage papers.
However, the sum should be paid out not on a stroke, but gradually.
In return, the State should receive stock option certificates from financial corporations that could be redeemed in the event of price developments in order to reduce the burden on the public funds.
Share rates in Europe and the USA in downwards
The billions of aid to banks in Europe and the US does not address the doubts of investors.

Dark Matter Affects Flight by Space Sins
For years, a mysterious phenomenon in research has caused a loss of counsel: Dark matter affects the speed of space probes during so-called swing-by-manives.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity could not be quite right.
The space probe "Ulysses" flowed through space for almost 18 years.
You now threaten the cold death because of fuel pipes that are soon to be freezed.
Among scientists, for years a mysterious phenomenon has caused confusion - the swing-by-anomaly.
The Swing-by is a flight maneuver of space probes in which they receive additional momentum in the gravity field of a celestial body, such as the Earth.
This allows the probes to save a lot of fuel.
The European-American research probe Cassini-Hoygens used this physical trick as well as the sun probe Ulysses.
What the researchers have been wondering for years, though: The missiles do not behave 100 percent as expected by the old-fashioned gravity law.
Rather, irregularities occur in the speed.
The probes are unexpectedly faster or slower.
So far, physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
They baptized him swing-by-anomaly.
Some experts fear that even the general relativity theory of Albert Einstein, which describes the attraction of matter through a curvature of space, could not be quite correct.
The American physicist Stephen Adler from Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study still firmly believes that Einstein was not wrong, and tries to explain the swing-by-anomaly with the help of the so-called dark matter that astronomers have made up the universe.
"Responsible for the anomaly could be dark matter, which could also be very close to the earth," he writes.
The space researchers have only known about the existence of dark matter for about ten years.
It is obvious that there is an attraction that can be observed on other celestial bodies.
On the other hand, it itself is completely invisible, that is, it sends and reflects no electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
According to the calculations of the scientists, the dark matter makes up a fifth of the entire mass of the universe.
Abducted tourists in Egypt are free
After ten days in the hands of their kidnappers, the tourists who are caught in Egypt are to be free again, as confirmed by the Italian Foreign Minister.
The kidnappers from Sudan had demanded several million euros of ransom.
In a shooting before release, six hostages should have been killed.
In southern Egypt, five Germans have been kidnapped.
Solvent negotiations are already under way.
Again and again Germans came into the sight of Kidnappers.
WORLD ONLINE describes the most important cases.
The European tourists that are caught in the Sahara are apparently free.
This was reported by Egyptian state television, the Arab TV channel Al-Arabija and Italian media.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release of reports from the Italian TV station Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and the other hostages have been liberated.
We're checking her health," Frattini said.
The five Germans, five Italians and one Romanians as well as their eight Egyptian companions are well-known and safe, reported Egyptian state television.
The 19 participants in a desert expedition should already be on their way to Cairo.
The background of a shooting before the hostages were released remains unclear: According to an Egyptian security officer, the kidnappers were ready to end the kidnapping before the Sudanese army was surprisingly killing six of the kidnappers.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed to a ransom," said the official.
It was "only about taking the hostages into reception" when suddenly "this surprise" came.
Sudanese soldiers shot six of the kidnappers and arrested two of them in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt on Sunday.
The hostages had demanded from Germany a ransom of six million euros; the money was to be handed over by the German wife one of the hostages.
The daily newspaper "El Masri El Jom" reported on a German mediator, the release of the hostages delayed because the Kidnappers feared their safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers intend to release the female hostages after payment of the ransom.
Men should be held until the kidnappers have a safe escape route.
The German Embassy in Cairo rejected an opinion on the report.
Abuse of stepfather "leaded to suicide"
Years of abuse by her stepfather has resulted in a woman’s killing, has been reported to a court.
Michael Trerise, 57, from Stithians, Cornwall, received a six - year prison sentence after he had suffered eight cases of sexual abuse.
The Truro Criminal Court found that he regularly tied his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle when she was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a confession: "I feel responsible for her death."
The court found out that Ms. Randle killed herself at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
When she lived as a child in Coventry, Trerise had tied her up and tied her eyes before performing sexual acts while her mother was away to work in a restaurant.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s and he moved back to Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
However, the court found that Mrs. Randle, who worked honorably for the National Trust for a large part of her time, was persecuted by abuse that had been added to her twice a week.
Prosecutor Ramsay Quaife told the court that friends had said that Mrs. Randle, who had been an zealous surfer and cyclist, had been "emotionally dead" since 2006 and had "gave up her life"
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her home in Plymouth.
It is assumed that she killed herself by suffocating through a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted the stepfather of his daughter, who wrote a letter of confession, who ended up saying, "I used to bind her and bind her eyes."
"I didn't need her sexually.
I feel responsible for her death."
Judge Christopher Elwen said to Trerise: "They are an extremely strange fetishist and it must have been frightening for her victim, especially since she was only seven.
This inconvenient story ends with the victim's suicide.
Worse still is the fact that it is very unlikely that the case would have ended in court if it had not done so."
He added: "I take note of the effects, according to the description of Stephanie's father and mother, on her daughter over the years.
She would otherwise have been a promising, successful and happy young woman."
Officials responsible for lost data are sued
The BBC has learned that the Cabinet official, who had lost strictly confidential documents in a train in June, will be sued in accordance with the Public Security Act.
The man was seconded by the Ministry of Defense when he lost two extremely confidential documents on a train to Waterloo.
The documents were handed over to the BBC before they were handed over to the police.
It is the weakest charge within the law and there is no indication of criminal intent.
BBC defense correspondent Frank Gardner said the action was a surprise to many in Whitehall.
He said, "You would have thought that this would be done internally with the Ministry of Defense and Cabinet."
In accordance with paragraph 8.1 of the Law, the employee whose names cannot be named is charged with the clause dealing with the safe storage of information.
The Royal Procuratorate recommended that the official be sued by the Metropolitan Police for the most sensitive nature of his work in the Joint Security Committee.
The documents he published contained classified reviews of Al-Quaida and the capacities of Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was taken from his house to a secret place.
View housing companies B&B Costs
After the rescue of the Bradford and Bingley Bank, British housing companies could spend more than 80 million pounds in the house.
The government made 14 billion pounds available to protect Bradford & Bingley's deposits 2.6 million customers.
The interest on this loan is paid by all companies that receive money from investors, including the 59 construction companies
The Director-General of the Association of Housing Companies (BSA), Adrian Coles, said that it was "unbearable" that companies and their members should pay.
Finally, the 14 billion loans will be repaid if Bradford & Bingley's loans are cleared.
However, the interest accumulated in the meantime will each year be counted as the 700 financial enterprises that accept deposits.
The financial services compensation programme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 housing companies were included in this figure.
It is bitter that those institutions that have behaved cautiously ... are now called upon to take over some of the costs of those institutions that were far less cautious.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It said that each company would have to pay in relation to the deposits it would hold, and that the companies together would have to pay about 18% of the costs.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that interest on credit will amount to 450 million pounds in 2009.
This means that companies have to purchase 81 million pounds for the first year's interest rates.
Adrian Coles, the Director-General of the Association of Housing Companies, told the BBC that he believed this was unfair.
It is bitter that those institutions that have behaved cautiously during the property recovery are now called upon to bear some of the costs of those institutions that were far less cautious.
According to the BSA, no company has failed since the existence of the records in 1945.
"We will observe all aspects of this over the next few weeks to see what alternatives there are to protect housing companies and their members from potentially considerable costs."
Interests due in 2009 cover the seven months of the end of September this year until the end of March.
In 2010 interest rates will be due for a full year and this could be almost twice as much.
Since construction companies are both-sided organisations without shareholders, their members will have to pay for the costs either through higher fees or lower interest rates on savings accounts.
Milk becomes five pence per litre more expensive
People in Jersey are confronted with having to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy has announced that it will raise the wholesale price of his milk by another five Pence per litre from Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after a two Pence increase in February, and comes after examinations of a consulting firm.
Retailers should decide for themselves whether they wish to pass on the price increase to their customers.
Before the increase in prices in February, the Jersey Milk wholesale price was last changed in 2002.
The former Prime Minister of Bangladesh is denied security
A trial in Bangladesh has rejected a security inquiry from former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, which means that she could be arrested if she returns to the country.
Their defenders said that the court refused security regarding the charge of having extorted 50 million Taka ($729,700) by a businessman while she was Prime Minister.
The case is one of several suspended charges for corruption against them.
Sheikh Hasina's long-standing political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released against bail at the beginning of this month.
Sheikh Hasina is supposed to return to Bangladesh in the next few weeks, but her party, the Awami Alliance, demanded that the military-based transitional government give her full freedom at first.
Correspondents say that, although their detention was granted to go abroad for medical treatment, it is not clear as part of their release whether they will be able to continue on their own if they return to Bangladesh.
Their lawyers state that they will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the decision of the Supreme Court.
"The upper court has rejected Sheikh Hasina's security petition, because it says that she should not be granted a deposit, as she is already on detention abroad to be treated abroad," said Rafique-ul Huq, her lawyer.
We will file a complaint against the upper court."
Their lawyers apply that they would need security to return from abroad to prepare for the December elections.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return home after October 17th, said an Awami Alliance chairwoman on Sunday.
She was detained last year after the army-supported transitional government had taken over power, but was released from prison in June to go abroad for medical treatment.
Sheikh Hasina, as well as Khaleda Zia, denied all charges.
Fears of the Anti-Polio Initiative in Afghanistan
According to the United Nations, in the recent anti-polio initiative in Afghanistan, almost 200 000 children have not been vaccinated because of the violence associated with the Taliban.
The United Nations carried out a vaccination programme in six provinces last week.
However, they could not reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for security reasons.
According to a UN spokesperson, this was the case despite the Taliban's promise not to attack or hinder thousands of people carrying out vaccinations.
BskyB loses claim in the ITV case
BskyB has lost its claim against the decision of the Competition Commission to reduce its share of the competing ITV channel.
The competition court ordered BskyB to reduce its participation in ITV from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
Previously, the Commission had claimed that the share of BskyBs distorts the competition and allowed it to have an unfair influence on ITV.
BskyB acquired its share in 2006 by successfully preventing NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the competition authority reported that BskyB had doubts about the independence of the ITV, which led the Competition Commission to launch an investigation.
The Virgin Boss Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and the communication office Ofcom voted against the purchase.
BskyB argued that the pressure to reduce its share of ITV was an unreasonable and exaggerate measure, in particular because BskyB had announced that he wanted to give up his voting rights.
New investigation in the U.S. prosecutor's office
The U.S. Advocate General has commissioned a specialist to deal with the termination of the nine prosecutors in the USA in 2006.
The reason was a report by the General Inspector of the Ministry of Justice criticising the actions of the administration staff.
The report criticised the officials of the White House, legislators and former Advocate General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was driven by the fears that the lawyers had been dismissed for political reasons.
The specialist agent Nora Dannehy is now to clarify whether the officials interviewed during the investigation have lied to the investigators in order to hinder justice.
Serious accusations including criminal actions have not been fully investigated or clarified, said General Inspector Glenn Fine in his report.
The appeal of a specialist agent with the power to force the witnesses to testify was one of his main recommendations.
The conflict began when the Ministry of Justice deposed nine U.S. prosecutors from their offices in December 2006.
At that time, the Ministry argued that the prosecutors would be released from work due to poor performance.
However, it was later found that the dismissed prosecutors had not been judged worse than many of their colleagues, which led many observers to consider the terminations politically motivated.
Some of these prosecutors were involved in the judicial persecution of high-ranking Republican Congress members, while others refused to investigate the accusations of evangelism of the Democrats.
U.S. prosecutors are assigned to investigate and prosecute judicial cases for the government.
They may be dismissed at any time, but may not be dismissed for political reasons.
The then Head of the Ministry of Justice, Advocate General Alberto Gonzales, has been arrested and has finally settled.
A number of officials from the Ministry of Justice have also resigned.
In particular, the report of the General Inspector addressed the role of Gonzales by bearing the "main responsibility" for the redundancies, giving up his leadership role and showing himself "exceptionally desinterested" in the process
Other officials, including former chief adviser to President Bush Karl Rove, were criticized for the lack of cooperation with the investigators.
Meat Loaf's epic song is to be honored
The Rockstar Meat Loaf is to be honoured for his epic anthem "Bat Out Of Hell" during the "Q Award" music award ceremony.
The singer, who will accept his special golden prize next week in London during the award, said he was honored to be recognized.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of Meat Loaf's Hit Album from 1977.
"Coldplay" introduces the nominations for awarding this year after it has come into the narrower selection in four categories.
The editor-in-chief of the magazine "Q Magazine" Paul Rees said that there would be some songs that go beyond such materials as time and genre and "Bat Out Of Hell" would certainly be one of them.
The song written by Jim Steinman required a strong voice delivered by Meat Loaf.
It starts with an instrumental part that lasts almost two minutes.
The song was released on sale in the UK as a single in 1979 and reached number 15 in the charts.
However, Meat Loaf's "Bat Out Of Hell" has spent about nine years in the charts and sold more than 40 million times worldwide.
Meat Loaf, whose real name is Marvin Lee Aday, has suffered from serious health problems in recent years. One of them was an operation in 2003 because of irregular heartbeats after he collapsed on stage.
In 2007, he had to cancel concerts due to acute throat inflammation.
Later it became known that he had a cyst on his vocal band.
Obscure street in town, often forgotten and possibly soon to sell
New York City has thousands of main traffic roads, only, side roads and other surrounding roads, some of which are famous and others are only comfortable.
Nevertheless, it is difficult even for experienced taxi drivers and long-standing residents to say where Extra Place is located, simply because most have never heard of it.
This tiny street is located in the East Village and runs from First Street north between Bowery and Second Avenue, without reaching Second Street.
It is 30 feet wide and 120 feet long and looks more like a dusty alley than after an active transit road.
There are no street signs either.
It is practically impossible to find them on a standard street plan.
This street still has its admirers.
For example, Avalon Bay, a construction company that recently built luxurious buildings on First Street.
It wants to retrace Extra Place to create a clean passage to the stores and boutiques that are expected in the new buildings.
Among the other admirers is the long-standing neighborhood, which says that it is fascinated by the short alley, simply because it is one of the remains of the house block.
However, the city administration department, which is responsible for the protection and construction of the residential buildings and is responsible for the road, has no interest in receiving them.
During a meeting of the City Council's Land Use Committee this month, representatives from the City Administration and Avalon Bay have designed a proposal for the street purchase by the construction company.
Nevertheless, the committee prefers that the street remains in the hands of the city, and has asked for a new plan to be presented in the coming month, said Susan Stetzer, the district officer in the municipal council 3.
"Only very little space has remained in the possession of the city and we want Extra Place to continue to belong to the city," she said.
"There could be offers on how to fix and operate the road, what Avalon could do, but we also want public access to remain guaranteed."
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that the small road was newly built and that the company would like to rent space, among other things, for a café.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the road was made public for the first time during the meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, a spokesperson from Avalon Bay, said that although the company wanted to use the road, it does not necessarily want to own it.
"The main concern of Avalon Bay is to renovate this fallen alley and make it a public meeting place," she said, adding that the city itself had proposed the sale.
Seth Donlin, spokesperson of the Building Protection Department, said that it was actually the city's desire to sell the road and stressed that the department's task was to develop the property rather than manage it.
Compared to its colorful neighborhood The Bowery, Extra Place has maintained some of its historical impression.
Some believe that the street got its name in 1802, when a large farm that Philip Minthorne belonged to was divided between his many children and a narrow strip of land was not claimed by any.
The back door of the CBGB music club, the punk rock monument, which was closed in 2006, opened to the Extra Place and the road is definitely best known as a backdrop for the photo on the cover of Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia".
The patch was great, said Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones who had taken the photo in November 1976.
The road was full of scraps, rags and parts of barrels, posters, leaves and ropes.
Some residents, including the bloggers who write about the gentrification of the East Village, have rejected the idea of selling Extra Place, with the argument that this public property, as modest as it is, should continue to remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rarity – a virtually unchanged splitter of the city that should be left in peace.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs the blog called "Jeremiah's Disappearing New York" (titled "The Book of Complaints: A bitter nostalgic view of the dying city"), has published a part of the conversation of the city history about Extra Place, which was published in the journal "The New Yorker" in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote at that time: "Extra Place is a small narrow dead end, which even during the day remains dark and is marked by rusty metal doors of the warehouses, closed windows and flying weeks of newspapers flying along rainhouses."
With a few exceptions, the road has looked just as recently on an evening.
A rat ran through the back part of the road, not far from the door that once led to the CBGB, where today is a more expensive clothing business.
Graffiti was on the walls and an empty beer bottle lay on the ground not far from a fresh bundle of arranged newspapers.
Some passersby said they had rarely thought about Extra Place, but suggested that the road could be polished up a little.
Fields, added that in his opinion, some people underestimate the attraction of the road in their current state.
The best years of my life, he said, were in the places that were dark, wet and disgusting.
The debate on bilingual training: education in English-speaking environments
In this edition of the Education Watch Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the positions of the candidates for bilingual training.
Lance T. Izumi, senior scientific staff in California Studies and senior director of the Department of Education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a co-author of the book "Not as good as you think: why the middle class needs a school selection".
Addressing the Hispanic voters is a complicated task.
Barrack Obama's proposals on education are a typical example of this.
Obama's election campaign mentions that "the probability of afro-American and hispanic students successfully completing school is lower than with white students" - which is true.
In order to close this gap, Obama's educational plan recommends, among other things, a bilingual transition phase in training for those who learn English first.
However, the question of Obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which focuses on teaching in languages other than English, contradicts his interest in reducing the distance in school benefits.
Let us take as an example Sixth Street Prep, a primary school in eastern Los Angeles.
Most of the students are hispanic and come from low-income families.
More than one third of the students, many of whom are only recently in the country, learn English.
Nevertheless, in 2008 amazing 100 percent of fourth-class students passed the state exam in Mathe at a good level.
Also surprising were 93 percent of children from the fourth year of school in the English exam considered good.
This amazing success was achieved with methods other than those preferred by Obama.
School Sixth Street focuses on review and exercise, on continuous control of knowledge and a position that does not tolerate exceptions.
The school also practises the approach by which the training is carried out in an English-speaking environment. That is exactly the point that Obama should take into account, says headmaster Linda Mikels.
This approach values the almost exclusive use of the English language in specialist teaching.
Mrs Mikels, who rejects the idea of bilingual training, told me that the school had a remarkable success with a student who had just arrived from Mexico. 12 months later, one would enter the classroom and can no longer recognize him.
"It works," she said, "it works for us."
Would Obama take a school like the Sixth Street Prep as a model for other schools with a large proportion of Latin American and other English-learning students?
The school’s services would make the answer to this question easy, but the educational positions within its own party (the national associations of images have long supported the idea of bilingual training) and its own consistent support of bilingual training make predictions about Obama’s response uncertain.
While agreeing with the point that immigrants should learn English, he recently triviated the subject by noting that people should stop worrying about the legislation aimed at "only English".
Instead, he said, "You should make sure that your child can Spanish."
If Obama really wants to close the performance gap, he should take into account carefully educational models that work instead of despising and trivializing them.
The price of oil is falling as a result of new fears around the economy
The price of oil on Monday has fallen strongly because of the fears that even the American rescue plan for the financial markets could not suffice to revive the economy.
The crude oil-mining operations at the New York Trade Exchange fell by 7 percent to $99.80 per barrel in the morning session.
Since last Monday, the price has fallen by more than $20.
In the last two weeks, goods markets have been shaken by financial turbulences on Wall Street and by strong cyclones in the Gulf of Mexico.
After the prizes reached their peak of $145.29 per barrel in July, this month they fell to almost $90 per barrel to rise again, as a result of the enormous uncertainty in the financial markets.
On Monday investors had already shown concern, although Congress representatives had announced that they had agreed on a rescue plan on the weekend, which should be the largest in history.
This message was overshadowed by new concerns that the financial crisis has not yet been completed by far.
In the first chapter of the growing crisis, according to a government announcement on Monday, the Citigroup is expected to buy up the bank operations of Wachovia Corporation.
In the meantime, Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalized the European financial group Fortis.
According to analysts at Barclays Capital, despite the tense negotiations that took place on the weekend and led to a rescue plan, it seems that there was no way of enhancing the mood on the markets.
As the economic situation continues to deteriorate, demand for goods, including oil, is expected to continue to decline.
In a communication to investors, analysts of the Deutsche Bank have written that forecasts for global capital markets, interest rates and exchange rates have become extremely uncertain.
We believe that they will continue to write that the goods markets will also be affected.
"From the perspective of the goods markets, we are most concerned about whether the US virus spreads worldwide, especially to China."
The bank’s analysts have corrected their oil consumption expectations as a result of weak economic growth for the coming year and reduced their forecast for the 2009 oil and gas price by 20%.
Team record by series in the second quarter set up
Interior defenseman Shaun Ellis thought that he had seen everything after he had spent the last eight and a half years more than any other one in the jets jersey.
Then on Sunday he saw the second quarter in which the jets turned an ineffective game into a triumphal move.
"I've never seen anything like it," said Ellis.
After a sloppy game between the jets and the Arizona Cardinals, which corresponded to the bad weather, the second quarter began.
However, when Quarterback Brett Favres Pass arrived at Lavernues Coles for a 12-yard touchdown, this marked the perfect start to an afternoon when her developing collaboration took a big step forward.
Favre found Coles in this quarter for two more touchdowns, which once slipped out as an outside defenseer and the other once 10 seconds before the end of the half-time.
"I didn't work hard," says Coles about the passports that went to Coles.
"He's a superplayer.
Our vote has voted, no matter what people think."
While Favre and Coles played catch, the defense took quarterback Kurt Warner apart.
Foreign defender Darrelle Revis caught a bad throw and turned it into a 32-yard touchdown.
Libero Erik Smith came to another pass and caught him off.
Linebacker David Bowens then caused a loss of Warner.
The last ball loss, forced by Bowens, was probably the craziest.
The Cardinal had conquered the ball with another 10 seconds in the game when the jets conquered the ball and Jay Feely turned a 20 yard shot to 34 to 0 lead.
These were most points that the jets had ever achieved in a quarter.
When he was asked to describe the madness, did Erik Mangini, the coach of the jets "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
To the answers both, because the jets allowed 21 points in the third quarter without achieving one, Mangini said, "I believe I enjoyed the second quarter more than the third.
A lot of points were achieved in a short time."
Exploited Brotherhood Strikes His World Record
Haile Gebrselassie from Ethiopia has again shown why some hold him for the best long-distance runner of all time, after he broke his own record in the Berlin Marathon on Sunday and became the first person to make the 42.2 km route in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With the victory on the flat course in 2:03:59, Gebrselassie improved his previous result of 2:04:26 by 27 seconds, which he had achieved last year in Berlin.
Gebrselassie, 35, has thus set up his 26th world record in his versatile career, in which he at least achieved a World Championship title or set a world record on every route from one kilometer to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie released the Olympic Marathon in Beijing, because of fear that might have been exaggerated in the aftertaste that air pollution could worsen its asthma problems.
Instead, he applied for the competition in Berlin.
In almost ideal conditions - with sun and 9 degrees at the start and 13 degrees at the finish - Gebrselassie has won at an average speed of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
Since long-haul track runners such as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat from Kenya have changed, the record time for marathon in the last 10 years has fallen by more than 2 minutes, since Ronaldo da Costa won from Brazil in 1998 in Berlin with the result 2:06:05.
After his victory on Sunday, Gebrselassie told the press that he had had cramps in his carte two weeks ago and was therefore unable to train a week.
Obviously, he was refreshed after a break and did not come back.
"I'm so happy," he said to reporters.
"Everything went perfectly.
I resumed the training a week ago and still had some concerns, but at the end what's great."
He was criticized for this - especially in Kenya, Ethiopia's rivals from East Africa - that he orchestrated his racing races overly, many world's best marathon stars generally avoided being too much on the race leaders as if it were a race, and world records about the competition.
But this critique hardly harms the size of the brusselassies as long-distance runner.
Accompanied by four Kenyans on Sunday, Gebrselassie had reached the center of the route in 1:02:04.
Two elite runners from Kenya, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi continued to challenge Gebrselassie after the Tempomacher left.
A little more than three miles before the finish, Gebrselassie made its final start to separate from Kwambai, who came second in 2:05:36 and thus improved his best time by almost 5 minutes.
Kamathi became third in 2:07:48.
In women, Irina Miktenko, originally from Kazakhstan and now German, completed a remarkable year by showing the seventh fastest result of all time at 2:19:19.
The world record of 2:15:25 is held by Paul Radcliff from Great Britain.
In the last spring, the 36-year-old Miktenko had won the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She missed the Beijing games due to problems described as back injury. However, she recovered to win in Berlin and to improve her best time in her third marathon by five minutes.
She has planned to run her course by allowing a quartet of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners to crack out first, but after 30 kilometers she overtook.
Askale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia was second in 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop from Kenya arrived as third in 2:25:01.
The pride and rhinestones in the life of the black population, in a very special city
Hidden between the growths of the leisure parks in the vicinity of Orlando, a few miles away from the glittering, loud and gigantic drifting, is a quiet city where pride and complications of African American culture appear.
Eatonville, the first entirely black town in the country and the home town of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as easy to describe as Hurston did in 1935: "the city with 5 lakes, three crockets, 300 brown hides, 300 good swimmers, more than enough guavas, 2 schools and no prison."
Today it is a pilgrimage place.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville to commemorate the most famous author of the Harlem Renaissance.
And yet, the city she describes is and remains – and it has made it a tourist destination by including it in the Florida travel guide, which was produced at the time of depression by the federal author project – in many ways a place of the very special kind.
Eatonville is as independent, generous and private as in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural black communities in Florida often refused to share their true thoughts with the white man who "knows so little about us that he doesn't know what's missing."
Even today, in a year when a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, calls for an open conversation on racial relations, many of us continue to feel sorry to be watched by outsiders.
"We are very concerned about how our story is told," said Hortense Jones, 59, from birth to a resident of the city and parishioner of the oldest church in the city.
It has to be true."
Eatonville was long defined as the paradox of triumph and battle.
It is both a historical example of the black movement and a community of almost 2,400 inhabitants in which the poverty rate is twice as high as the national average.
On the one hand, it is a stronghold of literature and on the other hand an example of the - sometimes condemned, sometimes praised - black culture of the rural south, which has its roots in American slavery.
It is not surprising that residents are both proud and on the hat.
And so right, the concerns about Eatonville's image actually began with Zora, as all the Hurston call here.
She presented her home town in books that came from the heart and were written in Mundart, such as "Mules and Men" (1953) and "There Eyes were watching God" (1973)
Five paragraphs in the Florida guide changed the city, which is very close to Route 77, a road that leads through the often forgotten centre of Florida, to the scenes of black history and human drama.
Frech as well as Oskar both in real life and literature, Hurston led readers to the shop of Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then turned to more private affairs.
"Outside the road to the left," she wrote, "is the brown-white-painted modern school, with its well-kept gardens and playgrounds that always care for Howard Miller, although he can hardly read and write."
She also mentioned the new man of Witwe Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "sold drinks of any kind and what-it-all-hour-rooms."
In just a few hundred words, Hurston thus linked Eatonville with self-government, but also with illiteracy, second marriage and sex.
This was certainly not a travel guide.
In fact, this was not a portrait that was appreciated by all.
"Zora described things as they were," said the 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of Johnson's girls who immortalized Hurston by quoting the men who sang songs about their beauty, which were full of sexual allusions.
She added, "Some people didn't like this."
One still remembers Hurtson as a lively eccentricist who regularly returned after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Augustus Franklin, 77, remembered that when Hurston came into the city, she did so mostly without warning, in a noisy Chevrolet, smoking and clothed with pants, in a city that today is a bit imagining on its honorable dress style.
According to Mr Franklin, most of the inhabitants were fascinated, whereas many despised them.
"People were always happy to see Zora," said Mr. Franklin.
But "She never stayed too long," he added as he rocked in his chair, on a back terrace looking at the Lake Sabelia, in which Hurston was probably baptized.
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were abandoned.
Together with most of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten them.
Although she was once a famous author, a contemporary of Langstin Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an anonymous grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she lived.
In Eatonville there was no great commemoration, no public readings in great style.
"I don't think they understood her contribution in the world or her heritage in the least," said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows", a biography about Hurston, published in 2003.
The turn came in the 1980s.
Orange County authorities wanted to pass a five-track highway through the city to replace the Kennedy Boulevard, the slow two-track main road of the municipality.
Orlando's suburbs had already pushed the highway 4 through the western outskirts.
The proposal was made when Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult phase in his history.
Forced integration, among other things, had put an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the struggle against racial mingling brought hatred to the community.
"At that time a bunch of white boys often came and they threw oranges and stuff on the people sitting away," said Mr. Franklin.
"There was even a woman who was killed.
They threw a watermelon out of the car."
In 1955, in a letter to the Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the claim of the Supreme Court to force integration by calling his decision in Brown against the School Council "regulatory rather than respecting my race".
Today, residents say that although the abolition of racial separation was positive in some respects, it weakened the group concentration in Eatonville and the self-confidence of its young people.
"Black children were used to being hugged - I remember - they hugged his teacher in the morning and they hugged his teacher in the evening," said N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and managing director of the non-profit group to protect the Eatonville community.
This could be maintained for so long, she added until teachers and students no longer came from the same place.
"You didn't embrace his white teacher because he was a white teacher - I mean there's a cultural gap present," said Ms. Nathiri.
However, citizens' rights have contributed to the creation of space for further Zora Neale Hurstons - black authors, actors and artists who have turned away from prejudices, as they did, with positive self-confidence and statements such as: "How can anyone refuse the joy of my society!
I don't understand."
In 1975, the writer Alice Walker headed for Hurston's nameless grave and began to fight for the revival of her fame.
Five years later, a much praised Hurston biography by Robert E. Hemenway was found in the bookshelfs and made it part of the American literary canon again.
The Fernstraße project came exactly at a time when Eatonville's most famous daughter was once again in the public light.
And this time Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a saviour.
The municipality began in 1988 with the planning of a Hurston festival to show what the district could destroy by building the motorway.
Thousands of fans came to the opening event two years later, and every January many return for the celebration.
A few years later, the district turned away from its road plans.
"The plans of a five-track long-distance road revived the city, speeded it up at top speed, aroused real citizen's pride," said Ms. Nathiri.
Ms. Boyd put it a little easier: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory against the highway project has contributed to a change in the city's self-image.
There were more and more guests, such as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who has been going to the church since 1993, and locals began to appreciate the past again.
Eatonville was incorporated into the national historical register in 1998.
A new one-storey library (of course named after Hurston) opened in 2006 on the newly paved and decorated Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville is still a speciality in Florida: only 6 miles from the city centre of Orlando can feel like a back alley in the summer rain, as small as when it was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(She's 90% black today.)
Outside in search of Eatonville's history and its significance are often still treated with caution.
For most interviews, approval is necessary in advance and certain things - such as the wall painting of Eatonville's oldest church, painted by a white man and being black men at field work - must not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Mrs. Jones, a courageous, self-confident teacher with a preference for dark red, still fear that her shielded community is misunderstandingd.
And yet, at the same time as the Hurston Festival grew bigger, a higher degree of domestic pride was also born.
Especially young people tend to see Eatonville as Hurston saw her entire race: beautiful, with all his problems, neither worse nor better and as proud, creative and diligent, boisterous and mixed as any other racial and ethnic group in America.
It is the genuine love of this city that can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin's nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who was planning to return to Eatonville to work in the city administration or at the police, who could use some help from him.
And even the disciples, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, eleven-year-old twins from Winter Park, have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people who go through only here will think, "Oh, this town is nothing compared to all the others," said Alondra Kenon recently on one Sunday after the church.
"But if you actually stop and look at your story for a moment, it's a very nice city."
Here with us in New York speaking fluent financial latent.
At first glance, nothing changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the newspapers and the huge TV screens in Times Square, they would not notice that they are in the middle of a debacle.
They would never believe that over their heads, in the shoebox-like offices with the glass facades, bankers and hedge fund administrators who have the monopoly in New York, have the worst horror working day daily since the fall of 1929.
Suppliers still push with loud flaps the metal tea weighs along sidewalks and transport tablets loaded with muffins for breakfast sessions.
Latinos still swoop between apartments, like human packing animals loaded with around 50 tied T-shirts hanging on a yoke-like rod lying on their shoulders.
Office workers are still waiting for food on the sidewalks on their breakfast ball and it is still impossible to get a yellow taxi on a weekday between 16 and 19 o'clock.
It didn't feel like a crisis at all until I decided to open a new savings account on the basis of all of the world's downside speech on Thursday afternoon.
Although I had decided to lay my duty on the quiet late afternoon in my JP Morgan Chase branch, about 20 people were already in line.
Not at the money desks to collect or pay money, but at the customer service desk where regular customers order checkbooks, ask tourists for the way to the Macy's department store and where new customers open accounts.
Most before me, so I learned later from Starr, my "personal banker with license", stood for the same reason as I used to.
unlike me, however, they had already removed their savings from smaller banks, in places from where they were commuting, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They had withdrawn money from so-called Thrifts (a little bit of a building savings bank), cooperative banks and those local savings banks that only have branches in a state, and say they treat their customers like family.
Last year 15 of these banks went quietly and quietly.
In the last few days, Washington Mutual, a bank with investments of $327 billion, went home in bankruptcy management and last Friday New Yorker drove home over the weekend, was Wachovia, another bank that owns savings facilities worth $440 billion, looking for a rescue buyer.
In the fear of another collapse, the office and shopkeepers who stood in front of me brought their bares to a bank that is considered a safe port, a bank that is responsible for most rescue purchases on Wall Street.
Normal New Yorkers have become fluent in the last few weeks.
A woman who telephoned in my Chinese tribal supermarket was so familiar with Lehman Brothers, the Pleite gone bank and their eerie Chairman Dick Fuld as if she were blasphemous about a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, who around the 50-year-old uniformed concierge of my house block, came from our usual entertainment topics about Brad and Angelina and my food supply.
"I now have all my savings in money market funds," she told me after my visit to the bank.
"I've changed, I'm not going in any more Risco."
Muslim graves damaged while right-wing slides in Austria
Heinz-Christian Strache, a left-wing judge of the Austrian Right-wing Freedom Party, and Filip Dewinter, a member of the Belgian Right-wing Pertei Vlaam's interest, will participate in a demonstration in Antwerp on Thursday, 17 January 2008 to represent the organisation "Citys against Islamization".
They carry signs in the style of traffic signs on which a mosque is depicted, stretched through with a red line.
The police accuses right-wing extremists of the grave damage to a Muslim cemetery in Austria, on the same weekend at the extreme right-wing party's significant profits in the country's parliamentary election.
In the night from Friday to this morning, more than 90 graves were severely damaged at the cemetery in Traun near Linz in an action organized, according to police.
The perpetrators sprayed Jewish symbols like the David Star on some of the graves, but criminals consider this an attempt to conceal the motive of the extremists driven by hatred on Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident is in any way related to the elections.
A spokesperson of the local Islamic community said she was "too deeply shaken" about the message of the grave damage that took place when the religious month of Muslim Ramadan inclined to the end.
At the same time, there is a round of research of conscience in Austria after the country slid to the right in the yesterday's parliamentary election.
The FPÖ and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, the two far right-wing parties who received almost 30% of the votes, advocated a strict anti-immigrant law in their campaign, and some of their elections were criticized by opponents as hostile to the outside.
Heinz-Christian Strache, chairman of the FPÖ, who won 18% of the votes, advocated a ban on head cloths and burkas and even made known his aversion to foods that are generally associated with Islam.
At his last rally in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties want to prohibit the construction of mosques and minarettes with the argument that these are political symbols of a continuous Islamisation of Austria and Europe.
Surveys and analyses carried out immediately after the election, stating that the extreme rights of the most politically strong block in the country, indicate that this new development is based on young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
International travel lock for Gary Glitter
Gary Glitter, the Glam Rockstar, who has been sentenced to sexual abuse of children, was tried to travel to France and Spain.
Judges placed a six-month lock on Glitter after informing the controlling authorities that he wanted to travel to Spain via France.
The Kent police were granted to hang a foreign travel barrier last Thursday, after presenting judges with evidence of glitter pre-punishment for the sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, the correct name Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at the Ashford District Court in Kent, but was represented by the law firm Corker Binning.
One speaker of the Court of Justice reported: "On Thursday 25 September, the police asked Kent at Ashford District Court to prevent travel abroad from Mr. Paul Glad to France and Spain until 25 March.
Paul Gadd was not personally present."
As required by the register for sexual offenders, Glitter, 64, had informed the authorities that he wanted to travel abroad.
He must inform the authorities if he wants to travel abroad for more than three days.
He must also notify the police 7 days before his planned departure.
Failure to notify the authorities could lead to a prison sentence of 5 years.
The Kent police said she wouldn't discuss individual cases or glitters of possible residence in the country.
A spokesperson from Kent's police unit said: "The Kent police will do everything necessary to protect children in this country and abroad."
"In our opinion, it is easier to control someone in the United Kingdom because we have a comprehensive system to effectively prevent any potential risks."
"It is the chief concern of the police in Kent to protect the inhabitants of Kent and we work closely together to monitor the behavior of registered sexual offenders in the country in order to minimize any risk to the population.
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abuse of 2 girls aged 10 and 11 years.
When he was released, Glitter flew to Bangkok, where he was scheduled to take a flight to London.
But he said he didn't feel comfortable and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not let him through the passport control and he flew to Hong Kong after some time.
The Chinese authorities also refused to enter and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and border officials insisted that he return to Britain.
Finally, he arrived at Terminal 3 on August 22nd and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to the Uxbridge District Court in West London, since Scotland Yard had successfully asked for permission to be able to register as a sexual offender.
Glitter had previously been detained in the United Kingdom for 4 months in 1999 for possession of images of child abuse.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, Interior Minister Jacqui Smith was calmed down and satisfied that Glitter was stopped from traveling to France and Spain.
`I receive the master behind the stage to hold his character', Günter Brauer, photographer.
No paragraphs, no ruffles, no costumes for appearance.
The nature of the great flamenco dancers who refrain from concentration and dedicate themselves to interpretation to get a relaxed appearance as a woman or as a man.
On the one hand, artists
On the other hand, personality
I look into private life, into these moments that are strange to the audience, I know when I can find typical gestures for the personality, the depth of a stolen look or the strength of the hands that are concerned because they will not enter the stage.
In his project `Flamenco-peaple', the German photographer Günter Bauer presents a number of productions on stage with singers, dancers and guitarists. From this page, he was still little known for the artists.
With this proposal, the photographer creates a special iconography of flame co-representation at different levels.
The exhibition, which belongs to the program of the month of photography of Flamenco, `reflects the international importance of flamenco, which grows ever bigger from day to day,' explains the artist and makes it clear that `Flamenco-peaple'` can be any person, but when you look at the photos, the viewer notes that there are no typical pictures of artists on stage.
Very normal people on the portraits are artists who are able on stage to convey passion, sadness, joy and thus move the audience.
In order to retain the personality of these artists, you don't have to take photos on stage.
Their personality and character are in their hearts.
What was interested in creating a personal atmosphere that would enable me to capture the characters of the largest flamenco master with the camera.
Bauer, inspired by the festival `Cante de las Minas', made a long trip in 1997 to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a digital camera.
Thanks to the image sorting function of the camera and the existing material, images were created that recall classical photography.
The application of various stylistic means destroys the classical basis of the image, giving the image the modernity and the idea as understood by the farmer Flamenco: 'Music with traditional roots that change and surprise each day'.
These are not just the dance, the singing or the instrumental play itself, but the personality of the artist, his character that seduces the audience with his art.
The search for the essential, after a certain thing, which is visible in the form of listening, being, and was the fixed goal of this work, which is presented in the next time in the gallery of El Fotómata.
Known personalities in Flamenco among them Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo and others belong to the narrow selection of almost seventy artists photographed.
The project became an anthology of flamencos and will soon appear as a book, with all portraits from the exhibition.
Bauer's passion for portraits led him to take up this idea again two years ago and to realize it as 'Portraits of veterans of sports' ('SportARTproject').
Although the concepts of the project `Flamenco-peaple' are different, the photographer gives me the pleasure of photographing the people, getting to know them and putting me in their state of life, whether for a short moment or a longer time.
I think in the area of photography the portrait is the most difficult genus.
You'll meet or you'll meet people, people you don't know at all at all, or they'll leave you alone for a few minutes to be able to take a picture.
Apart from these circumstances, as a photographer I always try to realize my ideas.'
The collection of portraits of the flamenco today entitled `Flamenco-people' is on display in the gallery of El Fotómata, which is located on the street called la calle de la Mata and runs parallel to the road la Alameda de Hércules. You can visit the exhibition until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa acknowledges that the Roma he just writes is 'a solstice'.
He doesn't know where the novel's act is and what it's about, but Mario Vargas Llosa is constantly trying to advance the project he is working on, a novel with the protagonist Roger Casemant, a nationalist from Ireland who lived in the Congo for twenty years and moved to the Amazon region.
Yesterday, during his presence at the Festival Hay Festival Segovia, the preferred Nobel laureate admitted that the project with which he is engaged is 'an awesomeness' and 'all points out that he would not have to write the novel'.
"If I had understood, I would not have done it, but I will do it and hope to end the novel sometime," he closed his participation at the festival, where the ideas, thoughts and words were exchanged. Within the four days he saw hundreds of writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people who were in Segovia.
The author of `La ciudad y los perros' was one of the most outstanding personalities on the third festival and made predictions.
Vargas Llosa, who won the premium of the Festival Hay Festival and to whom most present gave their voice, is compared with the old edition of `Our casual friends' and can be seen at the Juan Bravo Theatre.
He was introduced by Félix Romeo and found that he had an audience in front of him, which noted that the Peruvian who has a wonderful memory and a great sense of humor was not given enough time to be able to go through everything again: as his vocation to literature, which was born of 'exceptional adventure', from 'Freude at reading' and from 'more to experience than before' emerges; as he writes and 'Disziplin preserves' in order to complete 'the lack of inspiration', his intensive work with documentation, numerous corrections and revisions he makes; as Faulkner, Víctor Hugo and Alejandro Dumas influenced his vocation and which 'memorative images' are the basis for his stories.
The hispano-American novelist admitted that there is 'no way' to measure and where one can know whether books change life, 'but I refuse to believe that literature is pure entertainment, a fleeting experience', stressed Vargas Llosa, who claims that it 'effects' and 'the people are more apart', so I asked the authors 'such not to leave light' and 'the responsibility' for his vocation 'overtake'.
At the festival in Pozoblanco, the weather did not play with: bullfights were partly lost.
After the announced bullfighters found that the ground of the place was in bad condition, the bullfight, with which the feast was to be concluded in Pozoblanco, was placed on yesterday morning.
The organizer, with the consent of Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, decided to postpone the bullring festival.
Thus, the feast of inconsistency was exposed, so two of three celebrations could not take place.
On Saturday it rained, why the second planned bullring party could not be celebrated.
The Matadore group consisted of José Luis Moreno, Curro Días and Juan Bautista, who gradually entered the bullring arena.
So there was only a celebration on Friday.
The winner there was Daniel Luque, who cut three ears and triumphed after whom he had left the passage with pleasure and aesthetics.
That same evening, Alejandro Talavante met two horns and an ear of the bull, which he managed more by galloping than by his bull fighting art.
And even worse was El Juli, who passed through the Arena de Los Llanos without difficulty, but also without fame.
After he had fought so badly, most of the audience responded to his second fight with Buh-Rufen.
In Álava, two persons wanted to escape the control of their car loaded with two thousand kilos of hashish.
Tomorrow: five minutes before ten.
Traffic control in Ertzaintza, in the urban area of Armiñon (Álava).
Two officers asked the drivers of the car to stop, and then they took the flight.
It looked as if they would not have to stop with the cargo of more than two thousand kilos of hashish.
The police persecuted her and arrested one of the drivers, the man who is 28 years old, known as A. A. J., as reported by the Ministry of the Interior of the Basque State.
The arrested person was accused of drug trafficking and counterfeiting of official documents.
The incident occurred when the transport police officers of the Álava region had already completed traffic control on the N-1 and passed through the city area of Armiñon.
They decided to stop a car to carry out the route control. The driver did not follow the instructions, suddenly increased the speed and tried to escape control.
The police began the persecution until the car stopped on the edge of the road after a few kilometers. At the moment, the drivers got out of the car to flee a country road to a forest area.
The police of the city of Ertzaintza finally picked up one of the two. In the car, an Iveco Daily, the drug dealers transported 2,178 kilo of hashish, which was seized by the police.
The front part of the car was laden with hashish bundles, which were later directed to the exact laboratory analysis and to the weighing of the bundle to other police services.
In addition, the officials noted that the mark was 'double', so that it did not correspond to the mark indicated in the car papers, which is why an arrest was also made on account of counterfeiting of official documents.
The police of the city of Ertzaintza continue the investigations to carry out the arrest of the second suspect who, as mentioned earlier, was able to flee, but also to determine the origin of the seized drugs.
Arrested 28-year-old A. A. J., was sent to a police station for hearing. He will be presented to the arrest judge in the next few hours.
Actress Heather Locklear was arrested for driving under the effects of an unknown drug.
The actress Heather Locklear, who is known for the role of the Amanda from the series "Melrose Place", was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California because of driving under the effects of an unknown drug.
A witness had observed how she tried to get out of her parking hole in Montecito in a rather strange way, spokesperson of California's traffic police reported to the magazine 'People'.
The Witness told me in detail that Locklear was going through gas pedal after 4:30 p.m. and she tried to move her car back or forward out of the parking area, and when she drove backwards she caught herself several times on her sunglasses.
A little later, the witness who at first had probably not known that Locklear was on a nearby road and got out of the car.
The witness was the one who informed the emergency service because she had 'Angst for Locklear'.
When the police steps came, they found the actress sitting in her car, standing across the street, blocking traffic.
'She seemed to be unorientated', so they took the police to a special drug and alcohol center to make a test.
According to a police speaker, the actress showed himself cooperative, excessive alcohol consumption was excluded from the first moment. `The official's first observations result, we believe Locklear was under the influence of an unknown drug', says the speaker.
Locklear was arrested under the suspicion of driving under the influence of an undetermined substance which could not be determined and brought to a local detention centre by 7 p.m.
Two months ago, Locklaer was released from the hospital in Arizona, where she was treated against anxiety and depression.
Llamazares insists that the Andalusian Union of the United Left be responsible for the case Silva.
Gaspar Llamazares, the chief coordinator of the VL and United Left MP, has today assured that the regional association for education will be the one that will take the decision in the case of the former City Council for Youth and Sport of the City Hall in Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who had resigned last week after he was accused of making business with family members.
In such cases, I am a great federalist, and the Andalusian organization will be the one that has to take responsibility for this', Llamazares pointed out the way in which the party must deal with that which has until now been a city councillor in the City Council of Seville.
Nevertheless, the chairman of the VL defended the need for 'transparency' in the possible investigations of the regulatory violations that Silva might have begun: 'The VL always insisted that such cases receive maximum transparency'.
With regard to this issue, he stressed that the education of 'a strict ethical code for all public offices' has.
`Sangre de mayo': Heroesbuch von Garci
Inspired by `Episodios Nacionales' by Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Carci in `Sangre de mayo' presents the revised version of the Spanish uprising against the French. This is an admirable film in filmography, with around 15 million euros investment for shooting.
In this way, the Cineast has tried to present 'a lot of personalities and social analysis', which he always admired at the works of the famous novelist Carci explained in the presentation of the film with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the beginning of a long list of performers.
'Sangre de mayo', with a film length of more than two and a half hours, will be presented in cinemas this Friday and will later be shown on TV Telemadrid as a four-hour mini series.
José Luis Garci, great fan of Galdós literature, assures that his `child' dream was fulfilled by this film. This he owes to Esperanza Aguirre, who commissioned him three years ago by the autonomous community of Madrid to film a commemorative film for the second century celebration in Madrid on November 2. Especially because the story is based on 'Episodios Nacionales', he accepted the commission.
The total contribution of 15 million, made by the autonomous community of Madrid for shooting, offers Garcia, as he added, the 'one-off possibility' with the help of decorations and corresponding clothing, the image of 'distorted Spain, which selected the wrong leader for the struggle, because the people had been restored by the struggle for independence and under the rule of the Ferdinand of VII.'
However, the Cineast regrets that one could not expect funding as with `Alatriste' or `Los fantasmas de Goya' (two times as high as at `Sangre de mayo'), so some scenes from the script with Horacio Valcárcel, with which Garci almost worked his entire career, could not be shot.
For this reason, Garci, who was also film director in `Volver a empezar', has been involved in his ordinary working method: he turned on stage to the actors with whom you must first try before you start to turn and for those who did not make casting, he appeared ' humiliating' and respecting, 'a part of the profession of the film director is to provide assistance in theatre and cinema to know what is happening in the cinema industry in which you work.'
Many performers, on whom he meets in 'Sangre de mayo', must repeat before his camera, as in the case of Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garci, Oscar candidate in four nominations (of whom he won one), is of the opinion and assured that none of the three candidates representing Spain before the Academy of Hollywood this year represent a young generation of Spanish filmography. Neither `Sangre de mayo', nor `Siete mesas de billar francés' nor finally the selected film `Los girasoles ciegos'.
Garci does not expect any awards for this film.
`At the beginning you believe that you are working for offspring, later you notice that it is only for prospering, and now you're satisfied if you've produced a film', Garci explains after more than 30 years of professional activity.
Isabel Bayón calls back the memory of the dancer from Seville Tórtola Valencia
A flamenco dancer from Seville worships a dancer who also comes from Seville.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia: her father was Catalan (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and the mother of Andalusia (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), she was born in Triana and when she was three years old, her family moved to London.
She was a dancer and expert for oriental dances.
She had an exciting life, she was one of the first fighters to emancipate the woman, like Isadora Ducan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was Buddhist, vegetarian, and was committed to the abolition of the corset, which restricted the free female movement.
This woman's life, which left her traces of the dance and aesthetic revolution in Europe in the time between the wars, fascinated Isabel Bayón.
`I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she introduced this role to me, which seemed impossible to me.'
`We're not trying to tell about her life without keeping her Esprit,' said the flamenco dancer.
Your dance principles have helped me a lot in Flamenco.
For example, 'The dance of the butterfly' occurred to me like Guajira, or 'the dance of the snake' like Tango.
Her dancing was sensual and I have been told that my dancing is also in this aesthetic area', she claims.
The production calculates with two extraordinary collaborations: Miguel Poveda, who will sing for Isabel in one of her ideas, as he did in 'La puerto aberta'; and with Flamenco master Matilde Coral, who, exceptionally, wanted to work with one of her ex-students.
`Matilde plays Tórtola, a very mature personality.
I am happy because she agreed to participate in my work, and I feel very honored.'
The production also calculates with musical composition and the guitarists Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, with the singing of Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón; with the Percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the Viola of Rafa el Viola and the collaboration with the actor Juanfra Júarez, he takes over the role of the companion of the artists who were divas in which he always falls in love.'
This work also tells us in a certain way about the life of this woman, who became known in places as far away as India, the United States or Russia and also throughout Europe, although she normally lived in London.
`I wanted to recall her, because I think she's one of the women who has a huge influence on a particular epoch and whose works no longer can be appreciated today, and that's why it's even less appreciated', Bayón claims.
The show will take place today at 20:30 at the Lope de Vega Theatre.
The publication of the book 'Diario de un poeta recion casado' also includes the triennial
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of `Diario de un poeta recién casado' in the Saint Stephen's Church (New York), at a place where Juan Ramón Jiménez married 1916 Zenobia, offers an atmosphere to perform planned activities on behalf of the Andalusian Council for Culture to celebrate the `Triennial of Zenobia and Juan Ramón' (2006-2008). The aim is to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the award of the Nobel Literature Prize and the death of the two.
In this way, the 'Trennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón' will be concluded with the new edition of this work, with the international congress, which will take place in New York, with the restoration of the Museum of the House of Juan Ramón Jiménez-Zenobia and with the travelling exhibition 'Juan Ramón Jiménez: 'Aquel chopo de luz', which was opened in May and after which it was in various places in Andalusia, now reached New York and is presented in the course of the international congress.
The Andalusian Council for Culture has also received eight hundred copies of `Diario de un poeta recién casado', published by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Pacobo Pérez-Enciso. The aim is to make the person and the work of the Andalusian world poet better known.
The US can think badly without Paul Newman
Sometimes God creates perfect personalities.
Paul Newman was one of them.'
This phrase comes from the actress Sally Field, who worked with him in 'Sensation Reporter', and from the then reigning idea of the American cinema, which was abandoned, came from all America to Newman with his enthusiastic idea and followed her.
Now, look what it cost her to give him the Oscar.
And when he moved back in 2007.
And he knew he was very sick.
Nevertheless, this was a big blow for everyone.
`What one feels at times is much more than an expression, and now I have lost a great friend', said Robert Redford crying, 'my life and my country were the greatest perils of his life.'
No one was afraid to make a fool or exaggerate himself.
As a 'father' of cinema and the fatherland, he died in a sad moment, in which fear of terrorists and of the market collapse exists, in which the American sense of self-esteem on the hopeless search for reasons to preserve dignity is the downtrodden self-esteem of the US.
If in this hard time only a few people who can be admired remain without virtue, you don't necessarily have to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all, he almost embodied a platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official enemy of Richard Nixon and suffered as many losses as possible: from the foundation that committed itself to the fight against drugs and in honor of his son from the first marriage, who died of overdose, was founded up to its own brand of homemade and organic products.
All of this is a gift for the country in which it took a lot of effort to fight against a deadly diet.
A broad wave of admiration suggests taking home high over Hollywood without regard to nationalities and nationality.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, confirmed that not only a man died, but the whole era.
The English Sam Mendes, film director and Oscar award winner, said that the work with Newman was no more or no less than the top of his career.
Russell Crowe, the bad boy who came from Australia, dared to call Newman his greatest inspiration.
`We have left the greatest of all of us', confirmed George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who are confident to try to live today as Paul Newman lived: to maintain high standards of justice, to lead a responsible private life, far away from the cameras.
This is not always simple or even possible in today's media jungle.
But there's someone who's trying to, and Paul Newman was an example of this.
He divorced once and was married to Joanne Woodward for fifty years, who was faithful, although there were certainly many possibilities not to be.
`Where should I eat a hamburger on the street when I have filet at home?', he often joked himself.
In heaven he will be proud that on earth his daughters have the same opinion as his fans, which is not necessarily common in America.
`From all the great roles he played, he was not as proud as the faithful husband, the loving father, the attentive grandfather and the philanthropist', they say.
The streets in Madrid are flawed for the Olympic Games.
Yes, the dream of many of us is to organize some Olympic disciplines in Madrid after the failure for 2012, it may be 2016.
But I wonder, 'Are we prepared for this?'
Yes, we follow the example of old streets, I say it's not right!
She was called the perfect street, and after my assessment, she was the worst street with everything there was.
Of course, this is a lot of nonsense if you were to pay attention to the evaluation and I could examine it, that would clearly not have happened.
But, from the beginning, let's go through everything.
The nonsense begins with the ticket collection, which allows you to go first.
I don't seem to be bad either, but if they let you go, they should give you everything (including chip to avoid traffic jams on the street).
I don't think so.
Here they only let you get the ticket (the first nonsense that consists of just going there) and (after an infinite queue) there is the surprise! The T-shirt there was only in size `S' (a second nonsense because I need the size XL)
Where do we live?
Or is it so that after the crisis it was decided to buy only small, much cheaper shirts made of less fabric?
All right, things like these are a little thing compared to the days on the road.
Apart from the fact that you have to go very early to get the chip, there is already a waiting queue of at least 15 minutes and, moreover, you have to leave the backpack.
The waiting took more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible in the case of a road where 11 000 people are expected.
Finally, as was expected, the road started and we had not left our backpacks behind, even if it had once succeeded, but it would be more difficult to recover.
In addition, in this 40 minutes of waiting for rain, it seemed to be the temptation to organize a popular uprising and to attack the house.
I think tomorrow will certainly have some 500 people in the lung inflammation and some like me will not even appear in time with the classification because of this chip that I have received, I can already think that the output has been incorrectly stamped.
Of course, if you asked me for a perfect street, that road would never happen to me.
So I think we're still dreaming of a city that's well prepared for the Olympic Games.
Microsoft looking for a (virtual) receptionist
At the 'Emerging Technology Conference', organized by MIT, Microsoft presented the progress of the new image recognition system and human interaction, a being of artificial intelligence without much intelligence, which, however, is capable of carrying out some primitive tasks, such as ordering a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, this is a route planner to move on the campus of the company). The system observes what it hears during the conversation.
Thanks to a camera and a form and face detection system, this `receptionist' can recognize how many people in the room are who they are and even remember how they were dressed, it can listen and understand the keywords of their entertainment.
It can also arrange those present in the groups after the conversations.
In the presentation video `the receptionist' notices a third person, but she understands that this person is not a member of the group that leads to her conversation, and that there is no company employee either.
She asks if the person here wants to visit someone and answers that she will listen soon.
Everything without the blue screenshot
Impressive
This is certainly the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, for example, on the next version of its Windows operating system.
This week it was very superficial to talk about the change of Microsoft's strategy.
Windows 7 will be faster and will not have so many integrated programs.
Steve Ballmer found that if the computers were equipped with the most necessary, instead of filling them with the commercial garbage, they would work five times faster. Human, Steven, that will only be for the few.
Everything is just a statement, considering that Microsoft added one or other function and extras in Windows versions.
The change of direction is worthwhile
Microsoft has the right to lose the operating system gradually in importance, just like the software.
When Google Chrome appeared in the web, it was part of the theory that it was the first step of Google to compete with Windows.
Skillfully, many pointed out that the browser is not an operating system.
The operating system, as an indispensable part, will always be necessary to enable hardware and software to function simultaneously.
The operating system fulfils the function that can be compared to the function of his wife or husband when it comes to telling his mother-in-law something.
That's right.
The system will never disappear, but you must think of its 'death', not as an absolute but as a relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week is to confirm this idea.
Every time, people pay less attention to the operating system, more to the web browser.
The computer is only started to run the Firefox, the Explorer or Chrome and every day we spend more time surfing than in the surroundings of the 'windows'.
What is half of the existing applications in the computer?
Less is more
And Windows 7 must be more compact, much more compact than Vista.
Easier, not so exaggerated, less complicated.
Microsoft's interest is more to integrate its online services, which can eventually become the alternative to Google.
In reality, they need that, without a doubt. I'm taking a small example of it.
The photo of this place I took in Redmond, in one of the relaxation rooms for Microsoft employees at the beginning of the month.
A sign is attached to the refreshing drink machine: `Your search. Our future'. It prints a request to use your own tool for online search.
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of employees at Microsoft, Google used it for network research.
By the way, last week, it was also confirmed that the new version of Windows Mobile 7 was delayed.
It will not appear at the beginning, but at the end of 2009, rather even 2010.
Microsoft is looking for the ability to bring Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 to the market at the same time.
Every day the phone turns into a computer.
The Android and the iPhon are already on the market, but the other delay will cost money.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso adopted it in Costa Azul, Leonardo di Caprio had this brand in `Blood Diamond' by Edward Zwick, just like Al Pacino in `The Pate' of Francis Ford Coppola. At the same time, it belongs to clothing of a well-built pastor.
When we begin to list the countless stars appearances, we can get back to the image of a very powerful man, with a sharp beard that had raised heavy weights in a walking circus.
Basically, this is a typical male t-shirt made of cotton, sleeveless and tucked.
The English-speaking people call it `tank'. However, Lle Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles exceeds all other brands.
First, because of his great name, although called in the narrow circle of `Marcel'. Legend tells that the name creation is connected to sports and comes from Boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
'La Marcel' surpasses all because of its excellent cotton, because of its distinctive unisex cut and is characterized by a small Belgian flag (almost recognizable) that these t-shirts have as detail on the neckline.
And attention, the Belgian company not only focuses on the production of 'tanks'.
You also have college sweatshirts, boxer retro, cardigans and cashmere, cotton trousers, T-shirts with stripes, babies, mini shorts
Modelled and comfortable underwear.
Although, it is very bad to use it as underwear.
They're very attractive.
'I want to be a young mother; I don't worry about the candidate'
Her great appearance with her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Monica Cruz is delicate, but full of joy.
Currently, the siblings Gruz take their new activity very seriously in fashion.
For Tunica, this means much more than for some pretty and rich girls who keep their reputation.
She was in Paris with the promotion of the company Mango, moved there and also made the presentation of the most important premiums in fashion sponsored by the Spanish fashion house.
Merciful and shy, winner on the short distances.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to present the new collection for this autumn/winter season, which my sister Penélope and I designed for Mango, and also visited the presentation of the second edition of `Mango Fashion Awards' and took part in dinner to Valentino's honor.
A very intense working time that is exciting at the same time.
You work for the Spanish house, what is the basis of your new collection for the fourth season for Mango?
My sister, both I and I are fascinated by the cinema of the 50s and 60s, where we find many ideas.
I am happy to go through a city and observe women, as they are dressed, how they combine their garments, I often do.
Dancer, actress and fashion designer, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I believe yes, but finally, everything meets in one, and these areas have many similarities.
Since I was little, I was thrilled with the clothes; I always wanted to go to my grandmother to wade around in the wardrobes of my aunt and see her clothes.
That was great to go almost better than to a leisure park.
Even later, as a dancer, I always tried to pay attention to the clothing.
You know, we dancers like it so much to have our own style in teaching and in the samples to look into the mirror and feel good at it.
As an actress, when you get the costume, you put yourself in the real role of performers.
Finally, everything is connected, it is so, much respect for the costume designer and their professionalism.
You've been 30 recently, haven't you fallen into a crisis?
Oh, what?
I feel better than ever, than thirty years old I feel good.
I find the woman is mature, has experience and can enjoy life with less mistakes.
I'm not afraid of my biological watch.
I've done the things I've been doing since I was a kid, and that has given me a lot of inner joy.
So, do you remember being a mother, don't you?
I've known for a long time that I'm going to be a mother, because that's what my body wants and I want to be a young mother; I don't want to miss that.
As far as the candidate is concerned, I'm not worried.
I am going to convey great happiness to my child and raise it with a lot of love.
As for film art, you keep in mind the works you took part in and the last year were shot.
That is exactly what it is and I would like them to be presented to the public.
I, as a woman coming from the theater, am very impatient and restless and want to have everything at once, which of course cannot be immediately.
I very much wish that 'La última hora' and 'En busca de la tumba de Cristo' are listed for the first time.
Let's see how they like you.
A few days ago, you appeared on the run with Naomi Campbell, right?
It's okay, don't say that.
It's not like I went on my way to model.
Naomi Campbell, whom I have known for some time, has just called me and invited me to London to participate in a parade for the charity event of her organization `Women for a better world' and the clothing we show. I know that two garments from our Mango collection have been auctioned to collect the money for Naomis NGO.
People don't know Naomi's good heart.
There are a lot of things told about her. I, as the one she knows, would tell you that they don't vote.
Nevertheless, I will support this good thing in which it is involved.
She asked me to take part in the parade for this great-hearted thing, but when she comes and asks me to do a handstand, I will also do so.
To support women in the Third World, whatever it is necessary.
The motorists, who can return due to the alcohol level, will need to install the `Alcolock'.
The Authority recommends that the driver who had three official punishments for the level of alcohol installed in his car in this system which prohibits him from starting the car in a drunken state. If he is alcoholic, the car does not jump.
The initiative was announced last month in June and is already part of the report of the Advocate-General. According to their information, it is a pilot project which will last one year.
The purpose is the resocialisation of the driver, which is why he is given a course for re-education of transport behaviour.
The Ministry of Transport and the Foundation of the Technical Institute for Automobile Safety will also participate in this in addition to the Advocate General's Office for Safety.
According to statistics, between 30-75% of drivers who were shown to be under alcohol-influence more than once because of driving, were again on duty.
The `alcolock' would prevent this because it is a system connected to the car, it measures the alcohol content in the air that is breathed out and prevents car start if the driver has done alcohol testing; or if an alcohol concentration is determined higher than permitted.
It costs more than 1 000 euros, the costs are borne by those who impose the penalty.
In this context, a study carried out in the USA in 2007 showed that cars equipped with these devices were already preventing up to 65 % of the regulatory infringements already in the first year after its introduction.
In Spain it is estimated that 115 lives could be saved each year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to attack this behaviour before it became a criminal offence.
And in order to facilitate their implementation, a legal reform can be implemented in the ordinary way, and yet a reform of the Basic Law is required which is necessary for the prosecution process.
The equipment is still available on the Spanish markets, in no business, although it has already been installed in some commercial vehicles and public transport vehicles.
The House of Deputies will vote tomorrow because of the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party, which proposes to install this system in school buses, and this has already been done in France.
In Mexico and without 'peep-toes'
With British punctuality, at 17:40 p.m., at the time provided for by the programme, next to the Presidential Hangar of Benito Jua de México DF, the plane of the Spanish Air Force landed with the Prince and Prince of Asturias.
The sun went down, but their rays still forced the hand to be used as a umbrella to see the royal couple that got out of the plane.
Directly on the Gangway: the Spanish ambassador and other authorities
A few hours before that, I asked a taxi driver on the street if he knew that the Prince and Princess of Asturias visited the city to formalize the official journey.
- Ah, very good, so, you can't take people at the airport at this time you're from here or something.
No, she's the Spaniard, but she's lived here for a few years.
-Ah, so good.
But the Mexican press knows exactly who is the Prince and Princess of Asturias and knows the importance of the trip.
There are many who wait in the hangar of the airport and on the red carpet, including military protection of 27 Marine soldiers, who give off honorary salt.
The prince seems smiling, clothed in navy blue, and she, the princess, with long hairs that are used by the wind, without ordinary 'peep-toes', may have been told that a thunderstorm is expected in DF.
Before entering the hall, they smile and are prepared for the photographers in which the official sequence waits.
At the door of the hotel in which they are accommodated, one of the four largest in the city, a reporter from Mexican television awaits her, who likes to make a joke.
The best premium of fashion
Probably there was no more suitable place in the world than Paris to present a premium of fashion and there was probably no significant fashion designer and Bonvivanten than Valentino.
Mango presents the second edition of the fashion competition `el Bóton-Mango Fashion Advances' to promote and international increase of young fashion talents.
This is awarded with a monetary price of 300 000 euros.
Ayer Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, saw her drawings on Boulevard Haussmann number 54 in Paris yesterday in the window of the Mango branch and almost cried because of the emotional excitement.
By the way, this is the company's second largest business in Europe and has recently been opened. It offers a sales area of 1,335 m2.
The largest business is in London.
So many events have taken place that are linked to thanking the fashion designer Valentino for his jury chair at the competition. Everything ended with a luxury dinner in Opera National de Paris.
In the surroundings of many famous people, the board table organized by Mango seemed to be spectacular.
Nati, with the heavy heart that was broken by pain, because his brother died recently, pulls together. He put on the suit from the fashion house and put on some jewelry from ELAH that were stunning. He held himself at the arm of his son Luis, who is nearly two meters tall and has accompanied Valentino at dinner, to his honor.
Andik, the owner and master of the Mango house, welcomed the guests and was such a cavalier, so that he ended up with the baron of Rotschild without Jackets, because Jackets they borrowed the ladies.
Monica Cruz, has hurryed to the store and had a pants and a shirt that she modeled herself, and to dinner she wore a long, black sexy dress. During a night walk through the opera accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us a hall for ballet samples, so she was excited, remembered the old times, grabbed a rod and made a kind of 'grand plie'.
Inés Sastre, did not join the walk through the palace premises, but before she had shown us the photos of her son on the phone.
The next morning, we were able to look forward to the presence of Oliver Martínez, a personality that always arouses a stormy enthusiasm, and on Jon Travolta, who, after his arrival (with his own sheets and towels) at the Hotel Internacional in Paris, asked in advance to have a room without smells.
The stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh, la la, that's life.
1001 Anti-Stress Council
There is not 1000, but one more way to forget chaotic everyday life.
And if there are also few, all are collected in a book that says how to relax. The book comes into the bookstores on September 30.
The alarm clock is a punishment when it rings at 7 a.m., but even worse, the idea seems to come back into the hectic rhythm that demands the current life.
The office is called the tension and the computer that leads to the back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there are not one and not two methods to combat the daily exhaustion and problems of detachment from the working world.
However, the number increases, no more and no less than 1001.
In addition to yoga settings, the classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott presents in the book the entire list of possibilities that are adapted to the taste and time of each individual.
The work against stress is called `1001 possibilities to relax' and so comes the peace that the book conveys to the bookstores of Pearson Alhambra and DK.
Whoever believes that it is impossible to achieve the rest in the areas such as workplace with the help of personal contacts, this manual rejects such faith.
In addition, the methods are offered as to how to stay in contact with nature or the 100% natural recipes that lead to relaxation.
If the adrenaline no longer rises in your veins to restore balance of the body and the stress has become a problem, then the moment has come to sit down on the sofa, switch off the brain and focus on reading.
Talking in Sleep
Some children speak at night
I don't mean those who wake up and tell us something that happened the day before, but the children who speak during sleep.
If it happens to you for the first time, in the best case you will be startled, but in reality it has no meaning.
This is a positive sleep disorder called speaking in sleep.
It is quite common, especially among children and young people.
Of course, more than one of you was told that you spoke at night.
This phenomenon can occur occasionally (one time in life, for example, during the high fever), or regularly (every day, once a week, once a month), the child can remember nothing the next day.
There is no reason to create this phenomenon.
Often relationships with other appearances in sleep are sought, such as nightmares, panic fear at night, Enuresis noctura (bednasses at night), speaking in sleep, but there is no reason.
As we mentioned earlier, it may be due to very high fiber, stress situations or excessive stress.
In any case, this is a little researched phenomenon.
The frequency at which it occurs is very variable.
It may be that you speak quietly in individual words, whisper or it can be quite a opposite (screaming, crying, long discussions).
In cases where the expression is very intense, it is recommended that the child be observed and advised by a specialist to check if there is a problem that causes fear and thus comes about.
We have said that it is a positive disorder, so it will not be treated unless it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, with sleep apnoea or with stress).
What you can do is perform a series of simple prevention measures:
Try not to stir the child before sleeping.
So choose quiet game for the child and avoid stressful television programs that are terrible and something too wild.
In the nervous children who are recommended for relaxation, relaxation methods can be used to help them get a certain inner rest.
This helps the child sleep quietly.
Once the talk occurs in sleep, try to keep the rest.
Remember that it's harmless for the child and the next day it won't remember anything that happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake it up.
This is useless, for the child is unconscious, so you will tear it out of sleep.
Although the child speaks, it sleeps, so it rests.
Remember that if it shows itself scared after a couple of appearances, it is recommended that you consult yourself or find out what reason the child is afraid of.
If they understand what it says (which is not so common), the child does not put pressure on them to perform a hearing and to obtain more information.
So you won't be able to do anything, because when the child is asleep, it is unconscious and cannot think about it.
Moreover, you will hear what it says, but you will not know what it is dreaming and why it says that they are careful with the interpretation of the information and the conclusions you draw from it.
Maybe, doesn't tell the child that you hear the night and know his secrets.
Not even as a joke.
This causes a lot of anxiety.
So, don't worry, it's nothing bad, it's a moment that only takes a few minutes.
Illhäuser ... finally
After a long thirst, Illhäusers on the field is finally on track again.
Without much effort, the yellow blacks played numerous goals and managed to implement one of them, thus winning the game.
The pace of this encounter, where the attackers were trying to show their ability, was not very high.
After a first attack by the guest captain Kauffmann, whose long-distance shot just passed by the angle, Illhäusers should dominate the game with ease, and it succeeded in alternately only Funderflick with a long-distance shot, then brain with a high pass, and Romain with a shot with the foothead to challenge the defense of Denmark.
The opposing team blocked in the middle of the field and left only the lively Riahi at the top of the storm.
The start of the second half-time should be decisive with two goals fought by Riahi and Temporarye, and immediately afterwards with the first gate for the Illhäuser by Marais, who was exactly right to accept a ball that had been resisted in a first attempt by Diebold.
However, the Illusian goalkeeper should not be able to enjoy his luck for a long time and be sent to the bank about twelve minutes later, which required his teammates to continue playing in numbers.
However, Denmark did not know how to take advantage of this and did not face any major problems to an illustrious elf, which was only slightly withdrawn in order to 'condensate' their defense, except in the last few seconds of the game, in which the ball passed very close to the latte after a big mess.
Sarkozy Hits Angry Fischer
Before he flies to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make another detour to Brittany.
In view of the determined attitude of the fishermen who blocked the access to several Breton and Norman ports on Monday, the French President decided to find himself in the port of Guilvinec on Tuesday morning in Finistère to meet with their representatives there.
The latter promised to receive him 'with a constructive mind' and hope that he will come with 'concrete proposals'.
The President's visit takes place at the same time as a General Assembly of the Crisis Committee, founded by the Breton fishermen, to implement measures in view of the extreme rise in the diesel price, which has reached a record value of an average of over EUR 1.14 per litre.
According to the Elyséepalast press officer David Martinon, the President will discuss possible solutions with them to help their companies get back into competition and secure the working conditions and pay of the seamen'.
Sarkozy is expected with determination by the fishermen.
On Tuesday morning they led protest marches in Morbihan and Calvados, which caused traffic jams of nearly ten kilometers in length.
The port of Quiberon was also blocked, but the connections to Belle-île did not break off.
The Quiberon peninsula was separated by a barrier.
On Monday, the sailors expressed their determination by burning from the early morning on tires and pallets in front of the fuel depots of the ports of Brest and Lorient, while demonstrations were held in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports on the Atlantic coast and the English Channel, such as Sables d`Olonnes, in Vendée, where the fishkutter did not go out, or Le Havre, where about twenty boats blocked the maneuvers of the merchant ships.
In the evening, Turballe and Croisic fishermen in Loire-Atlantique dissolved the blockade of the significant total refinery in Donges.
The Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for the outcome of the meeting on Wednesday in the Ministry before deciding on possible measures.
In fact, the crisis committee in Guilvinec must decide on the reactions to the movement and its participation in the debate planned in the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by those responsible for the National Fisheries Committee who have not supported their movement.
'The strike will continue', because 'the fishermen will not give up' and 'will not go to Paris', for example, announced Liliane Cariou, President of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
The professional fishermen who do not pay taxes on diesel are currently costing about 50 cents, but they think that the profitability limit of a boat can only be reached with diesel for less than 30 cents per litre.
Paul Newman of the Miraculous
The unforgettable actor from `Butch Cassidy and the Kid' died at the age of 83 on the consequences of cancer in his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford, and also Sam Mendes accepted from the cinema legend and dedicated actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer holds its 2008 supply forecasts
This year, the Brazilian aircraft manufacturer expects 215 aircraft delivered, despite the threat of recession, to be a threat to the world economy.
Embraer, the world's fourth largest aircraft manufacturer, holds its delivery forecasts for 215 aircraft delivered in 2008, reaffirmed his President Fredrico Fleury Curado.
In the first half of the year, the aircraft manufacturer delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer is hoping for much from the Chinese market, especially for its aircraft of scale from 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 machines to Chinese customers in eight years’ time.
AIG would consider spending more than 15% of its assets
According to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times, the insurer American International Group, supported financially by the US Monetary Authority, considers spending more than 15% of its assets in order to repay the 85 billion dollars proposed to him.
AIG is ready to charge the sale of a large part of its business, beyond its international life insurance and their pension in the United States.
According to the FT, the board of directors of the AIG Sunday evening met to verify possible sales.
No confirmation of the AIG could be obtained.
One of the assets from which AIG might separate is its aircraft leasing branch International Lease Financial Corp., its share of 59% of reinsurance Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its real estate assets and investments in the private equity, the FT continues.
As regards these sales, no final decision was taken, the FT continued.
AIG must make quick sales to pay back over 85 billion loans which it has granted to it, including the risk that the US authorities will receive 80% of their capital and current shareholders will be lost to the same extent.
Analysis Historical Paris of the meeting Historical morning meeting
On Monday, after the Chamber of Representatives had rejected Paulson's plan to save the banks, the New York Stock Exchange reported a historic case of courses: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, an unprecedented loss of nearly 800 points, and the Nasday 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) has fallen by 777.68 points to 10.365.45 points.
As regards the points, the strongest case of his history (684.81 points) had been recorded earlier on 17 September 2001, the date of the trade decline following the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
According to the final revenue figures, the index Nastag, mainly concerning technology, fell by 199.61 points to 1.983.73 and the widespread index Standard&Poors 500 by 8.81% (106.85 points) to 1.106.55 points.
After the unexpected rejection of the plan to save the banks by the Chamber of Deputies, which was once again to allow a little stability in the markets, Wall Street collapsed, which had already been hit at the beginning of the quarter.
By 228 votes in favour, and 205 for this, the MEPs rejected the funds he had requested from financial secretary Henry Paulson.
Nearly two of three Republicans rejected his plan.
'This is a bad picture, which represents the Congress as unable to accept a plan', said Lindsey Piegza by FTN Financial.
'This shows how much the market counted on this plan', added it, and fears that a project adopted in several days 'too late' will come.
`If the project is actually condemned to failure (...), it will be the task of the Fed (the American Central Bank, the Red.) and other central banks to get to grips with the crisis, which would limit the credit conditions even more', warned Brian Bethune, Chief of Economics at Global Insight.
And Miss Piegza stressed, with her emphasis on the feeling of extreme urgency, 'that every day that removes, the ruin of a financial enterprise' in the United States 'takes with it'.
Following the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual on Friday, the American authorities planned to buy up Wachovia's banking business through its competitors Citigroup.
In Europe the crisis suddenly accelerated and thus led to emergency measures in favour of banks in the United Kingdom, Benelux countries, Iceland and Germany, a sign that the markets are not only facing an American but also a global crisis, the analyst of FTN Financial added.
The market for basic goods has grown strongly.
The revenue of the state funds within ten years has fallen from 3,632% to 3,827% on Friday evening, and revenue has fallen from 4,161% to 4,357% within 30 years last night.
Obama, winner after points in the first television game
After the first debate of the two candidates for the White House of Friday, another one followed to find out who as a winner came out of it, John McCain or Barack Obama.
As expected, both Republicans and Democrats announced their own victory in this television duel, which should be persecuted by a third of the American families.
Political analyst David Gergen estimates that John McCain's performance, although quite desirable, was not 'brilliant' enough to enable him to stop his decline in the election polls five weeks before the presidential elections.
The Gallup Institute, which published an opinion poll on Saturday, says Obama is ahead with five points (49% to 44% for McCain), believes that the democrat is clearly making the better figure.
In the case of the undecided voters, that is, those on whom it is now, Obama came out as winner of the polls with 39%, while according to a CBS survey 25% of them see McCain as the winner.
Obama should be able to confirm his lead on Thursday with the good performance expected by his competitors Joseph Biden at first and only public debate with his rival Sarah Palin
It would be a mistake to underestimate them.
She's got good instincts, but she warned Bill Clinton this weekend.
Seventy-seven-year-old McCain did not cease to put his indisputable experience in the field of foreign policy to the fore, clearly emphasizing his opponent's 'nativity' regarding these questions, which were the focus of this first television duel.
`Senator Obama does not seem to understand that...', he emphasized several times.
"I do not believe that Senator Obama has the necessary experience and knowledge to become President," he also assured.
An attack that has been preached since yesterday in the Republican elections.
Obama himself stressed that he represented the future.
He expressed himself briefly and precisely without being removed from the version.
He put his ability in the foreground to make good decisions and to renew the image the world has of the United States.
'McCain has not yet understood Obama, on the other hand' this weekend, opposed a democratic campaign in which Republicans were accused not to have grasped the full extent of the crisis that is on the 'American from the road'.
`During the 90 minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot of things to say about me, but nothing about you', Obama pleaded yesterday before 20,000 people who had gathered in torrential rain on the occasion of an election event in North Carolina.
He did not even mention the words 'middle' or 'worker'. 'The financial crisis gives Obama, whom Americans consider most suitable to save the economy even on the brink of the abyss, a clear advantage.
`The next week could be a crucial turning point', estimated yesterday by the influential democratic Senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton government, compared the 'good economic instincts' Obamas to those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the democratic candidates, the current crisis is 'the final judgment of an eight-yearly bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain'.
After stressing once again that he would be able to reduce taxes for 95% of Americans despite the fluctuations on Wall Street, the Illinois Senator pointed out that creating a potential energetic independence of the country and promoting renewable energies, together with the introduction of a health insurance system, was a top priority for him.
McCain, on the other hand, wanted to establish an installation of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
The two candidates consider the issues raised by the Congress last night and the plan to save the financial market over 700 billion dollars (470 billion euros), which was passed by the Congress and is extremely unpopular among the people.
`Have you noticed that there was an election in Minsk?'
Youths and oppositionals demonstrated Sunday evening at the main square of the Belarusian capital in order to reject the results of the parliamentary elections in advance.
A few hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday evening since the closure of the electoral venues in Minsk's marketplace to protest against the fraudulent nature of the parliamentary elections.
Although no result had been announced, many young people had come to demonstrate against the power of Alexander Lukachenko: 'The dictator should withdraw'.
Some admit that they have not chosen at all: 'What is useful if they do with my voice anyway,' says one youth.
They do not believe that the regime that has shown itself to foreign observers in the best light to resume negotiations with the European Union is ready to make a democratic turn.
The sanctions, including the non-providing of visas for 40 leading Belarusian personalities and the imposition of certain assets, could be abolished if these elections were considered clean by the observers.
According to the opposition, they weren't.
"We were excluded from the electoral commissions and our observers were not allowed to participate in the enumeration," regretted Juri Potemkin, Union press speaker of democratic forces, a heterogeneous merger of twelve parties.
This is a cosmetic change, emphasizing Alexander Milinkievich, former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-Europe movement, because it is important who is counting the votes, and with us this is the executive.
If members of the opposition move into parliament, then because they have been appointed, not elected.
But their entry into Parliament may mean broadcasting time on television, meetings in the regions and legislative proposals. '
The opposition is therefore guilty of interfering in the political game, because the dialogue with the European Union must be opened.
Because if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, gets into a crisis and we do not reform, we are in danger of becoming a protectorate of Russia.
Well, we want to be independent'.
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has followed the election, does not recognise the election as valid.
It stresses that the number of voters appears too high, and that the extension of the vote in advance (26% of Minsk voters) has opened the way for any type of manipulation.
`Have you noticed that one election took place?, asks the leader of Social Democrats Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August of this year.
There was no one in the elections.
And there will be a maximum of five members of the opposition in Parliament, those most likely to be in line with the government's views.
The silence of the night again sinks over the Oktoberplatz.
On television, President Lukachenko and the members of the Central Election Commission congratulated her on her success.
Discrimination - From the blood that became safe again
Hema-Quebec celebrated the 10th anniversary of her founding yesterday, and her president, Dr. Francine Décary, had every reason to be pleased because Hema-Quebec has become one of the safest and most efficient blood banks in the world.
And above all, it regained public confidence, which had been severely shaken by the scandal of contaminated blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
As you know, during the 1980s the national blood reserves administered by the Canadian Red Cross's blood donation were contaminated with the HI virus and hepatitis C virus.
In view of this drama and public dissatisfaction, in February 1994, the Government of Canada launched a public investigation conducted by Judge Horace Krever aimed at bringing light to the circumstances that had led to such tragedy and to draw up guidelines to prevent a further catastrophe of this kind.
While Judge Krever was still reluctant to deliver his report, at the time several provinces put a committee on the legs whose aim was to develop a new system for managing blood canned in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee fulfilled this task.
According to the reports of Gélineau and Krever, two blood banks were established in Canada: Hema-Quebec, who is responsible for Quebec, and the Canadian blood company to provide the other provinces and the two territories.
`1998, when Hema-Quebec took up her work, hardly 38% of people had confidence in the blood-conservation system in Quebec, remembers Dr. Décary.
The situation was discouraging.
Due to the enormous efforts to improve the safety of the blood cans and through the work in this field during the following years, we have regained public confidence," she says, before emphatically stressing that at the beginning of 2008 almost 94% of Quebec's population had confidence in Hema-Quebec.
However, Dr. Décary keeps in mind that 'trust is something extremely fragile'.
Since its foundation on 28 September 1998, Hema-Quebec has acted according to the principle of caution.
At this time we experienced the occurrence of numerous cases of the human form of cattle insanity in Europe, a new type of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, tells this woman who has been in charge since the founding in 1998.
"And we didn't have the slightest idea whether this disease could be transmitted over the blood.
So we called on one of the main guidelines of the Krever and Gélineau reports, which says that exclusion measures are applied if one does not know this and if a disease only progresses slowly, as is obviously the case with the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is expressed by a degeneration of the brain, which inevitably leads to death.
So in April 1999, no blood was taken from people who had stayed in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980.
Now, a few years ago, it was unquestionably proved that this disease is being transmitted over the blood.
Thus this event has shown us that the principle of caution that we used has quite a meaning.
In 1999 a much more precise technique for the detection of HIV appeared on the market: the nucleic acid tests (NST), which enable the presence of the virus itself directly in the donor's blood, and not that of the antibodies against the virus, as was the case with the tests used so far.
The NST made it possible to shorten the time of incubation, which takes place between the time the person was infected and the time when the first viruses can be proven by our techniques in blood, explains the specialist.
This time could be reduced to a duration of less than a week.
Thus, the risk that certain donors might be infected without knowing it, and one could not recognize this, was significantly reduced.
These improvements made it possible to significantly reduce the risk of transmission of AIDS via blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people is in danger of receiving blood infected with HIV.
In other words, it means distributing 12 million blood cans before someone is infected with HIV.
Since hema-Quebec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood cans each year, it would take more than 24 years before a case in which HIV was transmitted over a blood can.
I believe you can feel comfortable these days when you get a blood transfusion or write to restore health,' says the director of Hema-Quebec.
Our challenge for the next ten years is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know what pathogens can get into the system.
Only last year the Chikungunya virus appeared on Réunion's island, which, as well as the West Nile virus, is transmitted by insects over the blood.
We need to monitor continuously', continues Dr. Décary, before she emphasizes that Hema-Quebec must also provide a sufficient supply in addition to a secure supply.
The need is increasing because the population is ageing.
As cancer control treatments are more aggressive, patients often need new red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also affects the blood donor network, which averages only 3% of Quebec's blood-donors.
In doing so, every healthy person who is 18 years or older and meets the criteria of fitness can donate blood every 56 days, six times a year.
On average, 14% of the people who provide their blood are not accepted, for example, because they are ill with AIDS or malaria, and those who have traveled to a country in which malaria is spread are excluded from the blood donation for one year.
With this 3% we manage to obtain an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
Lack of supplies are very rare.
But you have to renew the members of this donor network when they get older and can no longer donate blood.
It is hard to convince people to donate blood, but above all, to keep them and make them become regular donors.
Life is so hectic these days that you rarely find the time to spend an hour in blood donation,' regrets Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of 297 million dollars, Hema-Quebec supplies not only blood canned but also human tissues, including bone transplants, heart valves, eye apples and skin, which is used almost exclusively for severe burn injuries.
These tissues are examined, processed and frozen before stored in Hema-Quebec, which also manages Quebec's only public cord blood bank.
In the umbilical cord, previously considered biomedical waste, there is rich blood on stem cells that can serve to treat severe diseases, such as leukaemia.
A few weeks ago we celebrated the deposit of our thousandth cord blood sample, and we plan to take more than a thousand each year.
`We should probably start to provide it for transplants at the beginning of next year', explains Dr. Décary, who describes this program of cord blood decline as very popular.
Many mothers are convinced not to have access to it, because Hema-Quebec lacks the means to offer this complex and expensive program in all Quebec hospitals.
Soccer - Impact in semi-finals
Montreal's Impact yesterday, thanks to a 3 to 1 victory (4 to 3 with all goals) against the Seattle sounders at the second and decide game of the quarter final series in the Saputo Stadium, where the total goal ratio counted, qualified for the semi-final round of the U.S.L.'s first league.
The midfielder Antonio Ribeiro shot the decisive goal in the ninetieth minute of the game.
After a first half-time without goal for both the one and the other, midfielders David Testo and Rocco Plancentino landed the other hits for the Montreal formation.
Roger Levesque was the only one who put Matt Jordan in the way for the sounders.
Let us remember that during the first game of the pre- and return series on Friday Impact, the Starfire Complex in Tukwala in a suburb of Seattle had introduced a 2 to 1 defeat.
In the semifinal, Impact will be measured with the Vancouver white caps.
On Saturday evening, Thunder was able to balance a 3 to 1 deficit by a 4 to 3 win, but the Whitecaps still entered the semi-final round with a total goal ratio of 5 to 4 in the final round.
Impact will probably have to face the white caps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the series will be defined today.
In short - Siegestor by Kovalev
The number one-trio of the Canadian team is ready to start the season.
Last night, the unit formed from Alex Kovalev, Tomas Platanec and Andrej Kostitsyn driven the attack on the Panthers from Florida with a stormfire, leading to a 3 to 2 victory.
Kostitsyn, the star of the encounter, shot a gate, Platanec delivered two templates and Kovalev transformed a pass into this victory game, the fourth of the Tricolors into six preparatory games.
Kovalev won by shooting the only gate of the whole shooting.
`I'm not ready yet, the Russian warned.
I need another game to make me feel comfortable.'
In the first half of his life, Guy Carbonneau noted that he was too focused on it.
But I think he liked the end of the game.
He's got a stormy coincidence.
Charest is set on the North
The Prime Minister does not exclude the introduction of elections before the end of the year.
As soon as the General Assembly of the Liberal Party ended, yesterday Jean Charest went to Jean-Talon in Quebec, where the new Health Minister Yves Bolduc (left) tried to be elected in today's part-election.
'Move the course of our last large border in the north: This is the long-term goal that Jean Charest presented yesterday by visual means at the General Assembly of the Liberal Party of Quebec in Levis, and he fully followed the guidelines.
During his lecture a kind of painting mill was projected behind him.
On three huge screens, spectacular pictures of hydropower plants, mines, viewed by Quebec in 'Google Maps', maps, etc.
Great resources such as during the election period.
In contrast to the press, the Prime Minister refused to exclude him from holding the elections this autumn, even if he had stated that his calendar was very full.
The 'Plan Nord' is the fourth element of a 'vision' that the Prime Minister is supposed to have for Quebec, namely that of a 'new economic area', which provides for an agreement with France on labour, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario.
Although it has been mentioned frequently in the Prime Minister's speeches lately, the opening of the North - the northern area on the 49th latitude - had never been the subject of a presentation.
The Prime Minister, however, limited himself to explaining why the North was 'a jewel with enormous potential', but did not mention a date, an investment sum or precise priorities for the upcoming projects.
At most some prospects for what could be done more: especially on water energy, on the forest, but especially on the mining sector, favoured by the growth of emerging economies and the renewal of public infrastructure.
According to Mr. Charests, the North has `nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium and even diamonds'.
This area is twice as large as France'``is near us, is in Quebec.
It is not only in our vicinity, it is in us', he stressed how to clearly show that he is looking for a national founding dream.
Quebec grew very much through his connection with the north, he stressed: the road to gold in Abitibi, the technique Quebec, the James Bay.
`It belongs to us, it's our future', he added after he had taken a theatrical break to look at the huge map behind him.
The North, 70% of Quebec's territory, includes part of Labrador, which Quebec has always called for, the Prime Minister told the press.
This is a traditional attitude that all governments pursued.
There is a border line where there has been no agreement for a very long time, if the opportunity is given I will take this attitude again on behalf of the government,' he said.
Moreover, 'with climate change, we have to rethink our vision from the north', he explained and spoke about the north-west passage, which will be transportable all year round because of the ice melt.
Against this new geopolitical background, the Prime Minister believes that it is precisely a duty to occupy this area.
And the inhabitants of the country, the natives, and the inuits?
The Prime Minister said that the Quebec government would be very careful about them, and that they would benefit from this project, especially the boys.
Two former ministers of various parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former pectist MP of Ungava) have already started discussions with about thirty communities.
A ministerial committee led by Benoît Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (transport and land treasures) occupies an important place, has taken up the work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a large assembly, 'not necessarily a summit', but an opportunity in which 'one will create a common vision'.
The development of the North will, moreover, go in line with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be discussed, regulated and environmentally friendly, he promised.
Jean Charest described this 'Vision' as a continuation of the liberal Prime Minister who was in office before him.
Like the liberals who were in office before us, we have been rethinking to turn the challenges into new growth and development gears.
This was, by the way, one of the themes of the weekend that was repeatedly raised, which opened on Friday with a large cocktail party to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the taking over of the party led by Jean Lesage.
One of the decisions adopted is to rename Beauharnois' power plant into Adélard-Godbolt-Staudamm.
"From Godbout, who created Hydro-Quebec, to Bourassa, who made the James Bay, our party always knew how to determine the future," explained Jean Charest.
On the other hand, the press was referring to another conservative project, namely the 'Roads to the North' programme by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
With regard to the project Ostmain1a-Ruper hydropower dam, Mr. Charest stressed that its commissioning was planned for 2012.
`This remains among us, but I intend to be in it', he trusted his party members, which cried out in those incidental storms.
The Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008, and certainly also in 2009, in fact has the possibility to hold this autumn a choice which is possible from the law, has not yet been ruled out.
He stressed, however, that his calendar was full, especially because of a mission by the Chinese Community Council and a summit between Quebec and New York.
The General Assembly of the weekend provided the Liberal Party leader with a platform of nationalist plans, especially from 'the Constitutional Goals', which were accepted without any further reason: the PLQ particularly calls for the recognition of Quebec's 'speciality' in the Constitution.
It also wants Quebec to appoint members of the Council of Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications and to have a veto on the decisions taken in Quebec.
On the side of the opposition, the guidelines of the Nord plan were taken up with skepticism.
The leader of the Parti Québécois, Pauline Marois, has brought about the North-du-Quebec policy that the Landry government introduced in 2001.
According to her, the liberal government, when it came to power in 2003, refrained from applying it.
If she had done so, 'we would be much further today', Mrs Marois judged at the side of her candidate in Jean-Talon (where the election takes place today) Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ has supported the government's adoption of a North Plan.
`But what we want is that this will not only be a big idea', explained the party leader Sébastien Proulx in behalf of Mario Dumont, who is returning from the holiday today.
Letters - A land that is depleted
Mr. Vic Toews, ex-'Justiz' minister (which irony) in the Cabinet Harper, it was last summer that allowed himself to say about Louise Arbour that she was a 'scande' for Canada.
This woman, who has waged a non-ending struggle for justice and deserves all our admiration to cover with shame, says as much about the people around the Prime Minister as about Stephen Parker himself.
We are dealing here with a government which, as the only one from all the countries concerned, has not brought home their fellow countryman trapped in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that doesn't even take into account that Omar Khadr was still a youth when things were happening to him.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, breaks its word and leaves a child soldier to flee under inhuman conditions.
The only one who falls into a justice parody to assess the defendant's guilt.
Let us remember that UNICEF, Amnesty International, and the Association of Canadian Lawyers, in particular, are calling for Omar Khadr to get home so that he can get a fair trial in Canada.
This very government also closes its eyes to torture: it is not interesting that a young adult will surely be broken forever after so many years of suffering.
We are not yet aware of this, but we are experiencing a secretive circumcision of our rights, our freedom and our 'democracy', this word, which Harper constantly carries as a flag in front of him, and which sounds so unspeakable from his mouth.
The time has come, therefore, when there is no more morals: a Canadian citizen can be arbitrarily abused, tortured and imprisoned, according to the virtues of a head of government, who is to date only supported by the minority (may be a minority after the 14th of October...).
Many voters believe in finding their salvation at a party preaching virtue, law, and order, but they do not see that this government has turned itself away from what made up the reputation and dignity of our country.
The shame, Mr Toews, lies in this release, and nowhere else.
Free Opinion - The Orwellian Speech of Barrick Gold
In its September 17 issue, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr Patrick J. Garver, Vice General Director of the Canadian Gold Mine Barrick Gold.
This confirms and pursues an Orwell logic that the world's largest gold-winning society sought to slander over six million against three authors and a small middleless publishing house with the aim of opening a 'public transparent debate'.
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, they do not judge the truth, especially not in the case of slander, but in the case of the law.
As expected, this fundamental difference has been completely silenced by Mr Garver.
For Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate is to drive everyone into the ruin that dares to represent one of their opposite opinions.
No matter how the process proceeds, the authors and editors of the book Noir Canada will have to spend considerable sums to prepare their defense and fight with very uneven weapons against an army of lawyers who are paid out of the almost inexhaustible pockets of the gold mine.
The tactics in these uneven struggles are often to ruin the defenders in order to force a consensus that makes the opposite mouth dead and also deters anyone who dares to deal with the question again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, she would have to present her view of things before the public opinion.
In contrast, what is going on and what is going on in many of the countries in which Barrick Gold works is usually debated in Canada through the exchange of ideas and not by knuppelhiebe.
So it would have been sufficient if the gold mine had revealed their books and records and opened a real debate through newspapers, media, publications and financing independent test teams that could have brought the matter to light.
But Barrick Gold seems to have no confidence in public opinion and wipes the petitions and letters to support Noir Canada's authors with a hand movement aside.
Perhaps Mr Garver could explain how he could at the same time ask for a 'public' debate, and at the same time disregard the views of this public.
This word in the Vice-President's world seems to include only the generously paid lawyers, and not the community of all Canadians; a very narrow view of the term.
In a democracy, even slanderers have the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold does not understand - or does not want to understand - is that the public who supports the authors and editors of Noir Canada does this primarily because it rejects the brutal attitude of the gold mine.
This public is willing to listen to and judge Barrick, but on the basis of a civilised exchange of arguments, and not in a framework which many perceive as a gag complaint (in the course of the 'public debate', Barrick Gold has just made a request to the authors of Noir Canada, in which she asks them not to use this term anymore...).
Apart from Mr. Garver's surreal speech, Barrick Gold's complaint is a direct attack on freedom of academic research and the finding of truth that are fundamental to any democratic society.
It completely denys the right to quote credible sources and to discuss facts and interpretations that form the basis of intellectual work.
If in a country like Canada it is impossible to explore and discuss topics that do not please the rich companies of this world, who else can do that?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, she could lead it by following the scientific standards used by Noir Canada's authors.
She has a right to answer.
The university environment we belong to has long been able to handle debates and inconsistencies and resolve conflicts.
The disproportionate suit of Barrick Gold clearly shows that, unlike what it says, it has no desire for a transparent debate.
This is a loss for the university world as well as for the public debate, and it is time for governments to take measures that restrict this kind of unjust action.
Rescue action for Wall Street - Democrats and Republicans understand
The administration of Bush and the executive Congressarians, Republicans and Democrats alike, finally came to an agreement yesterday on the most extensive economic recovery plan since the great depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the plan of more than 700 billion US dollars, which is intended to stop the financial crisis that has shaken Wall Street for months, is still to be accepted by the two Congress Chambers.
The main elements are: a better control of Members of Parliament on the practical application of the plan, new mechanisms to secure the repayment of public funds used, new resources to limit the number of houses affected by arrears, and the right to monitor the salaries paid to senior employees of the assisted companies.
The American financial secretary Henry Paulson, the president of the Chamber of Deputies Nancy Pelosi, and the representative of the Republicans, Senator Judd Gregg, announced yesterday, a few minutes after midnight, the good news, after a two-day negotiation marathon.
'We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be market-effective', said the Bush administration representative Henry Paulson.
'It all happened to protect the real economy and the American people from the price crisis at Wall Street', said the democrat.
'This is the basic point: if we don't, the trauma, chaos and unrest in the American daily life will be enormous', said the Republican Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had accelerated during the last two hours, for fear of the effect that the investor's mood had had once again failed.
That deadline, which was agreed, was the market opening this morning.
The two American presidential candidates, who took part late in the negotiations, showed themselves rather as supporters of the agreement, without, however, failing to express their dissatisfaction that they had to be met in this extreme way.
The democratic Senator Barrack Obama insisted on the addition of certain arrangements to the agreement, in particular those intended to enable owners to keep their homes, and those concerning the salaries of senior employees of companies saved by the State.
If the taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the lack of responsibility of certain persons, that is nothing to be congratulated on.
But these measures are necessary," he said on the American television station.
When he was asked on another station to vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent John McCain replied: `I would like to know the details first, but I hope so.
`The guidelines I have read show that this is one thing we all need to digest, and with which we will be able to move forward.
The option of not doing anything at all is simply unacceptable,' he said.
The 700 billion dollars plan is aimed at the money of taxpayers
It comes 14 months after a crisis caused by the placing of a real estate bubble which initially led to the collapse of the risk-rich mortgage loans (subprime) before it extended to other forms of more widespread bonds (PCAA), and finally resulted in a freezing of financial power and into the ruin of banks and financial institutions.
A group of Republican MPs failed last week's first attempt to reach agreement.
Since the Democrats have accepted that certain 'toxic' assets of the societies in distress are only to be secured and not bought by the government, it is believed that the deadlock is escaped.
In order to complete the perspective for all in Congress, one has also added an order stating that if the government were to make losses with this programme within five years, it would be able to raise new taxes in order to recover its capital used.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first sum of 250 billion to which another 100 billion can be added if the President considers it necessary.
The payment of another 350 billion must be approved by the Congress in a further vote.
In return for his assistance, Washington receives shares in the supported companies that bring it dividends in the case of profits and which it can sell again when the storm has passed.
The Federal Government will have the opportunity to stop the pledge procedures relating to the dwellings linked to the real estate loans covered by this plan and also to lay down time limits for the repayment and settlements paid to the executive employees of the companies concerned.
The developers of the plan would like the Chamber of Deputies to vote on him today, and the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will get green light.
In fact, yesterday there was another vote against this project, both from the Republicans and from the Democrats.
'Not exactly Washington understands us', said the Republican Scott Garett, a member of the Chamber's Finance Commission, to his voters.
Yes, we have a big financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not those who are asking taxpayers to cash.'
Democratic MP Brad Sherman, head of a group in Congress called 'the Caucasus of Skeptics', presents things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred excellent economic professors, including three Nobel laureates, have written us to tell us: We ask the Congress not to be pressured, and to consider carefully what way to go," he said yesterday.
At the same time, we in Europe were once again given proof that this was a global crisis.
At an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial governmentization of the Fortis banking group for EUR 11.2 billion (16.3 billion US dollars).
The approach of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after the French Bank announced BNP Paribas that it would refrain from buying up its competitor, who has been in serious difficulty since losing 2 billion euros (2.9 billion US dollars) in the crisis due to risk-rich real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the twenty largest European banks and the ten largest insurers.
'This is not a lost money, said Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos yesterday.
To compensate, we receive the right to vote and influence in the bank.
This is exactly what the savers and households appreciate, now that uncertain times are announced. '
During this time, on the other side of the sleeve canal, the British government was just about to get another bank under pressure from the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all ongoing loans from Bank Bradford and Bringley, of which more than 41 billion were $75.5 billion from real estate loans.
The Spanish Bank Santander announced yesterday that it would buy up the UK bank's branches and customer accounts.
After Northern Rock, Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank the British government has had to govern since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (19252008) - Death of a dedicated icon
His beauty with the azure eyes was his trump for a long time, no one would say his weakness.
Has the American actor been freed from the narcissian mirror with the charming smile?
Yes and no.
His sensitivity, sensitivity and an obvious talent have probably also kept him away from a position of power that brings the truly terrible monsters to the world.
But what a big continuous runner!
Paul Newman, who died on Friday at the age of 83 on the consequences of lung cancer on his ranch in Connecticut, remains one of the last icons of the American cinema of his golden years.
He was less monumental than Brando, whom he resembled and for which he was a kind of rival on the screen for a long time, more careful in his acting, certainly also more fragile, but just as an apostle of freedom and the explosion of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often produces wonderful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925 as the son of a German Jew and a non-Agricultural mother.
From its European roots, one of the glorious faces of the American dream should arise.
Without excessive ego, extreme quality feature.
Because in him a whole country was reflected in the self-made man, in the fighters who were wounded in the Pacific War, who studied acting art in Yale at the beginning of the 1950s, and then attended the Actor's Studio in New York before he was successful at the theatre, television and soon also in the cinema.
This man, who fought for the rights of the citizens, was also the driver who became in 1979 at the 24 hour race of Man's Second, and also a sex symbol, although he lived in a show relationship with actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
He also removes the unknown facets of this mysterious, restraining, committed and hypersensitive star versus the glamour of the show business, whose puzzles you will never completely solve.
A decent man, in the purest sense of the word.
Paul Newmans died this weekend in Taumel, while on the dark screen of his memories all his great roles were played.
More than half a century of American film art in constant change passes with it.
Again, the charming cowboy from "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" (1969) pushed his memory, and the young man who rejected his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in Die Katze on the hot sheet roof filmed by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
It is called back a much shorter memory (1990) that is disturbed by his sensitive Mr Bridge, who at his old age is disturbed by a wedding that did not fulfill all of her promises.
So many other Paul Newmans were in the course of history.
This criminal, stormy, violent and unforgettable boxer Rocky Graziano from Somebody Up There Likes Me (a hand full of dirt) by Robert Wise, a role that was thought to be for James Dean, was resumed after his death and made the Newman well known in 1956.
This congenial Ganove in the outstanding The Sting (Der Clou), which was awarded the Oskar for the best film in 1973.
As a bitter and ardent billiard player in the wonderful The Hustler of Robert Rossen (1961),
That face through time, that was him.
Still he.
In his CV, Epochen unites.
The youth knows him especially from the cult film Slap Shot by George Roy Hill (1977), as Reggie Dunlop, the little orthodox trainer of an ice hockey team.
His fans found him again in The Hudsucker Proxy of the brothers Coen in 1994.
With a final role in 2003 as a godfather of the Irish mafia in Road to Perdition of Sam Mendes, the circle closed.
In contrast to several cinema legends who moved away early enough from the film world, Newman was supposed to stay in his saddle for a long time, betraying Hollywood, his fortune, his prunk and his concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier saw him, not without humor, as a living challenge to the 'underplaying' when he judged his all too expressive achievements.
The Metier was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman, to whom the reels only flowed for a long time.
However, he often played Sunnyboys as an outsider: neuroticians, alcoholics, fisters, or desperate people, with whose perfect representation he reflected his slipping and his rebellion.
As a director, Newman revealed unknown sides of his true sensitive sensitivity.
His Rachel, Rachel of 1968 (after the novel of the Canadian Margaret Laurence), with his wife Joanne Woodward in the leading role, drew a fine woman portrait full of melancholy.
He, who lost his son Scott through an overdose, dedicated his 1984 film Harry and Son, a work full of sensitivity and sadness.
During the flood of honours that occurred yesterday over Newman, his close friend and former arms companion Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) declared very much: 'His present has improved my life and this country.'
Generosity and joy of life were essential qualities of the deceased actor.
In addition to his legendary career, a great champion of civil rights, environmental protection and independent cinema, an opponent of Hollywood's abortion, goes there.
We may have seen him often with the foot in bowls full of vinaigrette, in sauces, pastries or other food, and this thought quite tasteless, although we at first found it funny.
The profits from his sales nevertheless flowed to his foundation for children in need.
Instead of resting on his myth, Newman was involved in shooting.
He left behind his five daughters a letter with these sentences: `Immer and to the very end your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was an honor to be here."
And for us it was an honor to be allowed to pursue the life of such an intelligent and generous American actor.
An exemplary citizen, in the narrowest and widest sense.
What was produced at the invoice factory of Zuschlag &amp; Co.?
On October 8th, the negotiations in the criminal trial against Jáno's supplement and his compliments begin.
In particular, the defendants are accused of participation in organised crime, as well as grossly negligent damage and commercial fraud, and other criminal acts, including false documents.
According to the prosecutor's office, the funds obtained from the tendering procedures were used for their own purposes, while the services provided were often invoiced with fake invoices.
Government funds and grants from the self-government - a total of HUF 65 million - are to be part of the funds of the Fiatal Baloldal organization, some of which have been transferred to the private funds.
According to the investigation authorities, fictitious invoices have been submitted in relation to tendering fees and the associations should not have fulfilled their obligations.
According to the indictment, most of the invoices are supposed to have been faked.
The bill blocks were bought at the market of Józsefváros, the round seal was made in Kiskunhalas.
The decision on which companies to issue the invoices was made on that tour north of Lake Bala, to which István Lados was sent by János.
In the course of this "exploratory tour" Lados should find pensions and restaurants.
He requested invoices on consumption to be able to issue invoices for the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, and the self-management of Budapest later on on.
These invoices should have been manipulated by István Lados and his compliments, András Łri, the latter, according to our information, being responsible for the constitution of the reports.
One of the goals of Lados' "Exploratory Tour" was a beer shop.
As two invoices issued by Supplement and Co in 2003 are to be found, the gastronomy company is expected to host the ninety-five-member group of the Biztos Pont Egyptsület association.
Now, however, the head of the company states that such a large group would not have been able to go to the locals at once.
Another invoice issued in summer 2002 to the Jobb Jövřért Foundation, later known as Egypt a Harmadik Évezredért, also showed serious errors in form and content.
In a pension in Badacsonytomaj, which has only three rooms and cannot accommodate more than ten persons at the same time, 130 guests should have stayed in the invoice.
The imagination of the accounters was apparently not limited to the Pigal Kft., a gastronomy, in which accounting documents from customers Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá did not appear at all, according to the prosecutor's office.
According to the Managing Director Gyęző Farkas of the hvg.hu, it was immediately clear to him that this was fake documents when documents were presented to him by the prosecutor during a survey.
"Our company name and the tax number were wrong on the stamp".
And further: Apart from flaws in form, the fact that the company should have accommodated one hundred persons was also wrong, after having a total of eleven rooms that could not possibly accommodate so many people.
Also mentioned on the invoice board, the restaurant has not been in operation for a long time.
The serious accounting counterfeiters have also failed to verify that the Budapest travel agency, which they have taken into custody, offers travel abroad only, and thus they have indicated Hungary's travels on the cash payment account, which was also contradicted by the company's accounting practice.
In addition, as has been announced in the course of the investigations, they also mentioned VAT on the invoices, although travel agents services relating to a country outside the EU are tax-free.
The total amount of VAT was wrong for four invoices issued by Hotel Révfülöp Kft. to the Jobb Jövřért Foundation, because the operation pays only 15 percent VAT instead of 25 percent VAT, and also the employees issued only machine invoices, but the fake documents were handwritten.
Another mistake that had been made by the "accounting investors" was that in a case they had indicated "warning" as performance provided, although this is not offered by the company specialised in investment consulting, the public prosecutor was informed.
Further errors in form - false billing, false stamping - were due to the fact that the invoices issued on Egypt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, as well as on XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyptsület and Biztos Pont could be exposed as counterfeitings.
Similarly, in the case of Ravenna Bt. and the sports camp Kunfehértó, whose managing directors were afraid to have never issued the invoices.
Another "mistake" is the forgery at the HIB Kft. from Nyíregyháza: this company was in a resolution at the time (2001) when the group of the Fiatal Városért Egyptsület was supposed to have eaten there - the mass administrator therefore indicated that the bills had not been issued by themselves.
Consciously faked
The other group of accountants are persons who were well aware that they would have to make fictitious bills.
At the request of the Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták, the Esély Budapestért Alapítvány Foundation has issued invoices for the Egyutt a Harmadik Évezredért Foundation, at an amount of approximately HUF 4 million.
According to the indictment, the managing director of Collab Kft. was persuaded by one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi, for the exhibition of fictional invoices.
The Biogate Kft, which currently is also being liquidated, is expected to have cooperated with the grant and the co.: In 2003, the GmbH is expected to have supplied the Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány Foundation, as well as the Atlasz Egyptsület and Vorösfeny's Egyesület associations with fake invoices of HUF 5 million, which relate to non-delivery services.
However, there was equally little payment because the invoices were cancelled immediately after their exhibition, which the data subjects had forgotten in their documents.
The third group of accountants shall comprise persons who are directly linked to the defendants.
One of them is Iván Kubatov, the post-boat of the Ukrainian managing director of Delta Trió Kft., a Budapest based fuel and vehicle dealer.
This company is expected to issue several invoices on the sale of EDV components in the period October to December 2005 at the total value of HUF approximately 18 million.
According to the investigative authority, the cash investment Kft. from Kiskunhalas, which has been in liquidation since 14 September 2005, should have acted as a buyer of these invoices.
The managing director of this company was a Romanian to which the company documents should also be sent by Iván Kubatov between 2002 and 2005.
According to our information, Cuba has been able to issue invoices in the name of the GmbH. to the Atlasz and Hoppá associations, as well as to Egypt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány and to have collected their equivalent value itself.
The companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. as well as the Jos-Investment Bt. are supposed to have been founded by Romanian maurers on Iván Cubatov's express wish.
In truth, however, none of these companies were active, which, according to the defendant, was a lack of orders.
Nevertheless, he was able to benefit from the companies: at the request of his complicit, lawyer Zsolt Szente, who was responsible for preparing the company's founding documents, he has issued invoices to the associations associated with the award on behalf of the companies, such as Atlas and Y-Generáció.
In total, Cuba is expected to issue 15 invoices to the organisations on behalf of Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade in the total value of HUF 14.2 million.
The prosecutor assumes that Cuba may have collected 10% of the total invoice and VAT.
Cuba is even said to have abused Szi-Beri Bt. for the exhibition of fictitious invoices - in this case the invoices were accompanied by the applications of Biztos Pont.
In January 2006, Y-Generáció and Szövetség a Modern Magyarországért submitted their applications to the non-profit organisation of the Socialist Party, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány ("TMA").
Both received 500,000 Forint each, but have used these amounts for a purpose-forint.
In order to cover this up, they have submitted five fictitious invoices to the TMA of the Works Team Kft.
These invoices were also ensured in the examination of the office of Árpád Kemecsei in the Ministry of Education.
The negotiations are now expected by some of the defendants to find a confession on the way in which the bill has been mistreated, as they have already been made before the prosecution.
A sensation could be if the main defendant János decided to give a comprehensive confession.
His previous information was less detailed, and even though he had already agreed to give a comprehensive report of everything, his confession is still out.
The question thus remains whether this is in his interest, whether the socialists have concluded a pact with him in respect of the reparation of the majority of the damage caused by HUF 50 million, and whether the supplement is ready in return to take on responsibility.
It is quite possible, however, that supplement now plays the "indulgent" after his attempts to relieve the detention and house arrest were encountered on deaf ears.
While other criminals, who have done far greater damage with economic offences and have not compensated them, are on their free foot, or at least under house arrest, this option is denied.
The psychology of surrendering - or why we are willing to pay more
In the case of auctions, the buyers tend to spend more and therefore overvalue the auctioner.
Neurologists and economic researchers from New York University have now succeeded in discovering the neurological-economic foundations of this well-known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to a study published in the Science magazine, people do not want to be beaten in a competition, such as an auction on eBay, and are therefore willing to pay even higher prices.
The researchers have tried to explore the neurological scheme of this "game" with experimental auctions.
A group of volunteers should play Lotto while the other participated in a playful action - in both cases the active brain regions of the volunteers were examined using functional magnetic resonance (fMRI).
At both games, the participants were able to win money, but an increased activity of Striatum, a complex below the brainline, was measured in the case of losers of the auction, in which oversupply of the opponent plays an important role.
In addition to many other functions, this brain region is responsible for the "self-remuneration" of the nervous system.
The researchers therefore considered that the price increase could be explained by the prevention of an overreaction of the striatum.
In order to support their thesis, the economists in the research group have also carried out investigations to track the money.
In this case, three groups should offer to one partner under different conditions.
The control group was informed of the true value of the product, after which they made their efforts.
Another group was also promised 15 dollars reward, in the event that they come out of the game as winners.
The third group received $15 before the auction, which was also lost in the event of a lost game.
The difference between the two groups was therefore merely that the emphasis was on winning, while the other was on losing.
However, as evidence of the hypothesis expressed by neurologists, the members of the "losing"-group were prepared to do more than those in the control or "wine" group.
"These results cannot be derived from any previous economic theory.
In fact, the practices observed at auctions have only so far been justified by the joy of winning, or risk prevention.
The contradiction between these two theories was resolved thanks to the imaging neurological procedures, so that we now have a third explanation" - said Andrew Schotter, professor of economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When does the doctor check out?
Around half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary this chronic liver disease is listed among the leading causes of death.
The number of infected people in this country is estimated at one hundred thousand, but only seven thousand are treated, which is because the patients often do not know that they are infected.
Hepatitis is the collective term for infectious liver disease caused by various viruses.
The symptoms are often similar - liver inflammation and jaundice are common, but the pathogens and diseases differ.
Depending on the pathogen, hepatitis viruses spread in two different ways: in hepatitis A and E, the digestive tract (for example through contaminated food or water), in hepatitis B, C and D, the viruses can be transmitted by blood and other body fluids (such as sperm, divorce or saliva).
Travellers are recommended to have vaccination against the viruses A and B at any rate, against the virus C there is no vaccine.
Symptoms of hepatitis A show up about two-three weeks after eating the contaminated food and are generally accompanied by discomfort, weakness, abdominal pain and vomiting.
Afterwards the jaundice occurs on the skin and in the eyes, the chair becomes bright, the urine dark, and the recovery can last up to two-three weeks.
Worldwide, about 1 million people die every year from hepatitis B, more severe diseases such as liver cancer and liver cirrhosis.
The main reason for this is that, according to estimates, only every tenth infected person is in medical treatment.
Hepatitis C may also have serious consequences: untreated liver cirrhosis and liver cancer may occur.
Most infected people don't even know about their disease, as the pathogen secretly destroys the liver cells - in many cases the first symptoms appear after 20-30 years.
Therefore, timely prevention, such as regular inspection, is essential.
There are three groups in which this disease is more common: those who have undergone blood transfusion before 1991, drug addicts, and tattoos.
Currently, the number of chronic hepatitis C patients worldwide is estimated to be 200 million.
Since the disease can already be detected in a routine laboratory examination, it is advisable to visit the home doctor at the first signs of unknown origin.
Just in time, the disease is curable, the virus can be eradicated, thus preventing the risk of infection and preventing the emergence of cancer.
September 30 is the world day of hepatitis, organised for the first time in 2004 of patient representations worldwide.
The aim of the action is to strengthen awareness of this chronic liver inflammation caused by viruses, their origin and the importance of early detection.
Do believers have less pain?
As the latest research shows, religious faith acts like a kind of "mericide" that should have facilitated the death of Catholic martyrs.
Researchers at Oxford University have carried out an interesting experiment: It has been studied to what extent faith in God affects human pain, reported the British sheet "Telegraph".
In the course of the rather bizarre investigation, 12 believers and atheists received electric shocks, while studying a painting of the Mother of God.
As the results showed, the faithful were able to eliminate most of the pain.
By means of a brain scan technology, it could even be demonstrated that the Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain, which is responsible for pain control.
The study was the first in a research project in which, in addition to scientists, philosophers and theologians from various departments of the university also participated.
In an attempt, a sparkling device was attached to the left hand to the test subjects, which gave off the electric shocks.
The participants were asked to focus heavily on two paintings: on the one hand, a picture of the Mother of God, painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century, and Leonardo da Vinci's "Dame with the Hermelin".
The researchers hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary among the faithful would produce a kind of religious trance, while they chose the image of Vinci, because it was hardly distinguished from the other painting and felt as soothing.
The test subjects spent half an hour in a MRI scanner, and at this time they received a total of 20 electric shocks in four stages while either looking at the religious or the other painting.
The Catholics reported that they felt "in security" at the sight of the Mother of God, as if they were "anxious" and they felt "rest and peace".
While considering the religious painting, they reported more than 12% less pain than if they had Leonardo’s work in mind.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the attempt, said that one could also produce similar effects with other, highly acting images also among the atheists, one just had to find the corresponding photo.
"We need to find a picture that causes very positive sensations, such as a mother or a father," says the psychologist.
The Anglican Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of research.
"The practice of faith should change our personality, and do it in many cases," says Wright.
After these excellent results, the only question remains what effect a Madonna image of Leonardo or another similar painter would have on the pain regulation of the faithful.
Would the high quality Virgin Mary achieve even better results?
You're what you know about you.
On the occasion of her tenth birthday, Google can claim with fug and right: it is found in the pockets of people as well as in their minds in the sky: it knows where people have spent their holidays, to which specialists they go, and what it moves.
And that still isn't enough, according to Eric Schmidt, one of Google's managing directors.
In the direction of skeptics who are plagued by Orwellian horror visions, he suggests that these would just overlook the essentials of the Web 2.0.
In an interview with the Financial Times, Schmidt recently said that the main goal of Google was to collect even more personal data about the users and thus to get closer to the company's original goal, according to which they want to "organize all the information of this world".
Schmidt explained that after ten years of world-changing work, Google is still only at the beginning of the information gathering.
Asked about the Status Quo in five years, Schmidt said that he wished Google would be able to answer questions like "What am I supposed to do tomorrow?" or "What job really fits me?", but software programs are not yet able to do so because they don't know enough about users.
Not all internet users are aware that the search terms were registered in the course of their Internet research, as well as the IP addresses from which they were searched, and the pages visited.
For example, the "Personalized Search" introduced two years ago allows the visitor to store his own search history and access it later, so that the results can be generated much more precisely later, and the so-called "Recommendations" are based on the same logic, with which the system recommends tailored products and services based on the previous preferences.
However, users wonder what happens in the event of a data abuse - "If you look at what I do" - some people are concerned about whether the Google data monopoly.
In most cases, however, it is more the potential power represented by the company, which is causing fear, and less the guilt or fear of punishment, the striving for freedom or the desire for power, which many internet users have to reject.
However, it is a proven fact that the search terms are not only stored, but also passed on to third parties in the event of an incident, and in these cases there is no protection for the personal rights of the Internet user.
One example of this was recently the action against pedophilia in Brazil, during which Google provided information to the Brazilian government collected by the community site called "Orkut" and also enabled the identification of pedophiles.
However, for personal rights users, it was still possible to breathe in May when Google successfully opposed the FBI in cooperation with the civil rights organisation EFF: Google cannot be forced to release information to the FBI on a secret request in the future with no point of the Constitution.
(However, the Federal Government has successfully produced the publication of 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms referring to the Youth Protection Act adopted last year, but the list of individual users, or their web and search terms, has been retained for two months.)
Google's image thus remains controversial: those who are reluctant to publish their personal data because they fear the loss of their private and intimate sphere by using Google services, the company suffocate with the emotion due to the conservative companies.
In the meantime, the American " geek culture", which is present in many countries and which includes enthusiastic computer fans, activists and users, sees the next generation of "cool entrepreneurs" in them, unlike Microsoft, which is thanks to Windows market leader, even though both fight for the same goal.
One possible reason for this is that, unlike Microsoft, Google does not require any identification codes for its users and provides its services free of charge, so that an open, constantly updated source code and program package seem to be far more attractive, youthful and cool than the official practices of the software giant.
On the other hand, the geeks are looking through the problematic relationship between personal rights and the Internet - a relationship that has been focused especially in recent years thanks to the term "web 2.0".
The "Web 2.0" deals with nothing other than collaboration, the users deliberately leave traces and use the available communication channels, and even if the sizes are different, the main thing remains the same, namely to show themselves publicly.
An average youth can manage his profile at the same time on several common portals - from Facebook to Xanga, it can connect to each other through other services, such as Twitter, or music services such as last.fm, and can eventually integrate all of this into a tracking system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. In addition, they can conduct blogs that automatically represent the latest photo galleries that are frozen on Flickr or Picasa.
And a number of other exemplary cases prove: When looking at the party photos of last night, the girlfriend soon finds out who your unfaithful friend has enjoyed, or the employee is released, because in his blog he is only too honest about the corporate leadership air - one is sure: the term "private sphere" has now been completely reinterpreted.
Those who lead an online life are what they reveal - for example, one could formulate the basic idea behind the behavior of today's youth.
And whoever tries to keep something secret, or even avoid the Google monopoly, can do that - like with Scroogle, a tool that does access the search engine from Google, but deliberately leaves no traces behind.
Not a few people deliberately do not register on community pages so that they are not detectable, but also the online applications of Google, such as word processing and graphic tools and RSS feeds, can be handled with alternative versions that are not connected to huge server parks and therefore do not generate the best possible profile from the user.
Public opinion, however, is waiting for Google to show its true face.
With a current value of USD 156 billion, the company is even ahead of IBM (USD 140 billion), Intel (USD 124 billion) or Coca-Cola (USD 110 billion), the AdWords/AdSense advertising areas are threatening the revenue of advertising agencies, and the more and faster-introduced services not only provide Microsoft but also other software developers with headaches.
However, critical viewers also find the disturbing counterpoles: e.g. the management of the Group rejected a protest from the employees entirely after the fees of the company's kindergarten were doubled, and the management meant that the staff's multi-services were too expensive. However, all this seems to be quite mildly against the fact that in 2006 Google even went into the knees before the Chinese government and agreed to an agreement that all the regime-critical hits, or those who violate the good taste, would be filtered out.
The Group's internal regulation is that in advance no new service will be applied, but only when it is already available. Nevertheless, the events of the coming months and years could again shift a lot further: While some of my Google's book and magazine scan or archiving project now assumes sizes that the company will soon have to deal with the Supreme Court, others are rather disturbed because of the "Health" system, which allows for the creation of a complete health profile based on findings, doctors and problems.
And the fact that Google builds a genetic database, the next generation of Sci-Fi authors already delivers the material - for example, "Scroogled", the famous novel of Cory Doctorow describes in best orwellian manner a future in which a person becomes terrifyingly approachable thanks to Google-related data.
Two young people help Ózd's double killer to remove traces
In connection with the double murder of Ózd, the police have now interrogated two youths who are suspected of helping in the removal of the tracks, the spokesman of the police commission Borsod announced on Tuesday.
The young people were competent and are currently charged with the aid.
According to information from the MTI news agency, it is two girls who defend themselves on their free foot.
Aid is threatened with a imprisonment of up to five years.
The suspect of the double murder of Ózd, a 23-year-old local man, was arrested on Sunday.
The man is under the suspicion of having deliberately murdered several people out of greed for money.
In the course of the investigations, it turned out that the 23-year-old had owed a larger amount of money to a 53-year-old.
However, the suspect did not want to settle his debts, so last Wednesday he lured his creditor on a site in Ózd, where he murdered him and his nine-year-old daughter.
According to the MTI, the man has planned the act of a long hand - this also proves the fact that he committed the murders with a weapon hidden in the crime scene.
Together with experts, the police are now investigating the crime weapon and the circumstances of its use.
Warsaw Stock Exchange provides purchase offer for Prague Stock Exchange
About 200 million euros, or 5 billion Czech kroners, the Warsaw Stock Exchange has offered for the one hundred percent purchase of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, President of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, reaffirmed the offer that the Poles had made despite the fact that they had previously been excluded from the Czech Republic as possible owners of their stock market.
The reason for this is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange belongs entirely to the state.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish State, which, however, wants to sell more than 60% of the papers in the coming months.
According to the Czech daily "E15", the Polish offers include the highest purchase price, which has been offered for the Prague Stock Exchange.
As the newspaper reports, so far the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse have placed offers.
Petr Koblic, head of the Prague Stock Exchange said last week that the Warsaw Stock Exchange would probably be the worst new owner by all the interested parties, and he did not rule out that this could even lead to the closing of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange at 5-10 billion crowns.
According to shareholders' agreements, 90% of the shares could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is Patria Finance Investment Bank with a 25 percent stake, followed by Ceská Sporitelna Bank with 14.7 and Tiger Holding Four S.a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis from the perspective of European newspapers
In their comments on the growing international financial crisis, a number of leading European papers already spoke on Tuesday from "second September 11".
The global financial disaster we owe to the American president, for example, said "La Repubblica" - the President has not even been able to put his own party for the bill behind him to bring some relief into the frightening situation...
Instead of a "new Pearl Harbor", as the milliarded investor Warren Buffett called it, it would be more appropriate to speak of a "second 11 September".
Parts of the press in Madrid also located the scapegoat in Washington.
According to the "El Mundo", the lack of political leadership is due to the fact that the world economy is now on the verge of collapse.
The American financial system is threatening to collapse more and more, and the whole world will suffer.
Bush's plan was not perfect, but now after the Congress vote, the danger is that Washington has no political means of crisis management.
The world economy depends in the air, just at a time when one of the greatest transformations of the history of capitalism takes place.
One can no longer ignore the threat, for example, is the Geneva Day Scoreboard.
While some countries could still provide rescue packages to their institutions that are in a state of retribution, they could save banks from bankruptcy with taxpayers' money.
However, if a domino effect is triggered and more banks are pleaded, then no further financial injections or other immediate measures will help.
In the long term, EU Member States would have to jump beyond their shadows and centralize control over the money markets.
On Monday alone, more than EUR 100 billion of weak money institutions were paid, the Vienna "Der Standard" reminds us. Furthermore, the newspaper continues to say, the concerns are becoming more and more realistic that, according to the Americans, European taxpayers would now have to take a bit deeper into their pockets to get out of the crisis.
So far, the EU has not seriously dealt with the crisis, which is now moving like a tsunami over the old continents.
Although the "retters" would not have to immediately "bottle" with several hundred billion euros, it would be advisable to maintain in which case it would be reasonable to attack the taxpayers' money in order to avoid an even greater damage.
Intelligent car imitates the flight of Hummel
What would be the best method for developing new technologies to avoid accidents if not to imitate the obstacle sensors from nature?
For example, the bees.
At CEATEC in Japan, an amazing project was presented in which the Nissan engineers of Hummeln were inspired in the creation of new systems that prevent accidents.
In cooperation with Tokyo University, Nissan has built the BR23C biomimetic system, which is controlled by robots, a mini car, equipped with the characteristics of the bees, with the aim of supporting the development of a system that avoids any collisions.
In flight, each bee forms its own oval "private area", which is very similar to our own "protection shield", said Kazuhhiro Doi, product manager for technology PR and research development, at the exhibition.
The combined eye of the bee, which can be seen in every direction and at an angle of over 300 degrees, plays an important role in this.
To imitate the function of the combined eye, the researchers took up the idea of the laser-controlled distanceometer.
This identifies obstacles to the BR23C in a 180-degree field within 2 metres, calculates their distances and sends signals to the microprocessor on board, which immediately initiates the collision prevention process.
The obstacle is recorded in fractions of seconds, and the auto robot immediately changes the course, similar to the movement of the bees, by turning the tyres around the appropriate angle.
Unlike previous systems, this maneuver is purely instinctive.
"If it weren't, the car robot could not react quickly enough to avoid the obstacles," said Toshoyuki Andoh, head of the "Mobility Laboratory" and the auto robot project.
The system must react instinctively and immediately as this technology corresponds to the innermost and most vulnerable part of the shield - a layer within which accidents are still considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect the behavior of the bees when they avoid other bees.
And this must end in the fraction of a second.
However, in contrast to the bees, the deviation can not be up, down, or even diagonal - it can only be two-dimensional, only in the direction of the reversibility of the tyres.
While the bees are open to infinitely many possibilities to avoid other bees, the researchers were able to use only the rotational movement, or acceleration and brake, in the car robot.
The BR23C contains lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and more energy efficient, and therefore have a longer service life than conventional lithium ion batteries.
Andoh explained that it is due to instinctive, intelligent response, and less to the processing of the data, and even less to the ability to store it.
This device only has to process some inputs per second and react accordingly to them.
It does not have to store it, or produce an intuitive, logical reaction using earlier maneuvers, so that it is constantly using only a handful of KB memory.
No gigabyte and megabyte heavy memories are needed.
This is the first step in the development of the immediate collision prevention technology, which, according to Nissan, will be in production within the next ten years.
Another application could find the technology in GPS satellite navigation by consciously directing the driver around obstacles and thus leading him to the goal.
A name for the riser child
Now, the written version of the 700-mrd-dollar rescue package law is available, which will be applied in several stages and target the purchase of bad loans from banks.
In the first pass half of the money is to be spent.
In a meeting that ended on Saturday after midnight local time East Coast, the Congress members, after several days of debates, went to an agreement on the 700-billion-dollar rescue package, reported Reuters.
"We have made substantial progress," said Nancy Pelosi, democratic president of the House of Representatives of the United States, saying that the agreement was only to be made in writing.
The compromise reached on the rescue package supported both presidential candidates - Barack Obama and John McCain.
Finance Minister Henry Paulson said the result: the program will show effect and it will be efficient, but one has to do more. According to Pelosi, this was not about the rescue of Wall Street, but about breaking the rowing of the economy.
The written version of the package was published before the opening of the Asian markets, so Washington time Sunday evening 8 o'clock (mid-European time Monday 2 o'clock in the morning), but did not trigger a high-level flight on the stock exchanges.
On Monday, the House of Deputies will first vote on the draft law on the stabilisation of the economy in 2008, then the Senate will be in line.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday evening, and the White House also welcomed the news about the agreement.
We are satisfied with the progress made at night and appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilise our markets and protect our economy, said Tony Fratto, spokesperson of the White House.
However, the programme deviates from the Bush Administration's original recommendation that the $700 billion should be issued at once for the purchase of bankrupt securities charged with loans.
In a first tranche, a maximum of half of the 700 billion amount is to be spent, with 250 billion immediately available after the Congress will vote on the Causa on Monday. This sum will be spent on the purchase of credited, poor securities, and over the next 100 billion USD will be decided by the President.
The programme will be reviewed by a Commission of its own, which is also a member of the President of the Federal Reserve.
The other half of the 700 billion depends on a further decision of the Congress.
Under the law, the Ministry of Finance can also use a combined tactic: it can at the same time buy bad loans, mortgages, and mortgaged securities, or other "toxic" loans.
As the competent persons of the ministry reported, the purchase can be done both in an auction and directly.
The law allows the companies concerned to participate in an insurance programme in which the Ministry of Finance guarantees the worrying funds, and the companies pay the expected damages correspondingly.
Henry Paulsen said: The law defines the necessary funds in such a way that up to 700 billion dollars can be made available as an emergency aid to the American financial system, whether for the large-scale purchase of poor funds, their insurance, or the prevention of a system risk caused by the collapse of a larger financial institution.
We take the necessary steps so that we are ready to implement the law as soon as it has been signed, says Paulson.
However, the heads of banks in difficulty and now dependent on state aid can expect the government to shorten their transactions, which are called ‘Golden Handshake’ in the overseas Slang.
A reduction in salaries will only exist in certain cases, and these reductions will depend on how the Ministry of Finance helps each.
The reduction essentially means that if the Ministry buys as part of an auction, the "Golden Handshake" is taxed, unless the served boss is transferred to the pension.
In the event of a direct purchase of default loans, the government will aggressively turn on to ensure that managers' salaries will not be overrun.
The picture also includes the fact that the existing Gold Handshake contracts are not changed - the restrictions refer only to new agreements, so that more people participate in the program.
This is the first case in American history that cuts in managerial salaries are regulated by law, commented Democrat Barney Frank, Chairman of the Financial Committee, the measure.
The State gains equity rights in participating banks, so that the risk for taxpayers decreases, as they can also participate as soon as the economy and thus the saved bank re-enters.
The draft law provides for the President to submit a proposal to the Congress in the next five years for the taxpayers to recover their lost money from the financial sector.
However, there were skeptics on both sides who expressed their doubts about the plan.
This is not what the American citizens expect from us, the plan does not protect taxpayers' money, says the California Republican Darrell Issa.
His colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur, said that the measures were promoted by the same people who are also responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industrial prices continued to rise
Like the Central Statistical Office, domestic sales prices increased by 0.1 percent in August 2008 compared to the previous month, compared with August 2007, by 12.9 percent.

Domestic sales prices were only slightly higher compared to the previous month, i.e. by 0.1 percent.
Sales prices of the manufacturing industry also rose little - 0.1 percent - since July.
The largest price increase in August 2008 for leather goods (2.8 percent) - primarily for bags and belts - was 4.6 percent here, while for shoes prices rose by 2.5 percent.
Higher prices for plastics and chemical raw materials significantly increased prices for chemicals and productions (1.6%).
Price decreases in crude oil processing (1.4 percent), electrical and technical equipment (0.9%), as well as small wood processing (0.1%).
Prices in papermaking, publishing and printing remained unchanged.
In other branches of the manufacturing industry, price increases were measured between 0.2 and 0.9 percent.
In the important domestic markets of industry, such as electricity, gas, steam and water supply, prices rose by 0.3 percent in August, mainly as a result of the increase in gas prices introduced on 1 July.
When looking at the domestic markets in the manufacturing industry in the year-on-year, prices in crude oil processing have increased the highest (32.4 percent).
In the metal processing sector, a 13.2-percent increase was observed, while the increase in the production of food, beverages and tobacco was 11 percent.
Price decline was observed in the textile industry (2,5 percent) and in electrical and technical equipment (0,3 percent).
The degree of price increase in the other manufacturing industries was between 0.6 and 9.1 percent.
Overall, prices in the manufacturing industry rose by 10.2 percent last year.
Prices for electricity, gas, steam and water rose by 18.7 percent compared to the previous year.
On the domestic market, the highest price increase in the investment goods sector was noted in August (0.7 percent).
In the production sectors for consumer goods, prices rose by 0.3 percent, while in the energy and further processing sector they remained the same compared to the previous month.
The largest price increase in August 2008 was observed in the energy and reuse sectors compared to the 2007 comparison period (16.8 percent).
In consumer goods, price increases of 6.8 percent were observed, with investment goods falling by 1.4 percent.
Industry's export prices in Forint increased by 1.1 percent in August compared to the previous month, but fell by 3.9% in the year-on-year.
In comparison to the euro, the domestic currency became 1.7 percent weaker, compared to the dollar by 7.1 percent, and compared with the August 2007 price, it became by 7.5 percent, compared to the euro, even by 15.9% in the dollar.
No more visas to the U.S. from 2009?
Kinga Göncz sees good opportunities for the American-Hungarian visa agreement to enter into force around the 12th of January, as the Foreign Minister explained before the representatives of the Hungarian community in Chicago.
According to her opinion, "everything now depends only on whether the electronic immigration or control system is introduced in time in overseas."
However, it also stressed that the new system would not allow entry, but the tourists would have to register in advance.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy is now conducting negotiations in Washington.
She meets Foreign Minister Condoleezza Rice, who will hand her over the "Middle Cross with Star" of the Republic of Hungary, and she will also conduct talks with the foreign policy advisers of the Democratic Barack Obama and the Republican presidential candidate John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain support rescue package for banks
Barack Obama and John McCain, the two presidential candidates of the great American parties, committed their support for the $700 billion rescue package for banks on Sunday, but there are also politicians who demand the resignation of the Minister of Finance.
After day-long marathon consultations on Sunday morning, the Congress and representatives of the government announced that they had reached an agreement on the bank rescue package.
The Wall Street crisis, as well as the opening up of the frozen credit market, were the central issues of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain - both claim to be better than each opponent to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to recent surveys, Obama was able to further expand its lead thanks to the economic issues, while McCains Hoch, who gave him the presentation of the Vice-Presidentship candidate Sarah Palin after the Republican Convention, was also melted.
At an election campaign event in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that the Congress would quickly accept the bill of the $700 billion package.
He stressed that the plan also includes those passages of consumer protection that he has supported.
"We need to act now, and we have to act responsibly (...) - your jobs, your savings, entire industries, and the stability of the entire economy are threatened" - he said before 35,000 spectators.
He has not failed to describe McCain's economic vision as "obsolet".
In an interview given to the station ABC, McCain stated: "We will all have a hard time to kiefer (...) but none of this is no alternative."
The Republican Senator said that the plan was also designed to establish a control commission for the Minister of Finance, as well as to limit the executions for top managers - something he had insisted on.
Obama told the CBS that McCain had not played a definite role in the negotiations, whereas Obama was in contact with the minister.
On Sunday, the speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, announced that the House of Deputies would probably vote on the draft law on Monday.
Press review of the German-speaking region
The right camp is intact, only the voters became more self-confident within the camp - so comments "Der Spiegel" the weak performance of the CSU in Bavaria.
In Austria, Haider and Co are ready to rule to prevent a red and black coalition.
The mirror (Mirror.de)
In the online edition of the German news magazine on the left, Franz Walter analyzes the reasons behind the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article "Bayern Revolution destroys their fathers".
According to the renowned politicalologist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber-Duo took over its offices.
The Christian socialists have renewed Bavaria for decades - now the modern citizens are turning away from them.
The break-up of the epoch is also a problem of Christian democracy, as well as of Angela Merkel.
Surprisingly, the disaster of the CSU did not come to an end, but on Sunday a little bit ended, which, however, had already been recorded quite exactly ten years ago: the unquestionably hegemony of a state party
For already ten years ago, 1998, the CSU landed at 47.7 percent and thus for the first time since the fifties fell under the fiftieth percent mark.
This repeated three years ago at the Bundestag 2005 elections, i.e. in the much cited Stoiber era.
Last but not least, the modernization carried out by the CSU in the federal state has destroyed its own mothers and fathers.
Sociologists had predicted this already 40 years ago, but they were greatly estimated at the pace. However, the secularization, the success of education, the rise of East and North Germans in the prosperous regions of Bavaria could not remain the fidelity of CSU voters.
Modernisation always goes hand in hand with an increase in options, and this has political consequences.
The right camp is intact - only the voters within the camp became more critical and willing.
It is striking that, in recent weeks, the classic citizens' groups have expressed the greatest distance to the CSU: the liberal professions, the commercial citizenship and voters with Abitur such as higher education.
Here CSU's support fell to even below 40 percent.
The Press (diepresse.com)
The conservative Vienna daily reports in her "Whom with whom? Party leaders holding back in coalition questions" articles on the chaotic inner political situation in Austria after the new elections.
The SPÖ wants to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The ÖVP prohibits the interference of SPÖ in internal affairs.
The BZÖ appears open to conversations in all directions, while the Greens do not yet want to determine themselves in relation to a coalition.
The new elections are over, and now everything is about coalition; in the debates on public-law television, the party leaders hardly let them look into their cards.
SPÖ-Chief Werner Faymann reaffirmed his desire to negotiate with ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to demonstrate that cooperation between both parties is very likely - in some federal states and in the social partners is already the case.
The question of whether he could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current head of ÖVP as vice-president, left Faymann open.
As he said, the voters had chosen the bowl-molder course.
A repetition of this direction is not in question.
However, Molterer has responded cautiously to red offers.
The cooperation could not be fruitful, he said if Faymann tried to interfere in the internal concerns of the ÖVP.
Whether its party is in opposition or in coalition is currently completely open and these questions should be discussed internally by ÖVP.
BZÖ-Chief Jörg Haider showed up in all directions.
"To prevent red and black, we are willing to assume government responsibility," said Haider.
Járóka: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today, the European Summit on Equal Opportunities has begun in Paris, which will be held this year by the EU Presidency of France.
In its speech addressed to the Assembly, Lívia Járóka, Fidesz Member of the European People's Party, pointed out, in particular, that this is one of the most serious violations of the law that is contrary to Roma children, and this is also the main obstacle to their need for application.
The High Level Conference was opened by the French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, Mr Xavier Bertrand, on behalf of the French Presidency, and Vladimir Spiderla, EU Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Among the participants were representatives of governments, the European social partners, as well as the most important European legal protection and civil society organisations in the field of equal opportunities.
Járóka, as reported by the press office of the Fidesz MEPs, pointed out that, in addition to discrimination in the search for jobs, Roma would be forced from the labour market primarily because of their low level of education.
"The vast majority of Roma young people do not have secondary education, and thanks to poor primary education, only a small part of them can reach a university degree".
Járóka also stressed that education was a fundamental human right, a key role to play in the promotion of other human rights.
Investment in early training for Roma children could strengthen the economy of EU Member States.
In the view of the Members, it is important that this relationship becomes as broad a circle as possible, i.e. Roma and non-Roma.
The earlier a Roma student starts school, the more likely he is to become a productive member of the labour market, and through income and turnover tax they contribute to national expenditure.
"As a Union citizen, Roma must be guaranteed the right to high-quality education - the poor and segregated teaching must be discontinued" - says Lívia Járóka.
As the Members said, a common, objective and action-oriented approach by the European Union is necessary in order to speed up the desegregation process in the education sector, which requires correct compliance with existing and planned anti-discrimination directives.
"We must break through the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment and give Roma children the democratic opportunity to contribute to the future of Europe as full citizens," Járóka demanded.
Since last year's Berlin Congress, the summit has been organised annually with the aim of creating a unique forum for the advance of the objectives of equal opportunities and freedom of discrimination at European and national level, within the meaning of the "European Year of Equal Opportunities".
CSU: Grace on time
At the end of October it will be decided on the fate of the fallen Duos Huber-Beckstein
Despite the election debacles, no heads are yet rolling, at the top of the Bavarian CSU the personnel debates were postponed.
Party leader Erwin Huber and Prime Minister Beckstein remain in their offices, the question is only how long this grace lasts.
The fate of the tandem after the catastrophic 17 percent loss of vote is decided on the last week of October at the extraordinary party.
The much-chosen duo, however, already made it clear that it does not want to stick on its chairs.
They want to appease the angry group and the party base, which one day after the "Bayerni tsunami" called for personal consequences in the face of the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - admittedly, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber, the Christian Social Union reached 60.7 percent. But now, one year after the coup against Stoiber, they were able to secure only 43.4 percent of the votes.
For 46 years, the CSU was the sole government in Bavaria, which generated 18 percent of German GDP.
Conservatives remain the decisive force in the southern state, which is also important for the Hungarian economy, but will have to rule in a coalition in the future.
As the first sign of the in-depth restructurings, the potential successor of Huber, Vice-President and Federal Secretary of State Horst Seehofer is also involved in the exploration team, which leads to a possible Munich coalition with the liberal FDP, or the right-wing "Free Election" exploratory talks.
One irony of fate is that with the list "Free Elections" Gabriele Pauli comes into the legitimacy, whose anti-stower appearance has used the Huber-Beckstein Duo first, in order to protect the determined politician mercilessly.
The CSU leadership now focuses all its forces on the stabilisation of Beckstein.
In this transition process, Stoiber, who so far removed the threads from the background, will play an active role. The former Prime Minister and CSU Chairperson called the 28th September the "bitterest day of his political career".
On Monday Huber made a few toxic remarks towards CDU - in his opinion the CSU would have earned far more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a signal to the CDU and thus also to Angela Merkel.
If the CSU, which also contributed a lot to success at national level in 2005, is not relocated to the legs with a joint power act, Merkel cannot become chancellor again after the Bundestag elections in September 2009.
Merkel, who did not make a heel out of her disappointment about the fiasco, believes that the CSU's loss of terrain will not have a negative impact on the great coalition in Berlin.
However, what is relative: the wounded CSU will not be easier to rule, and the crisis of the Social Democrats will continue.
At 18.6 percent, the SPD has achieved its best result in Bavaria since 1946.
Lukashenko Opposition: 110-0
In the elections on Sunday, there was no member of the opposition to the Ukrainian Parliament.
Russian observers believe this was the prosperity and stability of Alexander Lukashenko's country, but OECD suspects illegality in the counting of votes.
The OECD, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, has not recognised the elections.
De Legislature of the 10 million resident state has been without opposition for decades. Nevertheless, the opponent who had gathered under the name "United Democratic Forces" (ODS) in front of yesterday's elections seriously hoped that Lukashenko, who had already renewed his presidential mandate for the fourth time in the uncertain elections and thanks to a constitutional change in 2006, would allow some members of the opposition in Parliament to "let" this time.
That's why the ODS even removed from the previously planned Boykots.
Ukraine is becoming more and more economically dependent thanks to the rising prices in the import of natural gas from Russia. In order to reduce the price increases, loans have even been received, and the country has also agreed to the sale of Beltransgas, the owner of gas pipelines leading through the country, to the Russians. In the context of the opposition’s expectations, Ukraine was hoping to improve its relationship with the EU after Lukashenko and other high-level politicians have banned entry into the EU due to the anti-democratic political system.
The evaluation report of the OECD elections, in which the emphasis was on positive movements rather than on the shortcomings - such as the exclusion of a third of the opposition candidates from the elections - caused temporary relaxation.
However, the OECD's rapid report already criticised the campaign on Monday - therefore, oppositionists are not likely to occur in the press - and in particular the fact that the opposition was not allowed to be present in the counting of votes.
Despite all this, the opposition has been able to recognize an improvement in the political system: political prisoners have been set free, for example, and Minsk is even prepared to face smaller confrontations with Moscow by continuing to recognize the independence of the retired Georgian provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhasia, although Russia, with which Ukraine forms a federal state on the paper, has considered both territories independent for one month.
"We have taken two steps forward and one backwards, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun," said Alexander Milinkevitsch on our paper.
According to the 2006 opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential elections, a continuation is desirable, although "the powerful have been afraid of even having an opposition in Parliament".
The opposition does not plan to protest in the face of the results, but rather tries to clarify the need for economic reform to the voters.
"We have to fight with many problems here - the opposition newspapers have to be printed in Russia, the local authorities are setting ourselves in the way of selling stones, but yet I see that more and more people support the change, even the older ones" - said Milinkevich in alleging that not even the most supported layer of pensioners agree with the Lukashenko regime, whose only merit is the production of social security.
"Thanks to the country's debt and the rise in the trade deficit, it's just a matter of time to break the "social security" which is exhorted to the silence of a cemetery," says Milinkevich.
In contrast to the opposition politician, Russian observers have called the elections democratic.
Sergej Lebedev, Head of the Community Mission of Independent States, explained the news agency Ria Novosti: "People believe in the deeds, and not the words". Therefore, the lack of opposition is evidence of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on, breakfast will be done"
For the first time in the history of Palazzo Chigi there are rotating doors for the entrances and exits of officials.
From today on, the measure will take effect against those who first stamp and then drink coffee during working time.
The new Anti-Faulpelz Act was presented today by Renato Brunetta, the Minister for Public Administration and Mauro Masi, Secretary-General of the Bureau of the Council of Ministers.
">"Creative doors are a means of increasing labour efficiency through a higher presence rate and more services", says Minister Brunetta.
"Now a new era of responsibility and transparency begins.
This is reformism", says Brunetta once again.
With the Palazzo Chigi the establishment ends in all the buildings of the Bureau of the Council of Ministers.
Masi says: "The choice of rotating doors is also of great symbolic value".
On the part of the officials there was no resistance, the Secretary-General assured: "This process was supported by all, the cooperation came from all sides".
All in all, there is now no breakfast during working time anymore; ending with coffee or croissant.
Brunettas advises on this with a smile: "A good cappuccino at 7 am works miracles".
During a meeting of the General Committee of Public Administration (Scuola Superiore della Publica Amminizione)
The Minister of Rome announces that "within three months the absences of officials have been reduced to 50%, i.e. 60,000 people a year are more present at work".
He added that it was necessary to strengthen the efficiency of Italy's public administration
"In the last 8-10 years, their wage dynamics - according to the minister - have been twice as large as the private sector and far above the inflation rate.
Meanwhile, thousands of officials have joined forces to oppose the Brunetta decree in the context of the appeal supported by Codacons.
"While the Minister for Public Service is profiled with numbers about lower downfalls in work - as the consumer centre writes - the people of 'active lazys' are growing continuously.
In fact, thousands of correct and valuable officials from the public service have gathered in order to declare war on the non-legislative norms of the decree."
In particular, the Regional Administrative Court (TAR) is under attack for additional financial compensation for work-related illness, including the planned extension of the compulsory house arrest of the sick worker, during which inspection visits can be made and further aspects of the changes made by the Minister.
Napolitano: 'Prevention against occupational accidents is crucial'
Every day 2500 accidents occur in Italy, three people die and 27 remain life-long invalid.
For 2007, the data of the Inail (Istituto nazionale contro gli infortuni sul lavoro) confirm that the fatal occupational accidents were approximately 1200.
These figures demonstrate the seriousness of a phenomenon that causes almost twice as many deaths as murders.
Today, the Anmil (Associazione Nazionale Mutilati e Invalidi del Lavoro) in all the provinces of Italy will take the 58th national day for the victims of accidents at work, thus directing the attention of social institutions and media to this dramatic situation.
"The alarming data, spread by Anmil, and the tragic news of these days confirm the crucial issue of prevention at the workplace," confirms the President of the Republic of Giorgio Napolitano in his communication to the President of the Amil (Associazione nazionale mutilati ed invalidi del lavoro) Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expressed his "great appreciation for the constant commitment to the prevention of jobs, to the protection of injured workers, to aid the families of victims and to raise public opinion".
"A empathetic "basta" has raised itself to this; understandable in the case of tragedy, which, measured in its scale, trigger some vertebrae in the media and public participation. However, everyday reality often confronts us with dramatic events that can even repeat themselves in their own dynamics".
Napolitano does not hide that "there is definitely also a resource problem: it must be invested decisively in education and information."
A particular importance is attached to the numerous initiatives for more direct awareness-raising on the part of young people who feed the world of work.
It is our duty to focus attention on this phenomenon and not to divert ourselves from its social seriousness. You have to put into force and improve a legislative standard.
On the one hand, the President of the Gianfranco Fini Chamber stressed "as the phenomenon of work-related deaths constitute an urgent social emergency which insults the conscience of all of us and forces all institutions to work on decisive rules that aim to put an end to the problem".
"The data on work accidents seem to signal a slight improvement, but this does not exclude the fact that the number of work-related deaths is far too high," emphasizes President Anmil, Pietro Mercandelli.
"We don't want this "positive trend" to mean less attention. That's exactly what causes the tragedy in the end."
"How do you believe that you are basically doing too little to counter the phenomenon of accidents? You can fight against it through various actions.
In our opinion, stronger controls and inspections are necessary – according to Mercandelli, but also stronger measures to inform the workers who are already starting in school".
"An additional effort is necessary - he adds - in terms of communication and awareness-raising of public opinion.
But above all, a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers is in demand of a phenomenon which constitutes a social emergency".
Mercandelli also referred to "the progressive deterioration of protection for occupational accidents" and urged "the abolition of the social system against which we have been fighting in recent years".
"The aim is, therefore, to give the worker a guarantee of insurance, so that the fate of the victim of an accident at work will not depend on voluntary or random donations decided on by a legislator from time to time".
Mp3 player in charge: risk of hearing damage
Listening to loud music over a longer period of time with portable music devices, such as Mp3 player, can lead to permanent hearing damage.
This is reported by the European Commission, which is quoted in a report published today in Brussels by the Csrseri (scientific committee on current and recently identified health risks) of the EU.
"The report – it says in a note – shows that 5-10% of those who hear music with portable music for at least five years are at risk of permanent loss of their hearing for more than one hour a day."
"I'm worried that such a large number of young people, who usually put portable music and mobile phones on a high volume, damage their hearing without knowing it irreparably," said Meglena Kuneva.
"From the scientific findings – it is said by the European Union – there is a clear risk of being too quick to act.
What really matters is to raise awareness of consumers and make this information common good.
In view of these scientific findings, we need to review the control systems already in place so that they are fully effective and keep pace with the new technology".
Brussels had commissioned the independent Scientific Committee in view of the widespread use of portable music equipment among young people.
"The scientists - and the EU communication concludes - confirm that one is rightly concerned and that the European Commission, together with the other European Members and those concerned, will now examine the necessary measures to ensure that children and young people are better protected from the noise coming from portable music equipment and similar devices".
There is already a European standard which limits the level of noise from portable music devices to 100 dB.
One can limit these damage very much in which one accesss to solutions such as reducing the volume and the length of the noise suspension.
In its report, the Scientific Committee of the European Union points out that if the users of portable music devices hear music for only five hours a week (more than 89 decibels) so that the legal limits already exceeded which apply to the maximum sound level at the workplace.
Those who cross this line of music risk the complete loss of hearing within five years.
This represents 5-10% of the users of such devices, whose number can be estimated at between 2.5 and 10 million in the European Union.
Roma, Alemanno launches the "Commission for the Future of the Capital"
We are starting today, in March it will be over, in June we will take stock.
This is the process defined by the Capitol for the work of the "Commission for the Future of the Capital Rome". The Commission met this morning in the new headquarters behind the Caracalla Baths.
In six months, President Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will draw up guidelines for Rome.
As soon as the project is completed, the City and Municipal Council will evaluate the analyses and projects in order to be able to present the strategic plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of the Capitol and the Mayor Gianni Alemanno in June.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and all political, social and cultural opinions are represented in it," said Alemanno. "It will present proposals for a development plan for Rome, whose political leaders of the city and municipality council will remain.
There is no redeployment of responsibilities, only the will to have a place where one can develop a large project for Rome.
In March, its task will be completed and the Commission will resolve again, as such a project must have a temporary final point.
In June - as the Mayor announces - we will present the strategic plan in which we will use the work done by the Commission".
Those who question the competence of the Commission, since their opinion of liability is lacking, Alemanno replied: "All depends on the work that the Commission will do and on the quality of its proposals.
If, as in France, the Attali Commission delivers quality results – and this will certainly be the case in Rome – then its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often policy is concerned with the everyday problems and emergencies that occur from time to time.
On the other hand, we want to have a longer period of time in mind, so that we can work seriously on the development of Rome and the future of the city in a deeper perspective".
"This Commission is neither a useless institution, nor a wreck: it is absolutely free, it will not cost Roman citizens a cent and it will bring us to think, and it will employ the best heads of the capital."
According to Alemanno, "it is necessary to have a strategic plan, which is neither hermetic nor static, in order to allow our city a quality leap - which it really needs - and thus to take a common step into the future".
A future, said the mayor of Rome, which "will not only limit itself to the current municipal boundaries but will look much further", not only as regards the role of Rome as a metropolis and political capital of Italy, but also as the future capital of Europe and the Mediterranean."
Obama – the first anti-American president? Here is a statement
A well-known American politician, who is much about being considered independent, wrote: "Barrack Obama becomes the second anti-american president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, through his decisions, decimated the economy of the USA and engaged with the established Islam relations (and still does this as a private man today).
The attacks against Obama are becoming more and more violent, right now where the elections are approaching.
A Miami lady wrote in an internet page: "This person is full of ambitions.
Obama is very bold: he thinks he will receive the highest office of a nation that has seen a total of two black governors and five black senators."
In fact, these attacks do not have much to say; they are racist attacks and they do not answer the question of voters: will he be a good president? And then there are also the surveys; all say that Obama will win with a great advantage.
In this case too, there are people who speak with the heart and not with the head.
A Mississippi newspaper, in the deepest south of the United States, has written in its editorial: only in the election booth will we know who the true American patriot will give his voice.
Here, a mentality of the United States comes to light, which has been kept hidden until last.
"If you say what you want, then we will decide for whom we will make our Creeches, whether for Obama or for McCain."
There are people who swear: if Obama wins, we will migrate from America.
Something you never heard before – only now where the success of the black candidate seems so sure.
In any case, despite all these considerations, the final weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
1500 people were asked: What mistake did Bush commit during his term of office? 89% answered: the war in Iraq.
America is changing.
The nation lost 50,000 soldiers in Vietnam and was sent back home with a step in the back.
In Iraq, 4500 soldiers lost their lives and the Americans were not forced to pack.
Nevertheless, Iraq remains for the majority of Bush' weakness.
The one who will take his place is facing a huge task.
USA. The financial collapse leaves its mark also with journalists: in the newspapers you can already feel the cuts. And many accuse the Internet, the "killer" of the printing press.
Five hundred American journalists were asked about the future by the PEW Research Center about their situation and mental control.
Today, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
Nevertheless, they did not really explain to those who are responsible for the information they provide because of the general credibility.
They don't feel as alone as they used to.
The problem for the American journalists is the money.
The 2008 crisis is a crisis of an economic model that has been destroyed for these journalists.
In addition, the major problems are caused by the cuts in the newsroom, i.e. the space in which the editors work to put together the paper.
This is a problem that needs to be solved – so the interviewed journalists – if you want to prevent traditional journalism, as the big audience understands it, from falling apart.
A clear but complicated pessimism is fulfilling the American journalist today.
Six out of ten journalists and executive seniors of the printing press believe that journalism is on the wrong track at national level.
In the local area, executives are even 65%.
Printed vs Broadcast.
It is not difficult for journalists to imagine the direction in which the web goes.
The most important publishing groups run the way to the Internet, which is considered by many to be the "killer" of the printing press.
The "economic pressure" that journalists feel has increased by up to 79%.
The 500 interviewed journalists have admitted to want to join the new technology, in the hope of "they bring something good for journalism".
The biggest crack in American journalism today exists between the chief editors of the newsroom and the reporters who work for them.
56% of the editors at national level are sure that their reporters share their values with them, while at local level only 23% are.
Some think it has to do with "security in work".
The managers who are afraid to lose their jobs within three years are 47% at national level.
There are 30% of journalists.
The topic of "safe work" in the team (our "readers", anm. d. Red.) is always a current topic in the United States.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In a huge nation like the United States, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio and TV operators and Internet operators, employers offer as it is popular to them and so it becomes a question of take it or leave it.
The editors get very often very high wages, while the editor can sometimes receive only 10000 euros per month, including pension and insurance funds.
As for the holiday, the thing becomes complicated: a certain amount of days in the first year, so and so many after the third, to finally reach 15 days after a certain number of years.
But the American journalists, as they admit themselves, will often be "sick" in the course of the year.
It is a matter of climate.
UNIPOL: JUSTICE IN ROM: DANILO COPPOLA BLEIBED IN GREAT AFTERRATE
The President of the Court of First Instance in Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the property agent's request, which had been asked to be transferred from Grottaferrata to Rome.
It is determined against Coppola for bankruptcy in the context of the investigation on the counter-convention in the case of the acquisition of Unipol-Bnl.
In the course of the trial against him during the last week, his release from the house arrest was transformed into a residence obligation in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella had asked to allow the real estate agent to be moved from the provincial city to an apartment in the capital.
According to the court, such removals (which the prosecutor had pronounced) could give him the opportunity to influence his company and to obtain evidence indicting it.
Elite is in danger
The phenomenon had been revealed a few days ago when the Chamber of Deputies voted against the White House's 700 billion-dollar package: one large part of the Americans was and is more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
This confirms the yesterday edition of the New York Times, which reports about how the crisis in progress widened the Republican Party, which is increasingly divided into its old and moderate East Coast soul, which always favours the state institutions and the business community, and that neoconservative, which is hostile to "thin Washington" and the financial world, and that, in the south and the centre of the states, wins voters.
This part of the party owes its rise to the voice of the one I mentioned above.
This just mentioned example, however, is only a small part of the major changes that the current economic earthquake announces or even already represents: not only in the US, also in the whole West and perhaps beyond it will be affected by it.
Both in the states and in Europe, the crisis seems to accelerate the long-awaited events, which, under these new conditions, finally take shape and come to light.
The first of these phenomena is the new discovery, the unheard renaissance of the state in connection with a kind of renationalization of the economy.
In fact, the crisis means a decline in the banking and financial institutions, which have close links to abroad and at the same time manage an enormous amount of private households living in a single state.
This means an immediate political problem for governments: that is, how to deal with the families concerned, which is also a huge number of voters.
So the crisis appears economically global, and politically, it is almost purely national.
Political internationalism seems to be so remote and have lost its right of speech: the illuminating evidence of this has been given by the EU, which, due to its division into various national and international conflicts, has not been able to find a common way.
So everyone expects the intervention of their own state; rescue plans, new rules, and a. distribution of aid funds: Since the crisis became more and more serious, only the US are in the economic situation to save itself without foreign help.
In addition to the means, they also have the legitimacy to use them: therefore, two conditions that cannot be overvalued – in certain circumstances – that otherwise no international organization and no market will be able to use in a similar way.
That new emphasis, which is placed on the state-national element, is, moreover, in perfect harmony with the ever-increasing importance that is recently linked to a closely related sector: territoriality.
Paradoxically, it is just now that we have been so convinced that we have long gone into a networked entire realm, into an empire of increasingly differentiated technologies, the immaterial, that we must at once see how our future will depend more and more on the essential material things: water, harvest and oil.
Although all of these can certainly be transported from one place to another in the world, they are nevertheless connected to a closely defined piece of earth – a territory.
Therefore, the person who has such a territory is in favour of another who lives in a non-fertilized, waterless or oil-free area.
I now come to the second news, but this is a short step forward.
Whoever's territory, who's the government, who says politics, says leadership.
In this sense, the financial crisis seems to produce two converging phenomena.
On the one hand, there is the knowledge of the need for respected leadership, so the need for someone who knows how to regulate things.
On the other hand, there is now a wave of disarmament over the existing leadership, i.e. that of the economy, which has turned out to be inadequate and full of shadow zones.
Finally, there is a deep and in a sense still disturbing aspect: a loss of confidence, an indifference, a picture of inutility, a feeling of distance, all aimed at an entire class of managers of Western countries.
This seems to pave the way for many people to believe that it is not only the deeds of the social elite, but already their world of ideas, their Way of Life, their culture in the broadest sense of the word, whose salary is the majority of them being increasingly foreigner and more abundant.
The demand for leadership therefore sub-terraneanly nourishes a branched but powerful movement of the empowerment of the leading class and the traditional political establishment. This manifests itself in unforeseen "revolts" of voters and in the immediate change of the collective state of mind of the past: starting with the rise of conservatives in Austria and Bavaria, about the collapse of the Labour Party in Great Britain, towards the rebellion of American MEPs against Bush (and perhaps the victory of rights in Italy plays a role here).
One gets the impression that the old elite, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, magazines, intellectual creditors, some would say their format, have more and more problems of understanding and therefore less representative value as to what is going on in the lower social stratas of the West and is even strengthened by the financial crisis and driven to overdimensionality.
In view of all this, it would simply be exaggerating to speak of a "rebellion of the masses".
But keeping the eyes wide open is certainly not.
The super glue that gets up on walls
To defeat the forces of gravity thanks to a adhesive and to be able to climb walls like Superman.
This is the subject of four American research centres, one of which seems almost to have reached the target.
With a adhesive applied on an area of only 2.5 square meters, the researchers have managed to fix a 100 kg body on a vertical wall.
The STUDIO – an American magazine has published the results of researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the research team is a further development of the adhesives already used, which use a special carbon structure, called carbon nanotubes.
"The principle of the adhesive can be imagined as a series to a stack of spaghetti-ordered tubes," explains Zhong Lin Wang from the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The scientists have been inspired by the feet of the geckos, which are covered by microscopic fairy tales that give the animal a perfect stop.
The tests carried out with various materials such as glass teflon and sand paper have shown that the new adhesive is ten times stronger than the durability of the feet of the reptiles and at the same time "can be removed from the wall without problems", says Liming Dai, researcher of the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Dayton.
"This material could be used as a transient adhesive," adds Liming Dai.
About how Spiderman gets involved in walls? Maybe already, but the researchers think of less fascinating benefits, such as the connection of electrical appliances, because the nanotubes are also heads of heat and electricity.
Other applications could fall within the space sector.
So for the moment, the superheroes still have to wait.
THE OTHER ART OF RESEARCH – also the University of Berkeley, California, is dedicated to a new adhesive.
In an article by the American Chemical Society, Californian scientists present a adhesive made of microfibres that, like hair through movement on a surface, cleanse itself from dust and thus always maintain a perfect liability.
Medicines: never take with fruit juice
Beware of grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, which are consumed due to their refreshing quality and vitamin richness, especially in summer, can cause serious health damage if they are taken at the same time with certain vital medicines, as they can affect the absorption of these by the body in an extreme way.
David Bailey, professor of the University of Western Ontario in London, repeatedly points to the risk of packed as well as fresh fruit juices associated with drug intake. As part of the 236th meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he once again suggested: There is a glass of apple, orange, or grapefruit juice sufficient to reduce the ability to take certain vital medicines to the extent that they are virtually eliminated and thus the health of the patients is threatened.
Grapefruit juice has been suspected of being responsible for increasing the effects of some medicines such as antibiotics, anti-asthmatics, cardiovascular drugs, anxiolytic and neurological agents to toxic levels.
MEDICAMENTS IN FAITH – The same Agency of the Medicine had warned doctors and patients in a report two years ago about the dangers of this mixture, and stressed that what is being drunk in conjunction with medicines such as diazepan or metadon.
IT IS NOT FOR GRAPEFRUIT – According to experts, orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that can inhibit medicines.
The list of active substances inhibited by fruit juices is long.
The appeal of Michele Carruba, director of the Università Statale di Milano, therefore: "This results are usually forwarded immediately to the various international manufacturers, who are so free to change the consumer information.
Therefore, it is recommended to read the package leaflet at all times and, if there is still some uncertainty, do not shyly ask a pharmacist or doctor," emphasizes the Ansa Agency's expert.
The Nobel Prize goes to Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize is to the American Paul Krugman for his analysis of trade patterns and the settlement of economic activities.
The 55-year-old Krugman is a Neokeynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is known for his regular articles for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush Administration's economic and external policy.
A few months after the attacks of 11 September 2001, during the days of Enron collapse, Krugman had claimed in a New York Times editorial that this second event was more crucial to the history of the United States than the attacks.
A prediction that did not receive a little polemic in response and was held up to the economist years later, but is now quite correct.
"I am surprised and also shocked by how quickly the memory of the scandals in the context of the collapse of Enron or Worldcom has disappeared from the public perspective," Krugman explained at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is an "econom of great value", but also a Banaliser with a "very aggressive style that is especially directed against the excessive liberalism of Bush government."
Open Office, it appears the third version of the "Anti-Microsoft" package
The day of release of OpenOffice.org 3.0 has arrived; as a free replacement for Microsoft's Office, the Open Source Software gains an increasing number of users, both at home and in the office, both among the freelance and the public administration.
After a year of intensive work by the voluntary developers monitored by SUN Microsystems, the new Open Office is now presenting itself to the audience with some innovations: in addition to a revised and now more spartaneous start menu, a reason for guaranteed compatibility with Apple's Mac OS x operating system is finally achieved, as well as support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 format, i.e. the latest standard ISO version.
Eight was also opposed to compatibility with Microsoft's Office 2007, whose new formats (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx) can be read by OpenOffice.
Also interesting are some new features, such as those that allow to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, which facilitates e.g. sending via email. This also includes the possibility of importing PDF files into graphic editing modules and at the same time preserving the original appearance of the page.
Thus, you can now generate "hybrid" PDF files that expand the typical graphics of Adobe format around the elements of a table and a word processing system.
The cooperation is one of the most improved elements of the applications: tables can now be processed by different users, thus avoiding conflicts in the event of changes; in the case of the text processing system, each processor is assigned a fraction to ensure a better correction procedure.
Some companies are just about to publish various features of OpenOffice on the Internet (on the cloud), while the final result will be published in the coming weeks.
The Italian version is available for download on the following link: http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html. Thus it follows the English version, which has been on the mirror since Friday.
Besides for Windows and Mac OS, the program is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request, the installation CD can be sent home or to the office.
However, if the freedom of free movement can be an incentive for the dissemination of the programme into private households, it is also particularly in the business area where OpenOffice could succeed: after all, various public administration and schools have already passed over to OpenOffice.
In fact, there is not even a lack of training opportunities, which means optimal assistance for small and medium-sized enterprises, and thus opens up business prospects.
OpenOffice is composed of five main components: Writer, the Word corresponding to the text creation program; Calc, the table program that aims to disperse Excel; Impress, to create presentations such as with PowerPoint; Dbase to operate databases instead of known access; and, lastly, Draw, a graphics module.
The 2008 target is to reach 5 million downloads – a target that can easily be exceeded at 3 million and 600 thousand already reached.
Kohl also tested positively and thus the fourth doping case
It opens up a new doping case in the context of the last Tour de France: it is the Austrian sportsman Bernhard Kohl of the team Gerolsteiner, who is a third-classifier and winner of the jersey of the best climber.
The news published the daily L'Equipe on its website.
The 26-year-old Kohl by the Gerolsteiner team is the fourth driver, who was tested positively on Cera, the third generation Epo. Previously, this already happened with the Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli as well as with the German Stefan Schumacher.
The analyses from the blood samples of Kohl are among those performed in recent weeks by the laboratories Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the counter-tests now confirm the positive results on Cera, the Austrian will lose third place and will be excluded from the race for two years.
The head of the French antidoping commission Pierre Bordry confirmed the positive epoch, and, according to the Associated Press, also informed the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian, behind the Spaniard Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, also claimed the jersey of the best climber for himself.
THEMA IMPLEMENTATION: NEW YORK TIMES: IS ITALY RASSISTIC?
Italy, "the former country of the migrants has recently become one of the preferred countries for immigrants", which are only taken up with inconsistencies.
Does the Belpaese make this a nation of racists? This asks the New York Times in a long article dedicated to the subject of racism in Italy, and from the case of the young, from Burkina Faso, stamming Abdul William Guibre, who was murdered a month ago in Milan after he had stolen a pack of cookies.
The case testifies to what the Times call "Paradox of the North": the northern regions are those in which "most integration and work opportunities" exist, and yet "the highest degree of anti-immigrationist sentiments and the greatest support of the Lega Nord is to be noted".
As a confirmation of the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the Times calls for further episodes of intolerance from Milan, Rome, Parma, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
And not just this.
The new legislation against immigration introduced by the Lega and the faster expulsion of illegal immigrants is also cited as a sign of climate change in Italy.
A movement which also underlined the Pope and the President: "Giorgio Napolitano asked the Pope at a meeting on the Quirinal for cooperation between the Church and the State to combat racism."
Students victims of up to 900 Euro per room high rental prices
The market for apartments for students knows no crises.
According to the last study of the Sunia, the Renter Association, a single room can cost a student up to 900 Euro in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome.
"This phenomenon has already taken very serious traits. Whole numbers of students are losing their right to study, as their families are not able to support them at this level" - according to Sunia's responsibility, Laura Mariani - "in these cities the great demand on the part of the students leads to a deformation of the market, which has also damaged the other inhabitants.
In addition, most of the rental offers include a number of infringements: free contracts, missing registrations, without rental price limit, unauthorised submissions.
In the case of Sunia, there is a need for exceptional measures, which lead to lower rental prices due to a revision of taxation.
The study shows that Milan needs a sleeping place in Brianza district about 450 euros; a single room starts at 650 euros (in Nere district) and ends with 800 euros in the Lambinate, Udine and Fiera district or even 900 euros in Vittoria district.
In Florence a sleeping area averages 350/400 euros, a room 700.
In Bologna, where students are concentrated in the neighborhoods around the university, 250/280 euros are for a sleeping place of need, 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome, prices in the neighborhoods around the university are about 600 euros for a single room, 450 for a sleeping place in a double room.
Only a little deeper are the rents in the neighborhoods around the other universities of Rome: 550 euros in Ostiense and Cinecittà.
Only those who leave out in foreign districts can save money: 300 euros for a sleeping place and 450 euros for a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar quarters.
In Naples you need 300-450 euros for a sleeping place, for a room the price is between 400 and 600 euros in the most expensive neighborhoods, Policlinico, Umero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari a sleeping place costs 250-350 euros, a single room at least 350.
In the smallest cities, prices are lower, but they have a greater weight in the urban economy.
In cities where the phenomenon of renting non-European students is more common, such as in Perugia, there is even another anomaly: a rental that is 25-30% higher than the average is required by foreign students.
Goodbye to the old cinema Paradiso – the cities close their historic cinemas
The historical cinemas close due to the favoured multiplex kinos.
"A city without cinemas is a blind city, like a face without eyes."
This image of director Giuseppe Tornatore describes with effect what is happening at the moment in the major urban centres of Italy, and also in the provinces.
The process of the exclusion of cinemas, which began with the birth of the large multi-sale complexes in the periphery, means long-term death for the one-saal cinema in the center. A process that not only seems inevitable and irrevocable, but also carries the traits of a cultural crime.
The most affected are historical places full of memories, "It's like losing a friend with whom you've put a piece of street full of emotions," said the director of the film "Nuovo Cinema Paradiso", who brought him the Oskar and the great prize of Cannes 20 years ago. It's about the history of a suburban cinema and its nostalgia, which consists of living in a cinema world that is probably lost forever.
The figures that the Anec, the Central Trade Association provides, speak a clear language: over the last five years, the vast amount of 316 traditional cinemas have had to close; these are for the most part the cinemas in the big cities: 10 in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
Among the most affected regions are the Emilia-Romagna with 82 lost cinemas, followed by Tuscany with 44 and Lombardy with 41.
This testifies to the fact that the main accusations are the multiplex kinos, because they are precisely these three regions in which the largest number of these modern cinemas has been registered: with 195 in the last 5 years, Lombardy is leading the lists, 81 are both in Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
"The business has developed in an irrational way," says Paolo Protti, the president of the Anec, "but it is useful that new structures also arise, but first of all the preservation of the already existing one, because locks a hall in the city, not all its regular customers are willing to visit a multiplex cinema in the periphery instead of the old one.
And here is still the lack of budget for the foundation of the trade union: the debt burden recorded by the state amounts to about 10 million euros.
It is a shame from the ethical-moral point of view that the government does not observe the existing laws.
In order to obtain the sector, between 16 and 18 million euros in the year would be necessary".
Interesting is the case of Bologna, the first Italian city, which, due to the fears of the old cinemas, has decided to protect them through an agreement between the community and the Anec; it is the first agreement of this kind in Italy to protect and support traditional cinemas, both in the historical centre and in the periphery.
Among the planned measures are tax advantages for the cinema operators as well as benefits for the public in terms of local transport: it will be allowed to go to the traffic-limited areas of the centre and also to park at cheaper parking fees.
"It's an encouraging initiative," said Giuseppe Tornatore, "I hope that other cities will join our example and also design new concepts.
But certainly we also need a better audio and video equipment to be able to do something against the superpower of the multiplex rooms, because finally the audience is more demanding today.
The defense of traditional cinema has always been an important topic for me: the closing of the "supercinema" of Baghiera, the place of my childhood and youth, was the decisive point that led me to establish the "Nuovo cinema Paradiso", even if I had been playing with the thought for 10 years.
For 25 years I have lived in Rome; when I pass the Rialto or the Quirinale in the Via Nazionale, where I have experienced so many different emotions, I turn to the side not to have to see the dust-covered posters.
The links between politics and 'Ndrangheta' lead to the arrest of the mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to adapt the decisions of the community to the interests of the Piromalli Mafia group.
The accusations of the attorney of the Antimafia authorities in Calabria against the mayor Giorgio Dal Torrione and his deputy Rosario Schiavane of the municipality of Gioia Tauro, who were arrested this morning for negotiation in Mafia shops, are serious.
Gioacchino Piromalli, the senior mediator between the clan and the public administration, as well as his nephew, was also handcuffed: the lawyer who bears the same name as the boss of the clan, had already been sentenced to a compensation of 10 million euros because of the processing of criminal associations of the Mafia.
According to the lawyers, "each kind of moral and legal norm disregards," "had the two local administrations decided to pay Lawyer Piromalli funds for consulting activities."
"It was thus made possible for the Mafia group – the judges say – to enter the town halls on an official way and to agree on public administration policy."
The President of the Regional Committee of the Agazio Loiero Regional Committee does not deny that in his region "it is anything other than an exception to the links of local administrations and organised crime." "There are places in which the concentration of the Mafia is greater than in others in which such connections are practically inevitable.
But there are also local politicians who resist the pressure of 'Ndrangheta': heroes who receive a white vest."
The arrests of this morning follow those of last July, with which the Clan Piromalli was decapitated, according to the police.
Since the end of April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved, but already in 1991 – and even then due to alleged links between organized crime and the local administration – the local politicians of their municipal offices had been removed.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, then mayor of the Udc, was elected head of the Middle Right Coalition in May 2006.
He shouted scandal as the prefecture ordered the resolution of the council.
He was interested in Vice-President Marco Minniti, who claimed to have invented everything for political-strategic reasons, but the judges explained in connection with the arrest warrant of this morning that the Piromalli clan had even dared to apply for a change to the A3 project.
From a hearing action related to the Dal Torriane case, the willingness was shown to meet the wishes of an entrepreneur, who is known to be a representative of the large group around Piromalli – which made public administration measures identical to the interests of this clan."
When the energy comes out of the waves, the greats suddenly run up
It is a non-interpreting source of money covering more than 70% of the planet's surface, and only now this seems to be the main energy companies in the world to understand.
Waves, currents and tides are the new renewable sources of energy that are now all looking for, and are also looking for gobbling, such as giants like Chevron.
The possibility of extracting energy from the sea's movements has been considered and examined for 70 years; these studies have not by chance increased significantly since the first oil crisis.
When the price of oil came into existence around 1980, the idea of marine energy was gasped, but now the environmental organizations and the rising price of oil are pressing for new impulses in this sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimates that 15% of global energy needs could be covered by the energies generated by the ocean waves.
This would be the same for the double of the energy currently produced by nuclear power plants.
In addition, the currents and tides would be added.
Giants in the attack.
The first company to rely on marine energy is Enersis, who signed a contract in 2005 for the establishment of a power plant in northern Portugal.
When this message was published it seemed to be a revolutionary step.
Two years later, there are now more and more companies from the traditional energy industry that rely on marine energy generation.
"Chevron investigates these technologies," says the spokesman of a company known as the US giant in the Wall Street Journal, and weighs the opportunity to work with us."
This concerns the procurement of a permit from the American Energy Commission, which is necessary to launch a project off the coast of Alaska.
This is not an underestimating sign, i.e. considering that oil is still being promoted by the US in Alaska, and President Bush just recently launched the plans for new drilling.
In addition to Chevron, the companies Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey, which invest in the new industry, are also not known the details, so observers speak of an increasing interest.
Even improved technologies.
Experts speak of a technology that is still in progress, not least because the last doubts have not yet been resolved by the environmentalists.
So far, projects such as those in Portugal and Scotland are of rather small size and do not seem to cause any serious ecological problems.
However, to produce energy on a large scale, there is a need for technologies with far greater impact on the environment.
There are several possibilities: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of interconnected beans.
The push of the waves, which moves the bows up and down, is converted into hydraulic pressure through pistons and cylinders within the floater.
This drives a turbine, which in turn operates a generator.
The current is sent to the coast via underwater lines.
So far, there are four planned plant of this kind, which is only waiting for state approval. Part of the energy obtained could also serve military facilities.
In fact, Verdant Power is already producing energy for a department store and a parking lot using underwater turbines in the East River of New York.
The water movements during the tides drives the turbines, which feed the generator through the resulting rotation.
According to Verdant, a long queue of potential clients is already waiting for the necessary authorizations to use these energy sources.
First the waves, then the tides.
According to the Institute for Electricity Production Research, a particular interest is immediately worthy of the potential that lies in the tides.
Although this is an irregular phenomenon, the tides are more predictable than wind currents, solar radiation and waves, and therefore a more reliable source of electricity.
It is precisely tidal energy which states such as New York, Maine and Alaska and other coastal states have contributed to investing already 7.5 million dollars in 2008 – up to 35 million in 2009.
