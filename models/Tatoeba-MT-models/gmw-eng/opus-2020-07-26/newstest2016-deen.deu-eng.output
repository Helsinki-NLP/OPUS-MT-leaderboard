Obama receives Netanyahu
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not exactly friendly.
The two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and about Tehran's destabilising measures in the Middle East.
At the meeting, however, it is also about the conflict with the Palestinians and the discussed two-state solution.
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been tense for years.
Washington criticises the ongoing settlement of Israel and rejects Netanyahuâ€™s lack of will in the peace process.
Due to the deal that Obama has applied for the Iranian nuclear program, the relationship between the two has deteriorated further.
In March, Netanyahu delivered a controversial speech at the invitation of the Republicans before the US Congress, which was partly valued as an affront against Obama.
The speech was not agreed with Obama, but a meeting had rejected it with reference to the election that was to come in Israel at the time.
In an emergency call, Professor admits to have shot his girlfriend.
In an emergency call, Professor Shannon Lamb told the police with a slightly quirky voice that he shot his girlfriend and that the officers had to come to his house.
Lamb was important to stress that his "sweet dog" was still alive and probably excited, and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone.
Within the house, the officials found Amy Prentiss' body and a handwritten note that was clasped on a white block: "I was so sorry, I wanted to make it back, I loved Amy and she was the only woman who ever loved me," according to the authorities in the letter, and he was signed by Lamb.
There was no indication that Lamb, who taught in two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already traveled 300 miles to the school grounds where, according to the police, he shot and killed a popular history professor, Ethan Schmidt, at the door to his office.
Delta State University Police chief Lynn Buford said university staff heard the shooting at 10:18.
He said Lamb made the fatal emergency call sometime later.
By the end of the day there was another death: Lamb took his life when the police enthroned him.
One day after shooting at the university, students and lecturers forced to hide behind closed doors, the authorities still try to get a picture of what motivated Lamb.
The details published by the investigators at both ends of the state, as well as what students and employees who knew him said, helped draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher.
Students said they were looking forward to his class.
The Gautier police, where Prentiss died, said he had no history of violence or criminal history.
Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him, in which he mentioned the "wonderful people" with which he shared his academic life.
Both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History, whose teaching body comprises 17 members, and many students attended courses of both.
At the same time, there were some tendencies to problematic behaviors.
A student, Brandon Beaver, who praised Lamb, said that he also seemed a little excited and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamb had told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014-15.
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University for a leave for health reasons, saying that he had any health problem.
This year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in the employment policy of the university meant that the doctorate for which Lamb had worked so hard would not guarantee him an automatic path to an employment as an assistant professor.
University President William LaForge said he knew nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr Lamb's idea."
These are questions that Lamb can no longer answer.
After the flight from the campus, the police later found Lambs Spur when he returned to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb killed himself with a .38 caliber gun in the backyard of a house about a mile south of his parents' house on the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi, Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson said.
His car was still running in the driveway.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this house, but Johnson said that she believed he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb started his work at the University in 2009, which has 3,500 students in a city with about 12,000 inhabitants and taught geography and pedagogy.
He received his doctorate in pedagogy in the spring.
One of the long-standing friends Lambs called him intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15, and Lamb was 20 when they met with friends.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was the cool older guy who tried to teach her the guitar game for several years.
He was the woman's swarm at the time.
All the girls melt down when he was there," said Hairston, now 40 and lived in the Jackson suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss were obviously together for some time.
In the emergency call Lamb said "I killed my wife," but there was no certificate of a marriage.
They had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in the brick house adjacent to a Bayou in Gautier.
The police said the dog was okay.
The ex-husband of Prentiss, Shawn O'Steen, said that they had been divorced 15 years ago but had remained friends and had a daughter who was now 19 years old.
"She was totally destroyed on the ground," said O'Steen about his daughter.
She and her mother were absolutely best friends.
O'Steen said he never met Lamb, but by his daughter Abigail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played Blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both appeared on a summer market three years ago.
Later, they played some gig together.
O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various companies online.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a weakly lit bar near Gautier, said he saw Lamb and Prentiss Night at night 5 September for the last time after Lamb had finished his guitar and oral harmonics game in front of a sparse audience.
There were no signs that anything was wrong.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We were cleaning up and screaming together.
I mean, they both had a good sense of joke.
Schmidt, the dead professor, led the first semester seminar program and specialized in American indigenous and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at school.
He was married and had three small children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was President of his Brotherhood and Student Committee.
On Tuesday evening at Delta State Campus, about 900 people, including lecturers, staff, students and members of the community attended a candlelight commemoration celebration.
Schmidt's wife Liz and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the Mahnwacht, while the university choir sang "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace".
The teaching will be resumed on Wednesday.
"We are trying to move our students back to life," LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press Authors Emily Wagner Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report.
This story was corrected to reflect that the police are now saying that Lamb made the emergency call after shooting Schmidt, and that Lamm, in his emergency call, called Prentiss as his wife, but there is no indication that the two have ever married.
Toys R Us plans to employ fewer workers for Christmas
Toys R Us says that there will not be as many Christmas season employees as last year, but the toy and baby products dealer says that he will give the currently employed employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours.
The company said that it was planned to employ 40,000 people in shops and distribution centres throughout the country. In the Christmas season 2014, 45,000 workers were recruited.
Most jobs will be part-time jobs.
The company said that it will start this month with application talks and the number of employees will rise from October to December.
While the holidays are still away for months, the Christmas business is getting closer, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to provide stores with employees who sell, ship and deliver products.
Michael J. Fox screechs about his "date" with Princess Diana
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was a great moment for Michael J. Fox.
She was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We sat in the theater waiting for the Royals, and I notice that the seat is empty next to me, and it gradually becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me," he said in a trailer for a upcoming documentary "Back in Time".
The film starts, and it comes to my mind that I am a simulated yawning and an arm length away from being with the Princess of Wales on a date.
"Back in Time", a documentary about "Back to the Future", presents interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as with director Robert Zemeckis and producer Steven Spielberg.
"Back for the Future" had premiere 30 years ago.
"It's really for me," said Spielberg, "undisputed the biggest time travel film ever shot."
"Back in Time" will be on VOD, DVD and in selected cinemas in October.
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon says that his response to Russia's increased military support for Syria is: "There is no military solution" of the almost five-year conflict, and more weapons will only worsen violence and misery for millions of people.
The UN chief again calls on all parties, including the shared UN Security Council, to unite and support integrative negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban told a press conference on Wednesday that he was planning to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA, Russia, China, Great Britain and France - at the edge of the General Assembly meeting this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He regretted that the divisions in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers "make this situation insoluble."
Ban urged the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity as they demonstrated in dealing with the crisis in Syria in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran.
8 survey values showing that Donald Trump is serious to take.
Some have tried to brand it as flop.
Others took him off as a joke.
And some are waiting for a crash.
But no matter how some Republicans try to pull Donald Trump down from the upper ranks on polls, it didn't work (yet).
Ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Trump leading in the double-digit area, and some begin to ask themselves seriously what it means for the chances of nomination of the real estate mogul.
Of course, it's too early in the election period.
Nobody claims that Trump will probably win the Republican nomination.
Experts stress that at this time in 2011 Rick Perry's leadership was given to the ascending Herman Cain, none of whom won any state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election.
But outside groups like Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the conservative club for growth now recognize Trump's endurance and begin to let her flow to overthrow him.
Here are some current survey values that indicate that the real estate mogul is not just a temporary phase:
Trump's popularity has turned 180 degrees.
Shortly before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a Monmouth University survey showed that only two out of ten Republicans saw the real estate mogul positively.
By mid-July, it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52 percent.
Now six of 10 Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say they have a negative opinion.
And these figures are kept in early states.
A Quinnipiac vote in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans have a good opinion of Trump.
Two-thirds of the GOP voters GOP would be happy with Trump as candidates.
In a survey conducted last week by CNN/ORC, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be either "inspired" or "satisfied" if Trump was nominated.
Only two out of 10 say they'd be "disguised" if he were the candidate.
Only Ben Carson creates about the same enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they were "inspired" vs. 40 percent who say the same about Trump).
The next one in the matter of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of the Republican voters say that they would be "unsatisfied" or "screamed" if Jeb Bush, the favorite of the establishment, was the candidate.
A majority of Republicans do not see Trump's temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump is widely criticised for his bombastic and insulting statements, 52 percent of Irish electors who tend to be Republicans believe that the real estate mogul has the right temperament for a president, says ABC News/Washington Post on Monday.
The same number applies in the nation's first pre-election state, the state of Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think he has the personality for a chief commander, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Nevertheless, 44 percent think that he does not have the personality to carry out his duties effectively, and nearly six out of 10 independent say that his temperament did not fit into the White House, says ABC/Post.
Republican voters get used to the idea.
When they put on their scholars' hat, Republican voters think Trump is real.
If you are asked who wins the GOP nomination the closest, after a survey conducted by CNN/ORC last week four out of ten say that Trump is the best bet.
This is a change since the time four out of ten in the end of July put their money on Jeb Bush.
Complete disclosure: GOP voters did not have the clearest crystal ball in the past.
At that point in the last cycle, four out of ten Republicans thought Rick Perry would win the nomination compared to only 28% for the final candidate Mitt Romney.
Nevertheless, it appears that a variety of GOP voters see Trump's campaign as plausible.
Even if the Republicans gathered around another candidate, Trump beats almost everyone.
Some experts point out that the fragmented field probably contributes to Trump's leadership while anti-Trump support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates.
But a survey of Monmouth University early in September shows that in a hypothetical head-to-head race between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump receives the majority support.
He has 13 points ahead of Carly Fiorina, before Marco Rubio 14 points, before Walker 15 points, before Jeb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie 33 points.
It's a head-to-head race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to hit him?
Ben Carson would overtake the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypothetical head-to-head race.
A close majority of Donald Trump fans say they have formed their opinion.
A new survey by CBS/NYT on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of the voters who support Trump say they have given their votes firmly.
Of course, much can happen to change that, and no one can really say never change the opinion.
46 percent said they left the door open to switch to other candidates.
However, Trump's strongest competition is at the moment of the other outsiders, the neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say that they have formed their opinion are twice as common for Trump.
Six of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico "rapists" in his election speech two months ago, immigration has been a turning point in the public discourse to 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump's bombastic expression will keep hispanic Americans away from the Republican Party and damage the reorientation efforts.
But after the new ABC/Post survey of Monday, six of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So as long as immigration remains in the spotlight, Donald Trump seems to be doing too.
The frustration over the government is climbing to new heights.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson now account for about half of the support of Republican voters, especially through their outsider status.
Six of 10 Republicans say in the new Monday survey of ABC/Post, they prefer a political outsider rather than someone with government experience.
And they're also angry with Washington.
A survey by Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago showed that three out of four Iowa Republicans were frustrated by the Republicans in Congress, 54 percent "unsatisfied" and 21 percent "hÃ¶llisch annoyed".
Munich, Sylt and Co.: The five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
Here in the Hobookenweg is the most expensive residential complex - with views over the North Sea Watt.
In the street a square metre of a reed roof house costs 73,300 euros.
"On Sylt, the offer of objects is naturally limited," says the study - therefore the high price.
A new study shows in which special locations a square metre costs most.
Of course, 18.70 euros per square metre for a student budget in Munich are not really little.
In contrast to Germany's top places, however, one of the prices occurs like Peanuts.
The real estate service provider Engel & VÃ¶lkers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential sites - with square meters prices in dwindling heights.
There are several tens of thousands of euros - per square metre, well noted.
But well, who can afford it...
By the way: Munich is not at the top of the game, especially here.
Champions League: Bavaria Dream Start thanks to MÃ¼ller and GÃ¶tze
Double goal protectors in Piraeus: Bayern-Star Thomas MÃ¼ller simply has a run.
A happy hit by Thomas MÃ¼ller paved the way to FC Bayern to a deserved 3:0 at Olympiakos Piraeus - then it ran.
A sovereign start of the Champions League season.
The world champions Thomas MÃ¼ller and Mario GÃ¶tze gave the FC Bayern a dream start in the "Mission Milan" in the hexen boiler of Piraeus.
The team of trainers Pep Guardiola won their opening in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympiakos in hot atmosphere thanks to MÃ¼ller's double pack (52/90.+2) and GÃ¶tzes hits (89.) earned at 3:0 (0:0).
The 12th success in series is expected to be the first step towards finale on 28 May 2016 in Italy, where Guardiola finally wants to bring the Henkelpott to Munich in the third round.
At his 28th hit in the Champions League, MÃ¼ller received a generous support from Olympiakos-Torwart Roberto, who let one of the world champions' shots as a flank.
"We will not underestimate them," said Bayern captain Philipp Lahm before playing at Karaiskakis Stadium before 31.688 hot-blooded fans - and the Munichers kept word.
They showed a concentrated and committed idea without shining.
Piraeus won his most recent six home games in the royal class, including against well-known clubs such as Manchester United, AtlÃ©tico Madrid and Juventus Turin.
==References====External links==
But the Bavaria, in seven European Cup duels with Greek teams, did not want to be the next victim.
They were bold, but often too inadvertently worked in their offensive efforts.
The attacks were launched too often via play shift on left-wing Douglas Costa, which rarely came through against the former Braunschweig Omar Elabdellaoui.
MÃ¼ller had more luck from the right than his flank came out of the right half-field in the left upper toreck.
In the 67th minute, the world champion gave the possible 2:0.
The best opportunities in half one had Robert Lewandowski.
First, when Olympiakos stormer Ideye Brown hit the headball of the Poland from the line (26.).
Then by direct decrease, Torwart Roberto mated with the knee (35.).
Although the Bayern picked up their usual dominant game, Piraeus could set needlesticks.
On TorhÃ¼ter Manuel Neuer was left.
For example, when he was directing a shot of ideye over the latte (56.).
Before Newer, Guardiola had a foursome chain with David Alaba in the center next to Jerome Boateng, which made it good.
Mario GÃ¶tze, after muscular problems back in the cadre, first sat outside.
The WM-Held gave green light only after the final training, Sport Executive Director Matthias Sammer said at "Sky": "Whoever wants to make something different, that's already evil."
Guardiola also decided against him at the first turn when he brought Kingsley Coman for the beaten Lewandowski (59).
GÃ¶tze came late for Arturo Vidal (76.) and made everything clear 13 minutes later, by an elf meter MÃ¼ller put another on it.
Before the game it had come to Krawallen in the stadium.
After a smaller group of partly maimed Bayern fans in their viewer block had apparently provoked the followers of hosts Piraeus with words and gestures, the security forces attacked and went against the Munich followers with strikes.
At least one Bayern fan was transported from the stadium.
Those who smoke have a higher risk of losing teeth
Those who smoke not only damage the lungs, but also the teeth - this suggests a Potsdamer long-term study.
The good news: In case of abandonment, the risk decreases quickly.
Smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early.
This is reflected in the long-term study of an international research team, including several employees of the German Institute for Nutrition Research (DIfE) in Potsdam.
Compared to non-smokers, smoking risked premature loss of teeth by 2.5 to 3.6 times.
The scientists had observed more than 23,300 participants.
The main causes of tooth loss are caries and inflammation of the gum, emphasizes the DIfE.
Smoking is a risk factor for this period, the authors stress.
The relationship between smoking and loss of teeth therefore stems from more frequent inflammation of gums in smokers.
It is not clear to what extent smoking also increases the risk for caries.
People who stopped smoking may, however, reduce their risk within a short time, writes researchers in the "Journal of Dental Research".
However, it could take more than ten years for the threat to fall back to the level of non-smokers, explained first author Thomas Dietrich of the English University of Birmingham.
People had to be convinced of becoming non-smokers, study director Heiner Boeing of the DIfE explained: "Smouching shortens the lifetime."
Not to smoke is good for lungs and vessels and, according to our findings, leads to good dental health up to the old age.
In Germany, more than 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 are affected by toothlessness, the DIfE reported.
Previous studies have already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early tooth failure.
The new long-term study supported the findings.
Archeologists encounter remains from the late antiquities at Cologneer Rheinufer
For the repeated time, archaeological findings have been made at the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne.
Near the building site for the new Rhine boulevard, archaeologists from the Roman German Museum of Skelette and the remains of historical buildings have been excavated, said museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday.
Since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine, historians have been looking for so-called ground monuments.
In all construction projects in the district of Cologne, the museum is always drawn up as a special office for archeological soil monument care.
In the third section of the Rheinboulevard, the archaeologists were now found.
From text documents had already been known that in the place of the 4th century a fortress and a church stood in the 8th century, Trier explained.
In addition to the remains of the fortress and the church tower, a cemetery with around 350 graves was discovered, which probably belonged to the church.
Young woman covered by freight train
After a young woman at the train station in Geilenkirchen-Lindern has failed, the federal police are asking the population for help.
On the early Wednesday morning at around 1.40 p.m., the woman crossed the track from the train station building towards the end of the platform and was captured by a freight train that came from the direction of MÃ¶nchengladbach.
By recording the train, she suffered serious injuries from it, according to federal police.
She was treated on-site and brought to a hospital by rescue workers.
The investigating officials have no knowledge of the reason for the night crossing of the young woman.
The incident may have been observed by witnesses or residents have heard acoustic perceptions.
Residents or passers-bys of Linderner Bahn, ZiegelbÃ¤ckerweg, ThomashofstraÃŸe and Leiffarther StraÃŸe (L364) will come in question.
Notices that indicate the cause of the accident can be given on a 24-hour basis and free hotline of the federal police can be given on telephone 0800/6888000 or any other police department.
EU Commission is proposing new court in dispute over TTIP
In order to resolve the dispute over the planned Transatlantic Free Trade Agreement TTIP, the EU Commission has proposed an extensive reform of the current arbitration system.
Therefore, the controversial private dispute settlement facilities for disputes between companies and states are to be replaced by a more transparent system which, in its functioning, corresponds significantly to more traditional courts.
"We want to set up a system to trust the citizens," said the responsible EU Commissioner Cecilia MalmstrÃ¶m.
The Swedish proposal to introduce the proposal as a European negotiating position into the free trade talks with the US.
The German government announced support.
TTIP is intended to create the largest free trade zone in the world with 800 million people.
The plans for the reform of the current arbitration procedures provide for the EU and the US to jointly choose independent judges for a new investment court.
They should also come from the EU, the USA and third countries.
For the first time there is also a second instance.
They would allow them to object to judgments.
To date, the parties to proceedings have agreed on a case-by-case basis, and there was no opposition to their judgments.
In the discussion over the past months it has become clear that citizens did not trust the old ISDS system in terms of fairness and justice, MalmstrÃ¶m commented.
In the long term, it intends to work on an International Investment Court, according to its own information.
In this context, for example, disputes between Chinese companies and EU countries could be resolved.
The investor-state dispute proceedings (ISDS) required, in particular by large companies, are considered to be one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe to TTIP.
Traditional arbitration courts are criticised by opponents as a kind of parallel justice, by which companies can contest damages for taxpayers, eliminate national laws or enforce a reduction in consumer and environmental standards.
In the first opinions, anti-TTIP organisations such as Campact considered the EU Commission's proposals insufficient.
It was criticised above all that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada (Ceta).
On the other hand, German economic secretary Matthias Machnig (SPD) called the plans great progress.
The Commission took into account key points in the reform that Federal Minister for Economic Affairs Sigmar Gabriel had drawn up in spring with other EU trade ministers.
The old system of private arbitrators was from the table.
The French government also welcomed MalmstrÃ¶m's plans.
The European business association BusinessEurope warned against restricting the business opportunities through too many new rules.
Especially small and medium-sized enterprises could be disadvantaged by this, it was said.
When discussions on the TTIP Free Trade Agreement (Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership) could be concluded, it remained unclear on Wednesday.
Negotiations have been ongoing since mid-2013.
However, the issue of investor protection has not yet been discussed with the US.
A framework for the agreement should originally be established at the end of this year.
This date shall be deemed to be no longer durable.
Delicate folk by Sufjan Stevens in Hamburg
11 years ago Sufjan Stevens was on stage at the Prime Club in Cologne (now Luxor).
Next to him stands a flipchart on which the shy folk singer recorded Michigan's picturesque U.S. state with felt pencil.
The entire audience, about 40 people, is almost taken by Steven's lecture.
He tells from various places, which he repeatedly records on the map, what his minute and delicately arranged songs report.
Where it came from and what it looks like there, in its home country.
Since then, Stevens has proved to be a wonderfully creative mistake.
With the 2003 and third album "Greetings from Michigan: The Great Lake State", cleverly composed songs appear, which are harmoniously close to the American folk of the late sixties, but can drift into the great opulent drift at any time.
The rumor arises that "Michigan" would be the first part of a moving series: each of the 50 U.S. states should be sung in a row.
However, in 2004 and near Rhine, "Seven Swans" has already appeared and breaks positive certain expectations.
Reduced Stevens appears here.
Live enough guitar and Banjo.
A year later, the New York-based musician returns to the series.
"Illinois" ("Sufjan Stevens Invites You To: Come on Feel The Illinoise") will be released in 2005.
Overarching ideas and stylistic finesse.
The album rises into the American billboard charts and is not missing in any annual best list of the influential music media.
After highly productive experiments Stevens then uses "The Age of Adz" (2010) very extensive electronic composites.
This sixth ordinary studio album is still well orchestrated, but carried by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effect and hall.
As long as the smaller clubs escape, the stage shows here will become a colorful spectacle of neon headbands and large fluorescent stage deco.
Sufjan Stevens currently tours through Germany as part of a five-member band.
In the dark Hamburger More!
He mainly presents the "Carrie & Lowell" which has been available since March.
Although now nearly 2,000 guests are banned from sitting in their chairs, the significantly matured Stevens returns to intimacy and folk.
Without a word to the audience, the group of excellent musicians plays through the widely enriched album.
From the audience one hears: The lecture is "opulent" and one can thus throw away the "platte in essence".
Only to add thanks to Stevens modestly, plays few older songs acoustically, and finally bows down to the sound of applause.
Jeremy Corbyns debut at Prime Minister's Question Time
Since his election, Mr Corbyns Debut has been expected with a great deal of tension at the Prime Minister's Question Time
The new Labour Chairman, Jeremy Corbyn, is expected to make his debut at the Prime Minister's Question Time and start with David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will rise to ask the first of his six questions given shortly after noon, with his performance being considered by the media and the Labour members from nearby.
He called for "less theatre and more facts" at this weekly event.
He also said that he could skip a few meetings to leave them colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary examination for Mr Corbyn's leadership, because after his appointment she will become a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TUC Annual Meeting on Tuesday.
In the meantime, the Labour chairman's decision to persist in silence during the singing of the national anthem on Tuesday at a celebration of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain, provoked criticism of a number of Tory-MPs and was at the centre of several front page stories in the newspapers.
Mr Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem has drawn attention to himself
A speaker from Mr. Corbyn said that he would have stood "in a respectful silence" and he recognized the "Heldency of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England".
But a member of Mr. Corbyn's shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told the BBC Two Newsnight program that he had advised Labour president to sing the national anthem "independent" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Almost a dozen of shadow ministers refused to serve in Mr Corbyn's top team, and they called for differences in the economy, defence and foreign policy, while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party originally supported him as leaders.
The political correspondent of BBC Robin Brant says that political differences are also "hopping" within Labour, according to Mr Corbyn's statements on the position on the European Union and the restriction on profits.
Mr Corbyn told the TUC conference that Labour presented changes to remove the whole idea of a limitation overall.
Hours later, Mr Smith, the shadow labor and pension minister, said that the party was "very clear" that it was only against the government plans to reduce the limit from $26,000 to $23,000.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour Chairman, David Cameron, ever since he was Tory CEO, across the dispatch box in Parliament over the last decade.
The Labour Chairman, who has promised a different policy approach, says that he has "crowd-sourced" ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and has given him more than 30,000 suggestions.
The Islington North MP has said that the Prime Minister's Question Time is too confrontational, and that he will refrain from both "difficultness" and dispute with contradictions, rather than focus on serious problems such as poverty, inequality and the challenges for young people.
Mr Corbyn said that Angela Eagle, the shadow Minister of Economics, would represent him if he did not participate - for example, when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad.
He has also brought the idea that other colleagues sometimes take the floor, and that he has spoken to John Bercow, the speaker of the House of Commons, to discuss the problem.
When he became leader in 2005, Mr Cameron said that he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a "Kasperle-Theater" which is often associated with the Prime Minister's Question Time, but several years later he admitted that he had failed in it.
Since it was first sent on television in 1990 the question hour with the Prime Minister was considered the most important barometer of the verdict of a leader and his leadership in the House and his position among his colleagues in Parliament, although critics argued that she had become a caricature and needed far-reaching reforms.
'GeschÃ¶ssen in Joburg': homeless youths trained as photographers
The city centre of Johannesburg is a tough place when you are homeless.
But a group of former street children have found a way to learn a skill and thus earn a living.
"I was shot in Joburg" (I was shot in Joburg) is a non-profit studio that teaches homeless youths how to take photos of their surroundings and get a profit from them.
BBC News has met one of the first graduates of the project.

Pounds increase due to accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
The pound increased by a leap according to data showing an increase in the UKâ€™s wage growth. In parallel, the FTSE 100 was increased by the SABMiller bid target.
Between May and July, earnings without bonuses grew by 2.9% in the UK compared to the same period of the previous year.
Since 2009, this percentage has been the fastest and most accurate assessment of the timing of an interest rate increase.
The pound rose by more than 1 % compared to the dollar to $1,5505 and was up to 0.84% compared to the euro to â‚¬1,3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed with an increase of 1.49% to 6.229.21.
SABMiller was the outstanding share on the market and made a 20 % leap after the acquisition offer of the Rival AB InBev had been received.
A transaction would combine the two largest breweries in the world and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares were higher by 0.9% after encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods Richemont.
Richemont's latest sales figures hit all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Burberry - are again showing growth.
Glencore's shares rose by 5% after the mining giant said that he had taken $2.5 billion by selling shares as part of his debt reduction strategy.
The shares of the packaging and paper group Mondi were the biggest losers on the index, with a decrease of 4.3% after Goldman Sachs put his assessment on "sales" for the company Rating.
JD Sports rose by 3.1% after the sportswear company reported a pre-tax result of 46.6 million for the half of the year.
The boss of JD Sports says that higher wages endanger expansion.
The managing director of JD Sports Peter Cowgill says that a higher minimum wage for UK employees could mean "more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers".
But it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate for the higher labour costs of his company, he says.
The costs could meet the expansion plans of JD Sports, he added, and that could mean that there are fewer additional jobs.
Justin Bieber in the capital: On Bieber expedition in Berlin
Justin Bieber, Megastar.
Leapish 21 years old, a hemp with overschik hair.
The guy with the platinum-blozed hair is 100 million euros heavy.
More or less.
Currently Monsieur Bieber is in Berlin.
And the U17 generation is going through.
Like Wiktoria Rudzinska.
The 15-year-old has never heard the name Ritz Carlton.
Not bad.
Hundreds of fans accompanied Justin yesterday.
Among them Ewa and Victoria from Poland.
However, since 7 in the morning, the Polin has been sitting on the cold stone plates form Berlin's luxury hotel at Potsdamer Platz.
The Beeber-Bau: Her idol lives here, whose poster hangs in Stettin, since Monday evening.
The suite, where the Canadian singer lives, costs exactly as much as her mama Ewa deserves in half a year.
If anything.
She says, "In fact, my Wiktoria would have to sit in the tenth class in the gymnasium."
"I'll fill her with a dream."
compulsory school?
Who's itching?
The fans don't.
Not even beaver himself.
He's been taking care of anyway.
For the advertisements in the commercial break of the Superbowl, he collected three million, a two-year deal with an anti-pickel company washed many, lots of dollars on the beeber account.
And with every doll that looks like him and over the storeside table, Bieber also cashes.
When Justin Bieber drinks a coffee, you stop at the window pane.
He's supposed to have conquered more than 100 million like this.
Some say the hype went too far.
Others emphasize that Bieber was finally in the US and Great Britain with his new single "What do you mean?" on place 1.
Bieber himself, whose fourth album will follow in November, is not interested in the many zeros for the first time.
At least he does.
Pegida Plakat brings Lebaneses to Potato Dunes Idea
Potatoes or doners?
It's both going - and it's in the Potato-DÃ¶ner, which the Oldenburger has developed.
Inspired by the saying "Cartoffel instead of DÃ¶ner" on a poster of the Pegida movement, Alhay has put potato and meat together on a spear.
The idea brought him a poster at a Pegida demonstration with the inscription "Cartoffeln instead of Doner", which he had seen by chance on television.
Since then, in his shop, a barbecue is made up of meat and potatoes.
"This is multikulti for the stomach," says Alhay.
In the meantime, the idea has been registered at the Patent Office in Munich.
It has recently been protected as a utility model, according to the Authority's information.
Therefore, how much meat and how many potatoes the spear contains, Alhay does not want to betray.
Only so much: "It tastes even better together," he finds.
The culinary understanding of the peoples also works well with its customers.
Metcash launches ground resistance campaign to combat Aldi invasion
Metcash tries to protect the IGA branches from an aldi march in South Australia and Western Australia.
Food wholesaler Metcash has launched a ground resistance campaign to defend the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia ahead of a $700 million invasion.
While Aldi is preparing the opening of two distribution centres and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening their relations with local food suppliers and building up the IGA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing through the social media, as well as through events such as Adelaide show.
IGA dealers and suppliers jump on board, selling discounted tickets for the South Australian football league to loyal customers with brands like ice manufacturers Simmo from Dunsborough, who are distributing samples in IGA stores and shop owners.
Metcash is expected to release further details of his defence strategy on September 29, when the wholesaler for food, alcohol and equipment will carry out his annual investor strategy day.
It is much at stake, as South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30 percent of Metcash's IGA stores and generate higher margins of profit than Metcash's IGA network in the Eastern States.
Buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are notable provincial and IGA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in the Eastern countries.
However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will take away about five percent of the food market in these two countries 12 months after opening its first markets and remove all existing stakeholders, but mainly independent retailers.
According to a report published this week, the analyst Tom Kierath from Morgan Stanley estimated that IGA retailers could lose 360 $ million revenue per year and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA next year and achieve sales of $500 million and $600 million in each market.
The loss in food and food business and in the amounts on Metcash's high fixed cost base could cost Metcash about $13 million before interest and taxes, said Mr. Kierath.
At the same time, Metcash loses market share in the eastern states, mainly in Aldi and Coles, although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan found that IGA buyers are the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley assumes that Metcash's sales in food and food business will fall by 3.8 percent in 2016, by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, and the market share will fall from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, the leading fund manager Hamish Douglas, founder of the Magellan Financial Group, told us that Metcash would probably disappear within a decade. Metcash.
Metcash refused to respond publicly to Mr Douglas's comments.
But it is assumed that a member of Metcash's board contacted Mr Douglas last week.
IGA's market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010, and income from Metcash's food and food trade, which supplies around 1,200 IGA retailers, has fallen by 43 percent since 2012, reflecting the reduction of operating debt while pressure on sales and margins.
However, the wholesaler is weaverd and invests more than $150 million to balance sales prices with Coles and Woolworths on hundreds of products every week and to improve IGA retailers in improving their stores through faster growing fresh food and to deliver a better choice of private label foods.
Metcash's Chief Executive Officer Ian Morrice says that the price adjustments and shop repair programs will increase to Elan and hopes that the wholesaler will return to a profit growth for the first time in 2017 in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by the president of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves praise rather than criticism of his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the "collateral damage" in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyrgios and, according to the president of the Australian tennis association Steve Healy, deserves praise rather than criticism of his own behavior.
Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented duo, which is repeatedly referred to as "Special Ks", came into the spotlight by the infamous battle of Kyrgios with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
In a fiery qualification game in Cincinnati soon after, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated twice by the referee, calling Harrison: "Wawrinka had to beat Kyrgios, and I should beat the child."
While he was last seen to destroy a tennis racket after a cramp destroyed a potential US-open victory by Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was firmly defended by Healy.
The teen is currently in Glasgow, in competition with Sam Groth for second place in the single behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup finale against Great Britain.
"One thing that I'm quite jealous about is the fact that, in my opinion, Thanasi was a little caught up in the fight," said Healy.
He broke a beating when he lost because of a seizure in the U.S. open, but he's not the first player who broke a fight out of frustration with himself, and I know Thanasi well enough to know he's not proud of it.
But, really, he has behaved extremely well in the US-Open, even under the rather provocative circumstances with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves a lot of recognition.
He's got a great team around, he's got a great family around him, and I think he was treated a little too strict.
He's a very mature 19-year-old, he works very hard, and he fits into the team and so on, he's never had a problem with the other players, he's been respected in the changing area, he's trained hard, he's good in shape, he's a very stable and mature young guy, and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own merits.
Healy also supported the decision not to take Kyrgios into account in the important preliminary ruling that begins on Friday, and he describes the "common decision" as the right thing for all, but he assures the man from Canberra to return to the team as a long-term fixed part."
"First, we want the team to be fully focused on the competition and not on all the controversy around [Kyrgios]," said Healy.
And I believe that Nick has made the ascent very quickly, to which people like Federer and Murray have pointed out. He rises in the eyes of the public, and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we try to support him, we try to make him understand the consequences of his action. Some time outside of the ramp light in which he can only think about it, I consider it appropriate, and it is best for the team and it is the best for him.
Europe's refugee crisis: Hungary declares emergency, closes the border, keeps refugees back
Hungary explained the emergency situation and closed the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held everyone who tried to get illegally to the country. Everything with the aim of stopping the flow of migrants.
Chaos followed the border, when hundreds of migrants gathered in a no-one's country, and Serbian officials responded emboldened.
For an unknown time, the people who had fled from violence were stuck in a country strip on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there.
But frustrations increased.
When a police helicopter floated over them, the migrants "open the border!" and shouted insults against the Hungarian willing police.
Some returned food and water from protest.
Serbia's Foreign Minister stated that it was "unacceptable" to send migrants back from Hungary, while more and more arrived from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution and not a collated damage.
Talks must take place in the coming days with Brussels and other countries," said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The turbulence on the Hungarian-Serbian border did not reach a common immigration policy one day after the 28-national block in a disputed meeting in Brussels.
However, ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people seeking refuge in the large-scale Italy and Greece. They expressed their hope that, next month or by the end of the year, an agreement would be reached that the EU countries would receive a further 120,000 refugees, including some from Hungary.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent.
Hungary, however, did not place its hopes on a soon-to-be action by Brussels or its neighbours.
The emergency in two southern regions on Tuesday gave authorities more powers to deal with the crisis so that they could block roads and speed up asylum procedures.
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Ssiejarto said that his country also plans to build a barbed wire fence along its border with Romania to stop the flow of migrants across the country - after it has finished a fence on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prison inmates were used in the race to create the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a major bottleneck and entry point for many refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban insisted that most incoming economic refugees are looking for a better life, and not refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws, which came into force in Hungary at midnight, make crossing the border or damaging the 4-meter (13-foot) high fence, which the government had built along the southern border with Serbia, a crime. These laws also set higher prison sentences for sentenced traffickers.
"Because of the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government explains the state of emergency," said government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs reporters in the southern town of Szeged.
We say it very clearly: the illegal crossing of the border is a crime.
Parliament still has to agree to the use of the military, which is expected for next week, but the Associated Press reporters have seen heavy armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs on the border for days.
Gyorgy Bacondi, State Security Advisor for Orban, said that authorities caught 45 people trying to cross the border, 15 others had already entered the country deeper.
They come across by damaging the fence, they are now in police custody and are accused of committing crimes under the new laws.
Authorities are in the process of quickly repairing the fence.
Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after a train car with barbed wire had arrived to close the borders.
Chaos surrounded the main border crossing near Roszke, Hungary, when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to process human data and pressed a crowd to enter it.
About 20 managed to enter, but thousands remained outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the most important motorway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said they would refuse food and water until they were allowed to enter Hungary.
Election-2016: Hillary Clinton's lead before Bernie Sanders halved in national survey
Former U.S. Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton continues to take a two-digit lead in the democratic race for nomination at national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders wins her against the ground.
Clinton has the support of 47 percent of democratic voters in the pre-elections (58 percent before), while Sanders is second in place, with 27 percent (up by 17 percent).
Vice-President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced that he is candidates for the presidential office, receives support of 15 percent of the democratic electorate of the elections.
More than five months before the start of the elections, most democratic voters say it is too early to say that their opinion is determined which candidates they will support.
But Clinton's supporters are more stable in their choice than the other candidates.
Since the CBS news survey, Clinton has lost in a number of demographic groups, while Sanders achieved some profits.
Clinton has a great advantage in women and moderates, but these premises have been reduced.
Their support for men has fallen significantly, and Sanders is only 5 points behind.
Clinton's advantage in democratic voters under 50 years of age has fled, and she and Sanders are now at the same level.
Clinton, however, has a great advantage among the older voters.
Last month, Clinton was ahead of Sanders with a double-digit lead at the Liberals, but Sanders now has a 5-point lead in this group.
About half of the democratic voters of the pre-elections state that they would support Clinton with enthusiasm if it were nominated by the party.
A quarter would support her with some reservations and a further 15 percent would only support her because she is the candidate.
Six percent would not support them.
Perhaps not surprisingly, Clinton's current supporters are especially enthusiastic about her.
The views are more mixed with those who currently do not support Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusiastically support it.
While 48 percent of the democratic voters of the pre-elections say that they are enthusiastic about Clinton, less Republican voters say this about their top candidates Donald Trump (35 percent).
If Clinton's supporters are asked in an open question why they want her to be the candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), followed by the view that it is time for a woman to become president (13 percent) and that she is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton's supporters also mention their connection with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
Consent to deal with the problems and the dialability are also cited.
Since the Vice-President casts a potential for the presidential office, 57 percent of the democratic voters of the pre-elections want to see him in the race - although a third believes he should not do so.
When democratic voters are asked who would be their second election for the party, bids are at the top.
Of Clinton's followers, more than half say bids would be their second choice far ahead of Sanders.
If bids decide not to stand for the nomination of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton's lead increases before Sanders, from 20 points with bids in the race to 30 points without him in the race.
Twenty-five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chances of winning the election, but this figure has fallen by 78 percent last month.
Biden is by far the second in this measurement, but the percentage that sees it as the "most random" has increased.
Nevertheless, when asking what is more important in the case of a candidate, Democratic voters call questions about the vote.
Similar to last month, no single democratic candidate or potential candidate for these voters of the pre-elections stands out as unacceptable.
The Democratic candidates or potential candidates produce good results with some important features in the electorate of their party's pre-elections.
Majorities consider Clinton, Sanders and bids to be honest and trustworthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities.
The three candidates are best placed on bids for honesty, while Clinton's strength is the leader.
Thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many say that about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent do not agree with him.
Democratic voters generally also see Clinton, Sanders and Biden ideologically in accordance with their views.
At all these measurements, about a quarter of the democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders.
Since questions about Hillary Clinton's use of a personal e-mail address and a server will continue to be asked as a foreign minister during the term of office, most Democratic voters of the pre-elections are satisfied with their declaration of matter and say that it has not affected their opinions overall.
But it's another story in the American public as a whole.
Half of the Americans are now dissatisfied with their declaration, while only about a third are satisfied.
Public opinion on this was divided in March, shortly after the problem came to light.
Most Americans said that the e-mail controversy had no effect on Clinton's general opinions, although 36 percent said that her opinion had deteriorated.
It's mostly Republicans, more than six out of 10, who say their views of Clinton have become worse.
Although Clinton is considered honest and trustworthy by the voters of their party, this continues to be a problem for them among registered voters as a whole: only 32 percent see them as honest and trustworthy, eight percent less than last month, and 15 points less since May.
62 percent of the electorate do not consider them to be an honest and trustworthy person.
At the same time, 55 percent of voters across the country also regard Trump as being not honest and unreliable.
Clinton and Trump, however, receive good grades on tour.
Of the six tested candidates, bids, Carson and Bush best cut off with honesty.
A majority view Sanders as being more than honest, but as with Carson, many have no opinion of him.
The error rate for the sample of 351 Democratic voters in the pre-elections is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson gets up in national survey close to Donald Trump
Ben Carson is located in the latest survey of CBS News/New York Times close to Donald Trump
The two candidates now have half the support of the voters in the new survey, and others are losing a dramatic hold
Republican voters continue to support Trump in large numbers throughout the country. Support is growing 23% in the last CBS survey conducted before Fox News debate last month, by 27% in the Tuesday survey.
But Carson shot from 6% to 23% in the same period.
The survey also found that Carson is good at demographic groups and Trump is outnumbered by Republican voters with higher education.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, has been defeated with Wisconsin's Governor Scott Walker, who has fallen the deepest, from 10% support last month to 2% now.
Former Florida governor Jeb Bush, former governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are in third place with 6%.
The margin of error in the sample of 376 people of Republican voters in this latest survey is plus or minus 6 % and was conducted in September.
The latest CNN/ORC survey published last week shows that Carson is increasing in the surveys - it is landing with 19% support from Republicans, behind Trump with 32% support.
The latest survey by ABC News/Washington Post also showed Trump clearly ahead of Carson.
With a view to a carson rising last week, Trump found some sidewalks for the former neurosurgeon, even after Carson apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy," said Trump last Saturday during a campaign appearance in Iowa.
Comfortable bathing temperatures: The eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm.
Even if peak values are measured only in the distance, a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for holidaymakers to find even hot water.
A bathroom in North or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees.
Some don't go to the sea anymore: the water in the North and Baltic Sea has a maximum of 18 degrees this week, the German Weather Service (DWD) reports.
The Mediterranean, on the other hand, continues to offer bathing temperatures: in the east it even rises to 29 degrees.
In the Adriatic there are in the top 25 degrees, in France 23 degrees.
The Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees.
Five members of the Brotherhood burdened with the death of a Baruch College-Neulings
Almost two years after a student passed away during a puzzling ritual of a student relationship in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, morgues are filed against five persons.
The New Yorker Baruch College Pi-Delta-Psi Brotherhood attacked Chun "Michael" Deng brutally during an introduction ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transportation to the hospital, which contributed to his death, told the police.
Officials said that he had been burdened with a 30-pfund backpack full of sand with attached eyes and had been repeatedly attacked while he was trying to reach a goal over a frozen field.
Mr. Deng finally complained about headaches, and then he fell unconscious.
The members of the Pi Delta PSI Brotherhood did not call the 911 emergency call after Deng became powerless and allegedly waited an hour before they took him to a hospital, the police said.
However, they had the time to change Deng's clothes, to Google his symptoms, and to contact Andy Meng, the national president of the brotherhood to get advice, said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference.
"At this point, the members began to hide utensils and put the well-being of the brotherhood about Michael Deng's," said police chief Wagner.
He could not be revived, and he died of his injuries the next morning.
According to an autopsy report, Deng was repeatedly added to the head, torso and thigh with a tougher force.
"Too many families were destroyed by the shins of the brotherhood. At least one student has died every year on the shins since 1970," said Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng's family, in a statement.
Brotherhood and its members must be held accountable, and this step by authorities is very important.
A County Grand Jury of Monroe recommended a third-degree trial for murder for the first five members.
Thirty-two members of the brotherhood, including Mr. Meng, are also charged with harassment and the formation of a criminal association.
"We not only want to blame the people involved, but if there is an organization that has sanctioned this - officially or implicitly - we will also bring it to account," said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College banned the brotherhood, and the national brotherhood revoked its belonging to the local group.
This will happen if the Fed increases interest
An interest rate increase will come, and the houses will be wacked, returns on bonds will rise, and the economy will slide into a recession.
We know that.
What we don't know is how long this will take and how long it will last.
In particular, the history for the economy offers little guidance on the process.
A recession came within just 11 months of the first interest rate increase and lasted 86 months.
The aggressive nature of the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates is often, if not always, a factor in how the economy and financial investments react.
Therefore, US central bank representatives have stressed so strongly that investors should not focus on when they begin to increase interest rates, but rather on the period needed for normalisation.
In fact, several variables play a role.
In the end, however, market participants could find that the whole excitement was possibly exaggerated due to an interest rate increase.
"The first increase of the Fed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of "money money," said Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, in a communication to customers.
In contrast, we do not expect the gradual return of the U.S. tins to normal heights, but still to be too low to lead to the seismic shock that many seem to fear.
This does not mean, however, that there will be no effects.
Here is a historical trend based on how some areas of the economy could react:
As the market has seen last month, the advance of interest rates can do things for a while.
As soon as the increase arrives, the influence is not so dramatic.
"There seems to be a tendency to strangle wealth yields 12 to 24 months after the first increase, which may reflect the delay in monetary policy again," said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what happens after Fed's interest rate increases.
More specifically, the market is mostly in the upward trend over the past 35 years - about 14 percent - on the way to the interest rate increase, rather flat in the 250 days thereafter (average profit of 2.6 percent), then back to the normal state after 500 days, with an average yield in the past six last cycles of 14.4 percent, according to a current analysis published by Bob Doll, Chief Investment Strategy at Nuveen Asset Management, at Barron's.
Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares tend to occur later in the increase cycle and the return begins to decrease.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but interest increases often promote it.
In the current case, the Fed is confronted with some conditions that did not exist before and that could accelerate a recession.
It is very remarkable that the gross domestic product will be close to its lowest point in the Fed's interest rate increase.
According to Deutsche Bank, the 118 interest rates increases since 1950 were only twice the nominal GDP of 4.5 percent.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent, only a few expect this to continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Interest increases in such a fragile economic environment could be risky and raise the question of whether it is different this time," said Deutsche Bank.
Market participants have taken the whole year to an interest rate increase of Fed, and all eyes were focused on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC could approve an increase in this session, the Futures trade indicates only a 25 percent probability.
"In our study, all the increase cycles from 1950 to today have taken place in a supercycle with increasing momentum in GDP and put pre-recession levels very quickly after the start of recovery in the shade," the report states.
In contrast, this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase.
The current cycle is by far the longest the Fed has waited since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and so far it is 74 months.
The fixed income was also volatility, as the market anticipates an increase in interest rates and the pattern is quite similar to that in the capital market.
The main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than on shares when they change their strategic price.
In the case of bonds, the returns seem to change the direction as soon as the first increase / decrease in the cycle takes place.
At the end of the increase cycle, the bond returns fall immediately, said Deutsche Bank.
Charles Schwab's strategists believe that the increase in interest rates will lead to returns coming closer together between longer and shorter bonds and leading to a flattening of the curve.
High-income bonds often bring better earnings in such a climate, although "we are still careful to expect higher yields," said Kathy Jones, Fixed-Income Analyst at Schwab, in an analysis.
Interestingly, Jones says that the markets have already adapted to Fed strategy expectations.
"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are some signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of stronger monetary policy," she wrote.
Short-term interest rates have increased, the yield curve is flatter, credit tensions have expanded and volatility has increased - all market characteristics when the Fed tightens up its strategy.
In general, companies that handle the greater part of their business in the US will benefit from this when interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.
Multinational companies with high debt will be worse, as an increasing dollar will make their products more expensive on the global market and so will the financing of their debts.
"History shows that "quality" shares tend to respond very positively three months after an initial interest rate increase," said Goldman Sachs-Analyst in a report for customers.
Strong-balance sheet companies have exceeded on average by 5 percentage points after each interest-rate increase in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Companies with high capital yields and low volatility in their shares also exceeded their low-quality counterparts by an average of 4 percentage points each and 3 (percentage points).
Debts are going to be a big problem.
Companies with a high proportion of flexible interest rates will lose most, said Goldman.
Outside the pure stock games, consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar.
Savings could see profits through higher earnings, even though experts differ in opinion as to how quickly this will take place.

He argues that he is increasingly not to be distinguished from commercial rivals.
He also aimed at the BBC Music Awards and said that they only imitated The British
Damien Collins, a Member of Parliament, attacked The Voice and said that this was not very original.
BBC Radio 3 "changes" to Classic FM, claims a leading parliamentarian and increases new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he does something that the private stations do not do.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told the BBC bosses that the public-law radio station was "sudden" and increasingly no longer to be distinguished from its commercial competitors.
"Radio 3 seems - I don't like to use the word "sudden" - but it seems to turn into Classic FM," he said.
He also aimed at the BBC Music Awards, which started last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which started last year, appear to be The British only under a different name.
So, if you're trying to do something else - these are two spontaneous-mentioned examples, in which you just imitate what's already on the market," said Mr. Bingham.
BBC general director rejected the accusations and argued that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and public education.
What I learn from Radio 3, I won't learn anything else about classical music.
And there is a commitment to live music and music that is really unsurpassed.
"And finding the commitment of Radio 3, finding new music and commissioning new works, I really think it's important," he said.
At the beginning of this year BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Davey argued that it had to work harder to engage the audience than it did in the past because the British were less informed about classical music.
Radio 3 was not, however, the only element of BBC production that, during the hearing in the Committee on the Selection of Culture, Media and Sport, became a source of fire to the commercial rivals.
The Tory Member Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the BBC's musical talent show, which was purchased by Dutch producer Talpa Media for estimated costs of Â£22 million.
See why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - with Paloma Faith and Boy George as judge - was produced "on special BBC-wise".
He added that he wished that the company would find "a hit from our own stable" when it started a series of entertainment next time.
However, he refused to exclude the ordering of further series of The Voice in the future or to spend money of the fees for other entertainment formats.
Internet sales rose slowest in August and Black Friday can be responsible for this
In the first three months of 2015, there was a seven percent increase in online sales.
Last month, there has been the lowest result since records began in 2000
Online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
Experts believe that the Black Friday in November has slowed the issues
For over a decade, virtual shopping has boomed, and many of Britain's main shopping streets have turned into ghost cities.
However, experts say that there are signs that online sales are stagnating after new figures showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015.
Total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the 2000 records with only five percent increase compared to the previous year.
Experts say there are signs that online sales stagnated after new figures showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
"If you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000, this has always developed over time," said Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMR sales index to the Guardian.
He explained that the online sales strengthened three years ago, when buyers started to make purchases with their mobile phones.
It meant that more people could shop online and that people could do so in different environments, e.g. at home on the sofa.
But now this commutes, and we may experience that growth is reduced.
The Black Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for the downturn in sales.
Experts believe that buyers are holding back their purchases before this event, which takes place on the last Friday in November.
Last year, five times the average number of buyers scrambled around their computers to make their beaks, and some dealer websites crashed.
Experts believe that Black Friday, in which buyers fought for bargains, could prevent buyers from making purchases.
A study by the British Retail Consortium found that 5 Â£ of spending was issued a little more than 1 Â£ online.
For some products such as TVs and washing machines, more than a third of the purchases are now carried out via web shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of the fashion chains in the inner cities.
Muslims bury those killed in Mecca during the crane accident - Bin Laden's family is sanctioned
The bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims at the first funerals in Mecca through the streets
Saudi Arabia places some of the huge Saudi Bin-Laden-Group at the root of the collapse
The Ministry of Health also said that 394 people were injured after the crane crashed
Hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried by the streets to bury those who were killed when a crane fell into Mecca's Grand Mosque.
Griefing filled, largely dressed in white, the route to win their respect when the first of the dead entered their last journey to the Al Moaissem cemetery.
The funeral procession passed the Holy Place, where only days before a building crane fell through the ceiling of the mosque and then on the bones.
The bodies were released for funeral when the Saudi king imposed a sanction on the construction company of the Bin Laden family because of the disaster, which also left 394 injured.
The bodies of 29 beggars killed when a crane fell through the Great Central Mosque of Mecca, were carried by the streets.
Among the dead were Qasim Akram from Bolton, Greater Manchester, father of four children on his first pilgrimage when the crane crashed.
Mr. Akram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual Hadj in the Great Mosque.
Saudi officers have already agreed that the Hadjj will continue to Mecca with thousands who will continue to come to the city.
Today, King Salman said that the Bin-Laden group should not have stopped the crane's arm when it was not used.
An Arab version of the decree, published by the State Saudi Press Agency, said that the Bin-Laden Group was co-responsible for the collapse.
The news agency's English-speaking service did not report this detail, but said that the company's management of travel abroad was prohibited.
At the beginning of this week, Salman vowed to reveal what caused the crash of the crane to fall into a courtyard of the Grand Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered in front of the Hadj, which will take place later this month.
The Bin-Laden Group did not issue any statements on the collapse of the cranes, and its representatives were not available for an opinion.
The Royal Decree also blamed the group for not recent security measures and because they did not cooperate with meteorologists.
Dozens of cranes surrounded by Mecca's Great Mosque as part of the massive construction project led by the Bin-Laden Group.
The Bin Laden family has been associated with the Saudi Arabia family for decades and takes over major construction projects.
The late leader of Al Qaida, Osama bin Laden, was an abject son who was expropriated by the family in the 1990s.
The crash of the crane came in the midst of strong winds and rains, just a few days before the arrival of millions in the Kingdom for pilgrimages, which is necessary at least once in the life of any healthy Muslim.
Officials said 158 people were staying in the hospital.
Government representatives ordered that 1 million Rial (Â£ 174,000) should be paid to the victims' families and the same sum of permanently injured.
Other injuries receive half of this amount.
B&Q Boss says that the time of cheap Eastern European craftsmen is over
British workers are increasingly employed, says Veronique Laury
The number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe has risen
This leads to the opening of 200 other Screwfix shops aimed at craftsmen
At the same time, Kingfisher will close 60 B&Q sales outlets across the country
By Rupert Steiner, City Chief Correspondent of the Daily Mail
It is claimed that Britons lay down their hammers and brushes in favour of the use of qualified Eastern European craftsmen who carry out the work in their home
If you can handle a hammer or brush for painting walls, these days you seem to be a minority.
After all, British people are increasingly engaged in craftsmanships to carry out homework jobs in their homes, according to the head of the company behind B&Q.
VÃ©ronique Laury, new managing director of Kingfisher, who owns the construction market chain, said that a large increase in the number of qualified craftsman from Eastern Europe who offers services at low prices is now obsolete.
Kingfisher therefore plans to open 200 more Screwfix shops, which target craftsmen and close 60 sales outlets of B&Q.
Mrs. Laury said she wanted to employ more women in B & Q shops, because eight out of ten purchase decisions in the store are made by women.
At the moment, the men are superior to the employees.
She said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends that have more female single households that make more renovations than in the past.
Mrs. Laury said, "It still works a majority of men in our branches.
We need to move this towards a balance.
In principle, half of our customers are women with 80 percent of the decisions on the purchase of articles by women.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
Mrs. Laury, who is one of only five women at the top of a British leading company listed in the FTSE100 index, has also implemented her top team to reflect the same number of men and women in leadership positions.
Kingfisher is almost the only company that has occupied exactly 50 percent of the team with women, including its management and financial director.
Mrs. Laury said, "This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important topic here.
It was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board.
Kingfisher reported a decline in the half-year profit and sales after the group had been training the cost of closing the stores.
Because of the trend, Kingfisher, who owns Screwfix and B&Q, will open 200 new branches.
Officials of Aich/Dob because of infidelity in court
On Wednesday, at the Landesgericht Klagenfurt, two officials of the Austrian Volleyball victor Aich/Dob had to answer for infidelity and tax evasion.
The defendants were not guilty.
One of them was also accused of abuse of office.
He was acquitted by this accusation in May.
The current process has been postponed.
According to state attorney Robert Riffel, in the preliminary investigation, it had been crystallized that the defendants used funds from club accounts for private purposes in the years 2006 to 2011.
He counts the damage with around 400,000 euros.
Sports officials are also accused of financial error.
This fact left off the chairman of the SchÃ¶ffensenat, Judge Michaela Sanin.
It will be negotiated at a later stage.
In order to reject the unfaithful, the defense stated that the association had at no time created an asset disadvantage.
The sports officials would have charged only compensation for effort and the sports club for which they worked from 1982 to 2011 and in which they invested a lot of time and money out of debt - the liabilities amounted to around 600,000 schillings in 2001 (approx. 44,000 euros).
"At that time, we were faced with the situation: Do we continue to run the club or do we lock it?", said one of the defendants, in the bread profession, who is a large-scale auditor of the financial office.
He then decided with his colleagues and fellow defendants to take on this task.
With all the risks.
"We put money in front of us, put our life insurance at the bank as a security," he said in his acquisition.
The association has been agreed: you can manage the money freely, only no debt can be made.
In the event of financial success, the payment of compensation for expenditure had also been decided retroactively until 1991.
Therefore, some of the expenses were paid out only years later, i.e. from the year 2003, when a plus was on the account.
Therefore, package and non-detailed bookings appeared, the former Obmann explained the transactions.
The accounts and savings books jointly managed the two defendants, said the second defendant.
The judge asked why the payouts had not been made available to the association in detail.
The association had not been interested in financial giving in detail, but only the debt freedom was important, according to the answer.
When a functional investigation against official abuse began in 2011, an amount of EUR 120,000 was transferred to the association account.
That was a setback, the defendants declared.
This securities account ran to the name of the second defendant and, according to his statement, was not known to the association.
"Why?" the judge wanted to know.
The questioner did not know for a long time.
Then he finally said he believed that this was the best thing for the club.
If anything had happened to him, no one would have known anything about this money, the prosecutor put it into the room.
The defendant had been informed, and the officer justified himself.
This transfer was formulated as a "damage recovery".
Why compensation for damages?, Judge and Prosecutor wanted to know.
The first defendant explained that he did not agree with this wording because the association never suffered any damage.
But what should I do if the lawyer says, "With this you are all out of the tailor".
"Am I a legal representative?" he asked.
The officer also said that he never paid a cents of salary, he charged only miles of money and diets.
He charged the club with 1,000 euros per month of diets, but the actual effort was much higher, he added.
Accurate documents for the early years have not been available to the defendants.
These were no longer kept after an operational check, in which everything had been considered to be correct, they declared.
The second defendant had also been charged with km of money.
All the orders were made in cash, and he had to go from his place of residence to the bank to Bleiburg, he explained in his statement.
The main hearing will continue on September 23 with the question of witnesses.
Hewlett-Packard deletes another 30,000 jobs
In addition to the decommissioning of staff for three years, the computer giant will reduce further jobs in the split-up of the company.
The dashes of the U.S. computer giant Hewlett-Packard (HP) find no end.
As part of its restructuring, the US technology group plans to reduce from 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customer division.
The company announced on Tuesday that this would save $2.7 billion (EUR 2.4 billion) of costs.
The step will lead to a special tax of about 2.7 billion dollars, which will take place from the fourth quarter.
The reduction of 55,000 jobs, which has been ongoing for three years, has not yet been completed.
At the end of the 2013/14 financial year, HP still employed around 302,000 employees.
The Hewlett-Packard share was reported to be 2.3 percent.
The large-scale group of printers from Palo Alto, California, is currently split up: For example, the computer and printer business is still to be bundled into a new society this year - separate from the more future-oriented areas with computer servers and data storage for companies and other services.
Both parts of the business are to be listed on the stock exchange.
The world's second-largest PC manufacturer to Lenovo, once again disillusioned PC sales and a weaker demand for its customers for its services.
In the third quarter at the end of July, sales of PCs and printers decreased by 11.5 percent.
Sales fell by 8 percent to just under $25.4 billion.
This led to a decline in revenues in 15 out of 16 quarters.
HP responds with a split and massive dashes to change in the industry.
The 76-year-old company under Meg Whitman's leadership has responded late on that customers are increasingly buying smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers and increasingly doing more and more shops online.
Whitman's restructuring plans total the reduction of about 55,000 posts.
Conflicts: The majority supports the Anti-IS Training Mission
However, direct participation of German soldiers in fighting acts in Iraq would be a main challenge: 54 percent opposed, 35 percent agreed.
The fact that other states are flying air attacks against the ISIS in Iraq and Syria is finding 61 percent positive.
By contrast, 24 percent are in conflict.
A collaboration with the Syrian power-holder Bashar al-Assad rejects 51 percent of the respondents that 20 percent would be in favour.
29 percent could not decide.
Car: second press day at the 66th IAA
The trade fair will focus on connected, self-propelled cars and electric mobility until 27 September.
After two press days, Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 66th International Motor Show under the motto "Mobility connects" on Thursday.
The general public can visit the IAA from Saturday.
The organizers of the VDA Auto-Verband expect about 900,000 visitors two years ago.
RÃ¶szke: the outbreak of violence at the Serbian-Hungarian border
On the Serbian border at RÃ¶szke, the Hungarian police have used tear gas and water heaters against several hundred refugees.
Euronews correspondent DÃ¡niel Bozsik experienced the outbreak of violence at the border control point.
He reported by phone:
A group of refugees broke through the border.
There was a police line behind it, and there was a waterlight behind the police.
40 to 50 refugees began to throw stones, sticks and plastic bottles to officials.
The officials first put in continuous pepper spray.
After that, the police used tear gas.
A lot of tear gas was sprayed in the direction of the refugees.
This disbanded the group.
Refugees are now awaiting something to withdraw.
A pregnant and apparently injured woman was carried out from the zone.
Children who had inhaled the tear gas scream.
Other refugees fell into each other and were left in a state of distress.
The Serbian police press spokesmen also suffered injuries due to the use of tear gas and pepper spray.
Time of decision on interest rates for the U.S. Note Bank
The world observes when the U.S. Note Bank meets on two days, on Wednesday and Thursday, to make the important decision whether, for the first time, almost a decade, interest will be raised or not.
A survey of 80 economists surveyed by Reuters found that a little more than half that was still last week's view that the Fed will do this, now thinks that the Fed will remain a little longer and will keep interest rates at the current level of 0 - 0.25 percent.
It's a historical event because it's been seven years since Fed put interest on NULL.
"For the first time, we are approaching a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of normalising interest rates," said Angel Ubide, Senior Staff at Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy is on relatively good performance, trillions of dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a small inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore the less rusty outlook on global conditions.
It has warned the markets to focus on an increase, but the signs indicate that the chances of such a step are good.
The decision will be announced on Thursday at 8 a.m.
Killer at Delta State University left apologies
After the shooting and killing of his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before later on the day he shot and killed his colleagues - Shannon Lamb wrote a note to say that he was "poor to do" at the first murder and wanted to "he could make it rude," authorities announced on Tuesday.
The police in Gautier, Mississippi, said that Lamb, lecturer for geography and social science education at Delta State University, called the emergency call number around 10:00 on Monday morning morning
And said he shot someone and killed someone.
Lamb told the emergency service staff that the police had to send them to his home.
He said, "I shot my wife last night" and he also mentioned that a "sweet dog" is in the house, but "no one will disturb", but probably will be excited.
The police asked the caller for his name, but he didn't.
Lamb gave no explanation for his shots.
When police entered the scene, they found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a handwritten note of Lamb, 45, saying, "I am so sorry, I wanted to make it go back.
I loved Amy, and she's the only woman that ever loved me."
After writing the note Lamb went 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a professor of history, before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when police surrounded him.
University President William LaForge said he knew nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr Lamb's idea."
Despite reports on Monday, which Lamb reportedly believed that Prentiss also had a relationship with Schmidt, authorities said on Tuesday, there was "no information, no evidence" for a "triangle relationship".
Prentiss was described by Shawn O'Steen, who said that they were married for about seven years, as a "good man".
The two were divorced 15 years ago but remained friends.
O'Steen said that he and Prentiss had a daughter who is 19 and she was "damaged on the ground".
He said that Prentiss was her daughter "absolutely best friends".
Prentiss worked online from home, according to Linsday Knowles, which was identified by Sun Herald as a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles said that Prentiss, who owned a dog called Lightning, had met with Lamb for about three years.
"She always wanted to help other people," said Knowles
The police said Lamb called relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them, "He's not going to jail."
When police picked him up at Highway 1 near Greenville later that night, Lamb drove his car to his side, fled on foot, ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot.
Lamb received a doctorate from Delta State University in spring 2015, as stated by his mood on the university's website.
Stars who lost their lucky charms
The actor (left), in the picture with his son Redmond (right), had several stressful years.
In 2001 he fought leukemia, and in 2009 he lost his long-standing partner, Farrah Fawcett, because of cancer.
The actor also reportedly has to fight drugs, and in 2008 he was sentenced to drug possession.
All of this must demand his tribute.
Eurowings: Lufthansa rebuilds the Group
Lufthansa is planning a major group reconstruction.
Half a billion euros a year, the Lufthansa Group wants to save on a better organisation alone.
150 of the world's executives will cost Group reconstruction the job.
There are new negotiations with the pilot union.
Lufthansa rebuilds its corporate structure and expands Eurowings' low-cost daughter.
The aim of the realignment was to make a profit contribution of around 500 million euros per year from cost and revenue synergies, the airline announced on Wednesday.
Among other things, Lufthansa will no longer have a board of directors for the passenger business.
The low-cost flight line Eurowings should be developed as independently as possible.
Karl Ulrich Garnadt will be responsible for Eurowings in the Executive Board of Chief Carsten Spohr in the future.
With the new version, Spohr underlines the importance of Eurowings, with which the Group intends to take action against Ryanair and Easyjet in the future.
So far, the organization of the 120 000 employees has been complex.
The airlines operated under the roof of the Passage Airline Group, which provides three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros.
New negotiations with the pilots
In the collective conflict with the Cockpit (VC) pilot association, negotiations will be resumed after the strike has been stopped this Thursday.
That's what the union told me.
Discussions should be the retirement scheme for pilots.
Cockpit wants to achieve as soon as possible "a year with a forecast record result".
The conflict between trade union and airline has led to various strikes in recent months.
In addition to the transitional delivery of the pilots, the savings concept "Wings".
It is foreseen that Lufthansa is outsourced to Eurowings in the fight against competitive routes.
Under the title "Morgenzug in den Zuid", paintings by Leena KrÃ¼ger are on display in the KÃ¼nstlerhaus.
The Finnin, who has long been located in GÃ¶ttingen, has compiled a selection of titleless works for the White Hall of the House, which will stimulate their viewers to travel thoughtfully.
Luke Shaw of Manchester United cannot play for months because of double fracture
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg at Manchester's Champions League defeat at PSV Eindhoven.
While this brought the left outside defender to cry and will exclude him from playing for at least six months, Louis van Gaal does not give up hope that Shaw can play again this season.
The injury was caused by a reckless attack by HÃ©ctor Moreno in the 15th minute after the 20-year-old Shaw had broken into the PSV area.
He was treated on the field for nine minutes and needed oxygen before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He has a double leg fracture and is in the hospital."
He'll be relocated tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operate in Manchester.
It's terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester United with 18 has a very hard time and then plays fantastic, and then that happens.
In the changing cabin he had an oxygen mask on.
He cried.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, it'll take six months, and he won't play in the group phase.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno seemed happy to have escaped a red card and the hanging of an Elfmeter.
Nicola Rizzoli, the referee, did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal suspected that the Italian referee had erred.
You can judge for yourself when I say that an elf meter and a red card were due.
It was a very bad attack with both legs.
A Tweet on Shaw's account said: "I thank you all for your messages. Words cannot describe how broken I am, my way to recovery starts now, I come back stronger."
To this end, Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Shaw in the defeat at PSV
The UK defenseman has an additional incentive with the European Championship in France to recover by June.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV trainer, said, "It's a very bad injury."
If a player with this type of injury leaves the place, all are very sad about it.
It is never our player's intention to hurt an opponent.
Moreno suffered a leg break when Mexico played against Van Gaals Holland team at the 2014 World Cup.
"He's very hard because it wasn't his intention to hurt the opponent, and when you hear that it's a very bad injury, that's not good," said Cocu.
It was not possible for me to see the moment.
The only thing I could see was the ball that was heading in another direction, so it looked as if he [Moreno] had touched him, but I couldn't see the attack on Luke.
In conversation with SBS6, Moreno said: "I know how it feels, I know how hard it can be.
I feel very bad about it, I'm so sorry.
The PSV player AndrÃ©s Guardado was also taken to the hospital - after a foul match by Chris Smalling.
Surely David Cameron The Lorax knows better?
It is one thing that all parents will soon learn: If your child loves a book, it will not take long until you know it almost externally.
Unless you're perhaps David Cameron.
When he was asked by a provider of child care systems to name his favorite children's book, the Prime Minister decided for The Lorax, the environmental fable published in 1971 by Dr. Seuss.
It was a difficult choice, Cameron writes in a message on the company's website SuperCamps, and continues: "slow, moving, creative and with a powerful message, it's a book I like to read to my children, because it always seems to be a picture or message we've missed so far."
Everything nice and good, except that the following paragraph, in which Cameron supposedly describes the action of the book, instead reflects a content description of the 2012 film version, which added new characters and details to expand the rather short original text.
"In the midst of the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams by fulfilling her desire to see a real tree," one reads. A love interest was Dr. Seuss, whose real name was Theodor Seuss' hostage, who died in 1991, but was totally unknown.
As if that were not yet suspicious enough: The text presented by Cameron reads in part like the summary of the Lorax film presented on the web site of Internet Movie Database and starts: "In the walled city of Thined-Ville, where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams."
Although he admits to be a pragmatic father, it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the action of the book. Here, an unnamed boy, like the local environment through the money-loving, tree-falling, Thined knitting once-ler, is destroyed despite the protests of the named Lorax, a horrifying, snorelike being, "which speaks in the name of the trees".
Most likely such a relatively low PR task was delegated to a helper who did not read The Lorax 20 times in a row to a child.
A down-street speaker said that the text probably came from Cameron's constituency office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron's employees, but did not give any more immediate comments.
Adam Lyth was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England's team, but it is still difficult
Meeting Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but when you see the cadre that England has chosen for the tour, a repeat of the 3-0 test series defeat is not on my map.
I wouldn't rule out a way out victory.
Alastair Cook's side may be less experienced than the three years ago, but there are good spin players in the battery setting, and the community spirit is strong; they won't wear scars of 2012, just a youthful positive attitude.
With the ball Moeen Ali develops as a spin bowler and Adil Rashid, even if he is an unknown size at test level, is an option for the attack.
Related Message: Adam Lyth separates from the England Test Framework and is replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to leave Adam Lyth is, of course, hard to analyze for me as his chief coach in Yorkshire.
In his seven tests, there were two good attacks under difficult conditions, and the simple but hard reality is that Kricket players are geared to results.
There were no question marks with Joe Root, for example, and this led to the nomination, since - and I have said this before - players are their own best choice.
One would have extended the course of Lyth a long time ago, but he had control of his own fate.
If he hopes to take more runs for Yorkshire, there will be another chance.
The England trainer Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude, even though he did not perform so well, and that did not surprise me; he is above all a team man.
The question of how much time a test hitman gets to set his mark is difficult.
Lyth got seven chances - like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got the chance to play home and out.
The only accusation one can raise was that England first used Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean - when Lyth was in the highest form - but this lost chance is now in the past.
Alex Hales comes in, and he's a striker I highly appreciate.
He's an X factor cricket player, what we saw at Yorkshire early this season when he scored 236 against us on a Trent Bridge place, which hit us very much.
He must be given at least the same opportunities as the ones before him, but this, of course, depends on the team position in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of letting Moeen hit next to Cook, which would produce an extra spin bowler and receive four Quicks, showed up, and I have nothing against it.
I don't see why a hitman can't beat there, and this left-handed has already shown that he's a devil's car from Cricket players.
Moeen may not have done his job for his County Worcestershire, but he's a number 3 for her, and there's no big difference.
My former team colleague Justin Langer played his first 38 tests on the first drop before he appeared as an opener in 2001.
He made three hundred runs right away and didn't look back.
Zafar Ansari comes in the cadre as a back-up spinner, and in my limited dealings with him he has impressed me very much as a young man.
People may look at his statistics - on average 31 with the hit and 35 with the ball - and think it's a point, but there's no large number of backup spins that raise their hands and the trainers have decided for youth.
He will learn a lot on this tour.
In addition to the team, England has made a few smart additions to the coach staff.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, Batsman from Sri Lanka, as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup.
He is one of the nicest guys of the game who will bring a wealth of experience, as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful use into the setup.
I always felt that he was created for the international Cricket competition, as a player or coach, and like Mahela he has insights that we can benefit from.
Sometimes new voices can bring fresh wind in the changing cabin, even if the messages are in line with the previous saying.
Colly's teammate at Durham, Ben Stokes, is not employed at the One-Dayers, Root received a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with it for my part.
Some will not agree, but Coaches and team developers will not set the schedule.
And you need to remember that as with the players their jobs depend on the results.
Such decisions are not made easily.
The Brexit camp (Brexit = exit from the EU) could gain access if the economy gets into a fleet by the year 2017
David Cameron's unfailing renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU will be in deep trouble every day, even without the choice of the brilliant Jeremy "Is it Yes or No?" Corbyn as the leader of Labour or the TUC, who violently disintegrated because of Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their Corbyns and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomat friend recently said that some Member States, as deeply encroached in various crises, as the EU is now, and not always out of its own fault, Britain's own self-created agenda with split concessions and disturbing changes in the contract they do not want to be satisfied.
In Brighton, the TUC decided at its annual meeting that it does not like this if they are at risk to social protection.
We could also call it Dave and George's Selfie Agenda.
Prime Minister and Finance Ministers climb to summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument, with or without local sizes, then come home and say that they win allies for reforms.
It's always about me.
My European friend, who wants an outdoor UK inside the EU tent - "Don't leave us alone with France," says Berlin - and lets us see that more and more short-sighted ministers and officials in some capital cities have come to the point that they don't care if we stay or go.
Germany's cautiously tuned chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her, as happened with the exuberant long endurances like thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
Frances FranÃ§ois Hollande looks at his reelection or replacement in 2017.
He's also a fading force.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government, Spain a left-wing government.
It is difficult to imagine that they will rip a leg out to help the selfie British whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland's exit from the UK - something they also do not want because most of them have similar separatist tendencies.
Therefore, some of these ministers may even deliberately not plan useful comments, in the SNP style, while Britain's referendum campaign 2017 to accelerate the Brexit process, my friend suspects.
"The renegotiation was a plite" and "UK has gained nothing of value from the renegotiation."
Europeans know how predatory the Fleet Street can be at their expense and what EU skeptics are the oligarchy of the press barons, as they were not during Tony Benn's 1975 referendum, which supported our arrival in 1973 with a ratio of 2:1.
They can weakly remember Boris Johnson, the ore Euro opportunists, who made a name as an "EU straight bananas" Brussels correspondent in the early 1990s.
In all his madness, Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.
This included the Medley of tax-fearing villains, telephone hooking foreigners and the pseudo non-residents who have most of our major newspapers.
Actually Tony Blair thought similarly about her, but found that if you sit with a hot gorilla in a cage, you better distribute bananas to distract him instead of becoming his lunch and dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairian than Blair himself when he opposed Cameron's referendum swirling, because Blair had put the principle on the EU's unadopted constitution, which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, thus opening his back door.
The press never gave it to him.
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me a friendly slap on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he no longer needs time to waste for me - seems in danger of repeating Neil Kinnock's Boycott Murdoch strategy of the 80s, a mistake back then and today.
It may take a while, but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose BBC-Sofa he left on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position on Europe is - I express it kindly - in development.
He says we should remain in a reformed EU.
Well, most people outside of Ukips' traditional blue dye trend and the wilder filter of Tory's small Englishism can probably say yes to everyone.
It's what Hilary said "A Benn, but no Bennite" Benn on radio and on television this week when the founder was fighting in him, not admitting that Corbyn's appointment of provocating John McDonnell as shadow Chancellor was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 70's when his old father tried on television to be illoyal to his Labour Cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabin job.
Hilary's fight was even more attractive.
But to fight to remain "under all circumstances" - Benn's expression - was not what McDonnell said, nor what JC told his fellow fighters and delegates after all the reports at their convention on Monday evening.
Whatever the touchy bottom-up image of Corbyn wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - news discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the strudel of the social media, a breeding site of paranoia and betrayal.
It is right not to give Cameron a free card for Europe, which allows him to consider Labour's support in the referendum campaign to be of course, as McDonnell said it.
Simon Jenkins probably thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbyn's fundamental ambiguities on EU membership - in line with their Benite siege economy, their anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a question of esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents, for which the narcosm of the little difference is a central principle of dogmatic disputes.
As with its ambiguities to Nato - Tom Watson, felsenfest is convinced that JC does not start a campaign to leave - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to find in everything a sense for their superiors at home.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspicious voters - in order to make concessions to the British if this can all be pointless?
The US has already been quite disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a cost reduction of the Tory government in power, which I was reminded of at the start on Monday of something called British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticise Public Health England's report on e-cigarettes
Claims of a state-funded agency that e-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking resulted from a meeting of 12 people, partly with connections to the tobacco industry, researchers said.
Experts who write in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet by criticizing the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in their report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published the "basic report" last month and describes it as a "comprehensive review of the evidence".
However, some researchers have questioned the loadability of the data and pointed out the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry.
A editorial in the medical journal Lancet last month attacked the "extraordinary windy basis" on which PHE justified its most important conclusion.
Two other researchers write in BMJ and asked if the allegations "building on stone or sand".
Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at Liverpool University, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on demonstrating effectiveness."
They said that the public expected that the claim of PHE that "the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking" is based on a detailed review of the evidence and modelling.
In fact, this statement comes from a single session of 12 persons called to develop a model for a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) in order to lead to a synthesis of their opinions on the damage caused by different nicotine-containing products; the results of the meeting were summarised in a research report.
McKee and Capewell said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose managing director should have received funds (BAT) for an independent study.
He also signed BAT's references to public health in a sustainability report, they said.
One of the 12 participants at the meeting declared that they would receive funds from an e-cigarette producer, but not the financing he was supposed to receive after reports from the tobacco company Philip Morris International, they added.
The reasons for selecting the members of the panel are not delivered, but these include several well-known e-cigarette champions, some of which also provide industry financing in the paper.
Some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know-how in tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by the PHE tobacco management.
The research work of the group "is significant" that there is a lack of "hard evidence of the damage of most products to most of the criteria," McKee and Capewell wrote.
However, none of these links or restrictions are discussed in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that the allegations of PHE that "there has been no evidence that e-cigarettes have been used as a way to smoke for children or nonsmokers" were premature.
Prof Kevin Fenton, director of health and well-being at PHE, said that BMJâ€™s claims had already been responded to.
He said, "E-cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking."
Every second life-long smoker dies in his quest.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are low in comparison, but that we continue to have the long-term effects to study.
PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public about what the proof proves and what does not, especially if there is so much public confusion about the relative risks compared to tobacco.
Almost 80,000 people die each year from a smoking disease, and smoking costs the national health system two billion pounds a year.
By clearly presenting current evidence that e-cigarettes are not without risk, but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking, we fulfil our national competence.
BBC should give up EastEnds, says former head of Channel 4
The former president of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, said the BBC should stop sending programs such as EastEnders and The Voice. He said that commercial rivals would "give their right arm" for hit shows like the Albert Square Soap.
Johnson said that the broadcasting fee should only be used to make the kind of programs that are not broadcast by other UK stations.
He criticized the BBC for placing public-law programs, which are probably seen by a smaller audience, in hard controversial time windows against the most popular shows of their rivals and broadcasters like BBC4.
After the BBC General Director, Tony Hall, said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said that for six years in his time at Channel 4 he had tried without success to get in touch with the BBC.
"I have problems with the idea that BBC is commissioning or sending programs that would also clearly be shown by unsubsidized rivals," said Johnson to the Oberhaus Communication Committee in his investigation of the future of the BBC.
If you want to keep the broadcasting fee, which I don't think is a good idea in the middle or in the long term, at least you should put your production on board programs that others don't make or order.
They send The Voice in a prime time window because they want to achieve as broad a support as possible for their future.
The idea that nobody else would show this is a joke, it's ridiculous, of course it's nonsense.
Johnson said, "I don't see why a regressive tax program is financed, which could also be financed without subsidies.
The Voice is such a program, EastEnders is another, admittedly both own productions.
Honestly, other channels would give their right arm for it.
I'm trying to see how this should be public-law television.
I don't think this would reduce the BBC at all.
Johnson, an entrepreneur for series that headed channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said that the BBC blames hunting for reviews "because of the ambitions of the people who work there, and because they believe this is the best way to secure long-term support."
His comments on BBC's most popular broadcasts are what the former director of Sky, Tony Ball, in his MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that BBC shows like EastEnders should sell.
Johnson said that the rather public-law niche programs should go "to BBC4, where you can't measure quite the audience, but they fulfill their tasks, and they can argue that if they go on their hypocritical missions to justify 4 billion pounds of radio charges, "Well, of course, we have created all these obscene programs that no one has seen."
They put it in a time window in which no one ever wanted to see it.
For the broadcasting fee, Johnson told the Committee: "I urge you to find a more regressive system in terms of terms who can get the best value from this.
Of course you all think, we all think that you get a big value for 150 pounds a year here, but for people who are a lot of money for 150 pounds, ask me if that's right, because they don't consume much of the BBC.
The former Sky and Channel 5 boss David Elstein, who also said he was in front of the committee on Tuesday, demanded that the BBC review its Reithian mission to "information, form and entertain".
He said that little of BBC production would now be officially classified as education - he said that it was 1% of their TV production and 0.1% on radio - and she should take an example of the public-law television channels in Australia and Canada to change this into "information, inform and entertain".
Regarding the question of partnerships, Elstein said the BBC should do more in areas like the Proms he said that only a handful of television will be shown, and with the commercial channels going alliances to make everything available online.
'Sonogenics' can control brain cells through sound waves
The video shows how the nematodes change the direction in the moment they are irradiated with sound impulses.
Scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems, which can be controlled by eruptions of sound waves.
The tiny nematodes change the direction in the moment they are irradiated with sound impulses, which for human hearing have too high frequencies to be heard.
The impulses work by enabling motoneuron cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultrasound waves.
More on this topic: Researchers read and write brain activity with light
The researchers said that the worms showed the power of a new procedure, called sonogenetics, in which ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain, heart and muscle cells outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that one day the procedure could replace the deep-brain stimulation, an invasive procedure that gives electrical impulses into the brain of people to treat symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
Wire worms usually do not react to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they did it when surrounded by a liquid with microscopic air bubbles.
The bubbles, he found out, strengthen the ultrasound waves, which then penetrate into the worms.
The reinforced ultrasonic waves affect structures called TRP-4 ion channels and are found in the membranes by some of the worm cells.
The sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned to, according to a report Nature Communications.
In order to create ultrasound-controlled nematodes, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of their motonurones carry TRP-4 ion channels.
When it uses ultrasound to create the changed creatures, the sound waves are reinforced and transferred to the worms, where they switch on the modified motoneurons.
The process has some similarities with optogenics, a groundbreaking tool that enables scientists to turn on and off neurons with impulses of light.
But Chalasani said that Sonogenetics could have some advantages over this technique.
In contrast to light that needs to be sent down to the desired point in the brain at an optical fiber, low-frequency ultrasonic waves of tissue can pass unhindered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull.
"We believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make the targeted human neurons temporarily susceptible to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments," said Chalasani.
Other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin producing cells, he added.

Ads shamed UK arms trade
Amnesty International Anti-Waffen Watch Trade Fairs Video.
Horrible killer-drons!
Foot joint suffocating leg caps!
Scatter bombs!
And electric shock rods that cause painful pain, but leave no trace!
The happy voice and cartoon images leave no doubt that this ad for the world's largest weapons fair is a combat parody produced by Amnesty International in order to highlight the British government's willingness to raise arms to repressive regimes through the Defence and Security Equipment International Jamboree at the ExCeL Centre in London's Docklands.

But a separate campaign also leads to many posters that can be seen at bus stops and in subway trains that require a second look.
"Important announcement: Do you drive with DLR from September 15 to 18,?" (Docklands Light Railway) read into the type of writing of the London Underground and DLR Line trademarks that turn into the image of a tanker.
In September, a swarm of weapons dealers will drive with DLR ... Customers are asked to help stop the weapons trade fair.
The 300 posters are by artists who have exhibited their work at the Museum for Cruel Designs in Banksys Dismaland.
A collective named Special Patrol Group helped with the distribution in London and used "Ad Space Hack Packs", a 6 Â£ pack of inbus keys that claim that "access to around a third of the bus stop advertising areas on the planet."
Transport for London does not find this poster "vandalism" funny.
One of the parody ads produced by Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Crueol Designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists become more critical and try to bring political works to the audience outside of galleries.
Many artists work with activists within protest movements and notice that they have to go out into the real world so that their art has an influence on society.
Another of the anti-weapon trade posters greets the counterparts on the subway.
The amnesty video was viewed over Facebook more than 100,000 times in 24 hours and was created by the advertising agency VCCP, who works with the graphic artist and voice-over artist, who also works for free.
VCCP creative director Matt Lever was amazed at the silence that ruled around advertising for the arms trade fair - through a space of the ExCeL calendar - and thought: "Give them the campaign that they are trying to avoid."
They played with the invention of a more realistically sleek company advertising, but "by blowing in with bright colors and animation it remains more liable."
"They have done a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness about the sale of illegal torture devices at the fair," says Tom Davies of Amnesty.
What we need now is a intervention by the British Government and the guarantee that torture equipment will not be traded illegally in front of our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art around the Waffenmesse comes from within ExCeL, where exhibitors are making fantastic euphemistic products worse.

Eight Golden Rules for Living in Student Homes
11 years ago, as a self-desired 19-year-old, I moved to a student home, still in faith in Beret's and moral relativism, but only now do I remember the tense smiles of those whom I have upset - and the numerous, long-term complaints about others.
Most of what I have learned can be distilled in eight simple rules.
The entry into student homes ranges from slightly nervous to absolutely terrifying.
It's tempting to swim: people tell you where you come from, whether and where you've taken Sabbath years, where you're in relation to Corbyn and why you're "no love or hate marmite, because seriously, boys, it's just a yeast extract HAHAHAHA, I'm in my room."
Breathe through.
And help others do the same - ask questions and show interest.
It steers the conversation and helps you find out the people you like in contrast to those you wouldn't talk to, even if your eyelashes got burned and those fire extinguishers would be.
Leave people.
People's rooms often turn into beverage receptions, film nights venues and municipal meeting points, but they are also the places where people dress and straighten their underwear.
In this connection, don't think about starting a university relationship.
Introverted people receive rough treatment at the university.
Her room should be a refuge, but many student homes form a space-to-room-bummel culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifelong friendship.
That could be hell for someone trying to recover.
Nothing in the culture allows you to say, "I like you, and I want our friendship to go on, but you have to go away so that I can get the energy back that I used for interacting with you."
Try to feel when a commilitone of socialism is exhausted - and send him a text message instead of knocking.
Apropos knock: Do it.
A guy in my student residence had the idea that a non-locked door was an invitation.
He saw some things.
Close friendship by baking.
Since you start the university at the top of the back mania, knocking on the doors of people to imagine yourself with a plate full of brownies, less strange than greeting the 1950s "Welcome in the neighborhood, I have baked you a bit. So, and now please smile if I ask you a few personal questions."
Offering homemade treats is a good way to make friendships.
Your roommates feel obliged to talk and will perhaps associate your face with a delicious surprise in the end.
Of course, this depends on whether you are a decent baker.
Bad mixed lumps of flour, sugar and fat cause people to sleep when you knock.
Stealing food is a common crime in student homes.
Of course the claw of chicken is a theft, but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea too?
Check with the milk owner.
The chances are good that they say to serve themselves, even if they cook inside.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoyed, and you have my compassion - but try to handle it more balancedly than my companion, who added a detergent to her milk to punish thieves.
She's in prison now.
You shouldn't make a noise that keeps people from sleeping or working.
It is not only about being a decent person, but that in the truest sense of the proverb you belong to the people sitting in the glasshouse.
A girl on my corridor asked her neighbors if they had something to do with drum and bass something quieter, because it was three o'clock in the morning, and she had an exam in the morning.
They responded with even louder music.
When she finally stopped at 5:00 p.m., she kindly left her neighbors to sleep two hours before she had her own music bragged, closed her door, and went to her three-hour examination.
Would it not be romantic for your future spouse to move into the same student home by chance?
On the other hand, it would not be absurd if you were to consider your future spouse to be a cohabiter, to run on to her, to separate again, and then to see her every day and perhaps to live with her as she draws all the joint friends over to herself?
Of course, the heart goes its own ways - but if a hot cohabiter is definitely not your future spouse, at least try to give your mind a little reason.
In the exciting moment when you notice that someone has left his keys in his non-closed room, the boundary between a ulk and mobbing is more fine than it seems.
A good strike is funny, but it only takes moments to become a boomerang.
Give a valuable and amusing lesson about safety by hiding - but never waste anyone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock their door, and put their keys in a glass of water, which you then put in the freezer - but don't tick their possessions on the ceiling more than twice.
Rowing houses for refugees, single parent, low-paid
The real estate owner Markus Gildner is building in the Central Franconian Eckental Rowing Houses for people who don't have much money.
So, for example, for refugees - but also as a signal: "Not only do refugees need housing space, but also the single mother and the low-earner."
"I show how to build cheaply and well even today," says the 44-year-old in the interview
Thousands of refugees will enter the housing market.
Entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes he knows how to quickly create cheap living space: He builds rowing houses for refugees in a project.
Mr Gildner, many refugees will enter the housing market.
Which solution do you offer?
Markus Gildner: The mass accommodation in containers or gyms has no sustainability.
For people stay here for a large part.
In view of the flow of refugees, we need enough housing in the next decades.
A completely banal, three-storey terraced house is the solution.
Gildner: A terraced house needs least space.
It facilitates integration.
It's different if you bring people into residential blocks.
Each of the six houses, which are currently being built in the pilot project, consists of three housing units for four asylum seekers each.
Each unit has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a living room.
It may be that many refugees will say it's peace again, I'm going back.
Then the houses can easily be converted according to the respective needs.
How high are the costs?
Gildner: The price for 160 square meters per house is 184 000 euros, without land.
That's manageable.
The construction took six months.
That's appropriate.
Did the building regulations complicate their plans?
Gildner: Legally, I did my project correctly.
It always makes it particularly complicated the threatening damoclesheavy special construction and the pitch regulation.
That's funny.
It is still assumed that if you create three apartments in a terraced house, you need at least three pitches.
Only in the cities the place is missing.
And refugees and asylum seekers have no cars.
How did the residents react to their terraced house project?
Gildner: There were some who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers.
What's definitely wrong.
But don't you tighten the competition for affordable apartments?
Gildner: It's true: we've had a building tree in Germany in the last five years, but we've built luxury apartments that can hardly afford to anyone.
My project has the message, even the normal people need living space.
Not only refugees, but also the single mother or low-earner.
I show you how to build cheaply and well even today.
That's what it's all about.
Markus Gildner (44) studied microsystem technology in Regensburg and initially dealt with environmental analyses.
iOS 9: How to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is released
The new operating system can be requested by going to the Settings app, typing "General" and then selecting "Software Update".
When it is ready, the phone will give you the option to download and then to install.
Some have encountered problems after installation, as they receive an error message that indicates that the "software update" has failed.
In order to avoid the problem, users are recommended to either wait until the attack goes back or try to update over iTunes.
The phone itself will guide you through the rest of the process.
This may mean deleting apps to create space - but Apple has made it more unlikely due to the slimming of the update. It will also be easier to do so if you use a special tool to delete apps and then re-install them once the process is completed.
It is worth ensuring that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is located near a charger, so that the battery is charged.
If the charge is too low, Apple does not allow the update to continue, as the phone may shut down half way and this could lead to a termination of the update.

Rosberg's only currency: Full attack
In the fight for the World Cup title in Formula 1 Nico Rosberg knows only one motto: "Full Attack" against his clearly leading Mercedes teammate Lewis Hamilton.
The World Cup second emphasized the decisive seven overseas races before the start, "that I have nothing to lose."
53 points separate the vice-world champion before the night race in Singapore on this Sunday from champion and double-champion Hamilton.
The Briton already won seven of the previous twelve seasons and attacks the floodlight Grand Prix in the city state as a favorite.
2009 and last year, the 30-year-old Briton was able to win the race.
Whether the current Smog in the state of the city will influence Singapore's Great Price is still unclear.
A dark bell has been hanging over the city for days, caused by fires on the neighboring island of Sumatra.
Bad Kissinger chess club has a prominent member
The chess club "Schachfreunde Bad Kissingen" was founded three months ago and has added another member to its ranks, thus the number of members increased to 19 players.
The new member is the entrepreneur Paul Gauselmann, a passionate chess and tennis player who stayed in Bad Kissingen for more than 40 times.
Gauselmann is the holder of the Bundesverdienstkreuz 1st class and honorary citizen of the cities of Espelkamp and LÃ¼bbecke.
The chess club in Bad Kissingen has supported Gauselmann with a donation that was accepted by Alfred Klein.
This makes it possible to include chess players who cannot pay the membership fee.
Youth work and talent search are also to be promoted.
Gauselmann wishes that membership in the chess club and also friendly contact with the tennis club "Rot-WeiÃŸ" be seen as an expression of his association with the Kurstadt.
Quarters office looking for direct contact
Saludis and Antonistift's old centre have joined together under the coat of the Social Foundation and opened a new contact point at Graf-Stauffenberg Square.
In addition to consultation, you can also participate in courses.
The Social Foundation draws it down from the mountain to the city center.
More specifically at the Graf Stauffenberg Square.
A new neighborhood office was opened there recently.
Here, right next to the shopping market, seniors and seeking advice will receive information on questions such as health insurance or the benefits of the health and care funds.
For years, with our outpatient care service, we have noted that often caring relatives are left alone.
There are infinitely many questions.
"Even though not many services of the cash offices are not often used because the complexity of insurance is hardly understood," explained the new landlord Jutta Weigand, who is also responsible for Antonistift and the civil hospital and for the outpatient service "Amadeus".
In addition to the consultations, the new neighborhood office also offers prevention, health courses and wellness.
For this, the Saludis was taken into the boat.
Therefore, you can use additional offers such as fall prevention, memory training or physiotherapy treatment.
The offers from the Senior Center and the Saludis complement themselves in an ideal way.
Saludis stands for prevention, prevention and reha.
"The Senior Center for Care and Care", described Heike Riedel, Managing Director of Saludis.
The reason for the opening of the new neighborhood office in the city centre is that both directors see it particularly in demographic change.
Because this is making a good decentralised infrastructure in the individual districts of Bamberg indispensable in the future.
In addition, the Mayor Wolfgang Metzner (SPD) underlined at the opening celebrations, the Quartiers Bureau was also committed to the unification at the age: "There are numerous events and offers on the programme and they invite to a regular social gathering."
This makes a major contribution to the social foundation that seniors can live as independently and well in their familiar environment as possible.
The quarter office is open Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 9 am to 2 pm, Tuesday and Thursday from 4 pm to 6 pm and Saturday from 10 AM to 12 PM.
Eintracht Bamberg v. WÃ¼rzburger Kickers on 6 October
Now it is official: After the renovation work at the Fuchsparkstadion of the date for the game FC Eintracht Bamberg had not yet been set against the third-ligist WÃ¼rzburger Kickers, the 6th of October has now been set as an appointment.
The encounter of FC Eintracht Bamberg in the eighth finale of the Bavarian football Totopokals against the third ligist FC WÃ¼rzburger Kickers has now finally been scheduled.
It will be played on Tuesday 6 October at 7 a.m. at the Bamberg Fuchsparkstadion.
"We are happy that we now know when the game is going over the stage, now we have planning security," said FCE team manager Karlheinz HÃ¼mmer, who also points to the online pre-sale.
It's something special for our team to play against a third-party.
We therefore hope for many spectators, and this is not without reason, because floodlight games have a special appeal.
In the round of the last 16 teams, the FC Eintracht Bamberg won the district ligigist 1st FC Oberhaid (3:1) and at home against the regional league 1st FC Schweinfurt 05 (3:2).
The winner of the competition receives 5000 euros and qualifys for the first round of the DFB club cup 2016/2017.
The title defender is SpVgg Unterhaching.
Vienna architect Karl Mang 92-year-old died
Karl Mang, one of the Doyens of Vienna's architecture, is dead.
He died on September 5 at the age of 92, as the KÃ¼nstlerhaus announced on Tuesday.
With Mang, the KÃ¼nstlerhaus loses an honorary member and at the same time "one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna", as it was said in the broadcast.
Born in Vienna in 1922, Mang studied architecture during and after World War II at the University of Technology in Vienna with Friedrich Lehmann.
Since 1952 he has worked as a freelance architect, but also worked as a teacher, writer and institute director.
From 1972 to 1983 he was President of the Austrian Institute of Design.
In the 1980s he was commissioned to the Austrian Theatre Museum with the establishment of the treasure chamber in the Vienna Hofburg and the reconstruction of the Lobkowitz Palace.
Park Punishment: Tim Wiese recruits police with money
Ex-footballer Tim Wiese found himself unwell in Bremen.
Football was once involved, since then Tim Wiese, ex-national goalkeeper in Germany and with Bremen and Hoffenheim, Wrestler.
According to his own statement, he wants to have added 30 kilograms of muscle mass over the past two years.
Intellectually, however, he did not commit.
Wiese had just cut his hair in the city centre of Bremer, when he saw a parking-room guard exhibiting a penitentiary for his white Chevrolet Camaro outside.
Wiese then stormed out of the business, insulted the official and threw the fine in front of her feet, as the "image" newspaper reports.
At the city of Bremen one confirms the accusations, but is not yet clear about the consequences for the unusual incident.
"The case is still in the test," it says from the city of Bremen.
Only then will it decide whether to display meadow, or not.
Panama authorities destroy 4500 marijuana plants
The fertile soil and the rainforest typical climate of the Isla del Rey are best suited for the flourishing of marijuana plants.
For three days the authorities of Panama have been tearing out the 4500 plants and burning them.
Men beat to 17-year-old Afghans a
Witnesses are looking for an incident in Bad Soden-SalmÃ¼nster: On Friday evening, around 23.45, three young men were on foot from Bad Soden towards SalmÃ¼nster.
One of the group, a 17-year-old Afghane, according to the police, followed his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him.
At that time, the group was at the height of the bft service station.
On the grounds of the gas station there were also three people.
One of these men now screamed at the youth and hit him with the fist in the face.
The victim suffered a nose fracture and bled heavily out of the nose.
When his two friends rushed in and mischievously spoke to the beater, he initially dropped off his victim.
The injured young man was brought home by his friends.
The culprit persecuted the group with a car to their home and was protesting several times there.
When the car was no longer seen, the injured went to the building to smoke a cigarette.
There he was again attacked by the beating and another male person.
The victimâ€™s face and thighs were struck with the help of a beating stick.
The injured person had to be taken to a hospital for medical care.
So far, only a vague culprit description is available.
One of the men was about 1.80 meters tall.
The second hit should have been about 1.65 meters tall and was clothed with a jeans and a brown-white shirt.
The police ask witnesses and notifiers to report by phone number 06181/100-123.
Dr. Frank MÃ¼ller takes over practice Felsthausen and invests 310000 euros
Silvia MÃ¼ller-Gongol and Frank MÃ¼ller (from the left) take over the practice of Karl-Heinrich and Ursel Felstehausen.
Samt municipality mayor Bernd Bormann, economic supporter Uta Seim-Schwartz and Asendorf's mayor Heinfried Kabbert are also pleased.
Doctors are missing in many places in the country - Asendorf, on the other hand, is lucky: Dr. Frank MÃ¼ller will take over the practice of Felsehausen on October 1.
While Ursel Felsehausen retired, her husband Karl-Heinrich is still at his side with half a job in the next few months.
After a reconstruction phase, MÃ¼ller reopens the practice on October 12th, until then he invests 310000 euros in the premises on St.-MarcellusstraÃŸe 6.
It was sympathy at first glance when the Felstehausen years ago met Frank MÃ¼ller and his wife, Dr. Silvia MÃ¼ller-Gongol, who is currently completing her specialist training in the Verden hospital and is also trying to get into practice next year.
"We always had in mind that the MÃ¼llers would fit well into this practice," says Dr. Ursel Felsehausen and laughed.
"When it was so, I just called them."
The MÃ¼ller couple liked the idea of doing their own practice in Asendorf in the future.
"The proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us," says 39-year-old MÃ¼ller.
"We want to meet and accompany families over the years".
As an advantage he also sees to be his own boss soon.
And so they agreed, the MÃ¼llers bought the house with the practice.
However, they will continue to live in Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
There, the double-family father Frank MÃ¼ller grew up, and his medical studies in Hanover followed stations in several medical practices as well as in hospitals in Sulingen, Nienburg and Rotenburg.
He is currently working as a senior doctor in Sulingen, and in 2009 he was appointed senior notary in Diepholz County and is volunteering in the DRK-preparation Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
From 19 September the practice will be prepared for the new boss.
While the surgeon Dr. Karl-Heinrich Felsehausen works as a house doctor, his wife Ursel (internist) has specialized in gastroenterology.
The MÃ¼llers, both internists, are trying to settle as domestic doctors.
"The endoscopy is therefore coming out," says 38-year-old Silvia MÃ¼ller-Gongol.
After conversion, the rooms will look more modern.
We will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long-term and load ECGs and need a speech room more.
In addition, the EDV will be completely renewed.
The MÃ¼llers receive a total grant of 50000 euros from the county's support programme (25,000 euros) as well as from the Samtgemeinde (12500 euros) and the municipality (12500 euros).
"This shows how proud and happy we are that the practice will continue," emphasizes Samtgemeinschaftmeister Bernd Bormann.
According to Silvia MÃ¼ller-Gongol every quarter, about 2,000 patients come to the practice of Felsthausen, with about 500 in northern German average practice.
There is another home doctor practice in Asendorf.
A positive side effect of the practice by Frank MÃ¼ller: The pharmacy remains according to Ursel Felsehausen in Asendorf.
If no successor had found her, she would have gone.
By the way, anyone who visits MÃ¼ller's speaking hour will continue to look especially at familiar faces: take over the seven medical professionals and the cleaning power from the Rockhouses.
With their departure ends an era in Asendorf, after all the physicians have practiced there for 30 years.
"At the beginning we had only two rooms," recalls Ursel Felsthausen.
A little weedy already feels it after a long time.
"But we continue to live in Hohenmoor and will certainly see many patients many times," says the internist.
Her husband adds laughing: "We have a 6000 square meter base."
"Unfortunately, I have always pushed myself before gardening, now that could be different."
In addition, the couple has two grandchildren and they like to travel.
Croatia: "We leave the refugees through"
"Now border controls are also going up at our southern border," said interior minister Johanna Mikl-Leinner.
The controls at the Hungarian border remain in parallel.
It is still clear that anyone who wants to apply for asylum can do so "of course".
People's care and safety are in the foreground.
It is clear, however, that "it needs clear signals," said the Minister.
People need to know that we do not accept boundless migration flows, nor over the Austrian-Slovene border.
A controlled procedure is needed.
Croatia is considering Corridor refused - Slovenia
The Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia would also want to continue arriving refugees to Austria and Germany and possibly also build corridors for refugees.
However, this was not the case with interior minister Vesna GyÃ¶rkos Znidar in LiÃ¨ge.
The idea of corridors was "absolutely unacceptable", rather than intensification in Slovenia's surveillance of the border - especially in Hungary.
The border with Croatia, on the other hand, was already heavily controlled as the external border of the Schengen area.
As the Minister pointed out, Slovenin does not want to lock down his borders on refugees.
"Every EU member must fulfil his obligations, otherwise the system will not work," said GyÃ¶rkos Znidar.
As the Croatian government reported, the first refugees had already tried to enter East Croatia at the border crossing of Tovarnik/Sid in the night hours to avoid registration.
The Croatian police were able to attack her in the nearby corn fields.
According to local media, police vehicles have been in constant contact with new refugees in Croatian Tovarnik since then.
It is mainly about Syrians and Afghans, including numerous women and children.
Rescue services and the Red Cross were also in use.
In the coming days, his country is counting with around 4000 refugees, said Interior Minister Rancho Ostojic.
In addition, buses from Presevo on the Macedonian-Serbian border, which so far had brought migrants to the Hungarian border, would be rerouted to Croatia, reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesdays.
However, the Belgrade government disputed that it was it to instruct the people to take certain routes: "We can still, or do we will," it said.
According to the media reports, at least in the early morning a first bus with about 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of Sid, and in the course of the day more buses would be expected.
About Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany
The inmates had been on their way through Serbia all night from the Macedonian border about 500 kilometres away.
"We have heard that Hungary has closed, so the police told us to go here," said one of the refugees.
They wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia, Slovenia and Austria.
In fact, this could lead to a slightly western route to the already predicted shift of the former Balkan Route of Turkey-Greece-Macedon-Serbia-Hungary.
Croatia: "Comprehensive possibilities for border control"
Croatia's Interior Minister Ostojic had previously stressed that his country had prepared appropriate plans for possible exceptional situations in the event of a strong inflow of refugees.
Details he did not mention, but he pointed out that as a non-schengen member, Croatia has "comprehensive possibilities for border control".
There are strict controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area.
Slovenia has been a member of this since 2007, and the EU partners have always been giving a good witness to the country as regards the standard of border controls.
On the Serbian side, some 300 refugees still stand behind the Hungarian border fence.
According to Belgrade's media reports, they had spent the last night at the Horgos border crossing that leads to RÃ¶szke.
According to the Hungarian authorities, the two border crossings Horgos and Backi Breg remain completely blocked.
Whether the remaining refugees want to continue to the Croatian border is still unclear.
The Serbian Interior Minister Nebojsa Stefanovic tried to calm down on Wednesday morning at a local eyelight in Horgos: he considered the debates on alternative routes of refugees to be premature after the Hungarian border was closed.
It would not at present be very high refugee figures.
It is not yet possible to say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary, Croatia or another country.
Helpers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
However, private Hungarian refugee workers have already begun to distribute to refugees maps on which alternative routes are recorded through Croatia.
However, the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous: in parts of the border area, even 20 years after the end of the Croatia war, mine fields still do not exist.
On Wednesday afternoon, the Croatian police announced that a team of miners in the border region had been sent.
Stock Exchange hacker: Ukrainian pay 30 million dollars
Supranook is said to have belonged to a ring of cybercriminals who have been accused of constantly getting insight into unpublished financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire, Market Wire and PR Newswire since 2010.
The information obtained is intended to make insider transactions on the financial markets.
According to the investigators, a total of over 100 million dollars were delivered.
"Today's comparison shows that even those outside our borders are ultimately caught," says the SEC Communication.
The proceedings against 32 other accused in the case took place.
Most of the defendants are from Ukraine and Georgia.
The perpetrators should have been active in both the US and Eastern Europe.
Ecumenical Hospice Aid Mannheim has existed for 20 years
Around the Mannheim Parade Square there is a busy operation.
People take care of their supplies, partly fast steps, partly cozy.
They control the two stations of the Mannheim car salon at the parade square.
City trains.
Pulsatory, delicate life with a wonderful autumn sunshine and in the middle four large plates each with the heading "Before I die I want to."...
With this action, the Ecumenical Hospice Aid drew attention to its 20th anniversary and is faced with mixed reactions.
"It's about life, so we went with the action in the middle of the city and among the people," says Josefine Lammer.
The head of the Ecumenical Hospice Aid is available to passersby as well as to questions and conversations as to volunteer staff.
While one passerby is spontaneously grasping the Creed and adding the sentence to "hearing my life", "reading", "to go through the U.S. camper", "stop the war" or "not long suffering", others stay short, read sentences such as "as far as I am not yet" and then go on.
Again and again, there are small discussions about the action itself, about life, about dealing with dying.
Peter HÃ¼binger is also on site.
"Only when I make it clear that the end of this world will come for me at some point, can I live responsibly," says the director of the Diakonisches Werke Mannheim, who together with the Caritasverband is the bearer of the Ecumenical Hospice Aid.
Therefore, this publicity action is good for the 20-year-old.
The fact that everyone does not want to communicate on the tables in public, however, is understandable, finally it is a very personal matter.
The issue of death and death is still with taboos, according to Josefine Lammer's experience, although the hospice movement in recent years has contributed much to the opening of people.
An assessment that Angelika shares Godefroid.
The death and mourning companion is one of the first hour's volunteer staff.
Faced with the subject matter through personal experience, she read a lot of literature and decided to engage in the death aid.
When the Ecumenical Hospice Aid sought honorary help, she immediately reported herself and was at the start in 1995.
Godefroid belongs to a team of 45 volunteer - 43 women and two men - accompanied by affected and family members in private households, hospitals, nursing homes and Hospice Saint Vincent.
They're all carefully trained.
Angelika Godefroid can deal well with her task and the experiences and experiences that have been gained.
"I see life from another wait, consider it precious and appreciate the moment," she says.
The offer of the Ambulant Ecumenical Hospice Service is free and religiously independent.
The financial support of health insurance funds and donations from family members and associations enables the training as well as the training and supervision of the dying and mourning staff.
Training for new employees is offered every two years.
The tables described on Saturday are now on display in the House of the Protestant Church (M1, 1a) and in the House of the Catholic Church (F2, 6).
Further personal requests can also be recorded on postcards.
FedEx results mixed, financial prospects reduced for 2016
FedEx reported disappointing results for the last quarter, and the supplier giant lowered his profit outlook for a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in his ground transport service.
The company also said that it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the vacation.
At this point last year, FedEx announced that the company would like to recruit 50,000 seasonal workers for the vacation period.
The share fell over 2.5 percent in Premarket trade 45 minutes before opening on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said to earn a profit between $10.40 and $10.90 in the financial year ending next May, 20 cents less than at the previous forecast.
According to a factset survey, analysts expected $10.84.
The lower outlook comes in spite of the price increases, which averages 4.9% and are effective on 4 January and despite higher increases in land transport of heavy and large packages, which will be raised from November onwards.
The company said that it is nevertheless expected that the result will increase compared to the previous year due to cost reduction, higher revenue and growth in online trade.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company "is producing solid revenues if one considers the weaker than expected economic conditions, especially in manufacturing and global trade".
The plans for holiday employment were announced one day later than that of Rival UPS, who plans to hire 90,000 to 95,000 additional workers, about the same number as last year.
In the quarter, which ended on August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, 6 percent more than in the previous year.
The result per share amounted to $2.42 per share, just behind $2.44 per share that twelve analysts asked by Zacks Investment Research predicted.
Sales increased by 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts surveyed by Zack expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx has seen a decline in international priority shipping in recent years, which has led to the stagnation of sales in its unit of express shipping.
But the boom in online shopping has increased the results at FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, land transport sales increased by 29 percent, but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger parcels and self-insurance.
Express unit recorded higher revenue due to higher prices, while earnings fell due to higher labour costs in the freight business.
In the premarket trade, about one hour before the opening, the FedEx shares fell by $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $10.15.
On Tuesday they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent under a record high on 11 June.
At its most expected meeting in the year Federal Reserve Strauts spend two days this week sitting around a 27-foot Honduras-Mahagoni table to decide whether it is time to raise the key interest for the first time in almost a decade.
Threatening about them at the end of the decorated two-storey meeting room there is a mural of the United States.
The card is a reminder that Fed president Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues should put the nation's economic interests ahead of everything else.
The Central Bank has a double order from the Congress: to keep the US employment and prices stable here.
But since the great recession, Fed leaders have recognized that there is an unwritten third mandate: financial stability.
And this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too close to predicting it. It will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to start to get engaged from the unprecedented incentive by the short-term interest rate close to zero since the end of 2008.
Although most data from the economy show that it is growing solid, the recent turbulences in global financial markets could make the already cautious Fed representatives afraid to strengthen this volatility by increasing the interest rate for federal bonds - and even by only a quarter of a point.
"The labour market and inflation are apparently the most important thing they observe," said Lindsey M. Piegza, Chief Economist at Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think if they were looking for an excuse not to increase the interest rate, the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is enough to keep waiting," she said.
There is no consensus as to what the Fed will do, which in itself will insure the financial market.
About half of the economists who were recently interviewed by Bloomberg predicted an interest rate increase this week.
However, financial markets expect Fed to wait, with a key indicator showing only a 30% chance for an increase.
This indicates a fall in the stock market if the Fed increases the rate, unless the strategists reduce the impact by promising that another increase is far away.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial average jumped by 228.89 points or by 1.4% to 16.599.85.
The action was triggered by expectations that the Fed policy would maintain the rate this week, said John Lonski, Chief Economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
It would be a surprise if the Fed lifted the sentences at that time," he said.
If she does, "in her statement, she has to go very far to calm down the financial markets so that she doesn't panic."
Other experts argued that an interest rate increase would calm down financial markets because it would eliminate uncertainty about when the Fed will act.
Just a month ago, the Fed seemed to increase the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US.
Yellen had said in spring and early summer that this year, despite the complaints of liberals that more economic progress would be necessary, she expected an increase in the rate.
Although job creation slowed down in August, the improvement in the labour market was solid this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest in more than seven years and near the level the Fed regards as full employment.
Wages increases have shown signs of recovery.
And although inflation was constantly below the annual target of 2% of the central bank, Fed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy "can cope with higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But the financial markets around the world have collapsed at the end of last month after China had devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial average fell by more than 16% in May, when investors feared that a slowing down of the Chinese economy would slow down global growth.
The market has recovered a little this month, with the Dow now nearly 10% below the May high.
For Fed representatives, market turbulences affect the complex calculation of when to increase interest rates.
"If the events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the last few weeks, they would have attracted the reins at this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, Senior Research Fellow at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former U.S. Note Bank staff.
Now he predicts that she will wait at least a month to better control the effects.
"There's a lot of uncertainty about what the impact will be on the US economy, and there's almost no reliable data describing the developments in China," said Oliner.
The health of the world economy is not one of the main concerns of the Fed, so it should not be technically included in its decision-making process.
But in the final effect the Fed currency authority has become the world.
The influence of the Central Bank has been enormous in recent years.
The mere indication of Ben S. Bernanke's former leader in 2013 that the Fed could "sink" their monetary expansion, caused confusion around the globe.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, Fed representatives can expect them not only to monitor developments elsewhere, but also to consult with other central banks and experts to get a better understanding of the global economy.
Their decision-making is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of the global strategy for asset management of Investnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, VA., noted this month that "the Fed has a history of overreactions on financial market movements that are apparently not linked to economic fundamental data."
Lacker, member of the Federal Open Market Committee, who is committed to an interest rate increase, cited decisions in 1998/1999 as an example.
A financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to reduce its key interest rate by 0.75 percentage points in three meetings, "despite the limited impact on US growth," said Lacker.
A year later the Fed representatives reversed these cuts.
The Fed should place aspects of financial stability only in the first place during a severe crisis such as the market collapse in 2008, said Adam S. Posen, former member of the Committee on Interest Rates of the Bank of England.
The most recent turbulences are not near this level, he said.
"She certainly does not want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of an interest rate increase because the markets are moving," said Posen, President of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that is changed, I do not think it should be time-consuming.
Do you need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown
The market/camp was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
LAX-C is often referred to as Thai Costco and is a Thai wholesale market that also sells to the general public.
Yes, it is located in Chinatown and not in Thai Town.
The market/camp is a central point of contact and offers a confusing number of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian snacks, and dishes, furniture, religious jewelry and Christmas decorations.
There is even a car division if you need engine oil.
The shop is huge, and it takes over an hour to stroll through the courses.
If the whole store makes you hungry, there is a meal for you in the LAX-C BBQ Express.
The kitchen (good and inexpensive) in this shop is close to the checkouts and has various take-away options.
What is there here: Do you need something - something - Thai?
LAX-C probably has it.
Products are cheap and a number of them are sold in large quantities.
Fresh products include Asian specialities and regional Thai herbs, fruit and much more.
The meat counter is extensive, as is the fish counter - the staff behind the counter will clean and fill the fish and even fry for you.
A good part of the store belongs to the massive freezing department. Here you will find frozen curry sheets, bitter melon and gallant, whole ducks, fish, bovine blood and galle, pig-nature, fish balls, regional sausage, commercially prepared food and more.
Who buys here: restaurant owners and cooks, also individual families and individuals.
The wide courses are suitable for shopping carts and forklifts.
You will find here: fresh Monthong Durian next to the cash desk.
Where it is: The shop is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles on the edge of Chinatown and downtown - a few blocks away from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking space, along with other shops and restaurants.
Even if the store is well visited, it is not hard to find a parking space.
Hoyerswerda: Small life aid for refugees
More and more refugees arrive in Germany these days.
Getting a warm welcome to you does not go without the commitment of countless volunteer helpers.
There are also a number of people in Hoyerswerda who are indignantly supporting asylum seekers in the city.
They include Petra and Klaus Heine.
Petra Heine is a teacher with body and soul.
She also likes to teach with her 74 lenses.
Every Thursday she does it at the asylum centre on Dillinger StraÃŸe.
There she helps refugees from Syria, Kurdistan, Kosovo and Pakistan learn German.
Of course, this is quite different from a real school.
Brazilâ€™s paediatric society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breastfeeding
The Brazilian paediatric organization SPRS tries to alarm women in a shocking way about how important good nutrition is during breastfeeding. It does so with the presentation of images of babies sucking at breasts painted with representations of unhealthy foods.
Mother's milk consists of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system.
Due to the additional energy requirements, pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories a day.
However, new research indicates that higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should make.
A recent study conducted by Robert Waterland, professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumours.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet of the child can negatively affect the immune system.
Exceptions for the new Bernrieder Sporthalle
Bernried Municipal Council approved the request for the 2.3 million euros expensive sports hall.
And he made an exception.
The roof may be flattered for solar system.
Plans for long-awaited gym construction at the Bernrieder Sportgebiet are progressing step by step: In the most recent municipal council meeting, the prepared building application was granted one-way without major discussions.
Previously, the body had decided, among other things, to apply for a building "exception" respectful "exemption" from the valid building plan.
The "exception" was about permission for a special form regarding the roof construction.
Thus, a "sat roof with non-middle first and roof cover" is to be built.
Background of the planning is the planned use of the roof area for solar systems: "This gives us a wonderfully large south roof together," said Mayor Josef Steigenberger at the meeting.
The "liberation" was again about the roof inclination that should be less than ten degrees for energetic reasons - unlike in the construction plan.
The volume of the hall is thus significantly reduced.
A "liberation" was therefore needed because the construction plan for the roof inclination does not allow "exceptions" - the Bernried municipal council usually has a more restrictive approach in the case of applications for exemption.
However, Turnhallenbau is not a recurring project: "We do not create a precedent", says Steigenberger.
Turnhallenbau am Sportzentrum is a joint project of the municipality and the SV Bernried.
About 2.3 million euros are calculated at the cost.
Grants are expected from school and wide-ranging sports promotions.
In the next process, the building application for the 18 x 36 meters hall is now submitted to the Landratsamt for examination.
Klinik PeiÃŸenberg moves to Schongau
The PeiÃŸenberg Hospital is to be closed earlier than planned - 2016.
At the same time, Dr. Wilhelm Fischer (66) will become new medical director at the Schongau Hospital.
The station as well as the majority of the employees move from Piessenberg to Schongau.
This is the view of the surprising plans of the Hospital GmbH of the county, confirmed by Landratin Andrea Jochner-WeiÃŸ.
However, the Supervisory Board makes a decision on this, and it will meet on Wednesday, September 23.
If the plans were implemented, then all of the almost 50 employees at the hospital in PeiÃŸenberg would continue to work.
The vast majority were supposed to move to Schongau with fishermen and the further existing inner station.
The rooms are available.
A job is to be offered to employees who are not able to go to Schongau in Weilheim, said Jochner-WeiÃŸ.
Staff were informed of the plans.
The change has triggered the termination of Dr. Andreas Eder, who is only since the beginning of the year medical director of the Schongauer Klinik and now turns to a private practice in the immediate vicinity of the hospital.
According to Jochner-WeiÃŸ, the name "Fischer" came into play on the question of who is supposed to succeed, who agreed to take the lead from October 1st and switch to Schongau with his team.
For the house in Schongau this means in any case a "upgrading" and an expansion of the offer in the field of "internal medicine", says Jochner-WeiÃŸ.
Fischer is a specialist in pacemakers and defibrillators.
Schongau (180 beds) specializes in gastroenterological diseases at the inner station.
In the course of the next two years, if the Supervisory Board agrees, Fischer will lead both houses until next year, the former Knapschaft Hospital, which still has 35 beds, will be finally closed in PeiÃŸenberg after almost 140 years.
So far, the county had planned this for 2018, when the current renovation at the Weilheim Hospital has been completed.
Landlord Jochner-WeiÃŸ, who is also Chairman of the Supervisory Board, was fighting rumours, according to which the house owned by the Bundesknappschaft will in future be used as accommodation for asylum seekers.
As the property continues, Jochner-WeiÃŸ could not say, there are several considerations.
Currently there is a short-term care of the Caritas and a day psychiatric hospital.
"What better couldn't happen to us, such an opportunity doesn't come back," said Fischer about the Quasi move to the Lech, which was taken up by the employees "positively and very understandingly".
A real perspective for the house where fishermen have been working as chief physician for over 30 years has not existed.
He had been asked by Schongauer colleagues to take over the position of the medical director.
The Piesenberg Hospital (one hundred beds) has repeatedly been threatened with closure over the last decades, and departments have been closed, such as surgery and birth aid.
The handballs of the Rhein-Neckar Lions are required at the Bergische HC tonight (20.15).
Although the Bundesliga's table leader is the clear favorite in Wuppertal, there is no cause for superiority.
In the past season, the Badeners at the BHC had a painful defeat and had something to do with it.
Hunt accident with two injured at Pratau
During her corn harvest on Tuesday afternoon, two tractor drivers were severely injured by shots.
During the aberth on a cornfield near Pratau (Landkreis Wittenberg) several hunters were in use, as the police reported.
After a shooting charge, a 63- and 22-year-old man suffered serious injuries and was brought to hospitals.
How exactly the accident could have happened was at first unclear.
The criminal police are investigating.
Missing 16-year-olds from Rhineland-Palatinate Victims of Violent Crime
A suspect has led the police to the body of the 16-year-olds who have been missing since Saturday from Rhineland-Palatinate.
In the interrogation, the 20-year-old admitted that the young people had killed and thrown their bodies into a canal in Rockenhausen.
A 16-year-old who has been missing since Saturday from Rhineland-Palatinate has been a victim of violent crime.
The young woman's body was found in Rockenhausen near Kaiserslautern on Tuesday evening, as announced by prosecutors and police on Wednesday.
A 20-year-old, who was also arrested on Tuesday evening, according to the act, is considered to be true and led the investigators to the location of the body's find.
The 16-year-old had been reported missing on Sunday morning after not having come home on the eve of an autumn festival in Rockenhausen as agreed.
In the search for the young woman, the investigators first encountered personal objects of the victim.
Finally, in the case of interviews in the circle of friends and acquaintances, there was a suspicion of crime against the 20-year-olds.
The alleged perpetrator then led the police to a canal in Rockenhausen, where the body was found.
According to the authorities, the prisoner admitted to the police investigation, killed the 16-year-olds and put the body in the canal.
The 20-year-old should be presented to the judge on Wednesday, the investigators will put him to death.
The further investigations are to be carried out on the further circumstances of the case.
Refugees need accommodations: Study warns about apartment gap
The situation on the German housing market is tense.
More and more refugees are also looking for affordable lead.
Pressure on the housing market is growing.
Social housing is a challenge.
Distribution struggles on the German housing market have long begun.
With the arrival of refugees and job seekers from the EU, more and more people are pushing into a market that is already overburdened in many major cities.
They compete with low-income citizens for the last affordable apartments.
In order to meet the demand for affordable apartments, 400,000 new units need to be built each year by 2020.
This results in a study on behalf of the Association Alliance "Social Housing".
For comparison: This year, 260,000 units will be completed in Germany.
That's why 140,000 apartments are missing.
After the first three months of their stay, refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seekers in an initial accommodation.
Many then enter the apartment market and join the long snakes in front of the rental apartments.
According to the Federal Statistical Office, however, less than half of all asylum seekers lived for rent last year.
However, the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the increasing number of refugees.
The study also sets out significant failures in the housing policy of recent years.
Germany is setting up a housing deficit which is growing from year to year.
Currently, about 770.000 housing units were missing in the conurbation areas, complains Matthias GÃ¼nther, author of the study.
Many professionals therefore lived in large cities in WG rooms.
Young adults remained in the "Hotel Mama" involuntarily because of the fleet on the apartment market.
In the major cities, the number of square meters per head has fallen for the first time in recent years.
In order to solve the problem, the "Social Housing Construction" alliance proposes a new start.
The aim is to restore new incentives to social housing.
For example, the basic tax could be waived and the basic tax on funded dwellings suspended for a limited period of time.
Furthermore, according to the Alliance, attractive tax depreciation options are necessary.
The funding programme for refugee accommodation at the Staatsbank KfW is already well received by cities and municipalities.
A good week after the start, more than half of the available around 300 million euros had already been received on Monday evening with 184 million euros.
Now the project could even be raised up.
Refugees have a free guide: Croatia and Slovenia establish a corridor
After Hungary practically no longer pass through, there are more and more refugees choosing the way through Croatia.
Zagreb announces that it will allow transit across Slovenia to the north without obstacles.
However, the route is dangerous.
Croatia wishes to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees.
"I have spoken with the Slovenian Interior Minister, and if necessary, we will organize a corridor," said the Croatian Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic.
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone.
The EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country.
After the end of the Serbian-Hungarian border, hundreds of refugees broke into Croatia to get from there to Western Europe.
500 people had come across the border with Tovarnik, reports the Croatian TV station RTL.
Hungary had locked its limit on refugees the day before.
New laws, which entered into force on the same day, make this ordinary asylum procedure virtually unnecessary in Hungary.
Croatia wants the refugees to happen.
The Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic said, "You can go through and we're preparing for this opportunity."
These people are there, they are women, children and men who want to live and achieve something.
However, it was people who did not want to live in Croatia.
The Croatian police in the morning had taken up the first refugees on Serbia's border to the EU's neighbouring Croatia.
Most media reports have come from Syria, Iran and Afghanistan.
They came both by bus and by taxi to the Serbian border town of Sid.
Immediately after their arrival, they would have tried to reach Croatia on foot across the green border.
On the Croatian-Serbian border, refugees do not encounter border fences.
For this, the border lines present other dangers: there are sharp mines from the Yugoslav Civil War in the 1990s.
Miners should now quickly create a safe passage.
In Hungary, however, there are hardly any more refugees after the border is closed.
On Tuesday, the police counted 366 intrusions.
Shortly before the closing of the gate on Monday, it had been 9380.
The new Hungarian laws class the overcoming and damaging of the border fence as a crime.
35 criminal proceedings were therefore initiated in the southern Hungarian border town of Szeged.
The defendants are threatened with imprisonment for up to five years and the deportation from the country.
According to the Immigration Authority, a total of 94 asylum applications were received on Tuesday in the new border "transitzons", almost all of them - 93 - the most important transition of RÃ¶szke.
Among the applicants were 13 families with small children as well as two older people.
On Wednesday morning 40 refugees would have stayed there.
In practice, however, no one has any chance of receiving asylum in Hungary.
In Hungarian opinion, Serbia is a "safe third country".
The rejected asylum seekers are to be shifted there.
Only a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the transit zone in RÃ¶szke.
In RÃ¶szke, workers began to clean up.
They collected the trash that tens of thousands of people had left on the roadside in recent weeks.
Lock gratings were mined and one of the shooting camps in the border area was rebuilt.
No one wanted to speak out to the end of this conversion.
After the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary, Austria achieves only a few refugees.
The country has also strengthened its border controls.
However, about 20,000 migrants were still in the country, according to government specifications.
In Salzburg about 1400 people await the journey to Germany.
The train traffic from there to Germany was stopped on the morning at the direction of German authorities.
In Freilassing, smaller groups of refugees met regularly on foot.
Mayor drove "sanded" across the border
"After the party of the bridge on Sunday we were busy cleaning up when ten people suddenly were at the entrance of the tent," said Wernstein's mayor Alois Stadler.
Tourists, they wanted to take a train to Passau.
But because of the flow of refugees on Sunday, Germany had a surprising stop in rail traffic with Austria, it ended in Wernstein," said Stadler, who immediately offered his help and drove the stranded ones together with two other helpers and their cars across the border to the near Passau.
Previously, we first picked up the unexpected guests, with jause and drinks.
We said we'd take her by car to Passau.
"This was natural for us," said Stadler at the OÃ–N meeting.
They were very grateful.
A man was not allowed to pass a generous donation - 100 euros for the fire brigade.
"We enjoyed this very much," says Stadler.
The stranded train passengers had gone from ICE to a regional train to Passau on Sunday evening in Wels, in order to try over the border after the short-term announcement that the railways were stopped to Germany.
However, the regional train was placed in front of the border in Wernstein at the Inn.
In Wernstein the cross-border is generally high in the course.
The bridge festival associated with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday, a two-bridge run sporty earlier days - organized by the Union Wernstein and Bavaria from Neukirchen.
The fact that Viktor OrbÃ¡n sends us another Zig thousands is a logical result of a hypocritical policy:
Instead of helping in the RÃ¶szke camp immediately to build structures that ensure humanity, our Federal Chancellor has put the Hungarian government's position in the dark circle of National Socialism.
It is not only those Austrians who are now confronted with chaotic conditions in the border areas that are suffering from this policy.
The refugees will also have to note that the "promised land" she has invited and welcomed is nothing but another refugee camp.
In view of the continuing flow of refugees and the approaching winter, it will be a major challenge to make for us humane conditions for those seeking protection.
And it will be an even greater one - to maintain peace, security and stability in Austria.
Conrad looking for 35.000 winter festivals quarters
Konrad has all his hands to do with the refugee accommodation.
Christian Konrad is used to having his word weight.
The government has used the former powerful Raiffeisen banker to set up quarters for the thousands of refugees.
The chaos in the first recording center of Traiskirchen has already been handled by Conrad.
"We no longer have homeless people in Traiskirchen," he reported of his first success.
The housing of 20,000 refugees who had come to Austria on Monday was also done without a big vortex, said Konrad and praised the organizational "master performance".
The Ministry of the Interior, on the other hand, spoke of a "crisis-like situation".
In total, Conrad expects 85,000 quarters in this year.
In order to meet the number, there are still 35,000 accommodations to be found in the coming weeks - 20,000 are to be provided to the countries, 15,000 of the Federation.
Should it become more refugees, we can do it.
"But it's not a barrel without a floor," said Konrad.
He has already held talks with the national captains.
They would have assured him that they would also create quarters for the coming refugees.
"In Upper Austria, things are going well," said Ferry Maier.
The former VP-Mandatar supports Konrad.
Tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph SchÃ¶nborn, in order to clarify how the Church will help.
The asylum coordinator also places great expectations on the ORF action "Help as we".
On the platform, private individuals can offer accommodation easily.
In addition, one hopes for hotels that are empty in winter.
Konrad and Maier criticised the standards for housing yesterday as "very high".
In times of emergency, it could not be that quarterers must maintain a certain height of the towel holders or the height of the overhead lights.
For a limited period of time, "not standards" should apply.
The fact that he is more successful in housing than the Ministry of Interior explains Konrad with his experience.
I am an older man, whom one does not say the untruth in the face.
Belief is his most important weapon.
Konrad and Maier do not charge the Republic as they themselves declared.
They want to increase their number of employees to three to four.
Its own quarter search has not yet been successful.
Konrad wanted to set up a container at Stephansplatz as an office.
But it seems that there are problems with the approval.
Linz calls for a better division
For now no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as Tips-Arena and Design Center for the accommodation of refugees is planning the city of Linz.
This is not necessary at the moment, as one can currently accommodate those affected without these measures, says Mayor Klaus Luger (SP).
For the emergency, however, additional sites are to be checked for their adaptability.
The head of the city is criticised by the division of refugees within the federal state.
Other districts too must make their contribution here.
Seehofer: "The limits are not locked"
In a longer telephone call with the Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU), Lands Hauptmann Josef PÃ¼hringer (VP) approved the further approach to the refugee issue on Monday.
Seehofer assured me that the German borders would not be locked down.
The journey of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany was still possible.
However, there are now the corresponding border controls.
Special trains with refugees to Germany will not be available for the first time.
However, those seeking protection would be brought to Germany by regular trains.
For the other EU Member States,Ã¼Ã¼hringer once again called for greater solidarity in the refugee issue.
For PÃ¼hringer, the fact that Austria is now reintroducing controls at its borders is "a logical consequence" from the German approach.
The next Runtastic is a matter of time
The general renovation of the "Neuen Werft" in the Linz industrial line is officially completed.
In four of the six floors of the office and production building, the listed S&T IT group has moved in, the rest (2700 square meters) is to be rented to young, innovative companies from the technology sector.
"In IT, the smart heads are our raw material - and we have to try to work for us," says S&T CEO Hannes Niederhauser.
He could imagine investing in startup companies of the New Shipyard and later acquire some.
From the beginning, S&T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - of which Niederhauser promises a lot: "The next Runtastic is just a matter of time".
1.7 million euros were invested by S&T in the site, 3.3 million euros from the Techcenter, each one third of the city of Linz, the country of Upper Austria and the federal government (FFG).
The building is leased from Linz AG for 60 years to S&T and Techcenter.
30 percent of the 2,700 square meters of remaining space in the building are already rented, for another 40 percent there are requests.
Lia-Peroni importer opened second business in the arcade
The new shop focuses on Furla handbags.
Actually, Jutta Breit wanted to raise a dog.
This project had to delay the 49-year-old owner of Lia Peroni in the pigeon market arcades: After all, she has now grown in the form of another business venue.
In the Furla-Shop opposite the store where they sell bags, suitcases, shoes and clothing of various manufacturers, everything is now about the women's handbags of the Furla brand, wallets are from 75 euros.
Bigger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros.
The new shop has been in operation since yesterday.
Previously, several weeks had been rebuilt.
"But I've been thinking for a long time about whether to open another store," Breit says.
The crucial factor for the decision was, among other things, that the Furla producers, who are at home in Bologna, were also engaged in the idea of their own location where only their handbags were sold.
"We are the only ones in the large Linz area who sell this brand," says the mother of two daughters who have even Italian roots.
Her fashion interest has got Breit out of her mother's cradle.
I do most when something develops and I can show new trends at leading prices.
Why so many women fall into oblivion when looking at a beautiful handbag, the woman also cannot answer with the last certainty.
Maybe it's because a nice bag of every outfit is up to date.
The Brulljesmacher from Kallstadt
The PÃ¤lzer ancestors of Donald Trump came from a place, whose inhabitants are called the originator.
This property also connects some to the billionaire who wants to become US president.
Donald Trump (69) is always good for excitement.
Whether he's being hostile to the outside, dealing with journalists, or revealing knowledge gaps in international crisis policy, the candidate for the US President's Office is making a strong start in the campaign.
And cut off well.
This is also recorded in the Palatinate Kallstadt, where the grandparents of the real estate milliardary come from.
The New Yorker with the hair freeze is a term for many in the wine village on the WeinstraÃŸe.
Some people in the 1200-inhabitant place are over -seven corners related to it.
His grandfather came from Kallstadt in the Palatinate: Donald Trump, here in campaign mode.
The caller Simone Wendel shot a film about Trump.
And what do the villagers think about his goal to become the most powerful man in the world?
"I think they find this kind of exciting, but they're not so deeply impressed in their call city style," says Simone Wendel.
The native Kalllstadter has filmed an amusing documentary about the place and its famous SprÃ¶sslings, among which the Ketchup family Heinz also counts.
Trump, who is not known for modesty, also speaks in "Kings of Kallstadt" (2014) - so saying that he would surely be successful if he lived in Kallstadt.
To the King of Hearts he did not bring it there.
Although there is respect for the performance of the family, but also tends to think that Trump is "a bit of a grandma," says Wendel.
Randomly, the nickname that Kallstadt has in the circle, "Die Brulljesmacher" - to Hochdeutsch: die Angeber, she says.
Trump comes from the village of the contractors.
The Trump's success story began in 1885 when the later grandfather emigrated and opened a site for gold tombs in the United States.
The foundation stone of the real estate group were first land purchases in New York.
But the life of the grandparents was not free from tragedy: their desire to return to their homeland on a permanent basis failed in the Bavarian state, to which the Pfalz belonged at that time.
He did not record Trump because he had once been cut off without permission, the director of the Institute of Palatinate History and Folk History, Roland Paul, had declared the film start.
Trump is the grandson of an "illegal immigrant".
This is in contrast to the sometimes marked statements of the offspring.
He had repeatedly spoken about Mexican immigrants in the US and called for the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants.
"The same as the polder is not so sympathetic," says Hans-Joachim Bender, a distant relative Trumps ("The Grandma was a born Trump, the grandfather was born Heinz").
The winner in retirement looks more distant to the American, "he's always so excited."
Does he think Trump's coming?
"I can't imagine that," says the 72-year-old.
"He never took care of Kallstadt."
The pensioner Veronika Schramm mentions, like some Kallstadter, that a descendant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ during a visit, which was generally good.
"I can't imagine this from Donald," says the 68-year-old.
She found it better if he did not wish the election, because "he has such radical views, I don't know if it's good."
If those who had been telling the story at the time of his grandfather in the United States would have been like him, "if he had never arrived there."
"There are more interesting topics than him," says Winzerdichter Sarah BÃ¼hler.
And as president?
"My president is not," she says.
And: "The grapes are also riped without the president Trump".
Wendels Film, for which Trump was interviewed for a long time, has seen 12 000 cinematists, including in the USA, awakening interest.
The Upper Bavarian municipality of Ramsau near Berchtesgaden is Germany's first "mountain" village.
The 1800-inhabited village in the Berchtesgaden National Park was awarded the award for gentle tourism from the hands of the Vice-President at the Deutsche Alpenverein, Ludwig Wucherpfnig.
In Austria there are already 20 "mountain villages".
In the neighbouring country, the Alpenverein is responsible for awarding the award.
A "mountain village" may have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants.
At least one-fifth of its area shall be designated as a protected zone.
Seven's Sunrise dominates the reviews, despite Nine's attempts to take over the loss of leadership at the Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson rush to Canberra to report the loss of the liberal leadership, but there have been no major shifts in the reviews for today.
Nine's breakfast show was broadcast by the state capital when Malcolm Turnbull made Tony Abbott's fall.
The rival Sunrise, with the moderators David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was part of a one-week series of international television programmes including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This disadvantage of the distance seemed to play no role for Australian TV viewers, as Sunrise scored an average of 397,000 viewers in the five capitals, compared to today 339.000.
Today, there was a slight increase over the ratings for Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but his number was below that of last Thursday (34,000).
Today has closed the gap with Sunrise in recent months.
Today averaged 318,000 compared to the 330,000 of Sunrise in August.
At the beginning of the year, the distance was between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far in September, Sunrise stands at an average of 349.000 viewers at 314,000 at today.
This is the most interesting thing that happens every morning.
The winds of change concern these mornings more than Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thanks for the review!
Written by TODAY on Monday, 14 September 2015
The great novelty for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former series star from Packed to the Rafters Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a recently widowed father who decided to settle with his two children on the coast of New Zealand reached a very impressive number of 1,219 million spectators.
Critics wondered if Thomson could wear a hit show solo without the Rafters Star Rebecca Gibney.
The result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear "yes".
The X-Factor of Seven remained strong with 1,136 million viewers and beat easily The Block (838,000) and TBL families (726,000).
Seven had mixed results on evening two of The Chase Australia.
The first half hour (17:00 to 5.30 p.m.) of the new Quiz show, moderated by Andrew O'Keefe, averaged 446,000 spectators.
The second half hour (17:30 am to 6:00 pm) jumped to 623,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuire's hot-seat (613.000).
On Monday evening, the first half hour of The Chase Australia was 520,000 spectators, and in the second half hour there were 700,000.
Hot-seat average 620,000.
The decline in the second night of The Chase Australia will not be confident that Hot-Seat will finally prevail at 17:30.
The Chase Australia is a million-dollar replacement that didn't manage to overwhelm the McGuires show.

The last three agree: Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose?
Revealed Secret? ...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may not know who won The Bachelor.
The woman, who finally landed at Sam Wood in The Bachelor, was covered in the greatest secrecy.
And no of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who received the last rose.
But when we checked in with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows on the day before three of the two, you may have accidentally indicated who the winner will be.
Sam Wood keeps his lips sealed until the finale on Thursday
All three women were lyrical about why Wood is the perfect man, calling his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positive attitude as reasons why she wanted to be his partner.
However, when the question is asked, "If you don't, who should get Wood's last rose?", their answers to the game corruption could be who won the Bachelor's heart.
Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski both quickly - except themselves - called Mackay as the best partner for Wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from the first day on.
"From the moment I went into the house and (Sarahs) and Sam's energies noticed, I felt that they were pretty compatible, and I thought this throughout the show," said Jeavons Fellows.
"Sarah stands on earth with both feet, it's so fun to be with her," Markoski added.
I saw them together, and they have the right chemistry.
They feel comfortable and comfortable with each other.
Sarah Mackay believes that they and Sam Wood as a couple would be well suited.
From her point of view, Mackay said that last week the house visit made it clear to her that Wood could be "the One".
"As soon as I saw him with my friends and the family, it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I am now set on him without reserve," she said.
And when she was asked who to choose Wood, if not her, she was puzzling.
"I don't know if I can say that," she said.
I love the remaining girls equally - it's a difference between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor will be broadcast on Wednesday, 19:30, on Ten.

Jarryd Hayne had several options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after his move to the United States - and there were many other teams who sent requests after his impressive open training day at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula and it looks like a smart decision.
Some trainers would have banished Hayne for the rest of the game to the bank when he lost a range as it did the Aussie-Rugby-Liga conversion at his first point return on Tuesday at the 20-3 victory against Minnesota.
But Tomsula trusted his husband and gave Hayne the next opportunity to return to a point and also to the ongoing game after a violation of Reggie Bush.
Tomsula continued to show his true face in the changing cabin after the game.
Instead of grinding his skirts in front of the rest of the team through the mill, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly strengthened Hayne in his press conference after the game.
The 49s sports reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by specialist team coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget his missed catch and take care of the next game.
Jarryd Hayne beats at a point that was restored in the first quarter of the Minnesota Vikings
It was certainly not the start that Hayne and his massive Australian success had hoped for his NFL debut.
Hayne left the field of play after the Fumble and later told the Australian Radio Duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 that he could not imagine a worse start in his NFL career,
"That was a thing that happens now, you just take care of the next game, and that's it," Hayne said.
Hayne compared the Schnitzer with his original debut in 2007, when a passport led to a try for Queensland in his own in-goal area.
Overall, it was a great experience for the 27-year-old.
Hayne poses for a photo with fans and holds an Australian flag after the game and posted it on his Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss the rights of the gay
Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Russia's richest man, was arrested on a Siberian rollerfield with arms force.
After he had openly challenged President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was sentenced to arrest his oil company Yukos and undermined his democratic efforts.
The free voters demand the recruitment of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high number of refugees.
At the beginning of the FW-Herbstklausur in GroÃŸwallstadt, leader Hubert Aiwanger warned of a serious crisis in Bavaria's schools if there were no new teachers for the many new students: "We need at least 1000 additional teachers to keep the schools from the collapse," said Aiwanger.
"In the end, we will get faults in the Bavarian education system."
The country group of free voters is meeting in the underground community until Friday.
In fact, very different main topics were planned.
But the record number of refugees now dominates the Free Election Meeting.
"Of course, the issue of asylum will be overburdened," said Aiwanger.
Aiwanger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria, as they did during the Yugoslavia war in the 1990s.
"That's not how it goes, we have to get to the causes," said the Free Voter Chief.
Rejected asylum seekers want to postpone voters as soon as possible.
Therefore, Aiwanger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum charges: "We also need at least 50 new asylum judges," said Aiwanger.
The FW boss criticised that several federal states were not consistent: "We need uniform standards of the federal states across Germany."
"Beyern's moving off, others aren't."
"That's where we have to become more effective."
However, national policy in Greater Wallstadt should not fall under the table.
A long-standing burner remains on the agenda: education policy.
For the new school year, Minister of Culture Ludwig Spaenle (CSU) started the pilot experiment "Middle level plus" at 47 Gymnasia, during which an extension of the secondary gymnastic level is tested from three to four years - as a result it will take nine years to the Abitur.
But Aiwanger doesn't do that far enough.
"The issue of G9 needs to be accelerated," said the FW chief.
We demand freedom of choice for all gymnasies who want it.
Free ride at the G9 wherever it is desired.
Stronger Wall Street helps Dax jump
The German stock market has closed profit after a long journey of directionless and nervous trade.
It was only in the afternoon that a firmer start of the US buses provided a clear direction, which ultimately carried the Dax by 0.56 percent to 10 188.13 points upwards.
The MDax medium values gained 0.54 percent on 19 552.88 points.

Solid profits also recorded trading places in London and Paris.
In the US, the Dow Jones index last recorded around 1 percent in the plus.
Many borsians expect the markets to be on the spot until after the interest rate decision in the US and also for the big decline in the term exchanges on this Friday.
In the meantime, the discussion about the loads from the nuclear exit has pushed the shares of RWE to a record depth and also left deep traces at Eon.
According to "playing" the German energy companies may lack 30 billion euros of provisions.
The Federal Government demented the figures mentioned in the press.
The shares of the two largest German energy companies subsequently recovered something, but ultimately always lost 3.31 percent (RWE) and 6.15 percent (Eon).
Infineon shares increased by a further 3.22 percent in the Dax peak.
According to a dealer, a positive report from the U.S. investor magazine "Barron's" appeared from the weekend.
According to this, investors have given too little attention to the German chip builder at present.
Investments in forward-looking wafer technologies and the focus on the car market should be paid out.
Car values were asked: Even in the traditionally weak summer month of August, more cars were dropped again than in the previous year, as the industry association Acea reported on the launch of the IAA International Motor Show in Frankfurt.
The papers of Autobauer Daimler and BMW increased by 1.34 percent and 2.21 percent respectively.
Volkswagen benefits increased by 1.26 percent.
On the German pension market, the circulation return on listed federal securities fell to 0.48 (Friday: 0.50) percent.
Rex's pension index rose 0.12 percent to 139.55 points.
The Bund-Future lost 0.71 percent to 154,11 points.
The course of the euro sank in the afternoon to last $1262.
By noon the European Central Bank had set the reference rate at 1.1305 (1.1268) US dollars.
The dollar thus cost 0.8846 (0.8875) euros.
4 people killed after police shoot rubber shots at demonstrators in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police shots shot rubber into a crowd who protested against the proposed new constitution, said an official on Wednesday.
The violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the district of Rupandehi, about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhaka, Senior District Officer, said that more than 1,000 demonstrators had gathered outside a police station, with some of you throwing stones and fire bombs.
Mr. Dhaka said the police used tear gas and then shot it in the air before she took back on rubber shots.
20 police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why the rubber shots used, known that they can kill, but which are traditionally used as a less deadly alternative, apparently produced such a high death rate.
The dispute was the last week of violent protests in Nepal's southern plains, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say that new provinces formed under the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence.
There were also protests in western Nepal from the ethnic group of the Tharus who want their own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been in violent conflict since the 10th century.
August killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which has been centrally ruled for centuries.
The work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008, but the legislators accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
The legislators voted this week on certain clauses in the Constitutional Draft in Kathmandu, and officials have said that the new Constitution could enter into force on Sunday.
Building area planned in the city
The property at the Emder Jugendzentrum Alte Post is to be rebuilt.
The city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 square meters.
Planed is a mix of trade, trade and housing - concrete offers are not yet available.
Emden - The city of Emden wants to market a plot of approximately 4,000 square meters in direct proximity to the Youth Centre Alte Post.
Preparations for this are underway.
It is planned to use the site for a mix of trade, trade and housing.
They are waiting for appropriate offers, it is said by the city.
What investor is in question is not yet clear.
In this respect, no contracts had yet been concluded.
The city of Emden had already bought part of the property, which is located on the RingstraÃŸe/Ecke GroÃŸe StraÃŸe, a few months ago and had the building on it broken down.
Project Heaven: Details are on the table
Planning for the holiday home settlement at the Kleine Meer near Emden takes shape.
The investor presented plans for the project for the first time.
A number of individuals are still worried - they fear the sale of their leisure leave
For months behind closed doors had been negotiated, grumbled, debated and drawn.
Now the plans for a new holiday home settlement at the Kleine Meer near Emden are on the table.
The interested party, the medium-sized Emder company "System-Bau", presented its plans publicly for the first time on Monday evening in the city development committee of the Emder Council.
This point was originally placed on the non-public part of the agenda.
Under the pressure of the project critics and the FDP Group, who proposed to the investor and the administration of secret-carriage, Ralf Behrends went from the system-building management to the offensive: "We don't have an answer to all questions yet," he said before the council members and more than 50 visitors.
But it's good to be able to meet all the rumors now.
The approximately 10 to 12 million euros project has been under discussion for months.
The pictures and new details of the hotel's desired construction brought out many reactions among seamen who had come to the meeting.
Roberto Schulz, a member of the Board of Directors in the interest of the Anlieger, Pro Hive, complains: "This will be a giant clot that surpasses all other buildings".
He also fears, like many other project critics, that traffic would increase greatly by the intended size of the plant: "There must be a whole bus load, so that it will be calculated," Schulz said.
What happens exactly on the well a hectare area of the former restaurant, however, is still open.
There's no operator yet.
"First, we must have a coherent concept," said Ralf Behrends.
Because this was still lacking, the building plans were also variable.
Twin studies at Gorillas in the Frankfurt Zoo
The Frankfurt Zoo is happy about young people with its gorillas.
The 26-year-old Dian brought twins to life yesterday.
Twin births are rare at Gorillas.
The last one in a German zoo is almost 50 years ago and was also in Frankfurt in 1967, it says of the zoo.
The sex of the newborn Gorilla twins is not yet fixed, as Mother Dian holds them closely on the body.
First the "image" had reported.
NHC predicts 60 percent chance for cyclone south of Cape Verde Islands
On Tuesday, the US National Hurricane Center predicted a wide low pressure system of about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southernmost Cape Verde Islands, which has a 60 percent chance of developing into a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours.
Another clearly defined low-pressure system, for example in the middle between the Cape Verde Islands and the Small Antilles, also has a 60 percent potential to form a tropical cyclone in the next two days, added the weather experts stationed in Miami.
Google starts doubling donation campaign to collect $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL. O) announced a doubling donation campaign that aims to raise $11 million for humanitarian organisations to help thousands of refugees who have overrun the European nations, as they flee from war torn and impoverished countries.
Google has an unusually personal approach to the announcement of the donation call on its blog.
Instead of having a manager make the announcement, Rita Masoud, a Google employee who fled Kabul with her family when she was seven years old, wrote about her personal experience.
"Our trip included many dark railway and bus rides, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and fear," she wrote.
I was lucky.
But since the refugee and migrant crisis has grown in Europe, many people like my family are desperately looking for help.
The donations will be made to four non-profit organisations providing help to refugees and migrants: doctors without borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said that the first globally collected donations are doubled to a value of 5.5 million on google.com/refugeerelief to $11 million.
Europe has been confronted with its worst refugee crisis since World War II, largely caused by the four-year civil war in Syria, which has driven out more than 4 million people this year.
Many also fled from Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq, and Libya, torn out of war.

Weight loss surgery can be helpful for slightly overweight diabetics.
The benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes may take at least five years after a new study.
It is still too early to say whether slightly overweight people with diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those who receive non-surgical treatments.
"The mortality data takes a long time to show something," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert on weight loss surgery, who wrote a editorial on the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight loss operations or adipositas surgery, use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the body's own ability to absorb food.
Over the years, adipositas operations have proven to be efficient in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most studies have been conducted in people who are malignantly obese with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a measure of weight in terms of size, is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight, and people with a BMI over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers from Taiwan's Min-Sheng General Hospital used data they have collected in a study since 2007, comparing two types of adipositas surgery - gastric bypass and gastric tube formation - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight.
The average BMI among those undergoing this operation fell from 31 to 24.5 to the end of the fifth year in this study.
Meanwhile, the BMI remained with those who received non-surgical diabetes approximately equal to 29.
Among those undergoing surgery, 36% total diabetes disease and 28% partially resolved.
In the medically-treated group, diabetes completely resolved only at one percent and partly at only about two percent.
In addition, the results in the controls of blood pressure, triglycerides and the "bad" LDL cholesterol were "generally better in the 'surgical' group", the authors found out.
The researchers also monitored the patient blood levels of hemoglobin A1c, which reflects the blood sugar levels over time.
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent, the researchers write.
After surgery, the average haemoglobin A1c level dropped from around 9 percent to around 6 percent.
However, in the medical therapy group it remained stable at about 8 percent.
But this better "glycaemic control" - as you reflect in the improved haemoglobin A1c level - did not reduce mortality in five years, according to leading researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared average results in the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, the Bypass-Chirgy Group had lost more weight compared to the gas trektomy group (18.7 vs. 14.2 kg), increased in the BMI (7.4 vs. 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1% vs. 2.1 %) and reported a more complete overcome of diabetes (46.9% vs. 16.7%).
While the new study does not show the survival benefit of surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life, says Blackstone of the University of Arizona, College of Medicine Phoenix.
In the Swedish study it was about 29 percent less likely to die over the course of 15 years in obese people who were subjected to an adipositas operation - compared to a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study showed no benefit for the survival of the surgery patients, Blackstone said it was soothing for people with a BMI below 35 who are interested in the procedure.
"This is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BMI group", without an increased risk of death or kidney disease, she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as the patient is between 27 and 30 with his BMI.
"I think we're waiting too long to get people to take this seriously," she said.
I think once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have tied their bodies to obesity and diabetes, a reverse is really hard."
Love story plays in HunsrÃ¼ck
It is a topic that is currently increasingly taking note of Belletristik: A young woman, unpopular and insanity at school, meets her youth after years, and she falls in love with her.
So also in the recently published novel "In fact we are not so" by Luisa Binder.
Beyond the history of love, the novel may be interesting for HunsrÃ¼cker readers, because it plays in Langweiler and the surrounding villages.
The main professional author grew up in Langweiler and is pleased that she was able to set a literary monument to her home.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT-News
Europe could not take up all refugees, said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East lies.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to violence in the refugee countries.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of its ten-day visit to the United Kingdom at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which is dedicated to ethics studies.
He demanded that under the circumstances the interests of humanity be put before the interests of the individual nations or even continents.
He also stressed that the Western European countries' response to the refugee crisis was admirable, but the situation was not appropriate.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria's efforts to cope with the crisis, he stressed that it was just a temporary solution.
"To care for several thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime, you need to think about long-term solutions, such as real peace and real development, mainly through education, for these Muslim countries," he stressed.
Finally, we need to think about how killing is reduced in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of violence.
"The use of violence has never solved these problems," he added.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of violence and also commented on George Bush's action after the terrorist attack of 11 September and pointed out that the US violent reaction drew a chain of uncontrollable events.
After September 11th, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush, and I told him that the way to solving this problem lies in nonviolence.
"I know his motives were good, but he used violence, and that caused unexpected consequences," said the Dalai Lama.
quadruple increase in the use of hand disinfectants by children in the last 4 years
The Georgia Poison Center says that toxic control centers in the USA report an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under the age of 12 who swallow highly alcoholic hand disinfectants.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Center, cases of hand disinfectant revenues in children under 12 years of age reported as toxic control centres rose from 3.266 in 2010 to 16.117 in 2014.
"Children get to these products more and more often, and unfortunately a percentage of them land in the emergency reception," said Lopez CNN.
He said that some children are deliberately drinking disinfectants, while some are doing it to impress their friends or because of a mouse sample in the social media.
Videos on YouTube show how adolescents drink disinfectants only because of cheap experience.
Young people are said to have mixed disinfectants with alcoholic mouthwater in order to obtain a harder drink.
Young children can be attracted by attractive scents of disinfectants.
"A child doesn't think this is bad for it," said Lopez.
Many of the more attractive (hand disinfectants) are those that are perfumed.
There are disinfectants with strawberry, grape and orange fragrance, which are very appealing for children.
Hand disinfectants contain between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
Especially in infants, a few syringes can lead to alcohol poisoning.
"It's highly concentrated alcohol," said Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the Gift Call Center at Kansas University Hospital, Fox 4 in Kansa City.
So, you wouldn't let sluggish whisky stand around, but people leave these hand disinfectants at the reach of children, and when children get there, it's a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six - year - old girl who had recently taken four syringes of hand disinfectant after strawberry, was brought to an emergency treatment.
Her blood alcohol concentration was 179, twice as high as the threshold that is considered to be drunk in an adult, said Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency doctor who treated her at the Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah heard her words and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency room.
Physicians monitored them overnight in a separate children's hospital for signs of brain trauma, as the girl had fallen by alcohol and had hit her head, said Ritchey.
"That was very frightening," said Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother, CNN.
It could have been deadly to my child.
Lopez has advised parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic products or disinfection cloths and to store hand disinfectants outside the child's reach.
Beyond alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants were related to deaths.
In 2013, two women died in Ontario after swallowing hand disinfectants containing a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
Health authorities personnel suspect that the product contained Methanol, a fatal solution rather than ethyl alcohol, which was listed as an active substance.
In January, three fourth-class students in New York State planned to poison their "common" teacher by explaining antibacterial products around the classroom," reports a police report.
The teacher is highly allergic to hand disinfectant and expelled her from her room.
The police considered the banished plan to be "swatz" and referred disciplinary measures to the school authority.
Villingen-Schwenningen: Three vehicles damaged
A 33-year-old driver was easily injured in the event of a drive-by accident on the crossroads between Nordring and Auf Herdenen.
A 60-year-old truck driver drove on the crossroads towards the circular industrial area and realized too late that two leading vehicles had stopped on the circuit.
As a result, he plowed his truck into the rear of an Audi and pushed that vehicle onto a Ford Fiesta ahead of it.
In the vehicles involved in the accident, material damage of approximately 10,000 euros was reported by the police.
The 33-year-oldâ€™s Audi was no longer ready and had to be dragged off.
Rumoured kitchen: No disharmony at Celtic
Griffiths plays down the talk of Disharmonie at Celtic Glasgow, Deila admits that the hoops are in a bad place, but that he will turn it over again.
Hearts will fight SFA for the charge of Neilson and Warburton will be cautious in January-new commitments that could destroy the unity of the cadre
Increase Don's Guide to Celtic on Five Points
ADAM Rooneys Elfmeter in the first half of the year Aberdeen gave a short victory over Hamilton in Pittodrie, so that the dons create a five-point leak between themselves and Celtic.
Griffiths Plays Talk About Disharmony Down
There are rumours about disharmony at Celtic Glasgow, which Griffiths spontaneously rejected. He insisted that he and his teammates are not under increased control as they prepare for confrontation with the Dutch table leader.
I don't think we feel pressured, I think the players are looking forward to it.
The lack of title competition in Scottish football is boring in Dutch - de Boer
The former Rangers midfielder and former national player of the Netherlands Ronald de Boer has said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic, as there is no title rivality with the Rangers.
De Boer, currently a ambassador for Ajax, said: "In Holland they show no highlights of Celtic games anymore and why?"
It's because the Rangers aren't there.
People here don't just talk about the rangers' return.
They're talking about the Old Firm.
They talk about both teams together, and that's what they're interested in.
There is a lot of tension in the old company games, and it's not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games.
I'm gonna turn things around, Deila swear.
RONNY Deila has accepted that Celtic must fight, but the Norwegian boss has sworn to turn things around.
After the defeat against MalmÃ¶ and the subsequent retirement from the Champions League, the defeat against 10 men from Aberdeen followed, who are now at the top of the table with five points of advantage.
Deila said, "Celtic had bad times before, and we'll be back."
Now we want to get out of that as soon as possible.
I know it's very frustrating and a lot of people are very, very angry or sad about what's happening.
We feel that way - but we have to keep going.
We really need the support of Celtic because that makes players better.
It's so important to be together now.
Warburton careful at January-Transfers
Despite his comments just a few weeks ago, which indicated that he was targeting some January transfers, Rangers-Boss Mark Warburton is careful when signing new ones and insists that he does not want to interfere with the unity of the Ibrox Framework.
The ex-chaf of Brentford said, "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window."
The players who come in the summer have this pre-season time to integrate what you have seen with our own group this season.
The team is really good.
Sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need.
Celtic target person Michu with withdrawal notice
Swansea-stÃ¼rmer Michu, with Celtic in conversation during the transfer period, suggested that he could withdraw if his contract with the Swans ended.
The 29-year-old has been plagued with a annoying ankle for two years and has not managed to finish from Wales this summer.
Hearts on SFA Battle because of Neilson's comments set
The Hearts led 2:1, when Fathersson was sent by the field and then lost 3:2, but the Red Map of the Defender was later lifted - the third Red Card of Collum, which was revoked in eight months.
Neilson remains with what he said and insists: "I did not question integrity, I did not comment on performance."
Griffiths swears to avoid Tynecastle
The incorrigible Hibee was reproved after admitting to have sung a song with offensive lyrics about ex-hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident occurred in a pub in the Roseburn area of Edinburgh in front of a Edinburgh Derby in Tynecastle in March 2014.
"It was a derby, and it was the heat of the moment," said the striker, adding: "It's safe to say that I don't return to Tynecastle if it doesn't play for Celtic Glasgow."
Tannadice Supervisory Board has confidence in Dundee United Management
Simon Donnelly insists that Dundee United's board still has confidence in the management team to turn things - but that the downfall on the field must end.
I think Stephen Thompson has confidence in us.
We'll bring the guys back to Trab," said Donnelly.
McInnes is glad to "winn unbeautifully" against Hamilton.
Derek McInnes admits that his team from Aberdeen had to struggle desperately against Hamilton Accies in order to see a seventh consecutive league victory that gave them a lead of five points ahead of Celtic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Rooney's Elfmeter in the first half-time.
McInnes said, "There's no team that won everything, in cup games or leagues, that hasn't even won the games of this kind."
Unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged as it rises in the United Kingdom as a whole.
Unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 164,000 between May and July, while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom as a whole increased by 10,000 to 1.82 million over the same period.
Scotland's unemployment rate of 5.9 percent was above that of the UK of 5.5 percent, as shown by the figures of the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
In the meantime, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 during the three months, with the number of employees now at 2,612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland fell to 74.0 per cent during the quarter - a figure above the UK average of 73.5 per cent.
Commenting on the latest figures, the Secretary of State for Scotland David Mundell said: "The government's long-term plan has laid the foundation for a stronger economy."
It is almost exactly a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment.
Drunk persons disturbed the process
The security staff could not provide the situation, so the police called the police.
Only with the use of pepper spray could the officials put the troubles in custody.
A respiratory alcohol test was performed in a 16-year-old 0.89 promille.
The adult was picked up by his mother.
A 28-year-old had 2.15 promills and remained in custody at first.
Why I'm going to witness an execution in Oklahoma
A little later today, except for a late legal intervention, I am going to watch a man be put to death.
When it happens, and I hope it doesn't happen, I will sit in a viewer gallery in the Death Chamber in Oklahoma State Penitentiary when Richard Glossip is executed by the poison syringe.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death.
The invitation took place for the first time in January about his best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day approached, I began to fear.
So, why should I do it?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty.
It would offer a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to see executions in the US, and since there are often more applications available than places, a masculine lottery takes place to decide who is elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media places from 12 to five.
Whoever is selected will observe it emotionally.
I can't do this.
I will sit next to Richard Glossip's closest friend, with whom I developed my own relationship with telephone calls and a two and a half hours visit.
I like the guy.
We often laugh a lot when we talk.
The prison authorities say I can't be a witness and a journalist, so I won't be allowed to take a notebook and a pen to record what I see.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of giving up my impartiality.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the story of the prisoner as he wants it, and you get access.
I beg her.
She admitted that she "could have formulated it better," but she still thinks it's wrong what I'm doing.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what I have to write, and I wouldn't do it even if he did.
I told him he could remove me from his list of witnesses at any time.
But he wants an international reporter to be present to write there.
When he dies, he thinks that public relations will help the movement against the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, a Huffington Post reporter, will sit next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, please hear the series of podcasts I have made.
I don't want to go back to all the details.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after Barry Van Treese was murdered would make him guilty of being a beneficiary of the act.
But I think there's a strong likelihood that he's not guilty of murder.
I believe there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence.
I think his execution is wrong.
And from this perspective I'll see him die.
I cannot claim to be really objective.
There will be other reporters to whom you can contact.
What you'll get from me is what it means to see a man die an unnecessary death.
Man after wet police chased to get out of the Canning River
The Canning Vale police remained dry when he persuaded the man from the Canning River.
An attempt by a man from Perth to hang the police was unsuccessful when he was in the shallow and sumptuous water just a few meters away from a police officer who was trying "to persuade him to return to the shore."
The Canning Vale police were called to a house break incident in Beckenham on Tuesday.
When they discovered the suspect, he tried to escape them towards the Canning River.
But he didn't get too far.
"He stood in the water and said 'I don't come out, come and get me," said Senior Sergeant Shandel Castledine.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec was not too excited to make his uniform wet, so he turned on a more reliable tactic - "a good police officer negotiated".
"Sometimes people do funny things to try to escape," said Senior Sergeant Castledine.
Championship football player Ben Cousins offers an unforgettable example.
In 2006 Cousins drove his car into the tombs to escape an alcohol control and then tried to swim across the Swan River.
His efforts were unsuccessful, but inspired locals to the humorous planning of a Ben Cousin Biathlon.
Peter Moody claims that Stewards tried to spy on him and threatened to end the racing
Peter Moody claims that Stewards from Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his stables last year and threatened to end the race immediately.
He aimed at the stewards and the integrity division of Racing Victoria and claimed that they carried out a personal campaign against him with Lady Tatai's Late Scratching because of a racing day treatment, the last straw on Wednesday.
Moody said Fairfax Media that he always tried to do what was best for racing and he had found himself under difficult conditions when it was about the positive cobalt tupfer test at Lidaris that he could not explain.
He had held back 18 months because of the espionage charges and did not want it to "look like too high hanging grapes."
"I thought I didn't say anything about it, and I've been sitting for a long time, but sometimes you're so frustrated that everything comes out all the time," Moody said.
You know it went on.
Sometimes you react, and you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'll go home tonight and sleep well.
I want to go around raised head, and I want my owners to think that I'm trying my best for them.
When they start thinking, I don't do that, then I shouldn't be a coach anymore.
I have to think about what I'm doing with my license.
Previously, Moody had raised the bomb in an interview with racing.com that the integrity department had tried to spy out his stable.
"Nearteen months ago Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown, and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - whom I will name when I'm asked - and offered him a job in my stables to provide information about what I'm doing within my stables," Moody said on Racing.com.
They seem to believe I'm a fraud.
If that is the case, they should certainly touch their noses because they failed to grasp me.
Robert Roulston, former chairman of the RVL, David Moodie, President-in-Office of the RVL and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of the RVL, was aware of this at the time and are still there today.
Should this lead me to believe that it will be personal?
Has the RVL been cowardly and perhaps people outside of trainers are responsible for what is going on in the industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I so bad for the industry?
Maybe people out there think it's me.
Maybe they need to take my license and violate me, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying makes them think about it now.
But I have now arrived at the point where I don't care, and that makes me sad.
That really saddens me.
I will put pressure on them and urge them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can go.
The coach's frustration levels have been built up with the long-standing cobalt investigation at Lidari, and the Late Scratching led him to say that he could "throw his license over the table."
Moody, best known by his preparation of the unspoiled master Black Caviar, called the racing day treatment rule "laugh", after a pack of mud or clay had been applied to the horse legs, which was against the rules.
"It's against the rules of racing.
I have to take full responsibility for that," he said.
"One of my employees has mistakenly applied mud to the leg.
It could have been like that last night.
It could have been like that all day yesterday, whatever it was.
It was on the race day, however.
Moody could be confronted with a three-month disqualification for treatment with the pack on the race day. An examination of this matter was opened.
It's a joke.
People who make these rules know nothing about the horse.
"We all see that we need rules, but here you have gone too far," Moody said.
Man arrested for driver's flight
The police arrested a man on the weekend after a collision with a cyclist and then a driver's flight in Cobram.
The cyclist was sent to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on Saturday morning on the Murray-Valley motorway.
The police said the driver went on without stopping to help the injured driver.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia stood up to the police in Shepparton.
It is expected to be charged for driver's flight and neglected assistance and for other traffic offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram stays in the hospital. He's in a stable state.
Melbourne-Storm Trainer Craig Bellamy beats rivals because of allegations to ring struggles
Melbourne-Storm Trainer Craig Bellamy has called criticism of the beatling of his players as "Agenda-Setting" of two Premier League favourites of the NRL.
Sydney Roosters Trainer Trent Robinson said that the referee allowed the Storm players "Ring Fights" with his team during the high Storm victory in the qualifying finale in Sydney on Friday evening.
Brisbane Bronco's coach Wayne Bennett made a little hidden note to the Storm team after his team had achieved the final victory against North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday evening. He called the game a "model example" of the Rugby League and said that the two from Queensland were not "too good" in the ring.
Bellamy defended his team's tacklimg and said that they were only focused on their "contact" in the Tackling.
Bellamy added that the critique of two leading trainers at his team supported him with confidence, as it meant that they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team.
"This appears again and again - I didn't hear Trent Robinson talking about ring fights when they beat us 24:2," said Bellamy on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we haven't changed anything in our defensive system or techniques throughout the year, but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tackles a real focus, and this has made the trend turn for us.
Trent has been there for three years now, and he obviously has a great team to train. Therefore, he is probably not accustomed to losing, so it was a bit of a shock to him.
It's funny how this shows up again and again at this time of year.
Bellamy attacked Bennett's idea of "voluntary football" and reminded his mentor that Bennett's St George Illawarra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with "durable" football.
Wayne's talking about exciting football.
He compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting her game was," said Bellamy.
I remember that in 2010 St George was criticized as a boring team, and Wayne said he'd take care of it.
But now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting, especially his young players at their speed.
This is the ball game you want to play if you have that kind of player.
He made this statement in 2010, now he wants everyone to play his kind of football â€“ not every team has two players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can play like that.
I am building more confidence because they say these things because they are a bit concerned about having to play against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think of us when it was about the Big Games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game Storm against Roosters achieved a higher result than the game Broncos against cowboys.
The game of the Broncos was probably a good game, I haven't seen it yet, but what was the result? 16 : 12 ?
Our game was 20:18, there were two more attempts in our game, but is that an exciting game?
Or are there breaks and no points something exciting?
For me, it's the schedules.
When they mention us, it means that we will meet at one stage.
The Storm team is free this weekend because they have won the right to receive either North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks on the following Saturday evening in the previous finale in the AAMI Park. Ticket sales start next Tuesday morning.
Serbier with $200,000 deposit after drug loan
A man who might threaten a life-long penalty because of his attempt to get in possession of 40 kilograms of cocaine smuggled into Queensland was released against a deposit of $200,000.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of the five men arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Solay, which came from South America over Vanuatu and settled in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was watched as he met his fellow defendants in the marina during the morning and later at the CafÃ© Coomera Roadhouse, where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota echo.
Despite a possible life-long punishment for trying to possess a commercial amount of cocaine, the lawyer of Maksimovic argued that there was no evidence that he was trying to own the whole amount and that in the cafe could have been for a harmless reason.
The judge at the Supreme Court, Peter Flanagan, was concerned about the danger of escape at Maksimovic.
He has clear relations with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he explained to the court on Wednesday.
In the criminal case, he lied to the police about his whereabouts.
Maksimovic's mother and stepfather had offered a security deposit of $200,000 to reach his release.
"After reading the affidavits of the two persons, it is clear that the issue of a security of $200,000 constitutes a real financial burden," said Judge Flanagan.
But this alone will not be enough to stop him from appearing, he warned.
Maksimovic was released against bail, under the conditions that he leaves his Australian and Serbian passport, reports to the police daily, and holds to an exit lock from 18:00 to06:00.
Accident at A5 near Karlsruhe: Guide house tears apart
In the event of a trip with three trucks on the motorway 5 near Karlsruhe, a truck driver was seriously injured on Tuesday evening.
Two of the three trucks involved had braked in front of a permanent construction site towards Basel.
The third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to move left in the last moment, as the police reported.
The driver's cab of the accident trafficker broke up completely apart.
The driver was severely injured in a hospital.
The A5 between Bruchsal and Karlsruhe-Nord was completely blocked over six hours to 2 o'clock.
There was a damage of 122,000 euros.
Stevan Hogg used phone of girls to lure pedophiles to send pictures
A paedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to request images of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone when it was asleep, signed in to an online messaging service, from which he received a series of unwise pictures from children who had been sent to him by another user.
The girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of sleeping Hogg.
She saw it through, found the confusing news and immediately alerted her mother.
The police took care of this and saw the five pictures, then analyzed computers found under the address and discovered "responsive" web searches that used terms for the search for improper pictures of children.
Hogg then claimed to the officials that he had done so because it would lead to "pedophiles on the Internet" and then "presumed to be a police officer to frighten them."
The prosecutor Eilith Robertson told the Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it was a addiction - that he was addicted to scare people.
He admitted that the searches on the computer were carried out by him, but said it had happened because he wanted to claim to be a police officer to scare pedophiles.
He was asked after his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and whom he asked to send even more photos.
He said he did it to lure her.
He said he was sick in his head when he was drinking, and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder.
Ms. Robertson added: "When the girl found the news on the phone, she called her mother and was shaking and crying.
She also saw the indecent pictures on the phone and confronted the defendant with them.
The girl was interviewed and said that the accused computer and Playstation used to talk to girls who looked much younger than he did.
Hogg, 23, Ward Road, Dundee, declared guilty, in the sense of the indictment, to have taken up inadmissible pictures of children on 14 June last year, to have violated the requirements on 25 January of this year and not to have appeared before court for a hearing on 24 March of this year.
Defenseanwalt Gregor Sim asked that Hogg not appear in the register of sexual offenders, as one could argue that "no significant sexual element" is to be found in his offense.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the verdict until October to receive background reports on social work.
Hogg was granted a security deposit in this case, but was detained for hearings on other outstanding cases.
He was added to the list of sexual offenders before the date of judgment.
Schleusers on small border crossings to Germany
More and more refugees are being taken away from the major control points on the German-Austrian border.
Many lockers caused people to increase in smaller border crossings because of fear of discovery and arrest
out on the Austrian side, said a spokesperson of the Federal Police.
More than 1000 refugees have been captured in the districts of Passau and Rottal-Inn since Tuesday.
They had reached the German side on foot over bridges and dams.
There they are received by federal police and forwarded to registration.
In comparison to the beginning of the week on Wednesday, Germany's main station station saw significantly more refugees again.
At about 700 people arrived in the capital of the country, a speaker said in the morning.
After the reintroduction of controls at the German-Austrian border, 1759 refugees had reached the city on Tuesday.
Stuttgart: Tropic Tower foothill "Henry" expected in the southwest
Meteorologists warn of stormbowees in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon.
Due to a low pressure area across Western Europe, warm sea air is currently pouring into the country, the German Weather Service (DWD) announced in Stuttgart.
The strong depth is the foothill of the tropical storm "Henry", which has been swept by the Bermuda Islands over the Atlantic in the past few days.
Hot storms and thunderstorms are expected especially in Baden.
According to DWD, the Black Forest, the Swabian Alb and the Lake Constance region can also be expected to be around 60 to 90 kilometres (60 to 90 km) until Thursday.
On Friday, therefore, the sun can be seen for a longer time.
The mass does it: Every two years, the carmakers at the IAA show their novelties.
In 2015 we have a particular movement in the compact cars, which currently sell themselves particularly well.
Cars from the compact class are currently particularly in demand: According to Kraftfahrt-Bundesamt (KBA), around 28.1 percent of new registrations were in this segment alone in August.
This is also reflected in the IAA (public days 17 to 27 September).
Many new compact models will be presented between all futuristic concept vehicles and new high-class and luxury cars this year.
One of the biggest premieres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra, who will be standing with the dealers in autumn.
"The Astra is an extremely important model for us," said Opel CEO Karl-Thomas Neumann at the trade fair.
It belongs to the core of the brand.
To ensure that the volume model also sells well, the new Astra will not become much more expensive for it.
Opel offers an entry point below the largest competitor VW Golf, which starts at EUR 17 650.
The current Astra costs from 16 990 euros.
The Astra has a new 1.4-liter engine with 74 kW/100 hp.
The Hessen also offers additional diesel and petrol engines from 70 kW/95 hp to 147 kW//200 hp, including three-cylinder petrol engines for the first time.
Unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus, the Opel Astra is initially only available as a five-doorer.
As a second variant, the combination will follow in spring, which can already be seen at the IAA.
And what is going on next to the Astra on the IAA on new compact cars?
Renault MÃ©gane: Renault sends the fourth generation of his Astra competitor MÃ©gane into the race.
At the fair, the MÃ©gane can only be seen as a five-doorer in a conventional version and an emphasizing sporty GT version.
He will come into trade at the beginning of next year, then also as a Kombi.
Infiniti: The Infiniti Q30 is all new in the segment.
The Nissan depositor wants to find its position in the highly growing segment with the new model.
The compact infiniti with its curved lines fully fits into the design line of the brand.
The basic model will get a petrol engine with a power of at least 90 kW/122 hp.
On offer is also a diesel with 80 kW/109 hp or 125 kW/170 hp.
Suzuki Baleno: The new segment is also the Suzuki Baleno, which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt.
The model is offered with petrol engines, including a newly developed 1.0-liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW/111 hp.
The maximum torque is 170 Newton meters (Nm) according to manufacturer's specifications.
The sale start of the Baleno in Europe is in spring 2016.
DS 4: Not completely new, but completely renewed is the compact class DS 4, which can be seen on the IAA.
Outside, the designers of the noble CitroÃ«n-delegator mainly put on hand at the front section: Here the cooler grill was re-drawed and the modified headlights equipped with LED technology.
In the interior the infotainment system was modernised, the number of buttons was reduced by a touch screen and integrated for the first time with Apple's CarPlay.
In addition, a number of revisions and new variants such as the updated Mercedes A-Class or the Peugeot 308 GTI joined the IAA in the compact class.
JVA Berlin-Tegel: Five square meters of cell are inhumane
The Federal Constitutional Court gave right to an ex-obstacle of the justice enforcement centre Tegel, which had been housed in a small cell for months.
Because of the violation of their human dignity, prisoners are basically entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in too small cells.
This was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday.
According to the judges, they can even hope for money if they have been locked up in the narrow spaces for a few days (Az.: 1 BvR 1127/14).
This resulted in an ex-huftling with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe: He was housed in the justice execution centre Berlin-Tegel between June and November 2009 in a single cell with approximately five square meters of floor space; the toilet was not separated spatially.
After that, the man who, according to his lawyerâ€™s information, is now on a free footing, had been transferred to a larger cell.
Although his official liability for the unworthy terms of detention against the state of Berlin failed.
However, the Constitutional Judges raised the judgment of the Berlin Chamber of Appeal and dismissed the case for re-examination.
You see the man's dignity hurt.
Court of First Instance now decides on the amount of compensation
Even if, for legal reasons, only a few days of imprisonment for compensation were essential for the period in question, a compensation was claimed.
Otherwise, "a shadow of the legal protection of the personality should be feared."
The court of the Chamber must now clarify the amount of compensation.
The constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past.
So they did not address damages to a prisoner in April because he was locked in a cell naked.
According to a 2011 decision, the multiple occupancy of a cell without a separate toilet is also unworthy.
Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court on Wednesday, which in a parallel case in November 2009 had certified a human inadequacy.
The applicant was housed between 15 and 21 hours a day for over three months in a cell similar to that in Karlsruhe.
The Berlin prisons have also been headlined in recent weeks because of the lack of staff.
Prisoners will therefore be locked in again and again for 23 hours, aggressiveness increases, even beatings should have already come because of the tense situation.
According to the Legal Press Office, 21 posts in Tegel are not occupied because of the shortage of young people, 19 are expected to fall away in 2016.
Angela Merkel and refugee policy: "We create this"
The immigration of refugees is a huge challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept it.
What's going on in Germany?
According to the Federal Ministry of the Interior, about 800 000 asylum seekers will come to Germany this year, according to Vice-President Sigmar Gabriel (SPD), Germany is even able to receive one million refugees.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge: "I say again and again: we can do this and we can do it."
What matters to Germany gives the following overview.
According to different forecasts, between 350000 (estimation of the Federal Ministry of Construction) and 400000 (estimation of the Pestel Institute) dwellings are used annually - for the next five years.
This is almost twice as much as it is built to date (250000 apartments).
However, the lack of accommodation is dramatic, especially for affordable rental properties: annual, 60000 to 80000 social flats fall out of the rental price commitment, and refugees will also apply for these particularly favourable apartments.
Federal Minister for Construction Barbara Hendricks (SPD) therefore wants to double the funding, from currently 518 million to one billion euros.
This is far too little from the point of view of the Pestel Institute: 80 000 social housings would have to be created each year and the federal government would have to invest in funding of 6.4 billion per year.
Scientists and Federal Minister for Construction agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investment in housing.
According to estimates from the Institute for Labour Market and Vocational Research, 55 percent of refugees in Germany can be employed in the long term.
However, refugees in Germany would not systematically demand their qualification to help them get started, criticizes Claudia Walter, project manager for integration and education in the Bertelsmann Foundation.
However, it is crucial for the integration of refugees whether they find work in Germany.
Work is the key to social contacts, for the appreciation in the reception society, but also for the self-esteem of immigrants, says Migration researcher Dietrich ThrÃ¤nhardt.
According to TrÃ¤nhardt, there has been a political change in Germany: from the ban on work for refugees to recognition of work.
While there was a ban on asylum seekers of up to five years earlier, in November 2014, it was reduced to three months, as was the residence obligation, which restricted asylum seekers to a place of residence.
In society - even because of the shortage of skilled workers - the majority of the view has been that refugees should be able to access the labour market more quickly.
A great obstacle to access to the labour market is the lack of German knowledge.
So far, there is not sufficient supply of general and vocational language courses.
Studies also show that workplaces are most often mediated by personal contacts.
According to TrÃ¤nhardt, the construction of networks is therefore the royal path for labour integration.
The Berlin school administration has found that few fledged parents give their children into the kitas, estimated ten to 15 percent: "For the displaced parents, it is very important to hold the family together first," says Ilya Koschembar, spokesperson for youth and family in the Berlin Senate administration.
However, in order to convince the family of the benefits of the Kita, the administration distributes handsets in various languages.
If the need for educators increased greatly due to the large number of refugees, the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacity - for example by allowing more specialist schools.
In countries, students are prepared for teaching without German skills in welcome classes.
However, they are not always taught by fully trained teachers, but, as in Berlin, also by teachers who only have a second language qualification in German.
There is no shortage of them, says Beate Stofters of the Berlin School Administration.
The Deutsche Studentenwerk estimates that about 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany.
In principle, no federal country prohibits asylum seekers or tolerated the study - the only exception has so far been Berlin, inside senator Frank Henkel (CDU) has now abandoned his attitude.
Student refugees could be facilitated access to the university.
For refugees with a residence permit or toleration will no longer receive benefits under the Asylum Enrolment Act when they start their studies.
The latter in principle do not get a baboo, as they do not fall within the circle of the eligible persons.
So far, patient refugees had to live in Germany for four years in order to be eligible for BafÃ¶g, from 1 January 2016 on this team will be shortened to 15 months.
However, this funding gap must also be closed, Steffen Krach, Berlin's State Secretary for Science, and the Deutsche Studentenwerk.
Students should get BafÃ¶g right away.
Islam will play an important role in the future, as many refugees are Muslims, and for many, religion is an important part of its identity.
The state should gradually grant Islam the same rights as they have the churches, and develop the existing state church law to a new state-religion ratio.
Also important would be the establishment of an Islamic welfare association, which professionally cares for the new arrivals.
The rights also include obligations.
Thus, the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact points and be ready to cooperate with the State in many areas and provide him with certain control options.
This also includes the willingness to take action against religious fundamentalism.
On Thursday, the chairman of the Muslim Central Council, Aiman Mazyek, expressed concern that religious conflicts could also be brought into Germany.
Those who wanted to fight such conflicts in Germany "have their right to stay here, in Germany," he said in the Bavarian radio station.
He suggested translating the Basic Law into Arabic.
In future, integration will be much more a topic of society than it is today.
This will also require a change in the majority of society, making the reduction of discrimination and racism more urgent.
Germany - as a result of European decisions - has had an anti-discrimination body and a general equality law for just a few decades.
But it is very slow to learn how the NSU murder series showed that police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motive.
Equal opportunities for all: what migrants' organizations and the interest groups of non-white Germans are demanding for a long time and what international agreements such as the Anti-racism Convention Germany requires must become reality in the coming years if the country remains peaceful and its new citizens are to use its opportunities for the benefit of all.
In general, Germany is able to provide medical care to the previously expected refugees, says medical president Frank Ulrich Montgomery.
"As far as man-power and capacity are concerned, we can do that," he said.
However, additional money had to flow into the system.
In order to avoid bottlenecks, Montgomery demands that all arrivals be delivered to health cards at the time of registration.
Services provided could later be charged with the federal states.
And in the long term, it would be highly questionable to feed so many people with the limited service catalogue provided by the Asylum Skills Performance Act.
Otherwise, doctors will be able to create the language barriers.
So far, the Berlin health scientist Thea Borde has already demonstrated, migrants are being treated worse about their diseases than other patients.
Not only in clinics, but also in doctor's practice, it requires interpreting costs.
However, many refugees would already be able to cope with more general medical contact points in the emergency ambulances.
And with another diagnostic look.
In refugee children, for example, there are clearly more untreated disabilities, and in young people HIV education is involved.
German doctors, however, came from their education with some of the other diseases, says Montgomery.
"Parasites infestation or tuberculosis are not so difficult to detect". And as far as the lack of doctors is concerned, refugees may even be able to see relief.
The Syrians had a highly developed education system, and some refugees were even doctors.
However, in order to be allowed to practise, they would need to prove their qualifications and possibly carry out further tests.
At least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are psychologically ill according to estimates of the Federal Psychotherapist Chamber (BPtK): Most suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder or depression.
Especially vulnerable are refugee children, explains Dietrich Munz, President of the BPtK.
A recent study by TU Munich shows that every fifth Syrian refugee child arrives traumatized in Germany.
Those who suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder suffer, among other things, from so-called flashbacks with difficulty of breathing, dizziness, heart rate and anxiety.
Further symptoms include sleep and concentration disorders, strong feariness and emotional deafness.
To prevent the symptoms from being chronic, early treatment was necessary, Munz explained.
However, only four percent of mentally ill refugees receive psychotherapy.
While psychologically ill asylum seekers in the social offices can apply for psychotherapy, the processing usually takes several months.
In addition, in the social offices most experts or doctors who are not trained for mental illness would decide whether therapy is necessary or not.
This often leads to misconceptions, says Munz.
Manege invites you to dream
With the new production "Leidenschaft", the Circus Probst uses the traditions of circus art.
The goal is to attract every age group in the banners of fascinating acrobatics, animal dressage and unique entertainment.
Now the Circus Probst invites you to wash on the brick to dream.
"Our passion is the circus."
"I can't imagine living without my circus family," says Stephanie Probst, animal teacher and junior chief.
"Leiency" - under this motto stands the current manegenzenierung.
For more than 33 years, the circus has been in the hands of the Probst family.
So the gift of enthusiasm lies in the blood of the family.
"It's important for us to get people out of their daily lives and take them to a completely different world for two hours," emphasizes the 27-year-old junior chief.
"Manegencocktail mit Weltstadt-Flair", says Director Reinhard Probst.
50 cities on the nearly 3,000-kilometre tour can now experience this flair.
The circus programme convinces with talented artists from all over the world.
Excellent at the international circus festival in Monte Carlo, the Russian Stoliarov Clown Family captivates the audience with joke and charm.
The Castillo Brothers also understand their crafts.
With the heroes of the silent films it wants to loosen the Cuban duo.
Easiness and mobility - with these words they identify themselves.
Her humorous art on the mast is to conquer women's hearts in the storm.
In addition to numerous salmon salts, the acrobatics of the Circus Probst also fascinate with the tip of the finger and jointness.
Balance with the unicycle on a ball?
He Yuan has no problem.
Snake people fascinate and frighten at the same time.
Wang Lin from China is familiar with the oldest form of acrobatics as little others and fascinated with their mobility.
60 employees from 12 nations offer diversity in every respect.
"The animals belong to our family", says Stephanie's mother, Brigitte Probst.
Disadvantages in the attitude of circus animals are all too often the subject of various animal welfare organisations.
Stephanie Probst also points out: "If our animals are not well, we are not doing well either."
Around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy every match unit.
The "four-legged artist", as they are lovingly called, will be read from the eyes if possible.
We want to work with the animals and have fun with them.
If the animal doesn't feel well, it doesn't want to be in the manege either.
So the first commandment: provide good for the animals.
Especially on her Zebroid Jumbo, a mixture of a ShetlandPonyhengst and a Zebrastute, the family Probst is proud.
The two animals lived together in a walk for eight years and nothing happened.
"But then, suddenly, our little Jumbo was there," says Brigitte Probst.
The Zebroid is not yet ready for the manege, but for this it is the unique mascot of the Circus Probst.
So there should be something for every visitor.
"One thing is sure," says Stephanie Probst: "Whether five or 1,200 spectators, we always give our best and are there with all our heart."
The Circus Probst invites daily from 17 to 20 September at 17 and 20 o'clock.
On Sunday the program starts at 11 and 4 o'clock.
Thursday is a family day, the prices are reduced at 5 p.m.
In addition, the animal show is open daily from 10 am to 6 pm.
Zimbabwe Robert Mugabe gives false speech in Parliament
Mr Mugabe, Africa's oldest leader, fell down the stairs at the beginning of the year from a podium.
He remained uninhibited, but the video of the case spread rapidly across the social media.
The opening of Parliament was also troubled by statements by members of the opposition that they had received anonymous threats of death and were warned to accompany Mr Mugabe's speech with cow's troops.
Last month, they had bred him and interrupted him during his speech on the situation of the nation in Parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The Spokesperson of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) Innocent Gonese said that seven opposition politicians received SMS messages on their mobile phones that warned them to disturb Mr. Mugabe's speech.
"The news comes from a number that is not displayed, but it has the title 'Death'," he said to journalists after Mugabe's speech.
It warns the Members concerned that immunity in Parliament will end, and as soon as it leaves Parliament, its parliamentary immunity will no longer be effective.
The chief spokesperson said that Morgan Tsvangirai's party was "anxious" about the dangers to the politicians.
Hewlett-Packard will reduce up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is expected to reduce 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in the company's services in the context of restructuring and savings efforts.
HP will later this year split into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast-growing corporate hardware and its service business.
The expected job reduction leads to a burden of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
"These restructuring measures will allow for a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett-Packard Enterprise," said Meg Whitman, HP chairman and Chief Executive, which will lead the unit after the separation.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and stronger than HP today, and we have a wide and in-depth portfolio of businesses that support companies in transition to a new style of business," Whitman said.
As an independent company, we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers all over the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than $50 billion of annual turnover and "will be focused on providing previously unattained, integrated technology solutions for companies," says a statement from the company.
It divides a company founded in the 1930s by the graduates of Stanford University Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to produce electrical installations and their Palo Alto Garage has been called "the birthplace of Silicon Valley".
HP has undergone massive restructuring to cope with the departure from traditional PCs to mobile devices.
HP's measure, the world's second-largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US-tech companies, is the latest in this field based on the conviction that closely focused companies deliver better performance.
FC Arsenal Captain Mikel Arteta says teammates must stand behind the injured Jack Wilshere before the match against Dynamo Zagreb
Wenger emphasized to Wilshere that it was only September and that, if his rehabilitation goes according to plan, there is no reason why he can't play again before Christmas.
This optimistic scenario already means that Wilshere will certainly miss at least the next four games for England and, in view of its history, its participation in the European Championship will certainly be uncertain next summer.
The great shame in this current problem is that Wilshere had ended the last season after a separate ankle injury and then returned to his old swing during the pre-season.
"This type of injury does not threaten the career," said Wenger.
It's a bone that didn't heal well.
That's no big deal.
This was just an accident.
It was not in connection with his ankles or with the injuries he had before.
This may be true from a purely medical point of view, but as Wenger also acknowledged, there is the associated danger of further injuries whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season.
It also develops an unpleasant pattern.
The investigation of Premier Injuries Ltd recorded 23 different diseases of Wilshere since his debut six years ago.
He also played in only 65 of Arsenals 157 leagues in the last five games.
The broader picture for Arsenal is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs in six out of eight times since 2007/08, which have reported most of the injury days.
Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believes that improvement in the injury rate will continue during the last season.
"Sometimes, when you come back from an injury, you have a susceptible period, a time when you need to strengthen your body and gain combat power," said Wenger.
Jack's young enough to overcome this.
I hope his body stabilizes, I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the kind he deserves.
Arsenal starts his Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Dinamo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tottenham Hotspur on next Wednesday, and Wenger sets up a rotation within the team.
HÃ©ctor BellerÃ­n and Aaron Ramsey did not travel to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta should start.
Wenger can also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to keep the balance and give the players who need a little break," said Wenger.
Although Arsenal are clear favorites to continue through Group F, the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the playgrounds with the greatest intimidation effect in Europe.
Dynamo is unbeated even after 41 games after the "invincible" campaign was launched in the last season.
The stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening, measuring 3.2 on the Richter scale.
This year it was the 10th in Zagreb.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has drawn the teaching from the past season with the Champions League capitulation against Monaco and remains driven by the far hope of leading the association to his first European Cup triumph with his management.
"This drive is immense," said Wenger.
It's never worked out at Arsenal's.
We were very close to it in 2006 but on the other hand, I am long enough in business to be realistic.
We're ambitious, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: the comedy show that gives us serious lessons about male friendships
The lack of similar representations in shows is obvious, especially in terms of how the need for men to open up has become more desperate now than ever before, as suicide rates among young men prove at a 15-year high.
In 2013, it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK, and it remains three times more frequent in men than in women.
In an effort to tackle the problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) announced 2015 as the year of the man's year, with the aim of questioning the culture that prevents men from seeking help if they need it.
Friendship is the heart of the struggle to overcome this challenge.
A recent study in more than 2,000 high school students with depressive symptoms found that if the sufferer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with "healthy mood", his chances of recovery doubled.
For those who are not depressed, a circle of spiritually healthy friends halves the risks of mental problems.
But of course you have to have friends first so that a friendship can work.
In the age of social media communication, with its focus on substance style, the immediacy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, lively and successful, even though in reality isolation dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, image, social status, everything at the expense of intrinsic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship, which affects our mental health much deeper.
And as a video game inventor and billionaire recently explained, money really can't buy luck.
The beauty at Friends was that this focus was placed on the head.
Each character was defined not by his work, but by his personality, which shined through interaction as a friend.
The humour of Joey and Chandler's frequent hugs, moments of football gambling in cozy chairs and the longing of Ross for Rachel - all this came from knowing that men can definitely refer to it, even if they often hold back from exploring their feelings completely.
As one employee of telephone care explained to me: "My audience role for people who feel depressed and are at risk of suicide has shown me really clearly how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference."
The men who contact us often feel unable to talk to friends.
The old phrase "I am right with it" has an enormous effect, such as the feeling that it is perceived as weakness when you speak openly about problems."
Friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer more long-term management mechanisms.
She clearly presents the small moments of male friendships.
As much as my objective outsider status via the phone may also help people in moments of despair, the long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends.
And so, if you are visiting Comedy Central FriendsFest with the backdrop that has been completely redesigned to celebrate the day, why don't take your friends to a drink in the Central Perk.
Or, even better, if you see someone sitting around in Starbucks alone, give him a smile and say hello.
You never know what difference your friendship could make.
Friends are sent to Comedy Central from start to finish - the entire 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria meets to help PSG crush MalmÃ¶
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his hit with MalmÃ¶.
Di Maria meets at his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PSG to pass MalmÃ¶.
Here is the game report and the response to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani held courses when Paris Saint-Germain started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2-0 victory against MalmÃ¶ in the Princes Park Stadium on Tuesday.
Di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as a PSG player who led the French champion, but after that they missed a number of occasions before they finally increased their lead when Cavani scored a headball goal in the 61st minute.
With Real Madrid and Schachtjor Donetsk in Group A, Paris also needs a strong start against Swedish champions, as they are seeking not only the qualification for the K.O. rounds, but an improvement on the way to the quarter finals in each of the last three campaigns.
But while they got the points, it wasnâ€™t a class game of Laurent Blancâ€™s team with Zlatan Ibrahimovicâ€™s missed opportunities in front of the goal. He was later replaced in the game against his home city team and against the club with which he started his illustrated career already in 1999.
"It's not easy to win home or out in the Champions League. Therefore, it is a good start to win 2:0, to cause our opponents problems and to look back relaxed, even if there are certain things we still have to perfect during the season," said Blanc.
"This is a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, although I regret that we did not achieve one or two more goals."
After his injury, Ibrahimovic returned to the Paris team in one of three changes that could hold a 2:2 draw on his own place against Bordeaux in the First League, but he was expelled in the fourth minute by Di Maria.
The Argentine wing tower was described as the man who can take PSG to the next level in Europe when he was taken over by Manchester United last month, and he indicated why when he entered Marco Verrattis Pass behind the MalmÃ¶ defense before he closed to Johan Wiland beautifully into the long corner of the network.
However, if someone believed that PSG would achieve a great victory, he was disappointed.
MalmÃ¶, who beat Celtic in a play-off to reach this level, joined Anpiff with nine national players on the field and was with a five-man defense and two deep in the middle field a heavy opponent.
But apart from a shot by Nikola Djurjic, who passed by Kevin Trapps in the 34th minute, they did little to attack.
Instead, PSG itself sometimes gave up, with some failures and bad conclusions, not least from Ibrahimovic, who patched in the first half in no less than five attempts alone and then was abandoned after Cavani had put it in after restart.
Nevertheless, he proved much more skill when he put his fellow players into the game, and it was a pass by Ibrahimovic that turned Di Maria into a shot that was passed by Wiland in the 52nd minute at the pole ...
The second gate finally fell shortly after the hour mark thanks to Cavani. The Uruguayian thus scored his sixth seasonal goal after Ibrahimovic had picked up a left flank of Maxwell.
This ended all the thought that MalmÃ¶ could return to the game, and only an excellent intervention from Wiland from the shortest distance to stop David Luiz could keep the final result low before substitute player Ezequiel Lavezzi was recognized a goal at the end.
The coach of MalmÃ¶, Age Hareide, later admitted that PSG played a class over his team, and the Norwegian said, "Our last champion League game was in December last year.
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish League, which does not have the same level.
The skills games are not enough."
Get off in front of Paris!
It was a great game of them!
Glencore collects $2.5 billion by stock sales
The Glencore mining giant, which is based in Switzerland, which is affected by one-stop raw material prices, collected $2.5 billion on Wednesday through a share sale as part of its huge debt recovery plan.
The London registered company Glencore said in a statement that it has sold new shares worth approximately $1.6 billion to pay its own debts.
The company, which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year, is struggling with falling commodity prices, as China's economic downturn is pressing demand and devastatingly affecting markets.
The issue of subscription rights brought Glencore's share price at trade on early Wednesday morning to the top of the London Stock Exchange.
The stock jumped by 2.77% to 131.60 Pence on the FTSE 100 index, which opened 0.69 percent higher.
Glencore announced last week the $2.5 billion sale of shares as part of the more comprehensive plans to take about one third of his $30 billion debt.
The company sold the new shares to 125 Pence per share, which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday.
There were 1.3 billion shares in the value of up to 9,99 percent of the group.
Concerns regarding long-term inhibited growth in China have cut iron ore prices by about half, coal, copper and other raw materials prices have decreased by 20 to 40 percent.

The White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington
Chinese President Xi Jinping will make a state visit to the United States at the end of the month, confirmed the White House in a statement on Tuesday.
The visit, Xis's first official in Washington, will take place on September 25 and will return President Barack Obama's trip to Beijing last November, said the statement.
This evening, the US President and First Lady Michelle Obama will also host Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan at a state dinner after the two leaders have held bilateral talks.
"President Xis visit will provide the opportunity to expand American-Chinese cooperation in a number of global, regional and bilateral issues of common interest, while at the same time giving President Obama and President Xi the opportunity to address areas of disagreement constructively," the statement adds.
XI, whose visit was first announced in February, is expected to meet several US technology leaders on his way to Washington in Seattle before going to New York City to the UN General Assembly in September.

Xavi: Pep Guardiola prevented switch to FC Bayern in 2008
World champion and European champion Xavi has been playing for the al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
FC Bayern was obviously just before the commitment of Spain's Superstar Xavi, who was playing for Barcelona FC at the time.
Eight times of Spanish champions, three times Pokal winners, four times Champions League winners, two times club world champions, two times European champions, one time world champions - the title list of Xavi is stunning.
In summer the 35-year-old left Barcelona FC after 24 years and changed to al-Sadd Sport Club to Qatar.
But in an interview with Marca Xavi now reveals that he was already standing before the EM 2008 before the departure from Barcelona.
"They told me that BarÃ§a wanted to sell me."
"Madrid won everything at that time, we didn't do anything," he says.
And that also recorded the FC Bayern.
Xavi: "There was an offer from Bavaria."
"Rummnigge wanted me."
For a reminder: In the summer of 2008, JÃ¼rgen Klinsmann took over FC Bayern.
Guardiola was the reason that Xavi did not change
But the change did not happen.
And today the key man works for the German record champion: Pep Guardiola.
Xavi explains why: "BarÃ§a has signed up to Guardiola and I have played a great EM."
"Pep told me I wouldn't change that he couldn't imagine the team without me."
"That's why he got me."
Who knows how Bavaria's season 2008/2009 would have been with Xavi.
Xavi stood for Barca in the quarter finals of the Champions League against Bavaria over the entire distance on the lawn, the Reds turned off (4:0, 1:1) and in the end celebrated the Royal Class Triumph.
Matt Damon plays a variety of movies
Matt Damon confronted Afro-American filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion of diversity and said she would not be needed behind the scenes.
During a series of Sunday Nights by HBO's Project Greenlight, the experienced actor Brown interrupted the need for alternative perspectives in relation to a black protagonist in the chosen screenplay of the project.
"When we talk about diversity, you do it in the occupation of the film and not in the occupation of the show," Damon assured.
Brown responded shockedly, with violent disbelief and cried out "Hoo! Wow. Okay", when the actor's comments from The Martian strengthened themselves.
Damon and Brown joined the producer colleagues Ben Affleck and Farrelly brothers to discuss the show finals.
"I would like to ask people to think about it - whoever the director will be - how they treat the figure of Harmony," Brown said at first.
The only black person, and she's a whore struck by her white holder.
The producer of Dear White People supported the finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the directing rights to the film; Damon replied that their director could "end up give us something that we don't want."
After the discussion was broadcast, the social media exploded before disapprove of Damon's comments.
Twitter user Mr Pooni expressed his anger over the clip by writing "Matt Damon speaks about the only black person in the room, so he can explain their diversity - that's SO WEISS that it hurts."
The Tweet earned more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes since its release.
Damon's comments come at a time when precise racial representation in the media is at the top of the social debate.
After Michael Brown was killed by a white policeman in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement had an impact across the country and forced legislators and authorities to stop discriminating practices against coloury restraint.
In February, the singer Prince made an allusion to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Grammy Awards.
"Albums still matter", he said (all still have their meaning).
Like books and black life, albums still have their meaning.
More recently, leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement have published a statement in response to the issue of Fox News Personality Elisabeth Hasselbeck, whether the group should be considered a hate group.
"The Black Lives Matter network is a love group," the leaders said.
Recently it was announced that Damon was on a list of entertainers, producers, and media Mogules invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether he has accepted the invitation or has already met the Pope is unclear.
'American Ninja Warrior' crowns first champion
Professional sports climber and operating aid Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior on Monday evening and took home the big prize of $1 million.
The competition show, which just finished its 7th season, had never experienced a competitive participant who could complete all stages of his obstacle race.
During the season, two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, managed to finish the season.
The final task was to climb a 75-foot climbing rope in 30 seconds.
Briton finished the task within the time when he was the first athlete to complete the strenuous phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior. However, Caldiero finished this challenge full three seconds faster, making him the winner.
Caldiero spoke to E!News after the hard win, still under shock about winning the big prize of $1 million.
"I mean, it's amazing to think about it, I've never earned more than $10,000 or had to live," said Isaac E! about his pile of money.
As suddenly as I can not even imagine how this is... the future is unknown.
The leading producer Kent Weed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the finale and why Britons, although he was the first ever to finish the race course, did not receive any prize money.
According to the rules, money goes to the fastest person.
"If there is more than one finalist, it gets the one with the fastest time," said Weed.
How much money is a wonderful price and life changes, it gets the great grace.
I don't think he's got any grudge on it.
He's just so happy to have done what he did.
He received lots of awards from fans.
He's such a great guy and a family father.
He's a hero for his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If I'm to be beaten by someone, I'm glad it's Isaac."
And I think Isaac would have felt the same way if they had exchanged the roles.
America Ninja Warrior has been extended for an eighth season, the shooting will begin in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers sneaking past Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS--The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tigers.
They used to be one of the best teams in baseball, and today the Tigers are on the last place in the American League Central.
The Tigers have been reduced to their role as a spoiler, but on Tuesday they played this part perfectly against the Minnesota Twins with 5-4 in Target Field.
The Twins missed a chance to climb within a half of Houston Astros for the second American League Wildcard place.
For Detroit, although only for one evening, it was a return of the three letter F-words, which was so difficult to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season.
"All wins are fun, no matter how it comes," said Tigers Manager Brad Ausmus.
Tiger-Pitcher Alfredo Simon maintained his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two innings, then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) scored 6 times in the 1-3-innings and enabled three runs.
It was only his third successful start in his last nine matches.
"I want to end strongly this year," Simon said.
It's hard to throw every game in the bull, and that's why I want to go into the game.
The designed Tiger-Hitter Victor Martinez had three hits and was in two races, his first RBIs since mid-August.
It was Martinez's first three-time hit game, since he had four hits against Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He has curved the punching wood well," said Ausmus.
He looked good while (beat training), looked much better in the bull, and he put it straight into the game.
With three run-ins at the end of the seventh inning, the twins had their best chance to get back into the game.
Center Fielder Byron Buxton finished the inning with a double on the left field line.
Right Fielder Aaron Hicks reached a colorful tone, and Simon brought his second baseman Brian Dozier to strikeout before he was replaced by the left-handed Blaine Hardy.
Hardy passed the wall, the only man he was confronted with, in front of the designed Rookie strikeman Miguel Sano, who released a two-run to the right-hander Drew Verhagen.
With a pair of runners and the final round at the second, Verhagen brought the third Baseman Trevor Plouffe to a double play.
It was the 27th time in the Major League this season that Plouffe beat a double play
After Detroit added an insurance run at the end of the ninth inning, a RBI double against the closing of the Tigers Bruce Rondon and scored 5-4.
The right-hander, however, turned out Sano at three pitches for his fifth save.
Detroit benefited from an unmoving Phil Hughes for the start of the game.
The Tigers scored three runs in the first two innings against the right-handed veteran who had been removed from the injured list before the game after he had missed more than a month due to a back suffering.
"Of course, not the beginning I wished for," said Hughes, "but I felt more comfortable than I took off and felt that I would create some pretty good pitches in the third inning."
After receiving the leadoff batter in the first time, Hushes gave a single to Second Baseman Ian Kinsler.
A two-out walk for J.D. Martinez brought Victor Martinez into the game, which created a single "up the middle" at the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez created his 0-21 series of success with the runners in the scoring position.
The third Baseman Nick Castellanos followed with a single on the right, created another run, but Victor Martinez was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third, which ended the threat.
The Tigers closed in the second, scored a one-out double by Catcher James McCann and a two-out single by the center field Anthony Gose to the 3-0.
"That was a big blow," said Twins-Manager Paul Molitor.
He didn't beat very well, but he got the right spot.
Hughes was in a pitch count, scored no points in the third inning before being replaced by the Reliever Right-Hander A.J.Achter.
At Hughes, there were three runs at six hits and a walk with four strikeouts.
COMMENTS: Tigers RHP Anibal Sanchez gave rise to a violation of the throwers' school.
He is examined by Dr. James Andrews, who operated on the shoulder of Sanchez in 2007.
Sanchez, since mid-August on the injured list due to a shoulder distortion, is to be activated for the start on Wednesday.
With Sanchez from the game, LHP Daniel Morris is removed from the injured list to start against the twins.
Norris with 1-1 at four starts with the Tigers, since he was acquired in exchange with LHP David Price on 30 July
He has missed since August 20 because of a distortion in the right hip joint.
The Tigers and the Twins will finish their series of three games in Target Field on Wednesday
Norris (2-2.4.43 ERA) will play against Minnesota's RHP Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73)

Ischinger: German military measures in Syria an option
The head of the Munich Security Conference, Wolfgang Ischinger, considers military measures with German participation in Syria to be possible.
"I believe that the decisive reflection on military options must not take place without Germany," he said.
He accused the European states of "separately looking away".
Four years ago you were glad that the cup of a military involvement in Germany passed.
"Now the conflict is crashing in front of our doorstep," he said in Germany's radio station.
The former German ambassador in Washington also demanded a massive increase in international aid to refugees on site.
Austria controls on southern and eastern borders
After Germany Austria has also introduced controls at its southern and eastern borders.
Austrian Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leinner declared on Tuesday evening in the Austrian TV station ORF, no one is sent back to Hungary.
Germany also did not send refugees back to Austria.
"No, that's agreed," she said.
As regards the question of an agreement where Germany could record a certain number of refugees from Austria per day, Mikl-Leinner said that there had already been discussions on this issue between the Director-General for Public Security and representatives of Germany.
She did not call concrete numbers and referred to talks on Wednesday in Berlin.
In recent days, tens of thousands of refugees have come from Hungary to Austria via the so-called Balkan Route.
Its target is mostly Germany.
Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and her Austrian colleague Werner Faymann together with several other EU Heads of State and Government requested a special summit for next week.
Germany had started temporary border checks on Sunday.
The EU countries have so far not been able to agree on a common approach in the crisis.
EU Ministers for the Interior to take a new start on the binding distribution of more than 120,000 refugees at a special meeting on Tuesday (September 22).
In view of the strong refugee degree in Germany, the Federal Government wants to strengthen the support of the countries in the initial uptake and distribution of the people.
The Federation will manage this together with the countries, and on the late Tuesday evening Merkel announced almost four-hour consultations with the Prime Minister at the Chancellor's Office in Berlin.
Merkel pointed out that those people who needed protection would also be able to do so.
But he who has no lead perspective cannot stay in Germany either.
This view had been emphatically shared in the round.
The chancellor stressed that the state as a whole now had to cope with a "great effort".
Thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkans route.
Hungary had closed its 175-kilometre border with Serbia in the night of Tuesday.
A few hours later, the government in Budapest announced that it would also lock the border with Romania with a fence.
This neighbouring country is different from Serbia to the EU.
Hungary wants to prevent Schlepper from looking for routes to leave Romania, said Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijarto to the planned new border fence.
The Romanian government immediately condemned the plan.
There were first arrests of people who had cut the fence.
According to Turkey, there have been thousands of other migrants on the way to the Greek border.
Space probe "Cassini" finds ocean on Saturnmond Enceladus
Under the icepan of the Saturn Moon Enceladus, a global ocean wanders.
This includes researchers from observations of the space probe "Cassini".
According to this, the moon tangles slightly on its orbit around the ring planets.
Although this tumble movement is small, yet too large for a solid heavenly body throughout, it says in a communication from the Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, on Tuesday.
The researchers present their analyses in the journal "Icarus".
It was already known for a long time that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of Enceladus.
Thus, "Cassini" had already discovered ice volcanoes on the south-east of the Saturn Moon in 2006 that spew water vapor and ice particles and thus feed the so-called e-ring of Saturn.
At least in the South Pole there had to be an underground sea, the astronomers closed at that time.
However, the expansion of the hidden ocean was not clarified.
Rama missing 1860 Munich for several weeks
The 1860 Munich must give up on Valdet Rama for about a month.
The association announced that an investigation had resulted in an adductor injury to the 27-year-old.
Rama had already complained about pain at the beginning of the week.
According to Munich Lions, the diagnosis is "preparedly four weeks".
"It's hard for us, Rama's a heart loss."
"Of course we need to think now," said sports director Necat AygÃ¼n of the "image" newspaper in view of the possible commitment of an unconventional professional.
However, as a training guest, the sixties initially presented a defensive man.
The 30-year-old Hrvoje Cale was last active in Belgium and was previously under contract with VfL Wolfsburg.
The Croatian currently has "the possibility to prove its ability".
TorjÃ¤ger Rubin Okotie can return to team training next week after his brain shock.
On Thursday, the Austrian national player is scheduled to enter running training.
Ocotie had been injured in the game near Fortuna DÃ¼sseldorf (0:3) in a violent collision on his head.
On the other hand, he remained without a serious injury.
No diet fruit - mangos contain a lot of sugar
Mangos are exotic and juicy sweet.
But whoever wants to pay attention to his slim line, he is often more discouraged from them.
Mangos contain relatively much sugar - especially sucrose.
However, the exotic fruits are healthy: B vitamins as well as the vitamins E and C. Above all, mangos contain a lot of vitamin A and its predecessor beta-carotin.
Anyone who eats the fruits thus supports vision, immune system and metabolic processes in the body.
When buying mangos should not be too soft or too firm and smell pleasant.
The shell color alone doesn't say anything about how ripe the fruit is - so green mangoes can taste very delicious too.
They should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days.
Then, of course, they taste pure or sweet food.
A mango, however, also gives hearty dishes a special touch.
It relieves the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as Chicoree and Radiccio.
And a mangochutney fits well with fish, poultry, lamb and game.
The UPS US Package Service restores up to 95000 aid for the Christmas business in the US.
The company has already started recruiting seasonal workers, and told UPS on Tuesday.
Especially drivers are looking for.
Already last year, UPS had increased its workforce for the holiday season by 95000 aid.
Given the booming online business, UPS and its competitor FedEx have taken steps since last year to be prepared for the Christmas business.
In 2013, late deliveries had brought the parcel services harsh criticism.
First hairstorm, then distinctive cold front
In the coming night, in the valleys of the Alps north side of the FÃ¶hn, as Meteo Switzerland reported on Tuesday.
On Wednesday and in the night to Thursday, the hairdryer blows partly with stormy strength through the mooring valleys.
After the end of the day on Thursday morning, a distinctive cold front crosses us, bringing strong rainfall, wind turbines and a fall in temperature.
As MeteoNews writes in a communication, Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low-pressure area across the British islands in a strong southwestern flow.
On the north side of the Alps the hair breaks through the valleys in the night to Wednesday.
As a result, until Thursday morning the hairdryer blows in the mooring valleys with trees from 60 to 100 km/h, isolated and partly in the Urnerland also with over 100 km/h.
The moan can cross through to the adjacent central country, and on the mountains, orcanoes of more than 120 km/h are possible.
While in the north on Wednesday a stormy hair dryer provides summer temperatures from 23 to 27 degrees, the moisture begins to stand on the south of the Alps.
This is where rain continues until Thursday night.
In total, in the next 48 hours, south of the Alps, some more than 100 litres of rain per square metre must be counted, after a large amount of rain has fallen in the last few days.
On Thursday morning, the haircut goes out, and as a result a cold front rolls with strong, partly weathery rain from west to east over Switzerland.
Together with the cold front, the wind freshs up strongly to stormy, and the temperatures go back significantly.
The following days will present themselves in the north autumn at 15 to 20 degrees, while in the south it will be sunny and warmer at up to 25 degrees on the weekend.
Rome now has a Martin-Luther place
Nearly 500 years after the Reformation there is now a Martin-Luther Square in Rome.
In the presence of President Ignazio Marino, on Wednesday a nameless place in the park on the Oppio hill was baptized on the name of the German Reformer.
At the "Piazza Martin Lutero" he is now honored as "German theologian of Reformation".
The park is located in the middle of the old Rome right next to the Colosseum.
The naming had been requested by the working community of the Protestant churches in Rome.
Jens-Martin Kruse, parish priest of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Rome, reminded us on Wednesday that Protestants in the city of the popes could often live as a minority only in secret.
With the place it becomes symbolically visible that its tradition of Christian faith in Rome is welcome.
Martin Luther (1483-1546) stayed in Rome for several months as a young Augustinian monk around the turn of the year 1510/11.
At that time he felt the city as a lost scapegoat.
According to historians, his negative impressions should have strengthened him in his later struggle against Rome.
Luther had then begun the division of the Western Church with his theses against the waste trade.
Hammer KÃ¼nstler invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the golden thorn crown is one of the main works Otmar Alt painted for his Bible.
Klaus Altepost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts.
At the beginning was the word?
No, not with the Otmar-Alt-Bibel, which has now appeared with magnificent pictures.
At the beginning was the image for Otmar Alt, who in 150 motifs formulated his very personal interpretations of Bible stories on paper and canvas.
His "language" with colorful colors and imaginative forms has been preserved by the 75-year-old - which is by no means the same as "lustful" images.
On the contrary, this can be quite gloomy.
For about three years, Otmar Alt worked on his Bible project, for which he made a subjective and artistic selection from the many topics of the book of all books.
There are cycles that dedicate themselves to such topics as crossroads, plagues, commandments, or fathers' prayers.
Thus he spontaneously fascinated several partners: this applies to Luther's publishing house with its theological orientation as well as to the Kettler publishing house with its focus on art books.
And there is above all the author Klaus Altepost, who has dealt with the respective Bible passages on the basis of painting.
He interpreted the Bible passages selected by Otmar Alt and thus "translated" into current contexts.
These texts are like verbal mirrors of old painting.
They are embedded between the original Bible quote of Martin Luther and each set of the artist, who formulated here his very personal thoughts about the situation.
The jewelry cover has golden letters.
Thus the 75-year-old allows twice a deep insight into his soul, his emotions.
This is a high level of intimacy.
Emotions were ultimately a trigger for the Bible project: Otmar Alt, born in 1940 in Wernigerode and raised in Berlin, comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant Herrhuter Order.
"There has been the education with the pipe stick before," recalls Otmar Alt.
"I have tried to work this out, perhaps to put up with the Lord Father again."
His second concern is to restore the importance of art in a fast-paced period of time: "The perception of image worlds is influenced by advertising today, and that is loud.
Symbolism is being suppressed there.
Artists have a different desire and pleasure to show things.
Pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative.
"In this respect, I'm a dinosaur."
Otmar Alt wants the viewers to "fall" into the pictures, make them feel, discover and feel the power they have: "The image looks its opposite".
Klaus Altepost stated on Tuesday at the presentation of the Otmar-Alt-Bibel in the Otmar-Alt-Stiftung that he "has always been a lover of Otmar Alt's art: "I like how he understands his pictures life".
Old did not pay attention to fully grasping the Bible but also selected the mysterious topics that matter to him.
"This wasn't a collaboration at eye level," Altepost says: "This is about the pictures, the text is just explained".
For Hans MÃ¶hler of Luther-Verlag, this work is an invitation to "increase his life and find freedom".
Otmar Alt's pictures speak for Muhler both the (biblical) language of love and the responsibility.
A part of the original - paper and canvas images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition that will be opened on November 15 at the Otmar Alt Foundation.
Start of construction for BMX train nears
Plans made, place found, company commissioned, ground hill modeled for a round course: a year later almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BMX train was already finished.
Failures in politics and administration caused confusion, especially among residents who did not want to tolerate the railway.
So hill shifted off, new place searched - now with formal planning and request for building permission.
The first municipal councillor Sabine Mosebach-Bock was able to inform the Children's and Youth Committee in October.
"I hope that this year is still happening," she said.
It was then to begin work at the former indoor swimming pool without a "further rest".
DFB intensifys engagement for refugees
The DFB expands its commitment to refugees by 2019, the Bundesliga sets a clear mark on the weekend.
The football reacts to the rising situation in Germany and secures policy support in dealing with the problems ahead.
"I think this is the biggest challenge of our country since reunification."
"No one can say that, in principle, it's none of my business, I have nothing to do with it."
"That must be of interest to every individual to get this issue under control," said DFB CEO Wolfgang Niersbach.
At an annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin, he wants to discuss the refugee situation intensively in Germany.
"I'm at the chancellor's office next Wednesday and meet the Minister of State, Ms. Ã–zoÄŸuz, and the Chancellor."
"The subject will certainly play a central role," he announced.
The football could and would like to help.
But the decisive course must be policy.
The German football band has therefore expanded its refugee initiative "1:0 for a welcome" by four years.
"About the Egidius-Braun Foundation, we have ensured that this program will continue until 2019," said Niersbach at the edge of the UEFA Conference in St. Julian's/Malta.
Some federal ligors also support this program.
Already this weekend, the 36 professional clubs will present a clear sign when they will wear the expression "We help - #refugeeswelcome" on the left arm of the jersey instead of the otherwise usual sponsor logo (Hermes).
"We also want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can only do it," said Leverkusen's sports director Rudi VÃ¶ller of the "image" newspaper (Tuesday) and called the project " taken for granted".
"The refugee drama goes on to everyone, no one is allowed to look away."
"We football leagueists can, no, we must use our radiance, influence and opportunities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly," said Hertha-Manager Michael Preetz.
Hoffenheim's managing director Peter Rettig spoke of a "prominent sign of the league".
The team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle/Saale to the EM-Qualification game against Hungary this Friday.
Niersbach referred to the support of refugees as "a great joint work of German football".
That all 36 license associations in their places have launched their own projects is great.
It is just as great that small and smallest clubs are active there.
The message "1:0 for a welcome" we have issued will be lived in football.
"This is of enormous importance," he said.
In this year and next, the Association, together with the DFB selection and the Federal Government, makes available â‚¬300 000 for the integration of refugees.
"The associations have already called the whole sum for 2015", Niersbach reported.
Reports: SAP Chief of State loses sight in the event of an accident
According to several reports, the Chief Executive Officer of Europe's largest software group, Bill McDermott, lost the left eye through a fall in early July.
In the accident on the stairs in his brother's home in the US, after midnight he fell on a glass of water that he had carried in the left hand, the "Economic Week" reported on Wednesday.
"He was almost bloodyd, was powerless, then dragged out on the road - that's what he told us last week," quotes the "WiWo" SAP co-founder Hasso Plattner.
But McDermott could do his job.
"At the beginning of October we meet before the Supervisory Board meeting in Walldorf," said Plattner.
The 54-year-old manager was at the meeting and "full of work".
In an interview with the "SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung" (SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung) McDermott announced that he will return to Germany in October and continue leading the software group.
"I'm full of SAP, full of my job."
"Of course, I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman, Hasso Plattner," said McDermott of the "SZ".
McDermott usually commuts between Germany and the USA, but since summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Walldorf.
It's important for him to go to the public with such a personal story, the manager of the "SZ" said: "Everyone can happen that way."
"It's important to get up again if you've fallen."
McLaren replacement pilot magnets out of combat...
Magnussen tweeted a photo and explained that he had suffered the injury when he was thrown off the wheel.
Therefore, during the night race in Singapore on the weekend, he is less likely to be a reserve driver for the two regular pilots Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button than a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan.
Football: BVB without giant against Krasnodar: fields of pasture in the gate
At Borussia Dortmund all hopes of a comeback by Marco Reus have finally broken down in the first group game of the Europe League.
The national player will also be missing from the football league table leader in duel with the FK Krasnodar on Thursday (19.00/Sky).
"Unfortunately, we cannot resort to him," said Thomas Tuchel on Wednesday.
Whether Reus will be back on Sunday in the Bundesliga-Topspiel against Leverkusen, the BVB coach left open: "We expect to return from him to the training on Friday".
Faced with the high load of his professionals, Tuchel will not only change his trunks on the giant position.
So he announced a change at the gatekeeper position.
That's why Roman Weidenfeller takes the place of Stammkeeper Roman BÃ¼rki.
"He trainings on an absolute top level," the football teacher praised the world champion.
Whether Weidenfeller will be used in all Europe-League games in the future, however, Tuchel left open.
With high probability, he will also compete with the second party.
The research statement of fellow player Reus that the final entry for the BVB in the Europe League must be the goal, believes Middle-fielder Julian Weigl to be understandable: "That's why Marco isn't so wrong."
"I think we have a good chance to take off the title."
Robotic cars: Government wants pioneering role for Germany
According to the will of the Federal Government, Germany is to be technological pioneer in changing the car.
On Wednesday, the Federal Cabinet decided to issue a strategy paper from the Minister of Transport Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), which includes investment in the development of digital infrastructure.
Dobrindt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the IAA car fair about a "new age of mobility".
The automated and networked driving will increase road safety and reduce traffic congestion, said Dobrindt.
He also wants to discuss the issue with his colleagues from the G7 countries, who also meet with representatives of industry at the IAA.
The Ministry of Transport's strategy paper highlights, among other things, the importance of mobile broadband expansion and a rapid switch to digital radio.
In order to test new technology, a test track on the Autobahn 9 in Bavaria is currently being developed.
To ensure that the driver "no additional risks of liability are imposed", the Federal Government wants to "check the legal framework and, where necessary, adapt to the new developments".
Germany, for example, intends to use internationally to increase the maximum permissible speed for self-driving cars from 10 to 130 kilometres.
The Federal Government also intends to work for a change to the Vienna Convention, which so far only provides for people as drivers.
With automated driving, the car is increasingly taking over, and the driver becomes more and more a passenger.
The technology is based mainly on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data in seconds.
According to a study submitted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, highly automated driving on motorways will be technically possible by 2020.
Even so, driverless vehicles on public roads would be "not to be expected far after 2020".
The authors of the study for 2025 value added in the field of driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions at the Germany site value around 8.4 billion euros.
"The digital networking of the car can lead to more safety and efficiency in road transport," said SÃ¶ren Bartol, the SPD traffic politician.
However, the question of liability in the event of accidents and the security of the driver's personal data must be clearly clarified.
However, the German self-driving cars still see skeptical - much more than French or American.
A survey by the Forsa Institute on Wednesday at the AA on behalf of the investigation organisation Decra concludes that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomously driving cars will prevail over the next ten years, 32 percent expect to do so only in 20 years, 31 percent do not believe in it at all.
In France 21 percent of respondents expect autonomous driving cars by 2025, in the USA 33 percent.
In any case, motorists in Germany are not ready to rely entirely on a self-driving vehicle.
After a survey of the Digital Association Bitkom, only seven percent would agree to give control throughout the trip on all roads.
On the motorway, at least 15 percent could be imagined in the flowing traffic, 45 percent in the traffic traffic traffic.
Well every fourth would not leave the car to control under any circumstances.
Boll says team- and double-start at table tennis EM
The DÃ¼sseldorfer wants to score only in individual after the title battles from September 25th to October 4th.
The final decision is to be taken by 22 September at the latest.
"This is a huge loss for our team."
"The boys experienced it in the morning."
"But we are strong enough to get the title even without Timo," said Bundestrainer JÃ¶rg RoÃŸkopf during the EM course in DÃ¼sseldorf.
Boll was on the flight to a long-term sponsoring date in China at that time.
The 34-year-old German champion is expected to return on Friday.
"Without Timo, we are no longer such a clear favorite," explained single European champion Dimitry Ovtcharov.
The Hamelner, who leads the list of seats in Yekaterinburg, also recalled the EM 2013 in Schwechat.
"At that time, Timo also missed, and we have become European champions."
"This is what we should be oriented towards," said the world ranking five.
The English football national player Luke Shaw from Manchester United has suffered a serious injury to the right leg.
During the Champions League game at PSV Eindhoven, the defender was hit in a Tackling by HÃ©ctor Moreno and replaced after long treatment.
The first diagnosis showed that the 20-year-old co-player of Bastian Schweinsteiger had a shin fracture.
Gaultier feels too old for an enfant terrible
It is a mix of very large fashion show and a wax figure caste: Designer Jean Paul Gaultier (63) presented an exhibition on his work on Wednesday in Munich.
The highlights: window dolls that look terrifyingly human thanks to video projections.
They wear the spectacular creations of the French designer, who, among other things, became a great star of the fashion scene with Madonna's stage outfits - and so that he put men in skirts.
"I can't say today that I am the enfant terrible of the Haute Couture because I have white hair."
"Before it was bleached, now it really is," said Gaultier.
For the visitors to the exhibition "From The Sidewalk To The Catwalk" (from BÃ¼rgersteig on the runway), which can be seen in the Kunsthalle der Hypo-Culturstiftung from 18 September, it is a happiness that the fashion creator has changed his initially opposed attitude to a show about his person.
Actually, he was against it because, "To me, an exhibition sounded a bit after death," he said.
When you die, you go to the museum.
The impressive collection had already been made at the Montreal Canada and Paris Station.
"It's about so much more than just beautiful clothes," said Roger Diederen, director of the Kunsthalle.
It is about tolerance, acceptance and the vision of an open society.
The exhibits give an insight into the man's hardly yet to be seen, who wrote fashion history without ever completing an education.
Chronologically, the show is not built up, but it is an excellent choreographed complete work of art, for which a lot of effort has been made: To fry the dolls, for example, a stylist was specifically engaged.
According to the curator Thierry-Maxime Loriot, 14 tons of material have been exported to Munich by the makers.
Shortly before the start of the October festival, there was a special tumult: a leather pants outfit with corset.
Heidi measures Madonna.
He was always interested in strong women ("Women are smarter than men") and for people who are a little different, Gaultier said.
Gaultier's old teddy can also be seen in the exhibition.
He stands for the designer's first, striking fashional walking attempts.
As a child (he was not a good student and bad in football) he put on his teddy bras and clothes, said Gaultier.
Playing with a doll, his parents would not have allowed him.
The design of fashion he taught himself later.
He stole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers, as Gaultier told in Munich.
Later, however, I bought them, of course.
For his first own fashion show he could not pay the models.
They didn't get anything, but they were allowed to keep the clothes.
Jewellery instead of Gardine - Plauener lace as fashion niche
It used to go into the long stickers and to make plausies about meters.
The embroidered fabrics and lace were produced in large quantities for customers who, for example, processed them for blankets and curtains.
This alone no longer works today, explains Andreas Reinhardt, Managing Director of the fashion peak Plauen.
Instead, fashion is important again.
In the early times of the Plauener top fashion played a greater role, then was driven out by the Heimtextil industry - and is now discovered as niches.
Reinhardt mentions some examples: lace in jewelry, accessories such as bags and regional costumes.
In general, the so-called vintage fashion, which leans on past style periods, is an increasing potential for order.
Anyone who does not serve niches in the textile industry in Germany is no longer on the market.
With us, they already make up half of all orders.
Fashionspitze Plauen, together with nine other companies, is a member of the Plauener Spitt and Embroidery industry association.
Only they may bear the protected label.
In the last 15 years, about 80 percent of turnover has been lost.
Private trades and also wholesale are almost no longer available.
Our products hardly reach the customer on this path.
Today, the bulk goods are produced much cheaper in the Asian region and almost exclusively through chains.
In addition, exports are weakening, currently to Russia and the USA.
So sufficient reasons for new ways.
The industry association also tries to score through environmental awareness, as Cordula Bauer explains from the stick pearl in Falkenstein: "Since this year we have been holding a quality seal, which shows that we are producing environmentally and socially compatible".
Reinhardt adds: "This also refers to the materials used".
Diploma designer Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schneeberger outside of the University of Applied Art Zwickau - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and specialises in embroidery and laces.
In order to counter competition from the Asian region, you need to find high-quality and innovative products.
It takes time and courage.
It creates an area of tension between the freshest ideas of designers and the companies, which must above all think economically," says Schmidt.
Therefore, an existing design is often only slightly varied to keep a customer base.
A few years ago, textile designer Kati Reuter revived the historic snowball tip.
In some places, the machine embroiders small bells.
Plauen Goldsmith master Bianca Hallebach-KrauÃŸe was inspired by this: "Before then, I couldn't begin with a traditional plauen top."
Now she uses the snowball tip for her jewelry.
In an extensive process, it shapes the pattern in silver.
"Many people of the region identify themselves with the topic Plauener Spit - young and old," says Reuter.
It also supplies to the USA, Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors have lived in plaus and surroundings and who want a memorial.
This makes me see my jewelry as the modern ambassador of the Plauen top.
Disney plans new "Mary Poppins" movie
Legend should not be touched, but Disney still dares to have a new movie of his classic "Mary Poppins".
According to "Entertainment Weekly", however, it is not about re-filming, but about a kind of continuation that plays with the magical child girl 20 years after the first movie.
It's about Nanny's experience with the Banks family in times of the world economic crisis in England.
Whoever plays Poppins more than 50 years after Julie Andrews is still unclear.
But the director is already on record: Rob Marshall, most recently with "Into the Woods" in the cinema.
Xi urges to open the economy wider for the world
The economy needs to open up more outwards to promote growth, said President Xi Jinping on Tuesday a group commissioned to manage the reform.
"China should strive to attract foreign investment and know-how and improve business start-ups strategies," he said in a speech at the 16th meeting of the Central Executive Group for the deepening of a comprehensive reform.
Promoting new start-ups and promoting reforms will bring about new momentum and vitality and provide new space for economic growth, said Xi.
The Management Group has adopted a number of directives, including a negative list of market access rules, relaxation of border control policies, promotion of state enterprises (SOEs), private capital, and a review of the resident information system.
According to the statement, a negative list is drawn up identifying sectors and companies that are not eligible for investment.
The system is gradually tested and improved by test programs.
The initiative is important because it gives the market a greater role to play in the allocation of resources, guarantees a regulatory business environment and makes the market more open, said the statement.
The government will also ease controls on the powers conferred on businesses and ensure that businesses decide how to conduct their business.
The statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms for promoting regional growth.
As part of an offer to open state-controlled sectors, further areas for private investment will be opened up.
"The government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-funded companies and provide better services for them," said the statement.
In addition, it is made easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the "Green Card" by optimizing the requirements and facilitating the application process.
The right of lawyers to carry out their activities and to use professional judges and prosecutors was also discussed at a meeting.
Premier Li Keqiang and important leaders such as Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli also attended the meeting, as reported in a statement published after the meeting.
EU wants to double mercury limit in predatory fish
The European Commission wants to double mercury limits in large predatory fish and thus to give consumers a much higher dose of the nerve poison.
The consumer organisation Foodwatch, which has an appropriate working paper from the EU, strongly criticized the plans: "Risks and adverse effects of bad industrial and environmental policies are passed on to pregnant children and toddlers with full sense," said Matthias Wolfschmidt of Foodwatch.
Wolfschmidt says that the limit values of the nerve poison for large fish at the end of the food chain, such as shark or swordfish for "economic reasons", are to be raised by one to two milligrams of mercury per kilogram of fish.
However, large predatory fish are already so heavily burdened with mercury that, on the basis of the remaining limit values, about 50 percent of catches cannot be sold.
After doubling the limit values, only 14.5% would be unsold.
In return, according to Foodwatch, the EU wants to increase the limits for other fish from currently 0.5 milligrams to 0.1 milligrams of mercury per kilogram.
Foodwatch, however, described this as a "trick" because smaller frying fish, such as carps, are usually so low that they already meet the planned limits.
The reduction in small fish is therefore "a perfidious distraction maneuver that helps the economy alone," Wolfschmidt explained.
Mercury is a highly toxic heavy metal for humans, which is greatly enriched over the food chain, especially in predatory fish.
The Federal Government therefore warns that "very small quantities can cause damage to the nervous system especially in the case of unborn ones".
On its homepage, however, the Federal Ministry of the Environment states that the "health risk of the general population" is not to be expected.
Mercury comes into the environment, especially through coal combustion.
According to a written information from the Federal Ministry of the Environment, the German coal power stations have issued more than six tonnes of mercury per year to the Greens-Bundestag member Annalena Baerbock, two thirds of the total amount emitted in Germany.
The concentration of mercury in fish, for example in Elbe, Rhine and Danube, was "permanently and widely exceeded", the "play" quoted from the paper in March.
Last year Europe-wide warnings about mercury in fish were among the most frequently reported health risks in the EU RASFF warning system.
