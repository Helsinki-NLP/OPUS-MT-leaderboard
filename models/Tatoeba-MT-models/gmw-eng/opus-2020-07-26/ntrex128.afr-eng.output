Members of Welsh Assembly worry they're going to look like fools.
There are constituencies among some members of the meeting about the suggestion that their title should change from AM'e to MWP'e (for Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This was caused by plans to change the name of the meeting to the Welsh Parliament.
Members from across the political spectrum are afraid that it can provoke a mockery.
One member of the Workers' Party says his group is worried because "it's with Twp and Pwp rhym."
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means stupid and pwp means excrement.
A member of the Plaid Cymru party says the group as a whole is "not happy" and has proposed alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party says his group is "accessible" about the change of name, but has noticed that it is a short leap from MWP to Muppet, the British equivalent of fool or fool.
In this context the Welsh letter w as the Yorkshire-English pronunciation of the letter is pronounced you.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently designing legislation to introduce the name changes, said: "The final decision on any description of what is called Assembly Members, will, of course, be a matter for the members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh meeting the power to change his name.
In June the Commission published the results of public consultation on the proposals that had received wide support to call the meeting a Welsh Parliament.
As far as the AM's title was concerned, the Commission elected Welsh Parliament Members of WMPs, but the MWP option received most approval in a consultation with the public.
AM's apparently proposing alternatives, but the struggle to get consensus can be a headache for the chairman, Elin Jones, who must submit within weeks a bill on the changes.
The reform legislation will also include other changes to the meeting's work, including rules on the disqualification of AM's and the design of the committee system.
AM's will get the last say in the question of what they should be called when they debate the legislation.
Macedonians vote in referendum on change of country's name
On Sunday, voters will vote whether their country's name must be changed to the "Republic of Northern Macedonia".
The popular vote was arranged in an attempt to remove a decades-long dispute with neighbor Greece, which itself has a province called Macedonia.
For some time Athens has already insisted that the name of his neighbor in the north represent a claim in his area and repeatedly objected to his applications for membership in the EU and NATO.
The president of Macedonia, Gjöre Ivanov, who opposes the popular vote on the change of name, said that he would ignore the vote.
Supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue, however, that the change of name is simply the price to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of Saint Martin's are getting quiet because churches are struggling in Harlem
"Historyly speaking, say the old people to whom I spoke, there was a bar and a church at every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"None of the two are there today."
He says that the disappearance of bars is understandable.
"People socialize in other ways these days," he said.
"Crowds are no longer neighborhoods' family rooms where people go regularly."
As far as churches are concerned, he is concerned that the money from sales of assets will not last as long as leaders expect, "and sooner or later they are back exactly where they started."
Churches, he adds, can be replaced by apartment buildings with condominiums full of the type of people who will not help the neighborhood’s remaining refuges.
"The vast majority of people who buy units in these buildings will be white," he said, "and therefore the day which these churches completely closes even bring closer, for most of the people who move into these condominiums will probably not become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white churches before Harlem became a black metropolis - Metropolitan Community in 1870, Saint Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodists-congregations moved away in the 1930s.
A black church that worshiped nearby took over the building's title.
Saint Martin's was taken over by a black church led by Ehrw. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers in125th street, a main street for shopping in Harlem, who did not want to appoint or promote black people.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but when Father Johnson's members made plans to rebuild it, they ordered the carillon.
Previous David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor at Saint Martin's, proudly called the carillon "the poor people's bells".
The expert who played the carillon in July called it something else: "A culturous cat" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
The expert, Tiffany Ng of Michigan University, also noted that it was the first carillon in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger carillon at the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather says St. Martin's didn't replace him.
What has been playing at Saint Martin's in the past few months is a complex story of architects and contractors, some brought in by the laymen of the church, others by the Episcopal diocese.
The church council, the church's governing body, which consists of laymen-- wrote in July to the diocese with concern that the diocese "is going to try to transfer the cost" to the church council, although the church council was not involved in the appointment of the architects and contractors who sent the diocese.
Some parishioners complain of a lack of transparency from the diocese's side.
Hey injure 13-year-old on lobster dive in California
A shark attacked a 13-year-old boy on Saturday and injured when he dived for lobster on the first day of the lobster season in California, said officers.
The attack took place shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he was diving with friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and then rowing with a group to help him pull out of the water.
Hammel said he thought at first it was just the excitement of a first lobster, but then he realized "that he called, 'I was bitten!
I'm bitten!'
His whole keybone was torn open," Hammel saw when he came to the boy.
'I called that all should come out of the water: 'There is a shark in the water!' added Hammel.
The boy was flown to the Rady Children’s Hospital in San Diego, where his condition is described as critical.
It is unknown which shark species is responsible for the attack.
Larry Giles said at a media education session that a shark was noticed in the area a few weeks ago, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim had suffered traumatic injuries in the upper part of his upper body.
Officers closed beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours to investigate and security reasons.
Giles notes that there are over 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's planned extension to UK beauty market
Sainsbury's say Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams are fighting with department store-type beauty walks manned by specialist assistants.
As part of a large expansion in the UK's £2.8 billion beauty market, which continues to grow as sales of fashion and household goods recede, the larger beauty walks in 11 shops across the country will be tested and if a success is taken to more stores next year.
The investment in beauty takes place while supermarkets search for ways to fill shelves once used for TVs, microwaves and household goods.
Sainsbury's says that it will double the size of its available beauty products to 3,000 products, which will include for the first time trade names such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing series of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also have more place with brand-specific areas similar to those seen in shops such as Boots.
The supermarket also launches its Boutique makeup series so that the majority of products are vegan-friendly - something that more and more younger buyers demand.
In addition, the perfume retailer, The Fragrance Shop will test sessions in two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croydon in southern London last week and a second that will open in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Internet shopping and a move to smaller quantities of food purchased daily at local convenience shops means supermarkets should do more to persuade people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, the chief executive officer of Sainsbury's, said that the shops are going to look more like department stores when the supermarket chain tries to fight with more services and non-food products against Aldi and Lidl stores.
Sainsbury's placed Argos outlets in hundreds of shops and also introduced a number of Habitat outlets since it bought both of these chains two years ago, which have strengthened according to their groceries sales and made the purchases more profitable.
The supermarket's previous attempt to renew its beauty and pharmacy departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the relationship was ended after an argument as to how the profits from the pharmacies should be distributed within his shops.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's three years ago sold his 281 store pharmacy for £125m to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain.
It says Lloyds will play a role in the plan by offering an extensive range of luxury skin care products, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's trade director, said, "We have transformed the appearance and feeling of our beauty walks to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in special-trained colleagues who will be on hand to offer advice.
Our series of trade names is designed to meet every need and the attractive environment and convenient locations means that we are now a challenging beauty destination that challenges the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones' anger after Holly Willoughby withdraws from $111 million agreement
Dragons Den-ster Peter Jones had run away 'voicing' after TV provider Holly Willoughby had withdrawn her from a £11 million agreement with his lifestyle trade mark business to focus on her contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby didn't have time for their home clothing and constituency business name, Truly.
The couple's business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop trade name.
The This Morning Provider, 37, announced on Instagram that she was withdrawing her.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons Den-star Peter Jones angry by finally withdrawing from their profitable lifestyle brand business - to focus on her own giant contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Bronne says that Jones was "enraged" when TV's golden girl was at a tense meeting in the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, announced that her new opportunities - worth up to £1.5 million - mean that she can no longer spend enough time on their home clothes-and-competition-trade name, Truly.
The business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop trade name and would have doubled Willoughby's estimated £111 million fortune.
While Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones got on a jet and traded Britain for one of his vacation homes.
A source says, "Truly was Holly's greatest priority at a distance.
It would be her long - term future that would carry her over the coming few decades.
Her decision to withdraw her was absolutely stunned by all those involved.
No one could believe Tuesday what was happening, it was so close to the introduction.
There's a warehouse full of goods at the Marlow headquarters that's ready to be sold."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the This Morning provider, one of Britain’s stars that causes most money to flow in, can chase the firm millions out of the bag as a result of the huge investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and home clothing, and the possibility that its introduction may encounter even more delays.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin has been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
In 2016, Willoughby prepared Truly with Capp and joined Jones, 52, as chairman in March.
The couples are on vacation together and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will become a trademark samba for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as a provider of ITV's I'm a Celebrity.
A source near Jones said last night, "We won't comment on his business affairs."
Hard words 'and then we fall in love'
He mocked at criticism he was going to get from the news media because he made a comment that some would view as "unpredictive" and because he was so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in his kamma- "new reader's voice."
"I gave up nothing."
He mentioned that Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump described their first conference in June in Singapore as a great step towards the nuclear disarmament of North Korea.
However, negotiations on nuclear disarmament have burned down.
North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, said Saturday, more than three months after the June leadership convention in Singapore, to leaders at the UN General Assembly that the North did not see an "conform reaction" of the U.S. on North Korea's early disarmament activities.
Instead, he noticed, the U.S. continues with slums aimed at maintaining the pressure.
Trump made a much more optimistic impact in his convention talk.
"We're progressing perfectly with North Korea," he said."
"We were on our way to begin a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have this wonderful relationship."
He says that his efforts to improve relations with Kim have produced positive results, ending rocket tests, helping free hostages, and causing the rest of American soldiers to be brought back home.
And he defended his unusual approach to descriptions of relationships with Kim.
"It's so easy to be presiding, but instead of 10,000 people out there trying to get into 'this crowded arena, we would have had nearly 200 people standing there," Trump said while pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
Tidal wave and earthquake in Indonesia destroyed island, dead hundreds
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations have been said not to be needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population has been uprooted, no national disaster has been announced, a prerequisite for calibrating international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they were very clear that they were not asking for international help, which made it a bit difficult," said I. Summing.
Although Save the Children is setting up a team to travel to Palu, it is not certain whether foreign personnel can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian officials are assisting the situation in Palu to see if international agencies will be allowed to contribute to the assistance effort.
Given the constant global tremor that Indonesia continues, the country is sadly prepared for the wrath of nature.
While tsunami shelters were built in Aceh, it is not a common sight on other coastlines.
The apparent lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu probably contributed to the loss of life, though a warning of strength.
Traveling between Indonesia’s many islands is at its best challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is heading to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo made the improvement of Indonesia's refined infrastructure a central point of his election campaign and issued swirling money on roads and railways.
But Mr. Joko’s administration is plagued by funding shortages that he faces next year’s reelection.
Mr. Joko also faced the pressure of sloppy sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority accepted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were displaced like Christian and Muslim gangs with machetes, arrows and bows, and other primitive weapons fought on the streets.
Watch: Liverpool’s Daniel Sturridge kicks good equalizer against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London from a prime league loss against Chelsea for a purpose in the 89th minute.
Xherdan Shaqiri reported to Sturridge when he was about 30 years out of the Chelsea target and his team 1-0 behind.
He typed the ball to the left before he kicked far toward the target pole.
The effort was sailing high over the frame as it floated to the upper right corner of the net.
Finally, the ball over a jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga tumbled and fell into the net.
"It was only to try to come into that position, to come on the ball, and players like Shaq always play forward as far as possible, so I just tried to create as much time as possible for myself," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw edge coming and typing once and not thinking too much about it and just kicking."
Chelsea was at halftime 1-0 before the Belgian star Eden Hazad had recorded a purpose in the 25th minute.
The Blues' goal head replayed to Mateo Kovacic in that playroom with a back-up before he rolled close to the middle field and nailed into Liverpool's helmets.
Kovacic received and reported rapidly in the midfield.
With a beautiful forward-scope, he then led Hazad into the frame.
Hazad passed the defense and ended with a left foot-head past Liverpool's Alisson Becker in the farthest destination.
Liverpool is fighting Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at Stadium San Paolo in Naples, Italy, on Wednesday at 3 p.m.
Chelsea comes in front of Videoton in London in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday to 3 p.m.
Death count rises to 832 after Indonesian tsunami
The death toll in Indonesia’s earthquake and tsunami climbed to 832, the country’s disaster agency said early Sunday.
It was reported that many people were trapped under the garbage of buildings which had caused the earthquake, which struck at 7.5 on Friday, to collapse, and caused burners of up to 20 feet, the agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said to a news conference.
The city of Palu, with its more than 380,000 people, was sown with the ruins of broken buildings.
Political arresting husband, 32, suspecting murder after woman has been stabbed to death
A murder investigation was launched after a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old was found at 7.55 a.m. in Grayson Mews in John Street with knifesticks, and a 32-year-old man was arrested under suspicion of murder.
The police urged people in the area who had heard or seen anything to move forward.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: 'The investigation is in an early stage, but I appeal to anyone who was in the circumference of John Street in Birkenhead who had seen or heard anything suspicious, to contact us.
I also appeal to anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have caught anything on dashcam film material, to contact us since they can have information that can be essential to our investigation.'
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead, and that she was found within a property.
This afternoon friends who are said to know the woman arrived at the scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
Investigations continue, since the police said they were in the process of informing the victim’s immediate existence.
A taxi driver who had lived in Grayson Mews had just tried to return to his apartment but was told by the police that no one was allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he discovered what had happened.
Residents are now told that it will take hours before they are released again.
It was heard that a police officer told one man that the whole area was now treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared in tears on the scene.
She repeatedly said 'it's so ugly'.
At 2 nm there were two police cars inside the cordon with another cart just outside.
A number of officers are left inside the cordon to monitor the block apartments.
Anyone with information is asked to link @MerPolCC to DM, 101 or connect Crimestoppers anonymously by 0800 555 111 with log 247 of 30 September as a reference.
Parliament's Statute of Cromwell becomes latest memorial with 'rewriting history' dispute
His banishment will be poetic justice for his Talibanlike destruction of so many of England’s cultural and religious art objects carried out by its fanatic Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Association described Mr. Crick's proposal as "punishment" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Association, said, "It was inevitable in the current debate about removing statues that Oliver Cromwell's form outside the Palace of Westminster would become a target.
The imaging of the English civil wars was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of his forefather Thomas in the last century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's handiful portrayal of Cromwell is evidence of 19th-century opinion and part of the history of a figure which many believe to be still memorable.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is seen by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case, of course the monarchy.
Whether it is an entirely accurate portrayal is the subject of ongoing historical debate.
It is firmly established that the conflict of the mid-17th century formed the later development of our nation, and that Cromwell is an individually recognizable figure representing one side of that separation.
His success as a Protector is also worthy of celebration and commemoration."
Murder Roaming Chinese Boer
According to local media reports, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in southwest China.
The man, identified only by his of, "Yuan", was found dead with a torn butcher covered with blood near a cage at the market in Liupanshui in the Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post Sunday reported.
On May 30, 2005, a Varkboer prepares to inject pigs with vaccines into a pig farm in Xining of Qinghai province, China.
He was reportedly traveling with his cousin of neighboring Yunnan Province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead and found a door to a neighboring pighoke open.
He said there was a great male pig in the cage with blood at his mouth.
A forensic investigation, according to the report, confirmed that the 550-pond pig had bitten the farmer to death.
"My cousin's legs were bleeding and torn," the cousin, who was called on his of, "Wu," said the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera film material showed Yuan entering the market on Thursday at 4.40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man does not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told the Evening New that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking someone else, while the police collected evidence on the scene.
Yuan’s family and the market authorities are said to negotiate compensation for his death.
Although weird, cases of swine that attack people have been reported before.
In 2016 a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and left the man with critical injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 650 pound pig had tied a Welsh farmer to its tractor until his wife had deterred the animal.
After a farmer from Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBS News that pigs are not normally aggressive but that the taste of blood can act as a "faster".
"They're not playable.
They're picks, very curious... they're not intent on hurting you.
You just have to show them the right amount of respect," he said.
Res from Hurricane Rosa, widespread heavy rain goes to southwest United States.
As foretold, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it moves over the cooler waters of the north coast of Mexico.
Rosa, however, will bring flooding across northern Mexico and southwest U.S.A. over the coming days.
Rosa had winds of 85 m.p.u., a category of 1 hurricane from 5 a.m. on Sunday and was placed 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a troop across the Pacific is beginning to take shape and move east to the west coast of the US. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will start to drive heavy tropical humidity northward into the southwest US.
Rosa will bring rain from up to 10 inches on Monday in parts of Mexico.
Then tropical moisture will bring widespread heavy rainfall to the southwest in response to the approaching trick over the coming days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous quick floods, waste flow, and possibly land spills in the desert.
Heavy tropical humidity will cause rainfall sites of up to 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
So much as 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in parts of the southwest, especially over most of Arizona.
Soon floods may be with rapidly worsening conditions because of the scattered nature of tropical rain.
It would be extremely unwise to venture on foot into the desert with the danger of tropical rainfall.
Heavy rain can cause deep cloves to touch waste rivers and thunderstorms will bring severe local winds and dust clouds.
The approaching trog will bring some local heavy rain to parts of the coastline of Southern California.
Rainfall totals of more than half an inch are possible, which can cause small waste flow and smooth rhymes.
It will be region’s first rainfall of the wet season.
A few scattered tropical showers will begin to reach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday before the rain gets more widespread Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the Four Corners on Tuesday and last until Wednesday.
October, intense temperature fluctuations across the U.S. can be seen as the Arctic cools, but the tropics keep warm.
This sometimes results in dramatic temperature changes over short distances.
A good example of dramatic temperature differences throughout the central U.S. on Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of nearly 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, numerous summer temperatures will try to rise and expand again.
It is expected that large parts of the central and eastern US will begin warm October, with widespread 80s from the Southern Plain to parts of the northeast.
New York City can reach 80 degrees [80 ° C] on Tuesday, about 10 degrees above the average.
Our long term climate forecast indicates a higher risk of above average temperatures for the eastern US for the first half of October.
Over 20 million people looking board Kavanaugh-answered
More than 20 million people watched Thursday on six television networks the thrilling testimony of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and Christians Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of a sexual assault that was said to have taken place in the 1980s.
In the meantime, the political deadpoint continued, with broadcasters interrupting regular programs for Friday's up-the-drop: an agreement reached by Arizona-senator Jeff Flake is for the FBI to carry out a week-long investigation.
Ford told the Senate-Legal Committee that she was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh caught her in drunkenness and tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a passionate testimony, said he was 100 percent sure that it didn't happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people watched it on Friday, reported Nielsen.
The company counted average viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC.
Figures were not immediately available for other networks that showed them, including PBS, C-SPAN and the Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen sometimes finds it difficult to measure people who are looking at offices.
To put this in perspective, it's an audience as big as one for a decisive football game or the Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose opinion hosts strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, was all the networks ahead with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day-long trial, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, said Nielsen.
Interest continued high after the trial.
Flakes were the central figure in Friday’s drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that he was going to vote in favor of Kavanaugh, he was caught Friday morning at CNN- and CBS- where objectors shouted at him when he tried to take an elevator to a judicial committee.
He stood a few minutes with his eyes blown down while CNN vividly portraying how he was being disapproved.
"I'm standing right here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he tells the country the truth?
He was told, "You've got power while so many women are powerless."
Flake said that his office had issued a statement and had gone to the elevator door, saying that he would have more to say to the committee questioning.
The cable and broadcasting networks all later covered living hours when the Legal Committee would vote to promote Kavanaugh's appointment to the full Senate for a voice.
But Flake said he would only do it with the understanding that the FBI would look at the charges against the candidate for the next week, as the Democrat-minority requested.
Flake is partially convinced by conversations with his friend, Democrat Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators thereafter, Flake made his decision.
Flake’s choice was powerful because it was obvious that Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump filed an FBI investigation after the charges against Kavanaugh.
British EM May accuses critics of 'political game' on Brexit
First Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union, accused of "political play" with Britain's future and undermining national importance in an interview with the Sunday Times curator.
Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May will arrive on September 29, 2018 for the Consequence Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain.
In another interview next to the one with her on the cover of the paper, her former minister of foreign affairs Boris Johnson continued his attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit and said that a proposal that Britain and the EU should collect each other's rates was "fully ridiculous".
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrests suspicious Dyteon Simpson in LSU player's death
The police arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and arrested on a charge of second-grade murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials issued a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police said Sims had lost his glasses during the struggle.
The police found the glasses on the scene and said they had found Simpson's DNA on it, reports CBS-affiled WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, the police said he admitted that he had shot Wayde.
His bail was set at $350,000, the lawyer reported.
On Friday, the judicial body-view office of East Baton Rouge Parish issued a preliminary report saying that the cause of death was a gunshot wound on the head at the neck.
The department praises the Louisiana State Police's runaway task force, the state police's crime laboratory, Southern University police and local citizens for their help with the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanks territory law application for his "practice and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The six-foot-ses predicted grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played for LSU basketball.
His average past season was 5.6 points and 2.6 jumps per game.
Friday morning LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team in "slaught" and "in shock" about Wayde's death.
"This is what you worry about all the time," said Wayde.
Volcano spits as at Mexico City
Assaying from the Popocatepeti volcano has reached the southern neighborhoods of Mexico’s capital city.
The National Center for Ramp Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after taking up activity in the crater and registered 183 releases of gas and ash over 24 hours.
The center monitored multiple rumblings and tremors.
Images on social media showed how thin low gas covers car windshields in neighborhoods of Mexico City, as Xochimilco did.
Geophysicists have marked an increase in activity at the volcano, which has taken 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital since an earthquake with a size of 7.1 central-Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clashes with Catalan separatists before celebration of independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters collided with riot police, and thousands joined counter protests to commemorate the first anniversary of Catalonia’s polarizing voice for reprisals.
A group of masked pro-separatists, held back by rioting police, had ignited them with eggs and threw powder paint that caused dark dust clouds in streets that were usually teeming with tourists.
A foundry also broke out later in the day, and the police had to use their clubs to control the fight.
In several hours pro-independence groups in one tone "No forget, no forgiveness" sang in confrontation with the Unionists' cries of "Long Life Spain".
Fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries suffered in the processions, reported the local press.
The tension continues to run high in the independence-based region a year after the referendum of 1 October by Madrid was considered illegal but celebrated by separatists-Catalans.
Dialers voted overwhelmingly to become independent but the participation was low, with those against abjection that largely chocoed the voice.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried in violent clashes to prevent the voterry from continuing at the voting rooms throughout the region.
Pro-dependence groups camped overnight to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration continued but was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist demonstration with his wife, said he was no longer hopeful for the prospect that Catalonia would gain independence.
"Last year we went through one of the best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy because they could vote but now we are stuck," he said.
Despite a vital yet clumsy victory in regional elections last December, Catalan pro-dependence parties this year struggled to maintain momentum, with many of their best - known leaders either in self-imposed exile or in detention in prejudice for their role in organizing the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanism who recorded the demonstration in support of the police on his phone, says the conflict was triggered by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more and more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalonian leaders in pre-trial detention since last year, announced that he would be standing in European Parliament elections next year.
"To stand as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to disapprove of the decline in democratic values and the oppression we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after car against home fasting
Three men, 33, 34 and 39 years old, were arrested after a car had repeatedly locked against a house in Londonderry.
The incident unfolded Thursday at about 19:30 BST in Ballynagardsing.
Inspector Bob Blemings said that damage was done to the gates and the building itself.
A crossbow may also have been shot at some point in the car.
Menga target gives Livingston 1-0 victory over Rangers
Dolly Menga’s first goal for Livingston assures victory
Advanced Liviston surprised Rangers to transfer Steven Gerrard to just his second defeat in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga’s goal was to show the difference when Gary Holt’s team moved to second with Hibernian.
Gerrard's team stayed this season in the premiere without losing a way and came to stand next week before the forerunners Heart, which is their eight points ahead.
Rangers are not until Thursday host for Rapid Vienna in the Europaliga.
Meanwhile Livingston extended their unconquered run in the division to six matches, with chief coach Holt who still didn't taste defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston wastes chances against bot visitors
Holt's team must have preceded long before they had recorded a purpose, with their frenzy which Rangers had faced all sorts of problems.
SR broke through but wore in front of the goal gate, then AL was able to play far after he approached and met CH’s headhold across the target gate.
The hosts were content to have Rangers play before them, knowing that they could get the visitors with death - game moments.
And so came the decisive goal.
Rangers lost a freehead and Livingston created an opportunity, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson who together gave Menga the chance to kick and draw a target from the center of the frame.
By then, Rangers had dominated but could not pass through the home defense, and the targetess Liam Kelly was largely careless.
That pattern was continued in the second half even though Alfredo Morelos had forced a stroke of Kelly.
Scott Pittman was denied by the feet of Rangers' goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow typed wide to avoid still open play of Livingston.
Crossings repeatedly reached Livingston’s frame and stopped repeatedly, while two fines — after Halkett’s challenge of substitute Glenn Middleton and one for handball — were rejected.
‘Feminal’ by Livingston – analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at the Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal game and results for Livingston.
To the last man was excellent; they still exceed expectations on this upward course.
Their game style and manship have been almost unchanged since their return to first place, but much honor comes to Holt for the way he has strengthened the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Hackett was giant with his manificent defense arrangement as Menga kept on their toes for Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall.
Rangers, however, lacked inspiration.
As good as they could at times under Gerrard, they could not uphold those standards.
Their final ball was missing and only once could they pass through the home team, which was somewhat of an alarm call for Rangers, who found them in mid-division.
Erdogan gets mixed reception in Cologne
On Saturday, September 29 saw smiles and blue air when leaders from Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
That's the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which had to restore relations between NATO allies.
They had a failure on issues that include the entry of human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey to the EU.
Erdogan went to Cologne to open a giant new mosque.
The city houses the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police quoted security reasons to prevent the 25,000-strong crowd from meeting in front of the mosque, but many supporters then arrived to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters – many of their Kurdies – also made their voices thick and condemned both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
The warring demonstrations reflect the division of a visitor, who is greeted by some German Turks as hero, and is excavated by others as autocrat.
Deptford road accident: Biker dies in collision with engine
A cyclist died in a collision in London involving an automobile.
The collision took place about 10:15 BST near the connection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford in the southeast of the city.
The driver of the car stopped, and paramedics were present, but the man died on the scene.
The collision comes months after another cyclist died in a hit-and-step in Childers Street, about a mile from where Saturday's accident occurred.
The Metropolitan Police said officials were working to identify the man and notify his immediate relatives.
Padlocks and bus tours were recommended in place, and motorists were advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six wardens in riot injury
Six guards were injured in a riot at a high security man's prison, said the prison office.
Resurrection broke out about BST 09:30 on Sunday and is still under way at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire.
Specialist "Tornado keepers" were called to handle the riot, which includes eight prisoners and is limited to one wing.
The wardens were treated on the scene for minor facial injuries.
A prisoner service spokesman said: "Specially trained prison personnel are being developed to pay attention to an ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and make it clear that those responsible for the police will be referred to and can stay behind bars longer."
HMP Long Martin houses more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country’s most dangerous offenders.
There was reported in June that the chief of the prison had received hospital treatment after he had been attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, riot officials were called on to pay attention to serious disorder in which personnel with billiard balls were attacked.
Hurricane Rosa Dreig Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City With Kitsfluge (Drooge Areas Trek Dalk Advantage)
It's unusual that a tropical low pressure hit Arizona but that's exactly what might happen early next week when Hurricane Rosa's remaining energy moves across the southwest desert and brings instant flood risks.
The National Weather Service has already issued instant flood watches for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeast California, and Utah, including the cities Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa Tuesday is expected to take a direct route across Phoenix, and by Monday will approach rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix observed in a twiet that only "ten tropical cyclones have retained tropical storm or depression status since 1950 within 200 miles of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the AZ border."
The National Hurricane Center's models predict 2 to 4 inches of rainfall, with isolated amounts of up to 6 inches in the Mogollon edge of Arizona.
Other parts of the U.S. southwest, including the central Rockies and the Great Come, are likely to have 1 to 2 thumbs, with isolated totals of possibly up to 4 inches.
For those out of instant risk, Rosa's rain will likely be a blessing, as the region is plagued by drought.
Although floods are a very serious issue, this rainfall will probably be beneficial as the southwest is currently in drought.
According to the U.S. Dry Monitor, only over 40 percent of Arizona are experiencing at least extreme drought, the second highest category," reportedweather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa’s road leads to the approach of land across the Baja California Peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, still at hurricane strength on Sunday morning, with maximum winds of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moves north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm encounters cooler water in the Pacific, so her strength decreases.
So she is expected to reach the country in the afternoon or evening at tropical storm strength in Mexico.
Rainfall over parts of Mexico can be heavy and pose a significant flood risk.
"Rainfalls from 3 to 6 inches are expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with up to 10 inches possible,"weather.com reported.
Rosa will then move as a tropical storm north over Mexico before Tuesday in the early hours of the morning to Arizona as a tropical depression and will then move through Arizona and into southern Utah by late Tuesday evening.
"The greatest danger expected of Rosa is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwest Sonora and the US southwest," said the National Hurricane Center.
These rains are expected to cause life - threatening rapid floods and ruins in the deserts and landslides in the mountainous areas.
Midsummer Norton attack: Four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenage boys A 20-year-old man was arrested under suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old with sting wounds was found in Somerset.
The injured teenage boy was found on Saturday at about 4:00 BST in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to the hospital where he was still in a "stable" state.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds, and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, said Avon and Somerset Police.
Officers have appealed to anyone who may have any mobile image material of what has happened to come out.
Trump says Kavanaugh that 'fell under the mediocre, the anger' of the Democratic Party.
"A voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to reject the merciless and shocking tactics of the Democratic Party," said Trump at a convention in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh had "suffered under the mediocre, the anger" of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh witnessed Thursday before Congress and fervently and emotionally denied a claim of Christine Blasey Ford that he had sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also witnessed her claim at the hearing.
The president said Saturday the Americans saw that day "the brilliant and quality and courage" of Kavanaugh.
"A voice to confirm Judge Kavanaugh, is a voice to confirm one of the most capable legal spirits of our time, a jurisprudence with a pure record of public service," he told the crowd West Virginia supporters.
The president referred indirectly to Kavanaugh's nomination as he spoke about the importance of Republican attendance at the mid-term elections.
"Five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lifetime.
I'm not standing, but actually I'm standing," he said.
That's why I fight for these candidates everywhere."
Trump argued that the Democrats were on a mission to "resist and hinder."
The first important procedural voice on the Senate floor over Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior GOP leadership assistant told CNN.
Hundreds of death from Indonesian shaking, tsunami, with numbers still rising
At least 384 people were dead and many washed away when giant waves broke on beaches when a great earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday for a festival on the beach when surfers broke up to six feet (18 feet) high at sundown on the beach, many washed away after their death and destroyed everything that was in the road.
The tsunami followed a 7.5-range earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still busy doing their activities on the beach and didn't run immediately and they became victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's disaster relief agency BNPB during an information session in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come on its own, it carried cars, logs, houses, it struck everything on the ground," said Nugroho and added that the tsunami had moved over the open sea at speeds of 800 km/h (497 m/h) before it hit the coast.
Some people climbed in trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
Some 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Airphotos released by the disaster agency show many buildings and shops that have been destroyed, bridges that have been distorted and collapsed and a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday aftershocks still rocked the coastal city.
A series of earthquakes were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's agency for the evaluation and application of technology (BPPT) stated in a statement that the energy released by Friday's giant holocaust was about 200 times the power of the atom bomb that had fallen on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city, which sits at the tip of a long, narrow bay, could have aggravated the size of the tsunami, they said.
Nugroho described the damage as "remarkable" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels have collapsed.
Body bodies of some victims were found trapped under the debris of buildings that collapsed, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the accidents and damage can be greater along the coastline 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the earthquake shark.
Communication "is completely impaired with no information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are over 300,000 people living there, the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that their staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"It's already a disaster, but it can get much worse," they said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for not telling that a tsunami had hit Palu, although officials said that the waves had come at times the warning had been issued.
In amateur footage shared on social media, can be heard a man on the top floor of a building cry desperate warnings about the oncoming tsunami to the people down the street.
Within minutes, a wall of water hits the beach and drags buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately declare the image material authentic.
The shaking and tsunami caused great power interruptions that cut off communication around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army began to send cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, said authorities, but evacuates still need food and other basic necessities.
The city’s airport was reopened only for assistance efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was to visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
Indonesia-tsunami mortality rates rise above 800.
This is very bad.
Although World Vision’s staff from Donggala arrived safely in Palu-city where employees in decked shelters erected in their office courtyard, they passed by on their way at scenes of destruction, Mr. Doseba said.
They told me that they had seen many houses that had been destroyed," he said.
This is very bad.
Even while assistance groups begin the terrible task of setting up the disaster relief task, some people complained that foreign aid workers were being prevented from traveling to Palu with much experience.
According to Indonesian guidelines, funds, supplies, and personnel from overseas can only begin after the area of the disaster has been declared a national disaster area.
This has not yet happened.
"It is still a disaster on provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As soon as the government says, "Well, it's a national disaster," we could open it up for international assistance, but it hasn't got a status yet."
With the arrival of the second evening on Palu after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, friends and relatives of those who have been missing are hopeful that their loved ones will be the miracles that will bring relief to the sad story line of natural disasters.
Saturday a little boy was taken out of a sewer.
Sunday rescuers saved a woman for two days under rubble was stuck with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandano, coach of the Indonesian national parachute weaving team, conducted two of the missing parachute weavers for the Asian Games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
More of those trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mandagi, were his students.
"As a senior in the parachute field I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon relates how, in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel on social media circulated under the parachute society, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the Palu participants who participated in the beach festival.
His messages, however, were only answered with one gray check mark, instead of two blue marks.
"I think that means the messages have not been delivered," he said.
Thieves steal $26 750 while refilling OTM at Newport on the Levee
Thieves stole $26 750 on Friday morning from a Brink's worker who had refilled an OTM at Newport on the Levee, according to a news release from the Newport Police Station.
The driver of the car was clearing an OTM in an entertainment complex and preparing to deliver more money, detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.
While he was busy, another man came running from behind the Brink's worker and stole the bag of money that had to be delivered.
According to the release, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing from the scene, but the police did not specify the number involved by the incident.
Anyone with information about their identities should contact Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West will change his name – to Ye
With the announcement of the change on Twitter Saturday, he wrote: "The being formerly known as Kanye West."
West, 41, had been nicknamed Ye for some time and used the nickname as the title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to introduce his new all Yandhi.
He replaced Ariana Grande on the program that had canceled for "emotional reasons", said the program's manufacturer.
Besides being an abbreviation of his present professional name, West has said in the past that the word has religious meaning to him.
"I believe 'ye' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," West said earlier this year when he discussed his album title with radio provider Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
It went from Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye – just the reflection of our good, our bad, our confusion, all.
The album is more a reflection of who we are."
He's one of a number of well-known rappers who changed their names.
Sean Combs, among other things, has been known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, or Diddy, but this year announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
A former West worker, JAY-Z, has already arrived with or without a link sign and capital letters.
Mexico’s AMLO promises not to use military force against civilians
Mexican newly elected President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has entered the country's 50th anniversary of a bloody retribution against students to never use military power against civilians.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza to "never ever use the military to control the Mexican people."
Soldiers shot at a peaceful demonstration in the plaza on October 2, 1968, where as many as 300 people died at a time when left-wing student movements throughout Latin America took place.
Lopez Obrador promised to support young Mexicans by granting monthly grants to those who study and open more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and a lack of training opportunities drew the youth to gangs.
US needs to double AI funding
With China becoming more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount it spends on research in that field, investor and AI practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple, said.
The comments come after several parts of the US government have made AI announcements, even if short the US a complete formal AI strategy.
In the meantime, China announced its plan last year: they aim to be the No. 1 in AI innovation by 2030.
"Dubble the AI research budget will be a good start, given that all the other countries are so far behind the U.S. and we are looking for the next breakthrough in AI," Lee said.
Doubling funding may double the chances that the next major AI performance in the U.S., Lee said this week in an interview to CNBC.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the HUB of Sinovation Ventures, which invested in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980's at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that called the highest rated American Othello player and later became a executive officer at Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee recognized previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's robotics challenge and asked when the next one will be, to help identify the next visionary.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to win government seats, said Lee.
"It's not China that takes away the academic leaders; it's the corporates," Lee said.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have in recent years appointed influential individuals from other universities to work on AI.
Lee says immigration policy changes can also help to help the U.S. AI efforts.
"I think green cards should be offered automatically to PhDs in AI," he said.
China’s State Council issued their next generation Development Plan for Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
China’s National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people at academic institutions similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to US researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a joint center for artificial intelligence aimed at involving partners from the industry and academic world, and the White House announced the formation of a Cure Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it is currently investing more than $100 million a year in AI research.
In the meantime, U.S. legislation aimed at creating a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not come under fire for months.
Macedonians must change their vote in election or country name
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia voted in a referendum about whether their name should be changed to "Republic of Northern Macedonia", action that would solve a decade-old discourse with Greece that blocked its membership boats for the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province named Macedonia, insists that their northern neighbor's name represents a claim in the area and has refused their admission to NATO and the EU.
The two governments made an agreement in June, based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents reasoned that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and a boycot campaign had sowed doubts as to whether the attendance would meet the minimum 50 percent needed for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum letter read: "Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership accepting the agreement with Greece."
Supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev argued that it was a price that could be paid for admission to Macedonia, one of the countries that came from the collapse of Yugoslavia, to bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they could live free under the umbrella of the European Union, for it means safer lives for all of us, Olivera Georgijevska, 79, said in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, enough Members of Parliament said that they would accept the outcome of the vote to decide.
The change of name would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The State election commission said there were no reports of inconsistencies at 1 p.m.
But the attendance was then only 16 percent, compared with 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 percent of the registered voters voted.
"I came to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe," said Gosse Tanevski, 62, a constituent in the capital Skopje.
Macedonia’s EM, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica, and his son Dushko bring out their voices for the referendum in Macedonia on the change of the country’s name that will pave the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union, in Stromica, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
Before the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small wedding and approached chairs before tents set up by those who went to the referendum boycott.
"We are in favor of NATO and the EU, but we want to join our heads up, not through the back door." said Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia to become part of the Euro-Asia integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership will bring much needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe the great majority will be in favor of it, for more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favor of the EU and NATO," said Zaev after he had expressed his voice.
He said a "yes" outcome will be "confirmation of our future."
A survey published last Monday by Macedonia’s Institute for Policy Research said between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum – less than the required amount.
Another recording, performed by Macedonia's Telma TV, found that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of them, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For the referendum to succeed, attendance must be 50 percent plus one voice.
A setback in the referendum will be the first serious setback to the policy of a pro-Western government since the government took over last May.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero navigation through Brighton defense for purpose
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling removed the Brighton defense in Manchester City's 2-0 won on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it ridiculously easy to look at his goal in the 65th minute.
At the beginning of the series, the Argentine goalhead received an event from the middle field.
He chased between three Brighton defenders before he struck the open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green shirts.
He passed by one defender before he had crossed several others on the brink of the Brighton target.
He then pushed an ane to the left, where he found Sterling.
The English forecaster used his first touch in the cage to send the ball back to Aguero, which used his right foot to knock out the Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a kick to the right of the net.
"Aguero struggles with problems with his feet," City manager Pep Guardiola told journalists.
"We talked about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
That is what happened.
We are happy that he has at that moment recorded a purpose."
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial benefit in the Premier League struggle.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
At that stake Aguero received the ball deep into the Brighton area.
He sent a beautiful ball along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane had some touch before he led Sterling to the farthest angle.
The Sky Blues foretold kicking the ball in the net just before he was over the back line.
City takel Hoffenheim in Kampioeneliga Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. by Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to spoil play against Rockies
With the Nationals out of the playout, there's not much reason to force another start.
But the ever-competent Scherzer wants to take on Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if there are still play-outs for the Rockies, which has a one match-forward above the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies got at least a promoter place with a 5-2 win over the Nationals Friday evening, but still wants to fix their first divisional title.
"Though we play for nothing, we can at least play the game knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver will probably stare with the crowd and the other team on the highest level of any point of me this year.
Why don't I want to participate in it?"
The Nationals still have to announce their starting player for Sunday, but is reportedly favorable to have Scherzer thrown in such a situation.
Scherzer, who will begin to have his 34th, had a throw-practice session on Thursday and will play on his normal rest- Sunday.
The Washington right hand is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 halls in 220 2/3 turns this season.
Trump holds conventions in West Virginia
The president referred indirectly to the situation surrounding his Supreme Court choice Brett Kavanaugh as he spoke about the importance of Republican attendance at the mid - term elections.
"All we've done is at stake in November.
Five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our lives.
It's one of the big, big -- I don't stand, but I'm actually standing and that's why I fight all over for these candidates," he said.
Trump went on, 'One sees this ugly, ugly radical group of democrats, one sees it happening now.
And they are now determined to take back the power by using any possible way, one sees the displeasure, the genius.
They don't care who hurts them, who they have to walk to get power and control, that's what they want, power and strength, we're not going to give it to them."
Democratics, he said, is on a mission to "stand up and hinder."
"And one sees it about the past four days," he said, calling the democrats "damage and mean and ingenious and false."
He was referring to the name Senate’s judicial committee’s high - ranking Dianne Feinstein, who received hard bonds from the audience.
"Do you remember her answer?
Have you checked the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh no, I'm waiting one – it was really poor body language – the weakest body language I've ever seen."
Workers' party is no longer a broad church.
It is intolerant to those who say what they think
When Momentum's activists in my local party voted to place me under censorship, it was not exactly a surprise.
After all, I'm the last person in a string Workers' Party LP's told who we weren't welcome – all because we said what we think.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received similar treatments because she stood up fearlessly against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censorship criticized me for differing from Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically enough similar issues over which Jeremy had differed with previous leaders.
The notice for the Nottingham East Workers' Party meeting on Friday said that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For most of my eight years as the local Labor Party LP, that was exactly what Friday’s AR meetings were.
Unfortunately, it is not today the tone of many meetings and the promise of "friendlier, more gracious" politics is long forgotten, if it has ever begun.
It has become increasingly evident that different views are not tolerated within the Labour Party, and every opinion is judged on the basis of whether they are acceptable for the party’s leadership.
It began shortly after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues with whom I thought I had previously shared similar political outlooks, began to expect me to make a U turn and take positions that I would never otherwise have agreed with – whether on national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public – and it doesn't really matter what I say – there is a tyrant of abusive language on social media who asks that I be not re-elected, disapproval of politics from the core and to tell me that I should not be in the Labour Party.
And that is not just my experience.
Actually, I am happier than some of my colleagues because the comments I make tend to be political.
I have a lot of respect for professionalism and determination for those colleagues who stare at each day a deluge of sexist or racist insults, but never shy away.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this age of politics is how the levels of insult normalized.
Last week Jeremy Corbyn claimed that the Workers' Party should cultivate a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that broad church and with every "motion of distrust" or change of selection rules, the party becomes tighter.
For the past two years, I have had a lot of advice that encourages me to stay under the radar, not to be so outspoken and that I will be "oukei".
But I did not enter politics to do so.
Since joining the Labour Party 32 years ago, encouraged by the Thatcher Government's neglect that literally left my State High School, I have tried to fight for better public services for those who need it most – whether as a local councillor or government minister.
I never hid my politics, including at the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been confused at all about my policy positions and areas where I differ from the current leadership.
To those who advocated the motion on Friday, I can only say that with the country that sends down on a Brexit that will damage all households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader the Workers' Party.
But the one message I actually have is not to Nottingham Momentum, it is to my constituents, whether they are members of the Labor Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no amount of threats of not being re-elected or political advantage will hold me back from doing what I believe is in all of you’s best interests.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unconquered Ayr above
Two late threes may have pulled the final results slightly, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to triumph in this wonderful, enjoyable Tennant's premiere contest of the day.
They are now at the top of the grade, the only unconquered team of the ten.
In the end, it was their excellent defense, as well as their better chances, that carried the home team and coach Peter Murchie had every right to be satisfied.
"We have so far been tested in our matches and we are still unconquered, so I must be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "Honor Ayr, they took their chances better than we have."
Grant Anderson's three in the 14th minute, referred to by Frazier Climo, had made Ayr front, but a yellow card for Scotland player Rory Hughes, made available for the game by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to have the numbers counted and Jason Baggot had recorded an insignificant three.
Climo increased Ayr's lead with a penalty head just before he, just before rest time a solo three meant to make it rest time 17-5 for Ayr.
But Melrose began the second half well, and Patrick Anderson’s three, referred to by Baggot, reduced the hindrance to five points.
There was a long stop for a serious injury at Ruaridh Knott carried on a portable, and from the restart Ayr increased the lead with a Stafford McDowall three, meant by Climo.
Ayr's substitute captain Blair Macpherson then got a yellow card and once again Melrose took advantage of the extra player with an insignificant three by Bruce Colvine, at the end of a lot of pressure game.
The home team made a return, and when Struan Hutchinson had got a yellow card because he had taken Climo to death without the ball, and out of the penalty stand MacPherson had pushed the ball to death behind the oncoming Ayr meal.
Climo did this, as he also did almost from the reboot, after Kyle got Rowe David Armstrong's goal head and sent away flank Gregor Henry for the fifth of his team.
Still Game star looks like he's going to start new career in restaurant business
It seems that Still Game star is going to move to the hospitality industry after it has been discovered that he was designated as the director of a company of licensed restaurants.
The 56-year-old is playing Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC program, which he writes and plays with old comedy nun Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the coming ninth season would be the program’s last, and Kirin seems to be preparing for life to Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor didn't want to comment, although a source suggested by Scottish Sun that Kilann wanted to get involved in Glasgow's "flouring restaurant business."
'The sea is ours': land-circuited Bolivia hope court will reopen away to Pacific
Sailor patrol a mastwork-covered marine quarters in La Paz.
Public buildings fly a sea blue flag.
Fleet bases from Titicaca Lake up to the Amazon are inserted with the slogan: "The sea is right ours.
It's a duty to get it back."
Throughout the country surrounded Bolivia, the memory of the coastline that they lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century is still fresh – as is the need to sail the Pacific again.
That hope is probably the highest it was in decades, while Bolivia is waiting for a verdict by the international court on October 1, after 5 years of discussions.
"Bolivia has the momentum, the spirit of unity and peace, and naturally expects the outcome with a positive attitude." said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look at the IGH pronouncement on large screens across the country, hoping that the court in The Hague will find in favor of Bolivia's claim that – after decades of sporadic negotiations – Chile is obliged to negotiate to give Bolivia a sovereign passage to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic native president – who is facing a controversial struggle to re-election next year – also had many who depend on Monday's verdict.
"We are close to returning to the Pacific," he promised in late August.
However, some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will decide in Bolivia’s favor – and that few will change if so.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no power to assign Chilean territory, and has established that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the IRH's verdict came only six months after the last events shows that the matter was "not complicated", said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And rather than helping Bolivia’s cause, it may have delayed in the past four years.
"The question of access to the sea was captivated by the present Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
Morals ’ aggressive rhetoric overpowered any remaining Chilean kindness, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to hold talks again at a time, but it will be enormously difficult to hold these meetings.
The two countries had last exchanged ambassadors in 1962.
Former president Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision was extremely rapid.
Monday will bring Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "end 139 years of differences with reciprocal advantages," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents – used the maritime issue as a political crutch.
Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific," he added.
"The verdict is an opportunity to see what we need to overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't come unless their U.S. can trust
North Korea's Foreign Minister, Ri Yong Ho, said his country would never first disarm their nuclear weapons if they could not trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to fulfill the promises made during a consultation in Singapore between the rival countries' leaders.
His remarks follow to USA Secretary of State Mike Pompeo apparently on the brink of resuming nuclear diplomacy, which had reached a dead end, more than three months after the Singapore with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it's a "drome image" that continued cracks and U.S. hoodies to a statement that the Korean War has ended will also bring the North on its knees.
Washington is careful to agree to the declaration without Pyongyang taking significant measures to disarm.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second meeting.
But there is widespread skepticism about whether Pyongyang is serious about renouncing an arsenal that considers the country to be the only way to guarantee their security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump meeting.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest series of large main coverings on the way to the shops near you
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or completely turn away the sun, you do not have to look further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne introduced a series of lavish oversized main coverings at their SS19 collection on the treadmill that enchanted the style at Paris Fashionweek.
Very impractical hats roamed Instagram this summer, and these designers paraded their baffling creations on the treadboard.
The excelling by Valentino was an oversized beige hat with a feathery wide edge which swallowed the models' heads.
Other great additions included watermelons decorated with jewelry, a magic hat and even a pineapple – but it was not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also introduced a series of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had covered lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creation seemed like scuba equipment, including a snorkel and mask, while another looked like a melted ice cream horn.
And if you continue the great fashion, it's your happy day.
Stylers predict that the huge hats may be on the way to the shops near you.
The great hats follow briefly on the heels of 'La Bomba', the straw hat with a two foot wide edge that was seen on all's heads, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the extremely impractical hat spread about social, sent another great creation over the treadboard – a straw-street bag that was almost as large as the swimming pants-dressed model it wore.
The branded orange raffiasak, finished with raffia fries and finished a white leather handle at the top, stood out at Jacquemus' La Riviera's SS19 collection at Paris Fashionweek.
Known stylist Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: 'I expect to see large hats and beach bags appearing in shops for next summer – since the designer has made such a big impact that it will be difficult to ignore the demand for excessive additionals.'
John Edward: Language skills essential for world citizens
Scotland's independent schools have a crack performance of academic excellence, and it continued in 2018 with another set of excellent exam results, which was only strengthened by individual and collective successes in sports, art, music and other community businesses.
With more than 30,000 schools throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best level of service to their students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their schools for further and higher education, their chosen career, and their position as world citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a newly created school curriculum, we see that world languages continue as a popular and desirable choice of courses.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to someone in a language he understands, it goes to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it goes to his heart."
It is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year’s recent exam results, we can see that languages are at the top of the league tables with the highest success rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages achieved a higher degree A.
The data, collected from SCIS's 74 colleges showed that 72 percent of students had received a higher grade A in Mandarins, while 72 percent of those who had studied German, 69 of those who had studied French and 63 of those who studied Spanish also received an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and young adults will no doubt need in the future.
Languages now have the same status as the STEM trades (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent schools' curriculums and elsewhere.
A survey by the UK Commission for Professionals and Skills found in 2014 that some of the reasons that employees provide why they are struggling to fill posts are attributed 17 percent to a lack of language skills.
Hence, language skills become more and more important in preparing young people for their future careers.
With more likely jobs that languages require, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career that someone chooses, if they have learned a second language, in the future they will have a real advantage with such a lifelong skill.
To communicate directly with people from other countries, a multilingual person will automatically be placed above the competition.
According to a YouGov recording of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation and French was the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage, 15 percent.
That is why investing in today’s language education is so important now.
Knowing several languages, especially those of developing economies, will equip children with a better chance to get meaningful work.
In Scotland, each school will differ in the languages they teach.
A number of schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while other languages will teach what is considered essential to the UK when looking ahead to 2020, such as Mandarins or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be a number of languages to choose from in independent schools, with teachers who are specialists in this field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare and equip children with the skills needed to succeed, regardless of what the future holds.
It cannot be denied at this stage, in a global business environment, that languages are still extremely important for the country's future, and therefore should be reflected in education.
Truly, modern languages really need to be viewed as "international communication skills."
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity, and excellence to Scotland’s young people.
Il faut been le faire.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will debut Sunday for San Diego Lakers
The guard is almost over for adherents to see LeBron James make his first start for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James would play in San Diego in Sunday's opening season match against the Denver Nugggets.
But just how many minutes he is going to play are still to be determined.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell has been preoccupied that James will probably play a limited amount of time.
After an exercise earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six matches in the pre-season program.
"I don't need to get ready at this point in my career season games," he said.
Trump's West Virginia convention time, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is beginning a low-level election meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia tonight.
It's Trump's first of five scheduled gatherings in the following week, including stopped in friendly places including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote currently held for his choice to fill the faculty in the Supreme Court, Trump plans to build support for the upcoming interelection because the Republicans are at risk of losing control of the Congress when voted in November.
What time is Trump's gathering in West Virginia tonight, and how do you look at it online?
Trump's gathering in Wheeling, West Virginia, was scheduled for 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday September 29, 2018.
Below you can see Trump's drawing in West Virginia via living flow.
Trump will probably give attention to this week's hearings for the appointed Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, who became tense about accusations of sexual misconduct with an expected confirmation voice held for up to a week while the FBI investigates.
But the main point of this excess is to help the Republicans facing difficult elections in November.
President Trump's campaign thus said that in the following week these five gatherings were aimed at "visiting volunteers and supporters while Republicans tried to protect and enlarge the majority they had in the Senate and the House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Government over Congress is so critical of his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible when we reach the busy campaign season," a spokesman for the Trump campaign, who refused to be called his name, told Reuters.
This evening's gathering, arranged for the Westbanco arena in Wheeling, may attract supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and can be covered by the media in Pittsburgh," according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump visits West Virginia, the state he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the West-Virgin Republican candidate for the Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who is behind according to the voting patterns.
"That's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president must come to give him a boost at the poll bus," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team shows that they have courage for the struggle to keep the hope alive when they enter Sunday’s single game
After three one - side sessions, the four - game teams of Saturday afternoon may have been just what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging sling of momentum is an all-encompassing sports concept but one in which players believe wholeheartedly, and certainly in competitions like that.
Where, then, would they say that the momentum is now?
"They went ahead with six points and now it is four, so we carry it as a little moment, I reckon," Jordan Spieth said when he ran away at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe has the advantage, four points ahead and twelve more.
The Americans, however, feel, as Spieth says, that they have such a little wind in their sails and that there are many to encourage them, not least the class of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each recorded three points out of four.
Spieth was deadly from the top to the in - laws and led by his example.
That throttle celebrations got louder as his round progressed and he sank a critical set to win four completely evenly while he and Thomas were behind after two rounds with two rounds.
She set up who won the contest at 15 for them, was greeted with a similar scream, the kind that told a man that he believed the American team had another chance.
"You should really just take out everything and worry about your own game," Spieth said.
That’s all those players have left.
18 pieces to print their stamp.
The only players with more points over the past two days than Spieth and Thomas are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the unquestionable story of the Ryder Cup.
Europe’s couple but charming couple got four out of four and can do nothing wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only few who didn't one keep on track number on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided one Saturday morning about track numbers as well as during the back nine Friday morning.
That gap, and the way their energy seems to flow to and from this exuberant crowd, confirms that they are the players who must be knocked on Sunday, and there will be no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari who can confound a potential European victory when the sun drops over Le Golf National.
Select both at once or at different pieces.
However, it is still too early to speak of European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made short measurements with Sergio Garcia, the morning’s four - ball hero, when he played with Alex Noren.
One stop over track number and two doubles on the front nine the Spaniard and the Sweed ended up in a hole from which they could not even come.
On Sundays, however, there is no one to help you out of your hole.
The four-balls and four-game teams are so exciting to watch from nearby because of the interaction between the pairs, the advice they give, the advice they don't give and the way a strategy can turn into an instant.
Europe has always played better as a team and took the lead on the last day meaningfully, but this four-game session also showed that the U.S. team had the courage to struggle with which some, especially at home, doubted.
Europe runs 10-6 during the last day of the Ryder cup
Europe will have a healthy advantage on the last day of the Ryder cup after coming with a 10-6 lead from Saturday's four-ball and four-game games.
The inspired duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the attack with two victories over a struggling Tiger Woods to take their count at Le Golf National to four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who tried to keep the trophy that they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an American team that had performed unevenly in the morning's four balls, so that they won the 3-1 series.
The U.S.A. was more resistant to the four - game games and won two games, but they did not shrink the back.
Jim Furich’s team needed eight points from Sunday’s 12 single - game games to maintain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European newcomer to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, who after a sensational weekend are called "Moliwood", are just the second few in the history of the Ryder Cup that recorded four points after their first four matches.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-balls, they played excellently together to conquer a pap of Woods and American newcomer Bryson Dechambreau with an even more convincing 5&4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two matches on Saturday, sometimes showed flashes of brilliantness but he now lost 19 of his 29 matches in four-balls and four-games and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who rested during the morning's four-balls, came back to play with Henrik Stenson in the four-games to a 2&1 low for Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka--which is first and third on the world rankings.
Europe, however, did not always get their way on a pleasant day with a wind of southwest Paris.
Jordan Spieth who won three big tournaments and Justin Thomas set the mark for the Americans on Saturday with two points.
They recorded a difficult 2&1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-balls and later returned to knock Poulter and Rory McIlroy in the four-games with 3&4 after losing the first two pieces.
Just twice in the history of the Ryder cup, a team recovers from a four-point backward when they enter the single game, though Fürk's team just has to play on the level to keep the trophy because they already keep it.
After being second for two days, however, they do not seem to succeed in a counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea says they'll 'really not' unilaterally disarm without confidence.
On Saturday, North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations that continued downfalls aggravate their distrust of the United States and that the country would certainly not unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons without such traits.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Body's annual General Assembly that in the past year North Korea has taken significant goodwill measures, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, breaking down the nuclear test site and promising not to increase nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"We see, however, no corresponding response from the U.S.," he said.
"Without any confidence in the U.S., there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances we will certainly not unilaterally disarm ourselves first."
While Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phased" approach to the removal of nuclear weapons that would reward North Korea if it took gradual action, his words seemed significant in that it did not reject one-sided removal of nuclear weapons unconditionally as Pjongang did in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong-Oen and Donald Trump at the very first summit meeting between a president of the U.S. and a North Korean leader on 12 June in Singapore when Kim committed to work for the "destruction of nuclear weapons in the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea wants a formal end to the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States said that Pjongyang should first give up his nuclear weapons.
Washington also resisted requests for strict international sanctions against North Korea.
"The U.S. insists on the "destruction of nuclear weapons first" and exerts more pressure by intensifying the level of the cuts to reach their goal in a compelling way, and even objecting to the 'declaration of the end of the war," said Ri.
"The persepsia that sluggishes can force us on our knees is a dream of the people who are ignorant of us.
The problem, however, is that the continued downfalls make our suspicions worse."
Ri had not said anything about plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump on which the U.S. leader at the United Nations turned attention earlier in the week.
Rather, the minister drew attention to three meetings during the past five months between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in and added: "If the party in this issue about the destruction of nuclear weapons were South Korea and not the U.S., the destruction of nuclear weapons in the Korean peninsula would not have reached such a dead end."
The tone of Ri's speech was still dramaticly different from last year, when he said to the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable that North Korea's rockets would be directed to the U.S. land mass after "Mr. Forest President" Trump called Kim an " rocket man" on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who threatened to destroy North Korea "fully," Kim generously commended for his courage because he had taken steps to disarm, but he said that much work still had to be done and that reductions still had to remain there until North Korea destroyed nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday Trump said he didn't have a time frame for this, and said, "It doesn't matter whether it takes two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia consider that the UN Security Council should reward Pjongyang for the steps they have taken.
But, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Thursday said to the UN Security Council that: "Adaptation of downfalls by the Security Council must be zealous and without letup until we realize the complete, final, confirmed destruction of nuclear weapons."
Since 2006, the Security Council has unitedly intensified slumps against North Korea in an attempt to dry up funding for Pjongjang's nuclear and ballistic mission programmes.
Pompeo met Ri on the outskirts of the UN General Assembly and said afterward that he would visit Pjongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo had already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip there did not go well.
He left Pjongyang in July and said that progress was made, but North Korea just hours later accused him of putting "benelike demands."
North Korea promised in a meeting with Moon to break down a missile press and also to make a nuclear complex as the United States "conformity measures."
He said that Kim told him that the "corresponding measures" that he wanted to see were security guarantees that Trump had promised in Singapore, as well as steps towards normalization of relationship with Washington.
Harvard students take a course over enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year leaves all its pre-graduate students more sleep in an attempt to counter the growing macho culture of study by working coffee driven 'all-night sessions'.
A academic found that students at the world's top university are often ignorant when it concerns the basic principles of how to care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleeping medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believed was the first of his kind in the U.S.
He was inspired to start the course after he gave a talk about the effects of sleep abduction on learning.
'At the end of it one girl approached me and said, 'Why do they tell me first, in my senior year?'
She said that no one had yet told her how important sleep was--that surprised me,' he told The Telegraph.
The course, presented for the first time this year, explains to students the basic principles of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as how it improves their general well - being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard School of Medicine and executive director of the university’s health services, said that the university decided to enter the course after students were found to be seriously deprived of sleep during the week.
The hour-long course involves some interactive tasks.
In one department there is a picture of a dormitory, where students on coffee cups, curtains, exercise shoes and books must click to be told about the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is influenced by sleeplessness and the importance of a sleeptime routine.
In another department, participants are told how long-term sleep withdrawal risks of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer can increase.
A map of the campus, with interactive icons, then encourages participants to think of their daily routine.
'We know it won't change students' behavior immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know--just as you have the right to know the health effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes,' said Prof. Czeisler.
The culture of pride to 'student all night' still exists, he said, and added that modern technology and increasing pressure on students meant that sleep abduction was a growing problem.
To make sure that you get enough sleep of good quality, a student's 'secret weapon' should be to avoid stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said--even to avoid putting on weight, because sleep deprived the brain puts in a starved mode, which makes you feel hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californiar studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to design the course after he walked one of his classes last year, during his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to work for a campus course.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar study program before joining the institution where people compete with one another.
Prof Czeisler recommended that students consider setting an alarm for when to go to sleep, as well as when to wake up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of 'blue light' emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which may disrupt your circadian rhythm and may cause you to struggle to touch the sheep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: The goal of Menga conquers Gerrard’s men
Rangers experienced another sarsie off-day heart injury when Dolly Menga's target-head Steven Gerrard's incoherent team caused a downfall of 1-0.
The Ibrox team wanted to win their first as visitors since February's 4-1 victory at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team just gave Gerrard his second defeat in 18 races as driver so that his team was eight points behind Hearts, running loose hands in the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga struck seven minutes before rest time, and it didn't seem as if a Ranger team would play without much inspiration.
While Rangers now fall to the sixth position, Livingston climbs to the third and is on target only behind Hibernian.
And there may be further trouble for Rangers after border judge Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound after an object was apparently thrown off the roadside.
Gerrand made eight changes to the team that stormed past Ayr after the final battle of the Betfred cup.
Holt, on the other hand, used the same Livi-11 that last week took a point from Hearts and he would have been in his troubles with the way his well-trained team had smothered their opponents at each turn.
Rangers may have dominated balbeque, but Livingston did more when they had the ball.
They should have scored after just two minutes when Menga’s first deposit passed through Scott Pittman on Allan McGregor’s goal, but the midfielder got his great chance.
A deep escape by Keaghan Jacobs then found captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner Alan Lithgow could only miss the back stake.
Rangers took control, but there seemed to be more hope than conviction about their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos felt that he should have gotten a penalty target at the quarter-tier point when he and Steven Lawless collided, but the divorce judge Steven Thomson rejected the Colombian's requests.
Rangers managed to get only two shots to the target during the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was hardly bothered by Lassana Coulibaly's headshot and a domestic target of Oviedo Ejaria.
While Livi’s opener may have been toward play at the 34th minute, no one can deny that they deserved it, even if it was just for their hard work.
Rangers once again did not handle a deep set of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained cool and sent it to Menga for a simple round.
Gerrard acted at the break when he exchanged Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and had the exchange had an almost immediate impact when the wing sent to Morelos but the impressive Kelly from his strip to the block rushed.
Livingston, however, continued to force the visitors to play exactly the kind of game they enjoyed, with Lithgow and Halkett who had long ball palmped in after long ball.
Holt’s team could have increased their lead in the final stages, but McGregor stood up well to stop Jacobs before Lithgov could reach far from the corner.
Rangers' substitute Glenn Middleton had another demand for a criminal head when he got confused with Jacobs, but Thomson looked away again.
Almanac: The Inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now a page from our "Sunday morning" almanac: September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, and OUR TEL VERDER ... the day on which future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of tracking and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device called the Geiger counter.
Since then, the Geigerteller has been a pillar of science, and it has also become a pillar in pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado," in which those two unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans played:
Man: "What on earth is it?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you set up these earphones, you can even hear the effects of the atoms that the radioactivity emits in the minerals.
Evans: "Good, it's cracking about!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to 'see robber cells'.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to 'see' and die robber cells
Dust teaches immune system to identify robber cells as part of treatment
Method involves withdrawal of immune cells from a patient, changing them into a laboratory
They can then 'see a protein', which is common to many cancers and then inject it again.
A test substance shows promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
One woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to identify robber cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for over 18 months.
The method involves withdrawing immune cells from a patient, changing them into the laboratory so that they can see a protein that occurs in many cancers and is called HER2, and then inject the cells again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "promising the growth of several types of cancers," including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer, explained Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar approach to removing immune cells from patients and "learning" them how to attack cancer cells has worked to beat a type of leukemia.
Kanye West began pro-Trump derision after his action on SNL, while he wore a MAGA hat.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was kicked out live in the studio during a Saturday night after an extended action in which he believed the president of the U.S. Donald Trump and said he would make himself elected in 2020.
After singing his third song of the evening, called Ghost Town, during which he wore a Make America Great-pet, he went out against the Democrats and repeated his support of Trump.
"I speak so often with a white man and they say, "How can you like Trump, he's a racist?"
Well, if I were concerned about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago," he said.
SNL started the show with a sketch with Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star mocked with Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate's judicial committee on accusations of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Even if it was not broadcast, the footage of West’s abusively loaded on social media by the comediat Chris Rock.
It is unclear whether Rock tried to ridicule West by placing it.
West also complained to the audience that it was made difficult for him behind the platform about what he wore on his head.
"They bound me behind the stage.
They said, 'don't go out with that hat.'
They bound me!
And then they said I was in a low place," he said according to the Washington Examer.
West went forth: "Do you want to see the low place?" and said that he would put on his "superman's coat, because it means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try love."
His comment attracted at least twice an outpouring at the audience and members of the SNL roll distribution looked embarrassed, Variety reported, with one person there who said to the publication: "The whole studio has become silent."
West was introduced as a late substitute for singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, the rhymeman Mac Miller had died a few days earlier.
West very surprised with a performance of the song I Love it, dressed like a Perrier bottle.
West is supported by the head of TPUSA conservation group, Candace Turner, who has sluggished: "To one of the bravest spirits: THAT YOU WANT TO BE THE SCREAM."
But chatter hostwoman Karen Hunter was sluggish that West was just "who he is and it's absolutely wonderful."
"But I chose not to reward someone (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his "art") whom I believe I accept an ideology and proclaim what endangers my community.
He is free.
We too," she added.
Before the show, on Twitter, the rhyme kletzer announced that he had changed his name and said that he was now "the essence that was formerly known as Kanye West."
Not the first artist to change his name, he follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P Diddy.
Mede-rymkletzer, Snoop Dogg, had the name Snoop Lion and, of course, long musical legend Prince changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist who was formerly known as Prince.

A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in East-Belfast on Friday.

The charge will be reviewed by the public prosecutor service.
Game of Thrones-star Kit Harington criticizes toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his swinging role as Jon Snow in HBO’s violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, criticized the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel that they have to be tough to be respected.
Kit spoke to The Sunday Times Culture and said he said 'there was something wrong' and asked how to tackle the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeTooera.
Kit, who recently married his fellow from Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he felt 'reasonably strong' about making this issue work.
'I personally feel quite strong about it right now--where did we go wrong with masculinity?' he said.
'What did our husbands learn as they grew up regarding the problem we're seeing now?'
Kit believes that television may well be responsible for the growth in toxic masculinity because of its extremely male characters.
He continued: "What is inborn and what has been taught?
What is taught on the TV and in the streets that makes young boys feel that they should have this certain aspect of being a man?
I think it's really one of the big questions in our time. How do we change them?
Because something obviously went wrong with our young men.'
in the interview he also acknowledged that he would not participate in any of the Game of Thrones-prosecutions- and-contaminations when the series came to an end next summer, for he said he was 'finished with battlefields and horses'.
From November Kit will play in a new version of Sam Shephard's True West, which is the story of a movie maker and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he thought that the best thing that came from Game of Thrones was to meet his wife Rose.
'I met my wife on this program, so in that way it gave me my future family, and my life from here on,' he said.
Rose played Ygrite, the love interest of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy-bricked fantasy series.
The couple married on the site of Leslie’s family estate in Scotland in June 2018.
HIV/AIDS: China report a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced that there is a 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people in the country are affected, health officials.
Some 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases have been transmitted by sex, representing a change in the past.
Traditionally, HIV quickly spreads through some parts of China because of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who received HIV in this way was reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in the province of Yunnan.
Year after year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000.
HIV transmission by sex is a critical matter in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still very common.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men would eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of the diseases come from insufficient sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, China's government has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of an attempt to deal with the matter.
Maxine Waters deny that a staff member leaked GOP senators' data, condemns 'dangerous lies' and 'competition theories'.
U.S. Republican Maxine Waters threatened on Saturday against allegations that a member of her staff placed the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on the legislator's Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the charges were driven by "ultrarights" experts and Web sites.
"Leuns, lies, and still detestable lies," said Waters in a statement on Twitter.
The information learned reportedly included the home addresses and telephone numbers for U.S. Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared on Thursday, placed by an unknown person on the Capitol Hill during the Senate Panel's hearing about the claims of sexual misconduct against the appointed for the Supreme Court Board of Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak took place some time after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Poundit and RedStates reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the sites was related to Waters' office and revealed the information of a member of Waters' staff, the Hill reported.
"This unfounded claim is totally untrue and an absolute lie," Waters continued.
"The member of my staff--whose identity, personal information and security were put at risk as a result of this deceptive and false claim--was by no means responsible for the leak of this information.
This unfounded claim is totally untrue and an absolute lie."
Waters' statement soon triggered online criticism, including former White House press representative Ari Fleischer.
"This denial testifies to anger," wrote Fleischer.
"This indicates that she doesn't have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When a person is accused of something he has not done, he should not be angry.
He should not be challenging.
He should not question the grounds of the prosecutor.
He must be calm and calm."
Fleischer apparently compared Waters’s reaction to the democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of seemingly being too angry during Thursday’s trial.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who tried to highlight Waters in the interelection from the pillows, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great if that's true," he grappled.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had informed "the appropriate authorities and law enforcement entities of these deceptive claims.
"We will make sure that the managers are exposed," she continued, "and that they will be legally accountable for everything they do that is destructive and dangerous to every member of my staff."
Johnny English Strikes Again Review - faint Rowan Atkinson spying
It's now traditional to look for Brexit meaning in any new movie with a British impact and it seems to apply to this revival of the Johnny English action comethe mockery ranch - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and continued in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will tongue-in-the-kiss evenatire on the subject of how obvious power we are the nation's new execution event?
In any event, the uncoupled Johnny English with his peacocks and rubber face had his license to waste everything up for the second time renewed--and his name is a clearer indication than anything else that he is a great comic creation for non-English-speaking film audiences.
Of course, he is the ridiculous secret agent who, despite his bizarre pretension, has a bit of Clouseau, a piece of Mr. Bean and a good shot of that guy who contributed a single note to the Chariots or Fire theme song at the opening ceremony of the London Olympic Games in 2012.
He was also originally based on the traveler and international man of puzzles, who left chaos behind him, who atkinson once played in the now forgotten Barclaycard advertisements.
There are one or two nice moments in this latest version of YES.
I liked Johnny English who came to a helicopter while he was dressed in a medieval armored garment and cut the screws briefly against his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is displayed but humor feels relatively faint and oddly superfluous, especially when the "serious" movie trade marks like 007 and Mission Imposible now use comedy with self-confidence as an ingredient.
The humor feels that it is aimed at children rather than adults, and for me Johnny English’s adversity is not as original and focused as Atkinson’s silent - movie greetings in the persona of Bean.
The eternal thematic assumption is now that Great Britain is in serious trouble.
A cybercracker infiltrated Britain's super secret network of spies and revealed the identity of all of Britain's agents in the field, to the dismay of the agent to serve--a deplorable little role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last straw for a prime minister who's an inflated and besieged character, who's already experiencing a total collapse of political unpopularity: Emma Thomspson is doing her utmost with this quasi-Teresa May character but there's little in the text to work with.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that since each active spy has been put at risk, she should call someone from his retirement.
And this means the struggling Johnny English himself, now in service as a teacher at some grand institution, but what from the record give lessons about how to be a secret agent, there are some cute jokes here when English offers a school of rock-type spy school.
English is called back to Whitehall for an emergency order and is reunited with his former long - suffering companion Bough, again interpreted by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, married to a submarine commander, an allamastic roll in which less of Vicki Pepperdine is expected.
Thus, the Batman and Robin are to waste everything completely in Her Majesty's secret service again and come to Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister comes under the dangerous spell of the charismatic technology billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain’s computer problems: the mysterious Jason Volta, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their journey of ridiculous escapades: disguised as waiters set a French restaurant on fire, they cause chaos when they smuggle themselves aboard Volta's luxury sailing hunt; and English makes pure anarchy break when he tries to use a headpiece for virtual reality to become familiar with the inside of Volta's house.
For that last scene nothing is spared, but as cute and boisterous as it may be, the whole store is quite a lot like children's TV.
Reasonably mediocre.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I couldn't stop thinking: can't the British give Rowan Atkinson a role that really makes his talent come to justice?
Labour denys that it's a plan for British to work a four-day week but to be paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's labor party must consider a drastic plan that will cause British to work a four-day week--but be paid for five days.
The party reportedly wants company-based savings caused by the artificial intelligence (KI) revolution to be transferred to workers by giving off their extra day.
It will cause workers to enjoy a three-day weekend--but they will still take the same payment home.
Sources says that it will 'pass' to the party's economic agenda and plans to put the country in favor of the workers.
To change to a four-day week was signed by the Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to exploit the changing economy.
A senior worker party source told The Sunday Times: 'A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
'It won't happen overnight, but a four-day work week is an ambition that fits in with the party's approach to rebalancing the economy in favor of the worker as well as at the party's overall industrial strategy.
The Workers' Party won't be first to support such an idea, with the Green Party who promised a four-day work week during his campaign for the general election in 2017.
At present, however, the ambition is not endorsed by the entire Workers ’ Party.
A spokesman for the Labour Party said: 'A four-day work week is not party policy and is not considered by the party.'
Shadow Minister John McDonnell used last week's Workers' Conference to appease his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from 'sightless directors' and 'winners' from service companies.
The shadow ministers' plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not get their entire investment back, as a workers' government can make withdrawals on the basis of alleged wrongdoing.
He also confirmed plans to place corporate directors and create inclusive ownership funds to give 10 percent of business opportunities in the private sector to employees, who can obtain annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy tells "60 Minutes" or the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh can make them change their opinion
The FBI's investigation of accusations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh took a final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court with at least a week delayed and raised the question whether the bureau's findings could convince any Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked for Republican sens. John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could dig anything they could change their opinion.
Kennedy seemed more receptive than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said at the beginning of the trial, I said, I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it had happened, that accusation came out, and said, 'Have you done this?'
He was firm, certainly, impudent."
Graham’s voice, however, appears to be unchangeable.
"I have formed my opinion about Brett Kavanaugh and it will require an accusation of dynamite," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know it: Board has zealously denied it," Graham continued, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone she calls couldn't confirm it.
It's 36 years old.
I see nothing new change."
What is the World Civil Festival and has done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the World Civil Festival, an annual music event that has a particularly impressive set of stars that act and have an equally impressive purpose; the end of poverty in the world.
The World Civil Festival is now in its seventh year and during the festival, tens of thousands of people will flock to Central Park’s Great Law to enjoy not only actions by Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes but also to raise awareness of the real purpose of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the World Poverty Project, an international interlocutory group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people fighting actively against it.
To get a free ticket to the occasion (unless you are willing to pay for a GDP card), concertors had to perform a series of tasks, or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an e-mail to a world leader, making a phone call, or any other significant way to raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But just how successful were World Citizens with 12 years left to reach their goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert, a good way to convince people to demand a call to action, or is it just another case of so-called "lickivism"--people who feel that they make a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a twig?
Since 2011, World Citizens have said that it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" of its supporters, which support a multitude of different goals.
It says that these actions have helped to encourage world leaders to announce commitments and policies equal to over $37 billion that will potentially affect the lives of over 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group mentioned 390 commitments and announcements resulting from its actions, at least $10 billion of which had already been paid out or collected.
The group estimates that the confirmed money has so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the most important commitments include the Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and implementers committed to "helping children reach their full potential", and promise to give up $35 million for Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country after having obtained more than 4,700 twigs from world citizens.
"With the support of the government of the UK, donors, national governments and world citizens just like you, we can let the social injustice of malnutrition become a footnote in history," the Power of Nutrition-ambassator Tracey Ullman told the crowd in April 2018 during a concert in London.
The group also said that, after more than 5,000 actions that have been undertaken to approach the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the common questions on his Web site that asks "what makes you think that we can end extreme poverty?"
Worldburger replied, "It'll be a long and hard way--at times we'll fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because together we have more power.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the artists who act on this year's occasion in New York, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S.A. can use fleet for "blockade" to reduce exports of Russian energy - Minister of Home Affairs
"If necessary," Washington could leave him on his fleet to prevent Russian energy from entering the market, including in the Middle East, revealed the U.S. Secretary of Interior Ryan Zinke, as quoted by the Washington Examer.
Zincs claimed Russia's involvement in Syria--in particular where it works at the invitation of the legal government--is a pretext for examining new energy markets.
"I believe the reason why they are in the Middle East is because they want to act as brokers for energy just as in Eastern Europe, the south of Europe," he reportedly said.
And, according to an officer, there are ways and means to deal with them.
"The United States has the ability, with our Fleet, to ensure that the seaways are open, and if necessary, to block, to make sure their energy doesn't end up on the market," he said.
Zincs addressed to the residents of an event offered by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a group without profit, who considered themselves the "voice of the energy consumer" in the U.S.
He went on to compare Washington’s approaches to the handling of Russia and Iran, noting that it was practically the same.
"The economic option to Iran and Russia is, more or less, to finance and replace fuel," he said while referring to Russia as an "single talent" with an economy dependent on fossil fuel.
The statements come as Trump administration was on a mission to boost the export of their liquid natural gas to Europe to replace Russia, by far the cheaper option for European consumers.
For that reason the Trump administration officials, including America's President Donald Trump himself, tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "unapproached" Nord Stream 2-pypline project, which, according to Trump Berlin's "prisons" made Moscow.
Moscow repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2-pypline, which would double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fiery opposition to the project is driven merely by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a means of carrying out pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers," said Russian Minister of Energy, Alexander Novak, after a meeting with America's Secretary of Energy, Rick Perry, in Moscow in September.
The U.S. view provoked counter-reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industrial organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US to stay away from EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempef, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), after a recent meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "seriously consider" standing as president in 2020, said the senator of Massachusetts
Massachusetts's senator, Elizabeth Warren, said Saturday she would "think it" to stand as president to the mid-term elections.
During a village meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts confirmed Warren that she would consider standing.
"It is time for women to go to Washington and correct our broken government and it includes a woman in the highest sports in," she said according to The Hill.
"After November 6th, I will seriously consider standing for President."
Warren aired her opinion about President Donald Trump during the village meeting and said he'd take the country in the wrong direction.
"I'm in my midst worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren was very expressed in her criticism of Trump and his nomination of Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court.
In a twit Friday, Warren said "of course we need an FBI examination before our voice."
A survey released on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own voters did not think she should stand in 2020.
Eight-and-fifty percent of likely Massachusetts voters said the senator should not stand, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe Recording.
Thirty-two percent supported the idea that she should stand.
The survey showed more support for the idea that former Governor Deval Patrick should stand, 38 percent who felt that he should have supported and 48 against it.
Other high-profile democratic names discussed to possibly stand in 2020 include former vice-president Joe Biden and Vermont's senator Bernie Sanders.
Praying said he would officially decide in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin calls Track Palin's PTSV by Donald Trump Convention
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after joining in September
He was arrested Monday night and accused of an incident of domestic violence.
"What my own son is going through, which he has gone through since he came back, I have sympathy with other families who feel the consequences of PTSD and the injury with which we soldiers return," she told an audience during a convention for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said of her son and other war veterans, "they come back a little differently, they come back hard, they come back and wonder if there is respect for what they and their fellow soldiers and airmen and every other member of the army gave to the country."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence, assaulted by a woman, interfered with a complaint of domestic violence and possession of a gun while he was under influence, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Station.
18 state, D.C. supports challenge of new asylum policy
Eighteen states and County Columbia support a legal challenge of a new U.S. policy refusing asylum to victims fleeing from gang or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and the district submitted a friend-of-the-court-law order in Washington on Friday to support an asylum seeker and challenge the policy, reported NBC News.
The full name of the claimant in the Grace v. Sessions proceedings filed against federal policy by the American Civil Liberties Union in August was not disclosed.
She said her mate "and his violent gangmen," mistreated her, but U.S. officials refused her request for asylum on July 20.
She was held in Texas.
The state attorneys who support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, who produce a large number of applicants for the United States, as nations facing in-depth problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. policy reversed in 2014 a decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals (Council of Immigrants-appèlles) that allowed immigrants to apply for asylum without the necessary documents that had fled from domestic violence.
District Columbia's attorney-general Karl Racine said Friday in a statement that the new policy "decades' state, federal and international laws."
"Federal laws require all asylum applications to be determined on the specific facts and circumstances of the claim, and such counsel violates that policy," said the friend-of-the-court-law commission.
Lawyers have further argued in the legal order that the policies that refuse immigrants' access harm the US economy and say it is more likely that they will become Entrepreneurs and "supply the necessary labor."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June to stop allowing asylum for victims fleeing from domestic and gang violence.
"Asiel is available to those who leave their homeland because of persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or membership to a particular social group or political opinion," said Sessions in his announcement of policy on June 11.
Asiel was never meant to relieve all problems – even all serious problems – that face people around the world every day.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu while double death in race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation is increasingly bulging.
"It feels very tense," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma as she consoled her feverish baby boy at an evacuation center in the destroyed city of Palu.
"Every minute brings an ambulance bodies.
Clean water is scarce."
Residents have been seen returning to their devastated homes, looking for through - networked possessions, trying to save anything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5-range shaking, were overwhelmed.
Of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a broken back and shoulder, rest outside Palu's army hospital where patients are treated outside because of constant strong aftershocks.
Tears fill his eyes as he told of the violent earthquake that shook the fifth floor hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pushed into the walls' ruins, I think,' Haris told Associated Press and added that he and his family were in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife calling for help, but then silence.
I don’t know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of being bullied with propaganda advertisement
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement in an American daily offering the mutual benefits of U.S. China trade, the U.S. ambassador for China charged Beijing with the use of the U.S. press to distribute propaganda.
US President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to the China Daily's paid stake in the Des Moines Register – the state of Iowa's newspaper with the most sales – after he accused China of interfering with the US Congress elections of November 6, a complaint denying China.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the U.S. elections marked what U.S. officials told Reuters, a new phase in a growing campaign by Washington was to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently trapped in an escalating trade war that has resulted in their leveling tariff rounds on each other's imports.
China’s retaliation rate early in the trade war was intended to beat exporters in states such as Iowa that supported Trump’s Republican Party, said Chinese and US experts.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador for China and the former governor of Iowa for a long time, a great exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, wrote Branstad in an opinion in Sunday's Des Moines Register, "is now annoying the bullying by publishing propaganda advertisements in our own free press."
"By spreading their propaganda, the Chinese government seizes America's cherished tradition of free speech and a free press by placing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register, Branstad wrote.
"In contrast with that one will find at the newspaper kiosk in the street here in Beijing very limited deviant voices and not see any true reflection of the various opinions that the Chinese people have about China's worrying economic trajectory, giving that media is under the firm thumb of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers has shy away from the offer to publish its article," although he did not say which newspaper.
Republican aliens women's voters for inter-elections with Kavanaugh debacle, warns analysts
While many top Republicans stand at High Court-genomical Brett Kavanaugh and defend him in the face of various claims of sexual assault, analysts warned that they would see counter-reaction during the upcoming inter-elections, especially of women.
The emotions on this go enormously high, and most Republicans are on record that they already indicate that they want to continue with the mood.
Those things cannot be reversed," Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School told The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Already said he doubted whether Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s incentive for an FBI investigation on the nipper would be enough to appease angry voters.
"Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday – they're not going to forget it tomorrow and not in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesman for the progressive group MoveOn Friday, according to the Washington, D.C. curator.
On Friday morning, protesters "November is on their way!" roared as they argued in the entrance hall of the Senate while the Republicans who had chosen the Judicial Committee to continue with Kavanaugh's appointment despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be very high," St. Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst, said to the news yard.
"People say it was already high; that's true.
But it can be higher, especially among swirling female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18 to 29-year-olds, who don't often vote because they don't like the president."
Even before Ford's public evidence explaining the details of her accusation of sexual assault against the Supreme Court-genomical, analysts said an counter-reaction could follow if Republicans continued with the confirmation.
"It became a messy mess for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, early last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not about the committee's voice or the final voice and or Kavanaugh being put on the court seat, it's also about how the Republicans handled it and how they treated her," Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group who helped to elect democrats, pointed to the news channel.
However, Americans seem slightly divided over who to believe after Ford and Kavanaugh’s testimonies, with a little more to take the latter’s side.
A new survey of YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents certainly or probably believe Ford's testimony, whereas 35 says they certainly or probably believe in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that they thought Kavanaugh was likely jogging or definitely jogging during his witness, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After Flake’s incitement, the FBI is currently examining the accusations made by Ford, as well as at least one other complainant, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Last week, Ford witnessed under oath before the Senate's Judicial Committee that Kavanaugh had attacked her at the age of 17 while he was drunk.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominated his sexes to her as they attended a party during their student years at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the worldwide web plans to start a new internet to tell Google and Facebook the battle
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the worldwide web, launched an initial item that attempted to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The technology legend's latest project, Inrupt, is a company that builds on Berners-Lee's open source platform, Solid.
Solid allows users to select where their data is stored and which people are allowed access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee mocked that the idea with Inrupt was "world domination".
"We must do it now," he said of the project.
"It's a historical moment."
The application uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data storage" or a POD.
They may contain contact lists, do lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional utilities.
It is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are all available at the same time and in one browser.
What is unique about the personal online data storage is that it is entirely up to the user who can access that type of information.
The company calls it "personal authorisation by data."
The idea for Inrupt, according to the company’s HUB John Bruce, is to bring resources, processes, and relevant skills to help make Solid available to all.
The company is currently made up of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, developers on the staff who have been contracted to work on the project and a community of volunteer coders.
From this week on, technology developers from around the world can create their own decentralized applications by using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee says he and his team don't talk to "Facebook and Google about the introduction of a total change if not, where all their business models are completely reversed overnight.
"We don't ask their permission."
In a placement on disk published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to provide commercial energy as well as an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee converted the Internet when he founded the Global Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months Berners-Lee has had an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Even while doing Inrupt, Berners-Lee will still remain the founder and director of the Global Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm tremendously optimistic about this next era of the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: WW1 Victoria Cross-spiritual celebration
The only minister of the Church of England who won the Victoria Cross as a warrior during World War I was honored in his hometown 100 years later.
Lt.kol Reverend Bernard Vann obtained the award on September 29, 1918, in the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But he was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew that he had acquired the highest British military honor.
A memorial stone was revealed on Saturday by his two grandsons at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "brilliant symbolic" that the stone is revealed exactly 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning achievement.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, lt.col. Vann led his battalion over the Channel de Saint-Quentin "through many dense fog and under heavy fire from the field and machine guns."
He then rushed to the fireline and with the "greatest courage" led the line forward before he stormed man alone a field gun and knocked out three of the department.
Lt.koll Vann was killed on October 4, 1918 by a German sniper – only more than a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's action was "anything I know I can't do, but something humiliating."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid a cliff to the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Orchestra.
Michael Vann said he "feel honored to be able to play a role in the parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero is demonstrated by the support given by a lot of people."
MMA supporters stay awake all night to watch Bellator 206, but get Peppa Pig
Imagine, you stay awake all night to watch the packed Bellator 206, just not to be able to look at the main event.
The program of San Jose contained 13 battles, including six on the main program that would be broadcast directly through the night of the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just when Gard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were on their way to tell each other the fight, viewers in the UK were left speechless when the cover changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were unimpressed after staying awake especially for the battle until the early hours.
One supporter described the conversion to the child cartoon on Twitter as "one or other sick joke."
"It is government rules that the content was not suitable at 6 p.m. and therefore they had to switch to child programs," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator senior vice president of marketing and communication when he was asked about the broadcast.
""Peppa the pig," yes."
Bellator company's president Scott Coker said they would work on their scheduling to include UK viewers in the future.
"I think that when I think about the remission, I think we can probably figure out something," Coker said.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning on a Sunday there and we won't be able to sort it out until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we work on it.
Believe me, when it switched over, there were many text messages sent back and forth and it wasn't all friendly.
We tried to fix it. We thought it was a technical mistake.
But it wasn't, it was a government issue.
I can promise you that this will not happen next time.
We will limit it to five battles instead of six – such as making us normal – and we have tried to offer more to our adherents and have just gone over our time.
It's an unhappy situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley has the 'minority' feeling about sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior about his sexuality – but that gave him the motivation to be a success.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize before he went to high school that "not everyone is like me."
When he spoke on the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs offered by Lauren Laverne, he said he aired his feelings about gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said that to become a parent, made him less concerned about winning at the Olympic Games.
The regular provider of the years-long program, Kirsty Young, took a few months off because of illness.
When he appeared on Laverne's first program, Daley said he felt "less" than everyone else when he grew up, because "it wasn't socially acceptable to like boys and girls."
He said, "To this day, those feelings of less feeling than, and feeling different, the real things that gave me the strength and energy to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "anything," he said, so that he would not let anyone down when they would finally find out about his sexuality.
The double Olympic bronze medal winner has become a high profile LGBT fighter and has used his appearance at this year's State League games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He says he has aired his feelings because he is so happy to be able to live openly without consequences and wants to give to others "hope".
The three-time world champion said that to fall in love with a man – USA filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, who he met in 2013 – "he caught him out."
Daley was married last year to the Oscar winner, who was 20 years older than he was, but says the age difference has never been a question.
"When you go through so much at such a young age," he went to his first Olympic Games at age 14, and his father died of cancer three years later – he said it was difficult to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar heights and lows.
The couple became parents in June of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley says she's "full perspective" has changed.
"If you asked me last year, everything would go about 'I have to win a gold medal'," he said.
"But you know, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father Robert who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley says his father did not accept that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was whether they had tickets for London 2012 – for he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him 'you're not going to be here to be in the front row, Dad'," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and it was only after he stopped breathing and was dead that I finally admitted that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley participated in the 2012 Olympic Games and won bronze.
"I only knew that it was what I had dreamed of for a long time about – to dive in front of my home crowd at an Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired his first choice of songs — Proud by Heather Small — which also resonated with him in the construction of the Olympic Games and still gives him chicken meat.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson does not push and withdraw from Saturday’s Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to manage his form to prevent it from being a unhappy milestone.
Mickelson, who played for a record 12th time in the biannual event, was withdrawn from the game by Captain Jim Furik for Saturday's four-ball games and four-games.
Instead of being the center of the action, as he has often been for the United States, the five-time major winner will divide his day in between to be a race leader and work on his game on the drill bomb in hopes of correcting what is wrong.
Even at the height of his career, he was never the most straight driver, so the 48-year-old is not the ideal person for the narrow Le Golf National course where the long rough always punishes the wandering blows.
And as if the track on its own were not challenging enough, on Sunday Mickelson came in his ninth match against the accurate British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who teamed up with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their races this week.
If the Americans, behind four points, start the 12 single games well, Mickelson’s match can be absolutely essential.
Furich expressed confidence in his husband, not that he could say much differently.
"He fully understood his role that he had today, gave me a knock on the back and put his arm around me and said he'd be right tomorrow," Furik said.
"He had much confidence in himself.
He is in the Heroesal and has contributed so much to these teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn’t think that he would play two games.
I had more in mind, but that was how things worked out and that's what we thought we should do.
He wants to be on the track there, just like anyone else."
Mickelson will exceed the record for the player who played most Rider Cup matches on Sunday, Nick Faldo.
This can mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that never really corresponded to the highlights of its individual achievements.
Mickelson said that his presence had contributed to the team by 18 wins, 20 defeats, and seven halves, although Furich said that his presence had contributed to the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, caught, likes to shave the fool, and he's a wonderful guy to have in the teamroom," he explained.
"I think the younger players also enjoyed shaving with him, which was fun to see.
He offers so much more than just a game."
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows great advantage can soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a considerable advantage before the last day's single game in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable experience.
The Danish made its debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where the team under the direction of Seve Ballesteros, had a five-point advantage, but only nail scrap won with 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"A man keeps reminding himself that we had a big advantage at Valderrama; we had a big advantage at Brookline, where we had lost, and at Valderrama, where we won nail scrap," said Bjorn, in the photograph, after he watched how the Class of 2018 won 5-3 and yesterday 10-6 before Le Golf National.
So, history will show me and everyone on the team that it's not over.
You're going to be affluent tomorrow.
Go out and do all the right things.
It's not over until you have the points on the board.
We have a purpose, and it is to try to win the trophy, and that's where the focus remains.
I am still saying that I focus on the 12 players who are in our team, but we are also well aware of who is on the other side – the best players in the world."
Rejoice over how his players sailed on the difficult golf course, Bjorn adds, "I'll never go ahead with this.
Tomorrow is a horse of another colour.
Tomorrow it is the individual participation that comes in turn, and it is a horse of another color.
It is wonderful to be out there with a mate when things are going well, but when you are individually there, you are tested to your full capacity as a golf player.
This is the message you have to deliver to players, get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your mate behind and he must also get the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furich would want his players to do better individually than they did as gamemates, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who got three points out of four.
Furich himself was already on both sides of that great last-day round, where he was part of the winning team at Brookline before he ended up as a loser when Europe got the "miracle of Medinah".
"I remember every covert word of it," he said in reply when he was asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999 had encouraged his players on their way to that last day.
"We've got 12 important matches tomorrow, but one would like to start well, as seen at Brookline, as seen at Medinah.
When that momentum begins in one direction, it puts much stress on those middle games.
We set up our team accordingly and gave the men we felt, you know, something magical will bring us tomorrow."
Thomas got the job of trying to lead the counterattack and faced Rory McIlroy, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Poulter, who are the other Europeans in the upper half of the classification.
"I have chosen this group of guys in this order, because I think it covers it up to the end," Bjorn said about his single game options.
Germany’s New Warship Overturned
The German army's latest frigate would have been put into service in 2014 to replace the old warships from the Cold War era, but it will not be there until at least next year, due to faulty systems and growing costs, reports local media.
The introduction of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the main ship of the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to The Time-Curant who quotes a military spokesman.
This vessel must have joined the Navy in 2014, but the troubling post-delivery issues plagued this ambitious project's fate.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels that the Fleet ordered in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen-Class frigates.
It is understood that they will have a powerful canon, a battle order of air defense and anti-ship missions, as well as several secret technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods – it should be possible to develop the latest frigates for up to two years away from home.
However, constant delays mean that the advanced warships, evidently enabling Germany to project power overseas, will already become obsolete by the time they take up service called The Time.
Last year, the disastrous F125-fregat struck out when the German Navy officially refused to hire the vessel and sent it back to Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time that the Navy sent a ship back to a ship builder to deliver.
Little is known about the reasons for the remission, but German media have mentioned that a number of vital "software- and hardware-defects" make the ship useless if it is unfolded in a campaign.
Software defects are especially important since the Baden-Wuerttemberg class will handle vessels by a crew of about 120 sailors – only half of the manpower on older Bremen-class frigates.
It also revealed that the ship was dramatically overweight, reducing the performance and reducing the fleet’s ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000 tons of "Rheinland-Pfalz" is thought to be twice as heavy as ships of similar classes used by the Germans in World War II.
Besides the faulty hardware, the price tag for the entire project – including training the crew – also affected a question.
It evidently reached an incredible €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) – more than the initial $2.2 billion.
Problems that have bitten the new frigates are particularly important in view of recent warnings that the power of Germany’s fleet is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's defense committee, admitted that the Fleet's "ships that can be developed are running out."
As time went by, the officials said that the issue worsened, for old ships were put out of service, but no substitute vessels were supplied.
He lamented that none of Baden-Wuerttemberg's class could join the Navy.
National Trust Listens to Bats ’ Secret Life
New research is carried out on a estate in the Scottish Highlands that aims to reveal how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behavior of the unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow the common and soprano-verter bats as well as the brown long ear and Daubenton bats at Inverewe Tuine in Western Ross.
Special contractors will be placed on the property at important locations to track bat activities throughout the season.
NHS personnel and volunteers will also perform mobile recordings using hand indicators.
Expert-channels of all recordings will check the frequency of bats and determine which species do.
A habitat map and report will then be compiled to create a detailed landscape scale image of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a nature conservation advisor for NTS hopes the results will reveal which areas of habitat for bats are most important and how they are used by each of the species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management such as pasture creation and how to best manage forest land for bats and other associated species.
Bat populations in Scotland and throughout the UK have decreased significantly during the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects sleeping and loss of habitat.
Wind turbines and lightning can also pose a risk, as well as flying paper and some chemical treatment of building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
Bats are not really blind.
But because of their nocturnal hunting activities, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated ego orientation technique to show bugs and obstacles on their flight route.
The NTS, responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens, and 76,000 acres [66,000 ha] of land throughout the country, are very serious about bats.
It has ten trained experts who regularly conduct surveys and sleeping - place inspections and sometimes perform rescues.
The organization even established Scotland’s first and only dedicated bat reserve at Thrave estates in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland’s ten species of bats.
Estate manager David Thompson says that the estate is the ideal site for them.
"Here at Thrave we have a wonderful area for bats," he said.
"We have the old buildings, many veter trees and all the good habitat.
But there is so much about bats that are still unknown, so the work we do here and on other properties helps us to understand better what they need to thrive."
He emphasizes the necessity of searching for bats before maintenance in properties is done because it is possible that unwitting destruction of a single maternity site can mean up to 400 females and young children's death and annihilate a whole local population.
Bats are protected, and it is illegal to kill, disturb, or hinder them or destroy their sleeping places.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to jump in to help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we don't know how their populations are doing."
Ronaldo makes rape claims while lawyers prepare to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo dismissed rape claims against him as "false news" and said that people "will promote themselves" by using his name.
His attorneys are ready to sue German newsmagazine Der Spiegel, who published the claims.
The Portugal and Juventus predecessors were accused of rapeing an American woman named Kathryn Mayora in a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
He reportedly when $375,000 paid to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported Friday.
In a Instagram live video in which he addressed his 142 million followers, hours after the allegations were published, Ronaldo, 33, dismissed the reports as "false news."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, false news," said the five-time balloon d'Or-winner to the camera.
"They want to promote themselves by using my name.
This is normal.
They want to be famous to say my name, but it's part of the whole thing.
I am a happy man and everything is right," the player said smilingly added.
Ronaldo's attorney is preparing to sue Der Spiegel about the claim, which, according to Reuters, they called "unauthorised reporting of suspicion in the field of privacy."
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player would claim compensation for "moral damages for any amount corresponding to the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident reportedly took place in June 2009 at a suite at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly went to the player's room, where he was said to have raped her anal, according to documents submitted to Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo had fallen down on his knees after the alleged incident and said he was "99 percent" an "good old" who had been abandoned by the "one percent."
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also claimed that she had gone to the police and had photos taken at the hospital of her injuries, but later agreed to a settlement outside the court because she was "pang for reprisals" and worried about being "publicly humiliated."
The 34-year-old says she wants to reverse the settlement now because she is still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was at the time of the alleged assault on the point of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United and this summer, in an €100 million agreement to the Italian giant Juve, moved.
Brexit: UK will lose it 'for ever repentance' as their car manufacturers
The UK 'will eternally repent' when they lost their status as world leader in car manufacturing to Brexit, Company Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it is "wronging" that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without agreement, it would have to temporarily stop production at the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese vehicle manufacturer said that the impact of border delays in the case of a non-convention-Brexit, could cost posts.
The Burnaston plant, which manufactures Toyota’s Auris and Avensis, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see how production is stopped in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director at Burnaston.
Other car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have been aired about leaving the EU without agreement and how cross-border trade will function.
BMW said, for example, that they would close their mini-plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what car manufacturers say supply chain risks are in the case of a Brexit without an agreement.
Toyota's production line runs on a "just in time" basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars made on order.
If the UK leaves the EU without agreement on 29 March, there may be disruption at the border which the industry says may lead to delays and shortfalls in parts.
It will be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day's supplies at Derbyshire plant, the company said, and therefore production will be stopped.
Mr. Clark says Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU was "calibrated precisely to avoid those border controls."
"We need an agreement. We want the best agreement that, as I say, will allow not only the current success, but for us to seize this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today program.
"The indications of not only Toyota but also other manufacturers are that we absolutely need to continue with what was an extremely successful set of supply chains."
Toyota could not say how long production will be stopped but warned that in the long term, added costs may reduce the plant’s competitiveness and may ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the Unite Union's convoy at the plant, says his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, when these posts disappear, it never comes back.
A government spokesman said, "We have proposed a precise and acceptable plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump meeting with Rosenstein can be postponed again, says Withuis
Donald Trump's high-risk meeting with deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein could be "be postponed by another week" while the fight over nominated for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh continued, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special legal adviser Robert Mueller, who examines the Russian election interference, links between Trump-helpers and Russia and possible cross-bombling of the right by the President.
Whether Trump will dismiss or not the deputy attorney general, threatening Mueller's independence, has been instigating Washington's gossip for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of carrying a contractor to take up conversations with Trump, as well as the possibility of removing the president via the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the account.
But last Monday he went to the White House, amid reports that he was on his way to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, then at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would "chosen not" to thank Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a collision with the Senate-rechtbank trial in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both witnessed.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation of claims against Kavanaugh and further postponed the full Senate vote.
Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When she was asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said: "A date for it has not yet been determined, it can be this week, I can see it will be postponed with another week with all the other things going on with the Supreme Court.
But we will see, and I always like to keep the press up to date."
Some journalists will disagree with that statement: Sanders has not yet held a White House Press Information session since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the scarcity of information sessions is not due to a reluctance to TV journalists who are "effect hunt", although she said, "I won't argue with the fact that they're an impact hunt."
She indicated that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president held more V&A sessions than any president before him," she said, and added without quoting evidence: "We looked at the numbers."
Information sessions will still take place, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask directly for the president of the United States questions, then it is infinitely better than to talk to me.
We're trying to do it a lot and you've seen us do it for the past few weeks and it's going to take the place of a press information session when you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press releases with visiting dignitaries.
Solo press releases are scarce.
In New York this week, the president may have demonstrated why, by making an unbound and at times, bizarre appearance before journalists gathered there.
Secretary of Health writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland on Brexit fears
The Secretary of Health has written to EU personnel working in Scotland’s NHS to show the country’s gratitude and express the wish that they will remain in Brexit.
Jeanne Freeman MSP sent a letter with less than six months left before the UK withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to the cost of completed status applications for EU citizens working in the delegated public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer negotiations between the UK and EU on withdrawal continued, on the way to expected decisions this fall.
But the UK government also intensified their preparations for a possible no-convention scenario.
I know this is a very disturbing time for all of you.
That is why I want to repeat how much I charge each staff member’s contribution, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from all over the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the health service’s work, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home, and we very much want you to stay here.
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after head injury
Tennessee State Tigers' line player Christion Abercrombie had an emergency operation after he contracted a head injury in Saturday's 31-27 defeat against the Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Tennessee-team's Mike Organ.
Tennessee State’s chief coach Rod Reed told journalists that the injury had taken place shortly before rest time.
"He came to the margin and sort of just collapsed," said Reed.
Trainers and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen along the margin before he was placed on a portable and taken back for further evaluation.
An official of Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie is from the theater at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there is no details about the type/range of the injury yet" and Tennessee still tries to detect when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, an academic second year, was in his first season at Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
On Saturday he killed five times before leaving the game, bringing his total for the season to 18 vessels.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher seal tax when they buy a property in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp taxes when they buy a property in the UK and the extra cash will be used to help the homeless, according to the new Tory plans
This move will neutralize the success of Corbyn’s attempt to attract young voters
The stamp tax will be levied on those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Treasure expects to gather up to £120 million a year — to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp taxes when they buy a property in the UK – with the extra cash that will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The action will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's attempt to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing and target high earners.
The seal tax increase will be levied on individuals and firms who do not pay taxes in the UK, with the extra money that will help the government’s plans to combat homelessness.
The additional tax – which is beyond the current seal tax, including the higher levels imposed two years ago on second homes and homes purchased for rent - can be as much as three percent.
The Treasure expects that this move could bring up to £120 million a year.
An estimated 13 percent of newly built London funds are purchased by non-UK citizens who boost the prices and make it harder for first buyers to get a foot in the housing door.
Many wealthy areas of the country – especially in the capital – have become "poor villages" as a result of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes only weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a reduction in seal tax to help more young people to own their first house.
He accused large construction companies of holding up their property prizes by picking up land but not using it and encouraged Mrs. May to abandon quota on affordable homes to repair Britain's "domestic disaster".
Mr. Corbyn announced a striking series of preliminary housing improvements, including rental management and an end to "no-error-emissions".
He also wants to give gears greater powers to build new homes.
Mrs. May said, "Last year I said I would dedicate my prime ministership to restoring the British dream – that life should be better for every new generation.
And that means restoring our broken house market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live here, work and build a life.
However, it cannot be right that it is as easy for individuals who do not live in the UK as well as foreign - based companies to buy homes as for hardworking British residents.
For too many people the dream of homeownership has become a distant dream, and the humiliation of homelessness has become too great a reality."
Jack Ross: 'My greatest ambition is to manage Scotland'
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "greatest ambition" is to become the manager of Scotland at a time.
The Shot, 42, enjoys the challenge of blowing new life into the North East team, which is currently in third place in Liga One, three points below the top.
This summer he moved to the stadium of Light after he had led back to the Scottish premiere last season of St Mirren.
"I wanted to play as a player for my country.
I took the second team, but it was already," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sports Sound.
"But as a child I often watched with my father for Scotland at Hampden and it was something that drew me back.
However, the opportunity can come only if I am successful with club management."
Ross's predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa athletic boss said he felt no fear of following such established names at such a large club after he had previously rejected presentations of Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
'At the moment, success will be measured to me by '' could I have this club returned to the Premier League?'
Because of the structure and facilities at this club, it undoubtedly belongs in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task to get it there, but I'll probably only consider myself successful if I can get the club out."
Ross's career in management is only three years, after a period as an assistant boss at Dumbarton and a 15-month period on Hearts' coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa return from relegation to the third liga and St Mirren from on the brink of relegation to winners of the Championship title in the next season.
And Ross says he now feels more comfortable than he ever felt during his career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren, and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a true crossroads," he said when he remembered how he had taken over Alloa's lies.
"I really believed the management was the right place for me, even more than to play.
It sounds bizarre, for I have done well enough, made a reasonable existence out of it, and experienced reasonable highlights.
But the game can be difficult.
There are many things in which one must come weekly.
I continue to go through it with regard to the stress and pressure of the work, but management just feels right.
I always wanted to drive and now I do it, it feels the most comfortable I have been in my own skin during my whole adult life."
On Sunday, September 30, you can listen to the full interview on Radio Scotland between 12:00 and 13:00 BST
The perfect time for a pint is 5:30 p.m. on Saturday, found recording.
The summer heat wave improved Britain’s struggling bars ’ income but put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Drinking places and bar groups saw sales rise by 2.7% in July — but receptions in restaurants were down by 4.8 percent, showed figures.
Peter Martin, of business consulting firm CGA, who compiled the figures, says: "Continued sunshine and England's longer than expected participation in the World Cup meant that Julie had followed a pattern similar to the previous month, June, when drinking places were up with 2.8 percent, besides that restaurants were even heavier hit.
The fall of 1.8 percent in restaurant trade in June only made July worse.
Drankie-guided drinking places and bars have done far better and increased more than what restaurants have dropped.
Food-guided drinking places also suffered in the sun, but not as bad as restaurant operators
It seems people just wanted to go out for a drink.
Worldwidely managed bars and drinking places had increased sales by 6.6 percent for the month, with food being down by three percent."
Paul Newman, of recreational and hospitality analysts RSM, said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
Again and the impact of major social or sports events remains the biggest factors when it comes to sales in the out-of-the-house market.
It comes as no surprise that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although a fall in sales of 4.8 percent year after year will be particularly difficult above and except constant expense pressure.
The long warm summer could not have come at a worse time for food-led operators and only the time will show whether the more temperate temperatures we have experienced since August will bring needed relief."
Total growth in sales across drinking places and restaurants, including new places that opened, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the slowing in trade - brand announcements.

One out of five children has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents
One out of five children – some as young as 11 – has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers reveal a survey
Recording of 20,000 high school students has revealed an increase in false Insta pages
The news raised fears of placing sexual content
Twenty percent of students say they have a "main account" to show parents.
One out of five children – some as young as 11 – create social media accounts that keep them secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students has revealed rapid growth in "false Insta accounts" – a reference to the photo portfolio Instagram.
The news raised fears of placing sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they had a clean "main account" to show parents, but also had private bills.
One mother who came across her 13-year-old daughter's secret yard found a teenager who encouraged others to "rape" her.
The research, at Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Head Mistresses' Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of 11 to 18-year-olds have two profiles, with half of them acknowledging that they have private accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: "It is disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers cannot detect them."
Eilith Doyle will be "voice for athletes" on Scottish athletic council
Eilith Doyle was elected as a non-executive director at the controlling body's general annual meeting.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated track and field athlete and chairman Ian Beattie described the step as a wonderful opportunity for those who lead the sport to benefit from her far-reaching international experience during the past decade.
"Eilidh has great respect throughout Scottish, UK and world athletic society and we are sure athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly from what she brings to the council," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I'm eager to act as a voice for athletes I and hope I can really contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland."
The American, who had the 200 meters and 400 meters at the 1996 Games in Atlanta under his four golden Olympic medals, is now a regular BBC expert, could not walk after having had a short-term ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter, "Today a month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors have said only the time will tell whether I will recover and to what extent.
It was exhausting work but fully recovered, again learned how to walk, and is doing skill exercises today!
Thank you for the messages of encouragement!"
Breast pump advertisement that compares mothers to cows split opinions online
A breast pump company has divided opinions online with an advertisement that compares breast feeding mothers to cows being milked.
In celebration of the launch of what is called the "world's first silently portable breast pump," consumer technology company Elvie released a tongue-in-the-kiss music video inspired advertisement to show the freedom the pump gives to mothers that milk out.
Four right mothers dance in a barn full of straw and cows on the measure of a song that includes lyrics such as: "Yes, I milk myself, but you can't see a tail" and "In case you haven't seen, it's not udders, it's my breasts."
The choir section reads: "Put it out, pump it out, I carry the babies, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my ladies."
But the advertisement published on the company's Facebook page caused an online controversy.
With 77,000 viewings and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reaction from viewers, with many saying that it underplays the "grudges" of the dairy industry.
"Very poor decision to use cows to advertise this product.
As we have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but their babies are often stolen from them within days of giving birth," one wrote.
The Elvie brush pump fits discreetly in a nutshell (Elvie/Mother)
Still someone noticed, " Understandably traumatic for mother and baby.
But, yes, why not use it to advertise a breast pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Someone else added, "The advertisement is so out of touch."
Others defended the advertisement, with one woman who admitted that the song was for her "scream naked."
"I think that's a brilliant idea.
I would have had one if I had continued breast - feeding.
To milk out made me feel like a cow.
The advertisement is a bit crazy, but I have accepted it for what it is.
It's a brilliant product," wrote one.
Still someone noticed: "It's a nice advertisement aimed at mothers who feel milk (often in their workplaces or toilets) and like "kie."
It is not an advertisement that praises or judges the dairy industry.
At the end of the video the women show that they all danced with the discreet pump in their bra's.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the understanding that many women who milk out say they feel like cows.
The Elvie pump, however, is still silent, has no wires or tubes, and fits discreetly into a nutshell that gives women the freedom to move, hold their babies and even go out while they are milking out.
Ana Balarin, partner and UKD at Mother remarked, "The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a large and appealing introduction.
By drawing a parallel between women who had milk and dairy cows, we wanted to put the milking process and all its challenges in the spotlight, while in an entertaining way that people can find the wonderful sense of freedom demonstrating the new pump.
This isn't the first time the Elvie pump got the news.
During London Fashionweek, a mother of two appeared on the treadboard for designer Marta Jakubowski while she was using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of persisting migrant children has increased sharply, although monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, partly because of fierce rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration, making it harder to put children in bailes.
Traditionally, most sponsors were also undocumented immigrants and feared that their own ability to remain in the country would be put at risk by taking forward to demand a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that possible sponsors and other adult members of their households would have to print their fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week Matthew Bonnence, a senior official at Immigration and customs enforcement, witnessed before Congress that the agency had arrested thousands of people who applied to bail out unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested did not have previous criminal records.
"Approximately 80 percent of the individuals who are depositors or household members of collateral are illegal here in the country and a large number of them are criminal foreigners.
That's why we continue to persecute those individuals," said Mr. Albums.
In an attempt to process the children faster, officials introduced new rules that would require some of them to appear in court within a month of arrest, rather than after 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to shelter workers.
Many will appear through video conference call, rather than in person, to plead their case for legal status with an immigration judge.
Those considered unfit for relief will be quickly deported.
The longer the children stay in custody, the more likely they will become anxious or depressed, which may lead to violent eruptions or escape attempts, according to shelter workers and reports that have come out of the system in recent months.
Advocates say those concerns are raised at a larger facility such as Tornillo, where signs that a child is more difficult to miss because of the size.
They added that moving the children to the tent village without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally to say good - bye to friends can aggravate the trauma that many already have to deal with.
Syria tells the US, French and Turkish 'occupied forces' to withdraw immediately
When he addressed the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Sake Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to come home, even though the country's war was in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as Deputy Prime Minister, said the foreign forces are illegal on Syrian land, under the pretext of fighting terrorism and will be "appropriately handled".
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he said to the meeting.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terror" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, with more millions who have been uprooted, is "almost over".
He said Damascus will continue "to fight this sacred battle until we have cleansed all Syrian territories" of both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The United States has trained and advised about 2,000 troops in Syria, mostly Kurdish forces as well as Syrian Arabs against President Bashar al-Assad.
France with over 1,000 troops on the ground in the war - torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moulem said that the conditions were right for them to return, and he blamed "some Western countries" for spreading "irrational fears that encourage refugees to stay away.
"We called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to fascinate these returnees," he said.
"They politicalize something that should simply be a humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union warned that there would be no reconstruction aid for Syria until there was a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats said a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last great rebel fortress of Idlib, created an opportunity to continue with political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-supported Syrian forces on the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed the hope that military action would target jihadists, including warriors from the Al-Qaeda-connected Nusra Front that would "be exterminated".
UN envoy, Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of government and opposition members to set up a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem prescribed conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee and said the panel's work should be limited to " following the articles of the current constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Term
According to that logic, Trump will win the election in 2020, unless, as many liberals probably hope, a state of accusation and scandals early end his presidency.
In that unquestionably "the most dramatic final of a precedent ever will be!"
To date, there are no signs of viewer wear.
Since 2014, peak-time views have more than doubled to 1.05 million at CCN and almost triple to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
Fox News has an average 2.4 million peak-time viewers, at 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" is top cable viewing figures with as many as 3.5 million viewers on large news nights.
"It's a fire to which people are attracted, because it's not something we understand," said Neal Baer, program manager of the ABC drama "Designed Survivor" about a cabinet secretary who is president after an attack destroys the Congress building.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The manager told her that he would vote for Mr Trump.
She asked.
"He said, "For he makes me laugh," said Skovell to me.
There is entertainment in the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the story lines that come from Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, or immigrant families, and reunite the health of the world economy.
To turn off is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it goes beyond being just an informed citizen when you're in the sixth hour of watching a panel of experts debate about Bob Woodward's use of "deep background" from his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich leather fly jacket ("a garment thick from the hubris", said The Washington Post) and the implications of Stormy Daniels' shocking descriptions of Mr. Trump's, um, anatomy.
For example, I will never look at Super Mario in the same way again.
"Some of what he does that makes it feel like a reality program is that he's feeding you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, business director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of "Pawn Stars," about the Trump program's varying roll-sharing and daily swings in the plot (such as looking for contention with N.F.L., Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss one episode, or you'll stay behind.
When I reached Fleiss this week, it was 80 degrees outside his house on the northern coast of Kauai, but he was inside watching MSNBC as he took in CNN.
He could not tear him away, not with Brett Kavanaugh on his way to appear before the Senate’s Rechtbank and the future of the Supreme Court hanging in the balances.
"I remember when we did all those crazy programs back then and people said, 'It's the beginning of the end of Western civilization,' said Mr. Fleiss.
"I thought it was kind of a joke, but it seems now they were right."

External flow to most exciting mid-my selection matches in House
It's not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th sees an inflow of money, thanks to a shift of congresses that two officers have now ended up in a race for the same seat.
The newly changed suburban Pittsburg district allows Democratic Rep. Conor Lamb – who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring – to measure forces.
Lamb stands against another officer, Republican Keith Rothfus, who now represents the old Pennsylvania 12th district, who overwhelms heavily with the new 17th.
The cards were withdrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January decreed that the old districts were unconstitutionally delineated in the Republicans ’ favor.
The race in the new 17th cut off with a campaign finance competition between the big parties' financial legs, the Democratic Field Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Field Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a nail craap won in a wide-spected special election in March for Pennsylvania's 18th Congress district.
The seat was held for more than a decade by a Republican, and President Donald Trump won the county with 20 points.
Political experts have given the Democrats a slight advantage.
U.S.A. was thinking of penalizing El Salvador, rather than supporting China, but then turning back
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until partners disfellowshipped the Trump Organization's management team.
Officials of the state departments decided to recall the American heads of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the "unlong decisions to no longer acknowledge Taiwan", said Heather Nauert, the department's spokesman, earlier this month in a statement.
But fines were considered only against El Salvador that received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including drug management, development and economic assistance.
The proposed fines, including a reduction in financial assistance and excessive visa restrictions, would be difficult for the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, only North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level congress and focused on security and economic progress to follow a similar convention last year that was considered a step forward in an attempt to prevent migrants from going to the United States.
But by mid-September, top administrative officials made it clear that they wanted the congress to continue effectively bringing an end to any consideration of fines for El Salvador.
Deputy President Mike Pence is now destined to address the congress, now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the seriousness of the convention for the administration, the diplomats said.
And the three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic with no new angry messages or straves from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton did not want to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal debate on condition of anonymity.
Their statements were confirmed by an out-of-analyst who was close to the administration and also spoke about the condition of anonymity.
Study History
The next thing that can happen can be the special discussion of Robert Mueller’s report on Mr. Trump’s possible cross - blockage of the law, of which there is now much significant evidence in the public record.
Mr. Mueller is thought to focus his investigation on or Mr. Trump’s campaign with Russia worked in the country’s attack on our elections.
If Congress were to pass into other hands, Mr. Trump would have to face responsibility in that body just when he was preparing to go again before the voters, and perhaps in front of a jury of his peer group.
It's a lot of axes, and with that I don't want to suggest that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable, and not that of his counterparts in Europe.
There are decisions to be made on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect the extent to which the battle can be extended.
In 1938 German officials were ready to execute a coup against Hitler, if the West had only opposed him and supported the Czechoslovakia at Munich.
We failed and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points and democracy’s merciless course is rushed or delayed.
Americans now face various such turning points.
What will we do as Mr Trump deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls Mr. Mueller's investigation's fate?
Rosenstein had been in hot water since this newspaper reported that last year he had proposed to take up the president secretly and speculate about whether he was qualified for his office.
Mr. Rosenstein says The Times ’ report is inaccurate.
"How will we react if the newly requested FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair – or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court in spite of credible charges of sexual assault and dishonest evidence?
Above all, will we vote in the intercession for a congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we watch those tests, there is a long winter ahead for democracy.
But I believe we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime who at one time lived in my embassies.
She survived, emigrated to America, and, 60 years later, sent me to go and light Sabbath candles on that table carrying the swastika.
With that as my origin, how can I not be an optimistic about our future?"

Rangers' Graham Dorrans optimisms for Rapid Vienna game
Rangers play hosts for Rapid Vienna on Thursday with the knowledge that victory over the Austrians, after the impressive drawout in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify for Group G of the Europe League.
A knee injury prevented middle-fielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season into the 2-2-equivalent results against Villarreal, but he believes Rangers can use this rash as a jumping-out for bigger things.
"It was a good point for us, for Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old.
"We entered the contest with the conviction that we could get something and walked there with a point.
Perhaps we could have won it at the end, but an equalization is probably a just outcome.
They were probably better in the first half, and we got out in the second half and was the better team.
Thursday's another big European evening.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it's going to be a difficult contest, because they had a good result in their last contest, but with the crowd on our side, I'm sure we can push through and get a positive result.
Last year was certainly difficult, with all that had happened to my injuries and the changes at the club, but there is now a well-feeling factor in the place.
The group is good and the men really enjoy it; the training is good.
Hopefully, we can now push through, sit behind us last season, and be successful."
Women lose sleep over this money - sharing fear of retirement
Despite the fact that recording participants have a clear idea of how they want to be cared for, few people talk to their relatives about it.
About half of the individuals in the Nationwide study said they were talking to their husbands about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said that they had talked to their children about it.
"People want a relative to take care of them, but they don't take the steps to have the conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide's life insurance business.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your husband and the children: You cannot prepare your family to care if you do not express your wishes long in advance.
Work with your adviser and your family to predict where and how to receive care, since those choices can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Bring in your financial advisor: Your advisor may also help you come up with a way of paying for those expenses.
Your long-term funding decisions may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid cash-life insurance policy to help cover these expenses or self-insurance with your own abilities – as long as you have the money.
Work out your legal documents: Cut legal battles to match.
Get a health care proxy instead so that you assign a trusted individual to oversee your medical care and ensure that experts fulfill your wishes if you cannot communicate.
Consider, too, the authorized person for your finances.
You should choose someone you trust to make financial decisions for you and to ensure that your bills are paid if you are incompetent.
Don't forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medication and allergies?
Play those details in a written plan so that you are ready.
"It's not just the financial issues that have been raised, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
What is the medication?
Who Will Care for the Dog?
Make sure that plan is in place."
Man shot several times in Ilfracombe with windshields
A man was shot several times with a windshield as he walked home after an evening out.
The victim, in his 40's, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
Officers described the shooting, which took place at about 02:30 BST, as an "equivalent act".
The victim did not see his attacker.
His injuries are not life - threatening, and the police asked for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed because of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu Friday, officers said, and the death count is expected to rise.
With communication put out of action, relief officers could not get any information from Donggala's leadership, an area north of Palu that was closer to the center of the 7.5-range tremor.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were brought to safety after the disaster struck.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi Province, located on the tip of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379 800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a regent that covers more than 300 km (180 miles) of coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The regent, an administrative region under a province, had an estimated population of 299 200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the pillars of the Central Sulawesi province's economy, especially the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but it is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times during the past 100 years, according to Indonesia’s Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938 a tsunami killed more than 200 and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck west Donggala in 1996 and caused nine deaths.
Indonesia sits on the seismic Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly struck by earthquakes.
Here are some of the great earthquakes and tsunamis of the past few years:
2004: A great quake along the western coast of Indonesian Aceh Province in northern Sumatra on December 26 leading to a tsunami that struck 14 countries led to 226,000 deaths along the coast of the Indian Ocean, with more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong tremors struck the western coast of Sumatra late in March and early April.
Hundreds died in Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: a 6.8-ranged area hit the south of Java, Indonesia was most populated island, which led to a tsunami that hit the southern coast and caused almost 700 deaths.
2009: A 7.6-size tremor hit near the city of Padang, capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-range tremor struck one of the Mentawai islands, near Sumatra, which led to a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozen villages and led to about 300 deaths.
2016: A level shaking struck the Pidie Jaya regime in Aceh and led to destruction and panic when people were reminded of the destruction of the deadly tremor and tsunami in 2004.
It didn't lead to a tsunami this time, but more than 100 were dead because of buildings that had crashed,
2018: Great tremors strike Indonesia’s tourist island of Lombok, with more than 500 deaths, mostly on the north side of the island.
The tremor destroyed thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists were temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin’s eldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former governor of Alaska and vice-president Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of domestic violence.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested under suspicion of domestic violence, interfered with a report of domestic violence and opposition to arrest, according to a report issued on Saturday by Alaska State Police.
According to the police report, he took a female acquaintance's phone from her when she called the police to report the alleged crimes.
Palin is in custody at Mat-Su hearing facility and is held on a $500 unsecured deposit, reports KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared "innocent, certainly" when asked what he pleaded, the network reported.
Palin's staring at three class A offenses in the face, which means he can be imprisoned for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He is also charged with a class B offense, punishable with a day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal complaint against Palin has been brought.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported the alleged attack.
The case now serves before Alaska’s Veterane Court.
In January 2016 he was charged with domestic violence, interference with the report of a crime of domestic violence, and possession of a gun while he was drunk, in connection with the incident.
His girl claimed that he had boxed her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized in 2016 by veteran groups after linking her son’s behavior with PTSD as a result of his military service in Iraq.
Indonesia Earthquake Tsunami: Hundreds Dead
At least 384 people died after an earthquake on Friday struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
The 7.5-range earthquake led to a tsunami that destroyed thousands of houses.
Electricity and communications networks have been put out of action with death rates expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck just outside central Sulawesi, which is northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos circulate on social media that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds gathered together for a festival of beaches in the city of Palu, when the tsunami struck the beach.
Federal prosecutors seek rare death sentence for suspects in NYC terrorist attack
Federal prosecutors in New York are looking for the death sentence for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terrorist attack that killed eight people – a rare punishment that has not yet been carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saikov, 30, reportedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out an attack on a bike path along the West Side motorway in Laer Manhattan to reap pedestrians and a cyclist who was in his way in October.
To justify a death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "consciously" killed the eight victims and "consciously" administered serious physical injuries, according to the notice of intent to ask for the death penalty, lodged in the Southern District of New York.
Both those charges bear possible death penalty, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal-large jury beat Saipov with 22 charges, including eight charges of murder for the benefit of extortion, typically used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack called for "mighty planning and provocation", said prosecutors and described the way Saipov carried out it as "detestable, cruel and pervert".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saikov caused injury, damage and loss to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hern Ferruchi, Hern Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," stated the intention notice.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
A decade has been legally prosecuted by the Southern District of New York since then.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was sentenced to the murder of two drug providers but was finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were killed after being sentenced for a plot to spy for the Soviet Union during the cold war two years earlier.
Both Rosenberges were tendered with the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saikov, an native of Uzbekistan, showed no repentance in the days and months after the attack, according to court documents.
He mentioned to detectives that he felt good about what he had done, the police said.
Saikov told the authorities that he was inspired to execute the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the charges.
He also requested to show the ISIS flag in his hospital room, the police said.
He pleaded innocently on the 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal pro Deo lawyers representing Saipov, said that they were "naturally disappointed" with the persecution's decision.
"We think that the decision to desire the death penalty rather than accept a debt recognition to life imprisonment with no possible release will only prolong the trauma of these events for all those concerned." said Patton.
Before, Saipov’s defense team had asked persecutors not to desire the death penalty.
Tory LP says NIGEL FARAGE should be placed in charge of Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage made a vow today to mobilise "people's army" during a protest at the Tory conference.
The former Ukip leader said politicians had to "feel hot" from Eurosceptics – since one of Theresa May's own LP's suggested he should be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative back banker Peter Bone told the march in Birmingham that by the time the UK was "should be out" as Mr Farage Brexit secretary.
But the challenge Mrs May faces is to unite her deep-divided officers by pointing out pro-Roman Tories by joining a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister struggles to keep her Chequers compromise plan on track in the face of the attacks of Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU.
Bondeers insisted that she would press door in her attempt to agree with Brussels in spite of the death row – and force Eurosceptics and Labor to choose between her package and 'chaos'.
Mr. Bone told the Loop Means Run-convention in Solihull that he wanted to "eject Chequers out".
He suggested that Mr Farage should have been made a nobleman and given the responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
'If he was in charge, we would have been out by the time,' he said.
The Wellingborough-LP added: 'I'll get up for Brexit, but we'll have to throw out Chequers.'
He outlined his opposition to the EU and said, "We did not fight world wars to be in subjection.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.'
Mr. Bone has rejected suggestions that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: 'The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay is totally untrue.'
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns was also at the march and told reporters: ‘ I simply say, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
‘Chequers are unpopular with the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for it, it is unpopular with our party and our activists who are actually bombarding the streets and making sure that we are selected in the first place.
Please let Chequers go and start listening.'
In a direct message to Mrs May, she added: 'First ministers must keep their jobs when they keep their promises.'
Mr Farge told us that the convention politicians had to "feel the heat" if they were on the threshold to want to violate the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
'It's about a matter of confidence between us--the people--and our political class,' he said.
'They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them 'we won't get away with it'.'
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: ‘ I want you to make our political class, who is about to betray Brexit, feel the heat.
'We mobilize the people's army of this country that has given us our victory in Brexit and will not rest until we are an independent, self-regulatory, proud United Kingdom.'
Meanwhile, Remainers marched through Birmingham before holding a convention for two hours in the city center.
Some activists waved Toric against Brexit banners after the introduction of the group this weekend.
Laborededelman Lord Adonis mocked the conservatives for the security issues they endured with a party application such as the conference had opened.
'It's the people who tell us that they can have the IT systems and all the technology for Canada plus plus instead, for the wrenchless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,' he added.
‘It’s a complete trick.
There's not such a thing as a good Brexit,' he added.
Warren plans to 'look hard' to stand for president
U.S. Sen Elizabeth Warren says she'll look at it hard to stand for president' nà the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts-democrat spoke about her future at a city hall meeting in western Massachusetts Saturday.
Warren, a regular criticism of President Donald Trump, stands for re-election in November against GOP states Rep Geoff Diehl, co-chair of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She has been in the middle of speculation that her Trump may be challenging in 2020.
Saturday afternoon’s event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with constituents using the city hall format since Trump was in power.
A local asked her if she was planning to stand for president.
Warren answered that it was time for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that includes a woman at the top."
Arrest in shooting death of LSU’s Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, LA., announced Saturday that a suspect was arrested in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wayne Sims Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11 a.m. ET News Conference.
They released a video of the shooting incident on Friday and asked for help to identify a man seen in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed early Friday near Southern University campus.
"Wayde Sims contracted a gunshot wound in the head and was finally dead as a result," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on 247sports Saturday.
Wayde stepped in to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted that he was on the scene, owned by a weapon, and admitted that he had shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and arrested at East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A 6-foot-6 younger person who grew up in Baton Rouge played Sims in 32 matches with 10 lead last season and maintained an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 backballs per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton makes world title after team orders gave him his win over Sebastian Vettel
It became clear the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified for Lewis Hamilton on Saturday when Mercedes's team orders would play a major role in the race.
From the pole position, Bottas had a good start and almost won Hamilton as he defended his position in the first two turns and invited Vettel to attack his team mate.
Fattel first entered the wells and left Hamilton to drive into the traffic at the very back of the bundle, something that must have been decisive.
The Mercedes took a round later and came out after Vettel, but Hamilton went forward to wheel-on-wheel action which the Ferrari driver had seen unscrupulously risk-free the innermost at risk of endurance to a double-movement to defend at the third corner.
Max Verstappen began from the back row from the runoff grid and was seventh toward the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then led for much of the race as he held on to his tires to quickly finish and to pass Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He may have entered the wells on the 44th round but could not accelerate his pace in the remaining eight rounds, since Raikkonen took fourth place.
It was said that it was a difficult day, because Valtteri had performed fantastically all weekend and was a true sir.
The team did extraordinary work to have a one-two," Hamilton said.
It was reprehensible bad body language.
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Dianne Feinstein at a convention on Saturday about her insistence that she had not licked Christine Blasey Ford's letter in which she accused High Court-genomical Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
The president spoke at a convention in West Virginia and did not directly address the evidence that Ford had given before the Senate Committee. Instead, he commented that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were "common and rude and liars."
"The one thing that can happen and the lovely thing that has happened in the Senate over the past few days, when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and mean and liars," he said.
"When you look at statements and leaks and then they say "Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do that."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you lick?
Remember her answer... you licked the document--"Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't lick it."
Well, wait a bit.
We licked it...No, we didn't lick it," he added, in an homage of the senator.
Feinstein was sent the letter that set out the accusations back in July against Kavanaugh by Ford, and it was licked earlier in September--but Feinstein denied that the leakage had come from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations. I didn't lick her story," Feinstein told the committee, reported The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential as she asked."
But the president did not regard her denial as good and commented during Saturday evening's convention: "I tell you what. It was reprehensible bad body language.
Maybe she doesn't, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
The president continued to defend the Supreme Court nominee accused by three women of sexual misconduct and suggested that the democratic use the accusations for their own purposes.
"They are determined to take back with any necessary means.
You see the mediocre, the inconsistency, they don't care who hurts them, who they have to go around to get power and control," Mediaite reported the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer threw two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars reconciled for Friday’s Elite League’s loss against Belfast Giants by winning the 5 - 3 contest on Saturday in Dundee.
The Giants got an early two-purpose lead by throws from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvilier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought up the home team before Dwyer restored the Giants ’ direction.
Francois Bouchard brought Dundee even before two Luke Lundvald Nielsen goals tied their victory.
It was the third Elite League victory of the season for Adam Keefe’s men who first lost matches and then won Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday evening.
This was the fourth convention of the season between sides, with the Giants winning the previous three races.
In the fourth minute at 3:35, Dwyer's prom came from a Kendall McFaul aid, with David Rutherford who was helping when Beauvilier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In what was a busy opening period, Sullivan put the home team back at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt became the supplier for Cownie's equaliser at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants took direction into the first break when he threw his second purpose of the evening at the end of the first half.
The home team regrouped, and Bouchard found them again with a power-play target at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran stood together to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the match in the second half and he made sure of winning with his team’s fifth point halfway through the final half.
The Giants who now lost four of their last five matches are at home to Milton Keynes in their next Friday match.
Air traffic controller dies to make sure hundreds on plane can escape earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is considered to be a hero after he died when he made sure that an aircraft that carried hundreds of people had ascended safely.
More than 800 people are dead and more missing after a great earthquake on Friday hit the island of Sulawesi, and caused a tsunami.
There are still strong aftershocks in the area, and many are trapped in demolitions in the city of Palu.
But in spite of his colleagues who fled for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Guwyan Agung refused to leave his position in the control tower which was severe on the Mutiara SIS Al-Jufri Airport in Palu.
He remained unmovable to make sure that the Batik Air-flight 6321, which was at the time on the runway, was able to rise safely.
He then leaped from the traffic control tower when he had the day that it tumbled together.
He later died in the hospital.
Spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, says that the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, reported Australia’s ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Sadly, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts break to hear of this," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death toll can reach the thousands with the country’s disaster - provoking agency that says that access to the towns of Donggala, Sigi, and Boutong is limited.
"It is believed that the death count continues to rise as many corpses are still under the traps while many can't yet be reached," said the agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves reaching up to six meters, Palu snatched, which would have a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring in help and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance brings in bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
The mini-market is being looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help survivors, but we don't know what they're going to find there.
It's already a tragedy, but it can get much worse."
Indonesia's president Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military service: "I ask almaI of you to work day and night to complete every task related to evacuation.
Are you ready?" reported CNN.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was struck by earthquakes in Lombok in which over 550 people were killed.
Micronesia aircraft accident: Air Niugini says now one man is missing after lagoon aircraft accident
The airline that handled a flight that crashed into a Pacific beach in Micronesia says now that one man was missing after they had earlier said that all 47 passengers and crew had safely evacuated the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon they could not account for a male passenger.
The airline said that they were working with local authorities, hospitals, and detectives to try to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at the Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said Friday that seven people had been taken to a hospital.
The airline said that six passengers stayed in the hospital on Saturday, and that all of them were in a stable state.
The cause of the collapse and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. fleet both said that the plane had landed near the runway in the lagoon.
Some witnesses thought that the plane had missed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said that the plane had come in very low.
"It's a very good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and the others were able to walk through medium - deep water to the emergency exits on the sinking plane.
He said that the airors panicked and shouted and that he had contracted a small head injury.
The U.S. fleet said that ships working near to improving a wharf also helped with an inflatable boat rescued people to land back and forth before the plane sank in about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Air Safety Network indicate that 111 people have died in collapses of PNG-registered airlines in the past two decades, but Air Niugini had been involved in one.
Analysts set out timeline from evening that woman was burned alive
The state closed its case on Saturday in the re-examination of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice-analyst Paul Rowlett witnessed for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He outlined to the jury how he used cell phone records to assemble the movements of 29-year-old charged Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night of his death.
Rowlett said that he had received location data from different mobile phones showing that Tellis was with her death the night of her death, contradicting his previous claims, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers during the period he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford witnessed Saturday that he was not in the city that day.
When prosecutors asked him if Tellis told the truth when he said that night he was in Sanford's train, Sanford said he "jok, because my move was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency is that Tellis said he knew Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Mobile records indicated that they knew each other only for a week.
Rowlett said that for a while after Chambers' death, Tellis Chambers' messages, calls and contact information deleted from his phone.
"He certainly gave her out of his life," said Hale.
The defense was scheduled to begin his closing pleas Sunday.
The judge said that he expected the trial to go to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative outlook of the genres by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, of Bristol, claims that hip-hop has moved away from its origins of political messages and the approach to social issues.
They want to go back to the foundations and make conscious hip-hops popular again.
Artists like The Fuges and Common have seen a recent resurgence in the UK by artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?
NY-kidshers suede couple because she was fired to "racist" text
A New York children's blouse suede a couple for discriminatory dismissal after she received a wrong addressed message from the mother who complained that she was another black person.
The couple deny that they are racists and compare the suit to "expressed."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, aired her distress when she found out that the new child caregiver, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived for her first work day in 2016.
"NEEEEEE EEYE TO A SWART PERSON," Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a message.
Instead of sending it to her husband, however, she twice sent it to me Maurice.
After she found out her error, an "uneasy" Plasco-Flaxman fired me Maurice and said that their outgoing children's nuptial who was African-American was doing bad work and that she would rather expect a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Me Maurice was paid for her one day's work and then sent home with an Uber.
Now Maurice sues the couple for damages over the dismissal and seeks his damages up to the amount of $350 a day for the six months, residing job for which she was initially appointed, although it was without contract.
"I want to show them, look, you don't do such good," she told the Post Friday and added "I know it's discrimination."
The couple returned to the claims that they were racist, saying that it was the reasonable thing to end Maurice’s job and feared that after insulting her, they would not be able to trust her.
"My wife sent her something she didn't mean to say.
She's not a racist.
We're not racist people," man Joel Plasco told the Post.
"But would you put your children in the hands of someone with whom you were rude, even though it was by abject?
Your newborn?
Come on."
Plasco compared the matter to "expressed" and said that his wife would have had a baby in two months and was in a "very difficult situation."
"Are you going to pursue such a person?
It's not a very nice thing to do," the investment banker added.
While the legal case was still continuing, the court of public opinion was quick to bring the couple on social media and cut them for their behavior and logic.
A new letter reveals that Paddington publishers feared that a talking bear would not link readers
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said about the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who reads it for the first time before it was published.
It is very entertaining that we know about Paddington's great success."
She said her father would have been fiery if his work had been rejected. He was a BBC cameraman before he was inspired to write the children's book about the little toy bear. She added that the 60th anniversary of the book's announcement after his death was last year's "bitter sweet".
About Paddington, whom she described as a 'very important member of our family', she added that her father was quietly proud of his ultimate success.
"He was quite a quiet man and he wasn't an apple-eyed man," she said.
"But because Paddington was genuine to him, it was almost as if you had a child who had accomplished something: you're proud of them, even if it isn't your job.
I think he viewed Paddington’s success in that way.
Although he was his creation and imagination, he always credited Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying, and I had to greet over the phone.
When she landed, her daughter was chased to Nice’s Louis Pasteur 2-hospital where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad regularly called to say that it was very bad, that they did not expect her to make it," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I received the call from Nad to say that she would die within the next two minutes and that I should have greeted her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much, my heart.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicine the doctors gave her to keep her heart knocking was slowly touching and leaving her system.
She was a while before it died and the body was closing.
I just had to sit there waiting, knowing that this was unfolding.
I couldn't cry or cry or cry because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to keep it together."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who by then was hurt for the loss of her daughter, accompanied the other passengers on board the plane--unconsciously appreciated the trial she had gone.
"No one knew," she said.
"I had dropped my head and the tears fell all the time.
It's hard to explain, but I got an overwhelming sympathy for Nad on the flight.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Incentive women mail cards to prevent suicides on bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones because of suicide work to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been mailing cards for a while on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Me Davis ’ son Tyler was 13 years old when he began to lead to depression and killed himself at the age of 18.
"I want no parent to feel the way I feel every day," she said.
Me Davis, 45, lives in Lydney and said her son was a promising shef with a contagious smile.
"All knew him for his smile.
They always said that his smile brightened any room."
However, he gave up work before he died, because he was "in a very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, then 11 years old, found his brother after he took his own life.
Me Davis said, "I constantly worry that there will be a domino effect."
Me Davis designed the cards, "to let people know that there are people out there to whom you can go and whom you can talk to, even if it is a friend.
Don't sit in silence. You have to talk."
Me Humphreys, who has been a friend of Me Davies for years, lost Mark, her husband of 15 years, not long after the death of his mother.
"He didn't say he felt sick or depressed or anything," she said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his attitude.
He reached the lowest point on Christmas - when the children opened their presents, he did not make eye contact or something with them."
She said his death was very traumatic for them, but that they had to work through it: "It rips a hole through the family.
It tears us apart.
But we must all go on and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh’s future is still unscrupulous as FBI investigates
"I thought if we could actually get something like what he asked for--a timeless investigation that didn't cover--we might bring a little unit," said Mr. Flake Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee was "falling apart" under entrenched partisan stacking.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is all because of timing.
The interelections are only weeks away, on November 6 - if, as expected, the Republicans do bad, then they will be severely weakened in their efforts to get the man they prefer to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush calls senators to influence them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House and who met his wife Ashley and was Mr. Bush’s personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI delivers its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It's not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can come up to at least 50 voices on the senate floor that will allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to break a draw and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
North-Korea overflowing numbers 'down' under Kim
The number of North Korean robbers to South Korea has dropped since Kim Jong and seven years ago, a South Korean legislator said.
Park Byeong-seug quoted data from the South’s Union Cabinet and said there were 1,127 transfusions last year - compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said more stringent border control between North Korea and China and higher rates requested by human smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang made no public comment.
The vast majority of crossings from the North are finally offered to South Korea citizens' right.
Seoul says over 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most flight through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the highly protective demilitarized zones (DMS) between the two Koreans.
As illegal immigrants, Shina often considers them to be refugees, repatriating them with violence.
Relations between the North and the South - who are still technically involved in war - have significantly improved in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries in Pyongyang met for conversations that centered around the ongoing negotiations on the removal of nuclear weapons.
It came to the historic meeting in June between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore when they agreed in broad terms to cooperate for the nuclear - free Korean peninsula.
But North Korean Minister of Foreign Affairs Ri Yong-ho blamed on Saturday for the lack of progress since then.
"Without any confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances, there is no way that we will unilaterally disarm ourselves first," said Mr. Ri in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "histerish," he says he is incompetent to serve at the Supreme Court.
House minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court-genomicated Brett Kavanaugh "heisteries" and said he was spiritly incompetent to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comment in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas on Saturday.
"I couldn't help thinking that if a woman ever acted like this, they'd say 'histerish'," Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate-rightscommitte Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied accusations that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional and at times almost screamed and choked while discussing his family and his high school years.
He also expressly disapproved democrats on the committee and called the claims against him a "disputable and coordinated murder of character," organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton had lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that she believed that Kavanaugh’s testimony proved that he could not serve at the Supreme Court because it showed that he was prejudiced against democrats.
"I think he makes himself unfit with those statements and the way he went behind the Clintons and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked if she would try to sue Kavanaugh if he had been confirmed, and if democrats won the majority in the Laerhuis.
"I'll say it -- if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's not competent to be in the Supreme Court, but to be in court on which he is currently," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Ummegang Supreme Court.
Pelosi added that she was concerned as a Democrat about potential Kavanaugh decisions against the Law on Costable Sorg or Roe v. Wade since he was considered a conservative right.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh passed questions about whether he would overthrow certain Supreme Court decisions.
"It's no time for a hysterical, prejudiced person to go to court and expect us to say, 'Isn't it wonderful,' said Pelosi.
And women must handle it.
It is a righteous diatribe, months and years' anger that boiled, and she can't get it out without weeping.
"We cry when we get angry," Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do you?"
She continued, "I was very helped by a woman who was an executive officer somewhere, who also said that she was crying when she got angry, but developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and began to cry, she would have said to the person she spoke to, "You might think I'm sad because I cry.
I'm angry."
And then she just went on.
And I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are permissible as partial exits for bridle because they are fundamentally misunderstandingd.
One of my sharpest memories of an early work in a male-dominated office is where I once found myself crying with nameless anger and being grabbed by my neck skin by an older woman--a cold driver for whom I was a little afraid--who dragged me into a lobby.
"Never let them see you cry," she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and happy because they have had an effect on you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a democratic congresswoman from Kolorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught up in an extramarital relationship on a boat called Monkey Business and he had to leave the races, I had to leave Schroeder, very frustrated, realize that there was no reason why she could not investigate the idea that she could run for president.
"I didn't think well about the decision," she said to me laughing 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another.
Someone called it Snowy and the Seven Dwarfs.
Because it was late in the campaign, she was behind with discovery collections and so she made a vow that she would not enter the races unless she had collected $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters who gave men $1,000 would give her only $250.
"Do they think I get a discount?" she wondered.
When she gave her speech and announced that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was overrun by emotions--thankful for the people who supported her, frustrated with the system that made it so difficult to collect money and to target voters rather than partial holes, and angry with sexism--that she had choked.
You would have thought that I had a nervous downfall," recalled Schroeder about how the press had responded to her.
"You would have thought Kleenex was my corporate deposit.
I remember thinking, what are they going to put on my tomb?
"She cried?"
How the US China trade war may be good for Beijing
The opening of the trade war between the U.S. and China was deafening and while the struggle is far from over, a dispute between the countries may be in the long term beneficial for Beijing, experts say.
Donald Trump, the U.S. president, fired the first warning earlier this year by burdening important Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
This week, the most important escalation rolled in with new rates that affect the items of $200 trillion (£150 trillion) and effectively burdened half of the goods coming into the U.S. from China.
Beijing has been reprimanded in goods each time, and recently rates of between five and ten percent have claped to $60 trillion of U.S. goods.
Shina has promised to match the U.S. lap-for-shoot and the world's largest economy is not going to move soon.
To get Washington to stand back means to surrender to requests, but to satisfy publicly the U.S. requests will be too much of a embarrassment to Xi Jinping, China's president.
Experts continue to say that if Beijing plays its cards properly, pressure over US trade war over the long-term Shina can be a positive support by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
The fact that a rapid political decision in either Washington or Beijing can create the conditions that an economic toll can begin in any one of the countries is actually far more dangerous than spectators had previously observed," said Abigail Grace, a research assistant focusing on Asia in the middle of New American Security, a thinker.
Syria "caught" for refugees to return, says Minister of Foreign Affairs
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and appeals for help to rebuild the land destroyed by a war for more than seven years.
Minister of Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moualem said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly that conditions in the country improved.
"Today, the situation on the ground level is more stable and secure thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore to normal the areas destroyed by terrorists.
All conditions are now present for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they were forced to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that targeted their daily lives and their existence.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
A further six million people who still live in the country need philanthropic assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help to rebuild the flatland.
However, he stressed that it would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that had sponsored the invasion.
Europe sealed Ryder cup victory in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder cup and team U.S.A. won with a final point of 16.5 by 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The US has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a Ryder cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe got the crown back when the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn’s team reached the 14.5 points they needed to win the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who struggled for most of the tournament, left his T-hou in the water at the par-3 16th hole and admitted his contest to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golf player Molinari shone in all his rounds and became one of the 1-of-4 players ever to go 5-0 since the tournament's current format began in 1979.
U.S. Jordan Spieth was blown out 5&4 by the player with the lowest rank on the European team, Thorbjorn Olese from Denmark.
The player with the world's highest rank, Dustin Johnson, had 2 and 1 fallen to land Poulter from England who might have played in his final Ryder cup.
A veteran of eight Ryder cups, Spaniard Sergio Garcia, has become the tournament's European winner of all times with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It was a rough year.
So grateful for Thomas who chose me and believed in me.
I am so happy, so glad to get the cup back.
It's about the team and I'm glad I could help," said an emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He handed the torch to his fellow countryman John Ram who won US golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in single game on Sunday.
The incredible pride I feel, to conquer Tiger Woods, I grew up and looked at that old one," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods has lost all four of his matches in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 career Ryder-bekerord.
A strange statistics by one of the greatest players of all time and he won 14 major titles second to just Jack Nicklaus.
Team U.S.A. struggled to find the in-house field with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau who played high-caliber golf throughout the tournament.
US captain Jim Furk spoke after a disappointing performance on behalf of his team: "I'm proud of these guys.
There was time this morning when we put some heat on Europe.
We've deleted.
Hurt off for Thomas.
He's a wonderful captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We'll regroup. I'll work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we'll move forward.
I love these 12 guys, and I am proud to serve as their captain.
You need to keep your hat slanted.
We are surpassed."
