DFB CEO Grindel sees no basis for Özil-Comeback
Berlin DFB President Reinhard Grindel sees no basis for a return from Mesut Özil to the national team.
"This is a question which, of course, depends on the fact that one comes into the conversation once, that one also talks to him about why he seems to have felt one or the other as it was laid down in his statement," said Grindel in the football podcast "word mower" of the "image newspaper."
Despite the months-long debate on the photos of Özil with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regrets the withdrawal of the 92-fold national player Özil.
"I would have liked Mesut Özil to continue playing for Germany.
I also assumed, to some point, that this would be so," said Grindel.
The 29-year-old had declared his resignation from the DFB team in July and had also justified him that Grindel had not defended him against racist infidel during the World Cup.
The DFB boss repeated his criticism to Özil that he was not ready for a conversation with German coach Joachim Löw and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He didn't want to build any pressure, but he knows it from football so that if "one leaves a team or a club changes that one speaks to his coach and I find it a pity that this conversation has not been achieved so far".
Linz: Gartenhütte in Schrebergartenstädtinge
At 2:13 p.m., the Linz professional fire brigade was alarmed to a fire in the Angerhofweg.
Because a high-voltage line leads directly over the Schrebergarten settlement, danger was in delay.
The professional fire brigade broke out and found the cabin in full fire when it arrived.
The roof had to be removed practically to the full and fireshoet removed to the essential extent.
According to the owner of the burning garden cottage, he had a battery plug to store at lunchtime.
That might be the source of fire.
In any case, the charger was, according to fire brigade, in the area of the greatest fire intensity.
The damage caused by the fire is still to be determined - as is the cause of the fire.
He may be considerable, however, because the owner had many collectors in his garden hut.
Angry mother knows: Lindsay Lohan attacks refugee family on open street
What has Lindsay Lohan driven to this very strange action?
She apparently wanted to rescue the children from an alleged refugee family.
Lindsay Lohan (32, "Herbie: Fully Loodd") himself has a live stripe on how she apparently wants to rescue the children from a family in Moscow.
This is reported by the U.S. portal "TMZ" and it publishes a partial section of the stream.
Here you can see "kissed for luck" with Lindsay Lohan
In the clip you can see how Lohan rises out of a car and goes to an potentially homeless family who wants to make her a refugee family from Syria.
When the family flees right before the actress, Lohan persecutes the parents and their children.
It encourages the adult trade in children.
For all this, she doesn't provide any evidence in the clip.
"The whole world is watching this right now", Lohan is listening in the video, as she continues the family along the road.
She obviously tries to separate the children from her parents.
At some point, however, it seems that the obviously angry mother is enough.
It looks as if she's turning around and Lohan's missing an ear-fee.
Under tears, the actress shows how shocked she is - and she keeps her cheek.
What Lohan has done to this action is currently completely unclear.
Landing on Ryugu: This task has "Mascot" on the asteroid
The Hayabusa2 probe started in December 2014 in Japan.
It is intended to approach the asteroid Ryugu so much that it can absorb material from its surface and bring it to the earth.
The lander "Mascot" will stay on Ryugu.
Foreign ticker: number of dead on Sulawesi rises to more than 400
After the severe earthquake of strength 7.5 and then tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, death victims are at least 420.
The number of victims could increase even further.
The rescue teams have not yet entered the deserted areas cut off from the outside world.
Elon Musk withdraws as Tesla Supervisory Board Chief
At the beginning was a Tweet.
At the beginning of August, Tesla-Chef Elon Musk caused unrest in the stock markets when he announced a withdrawal from the Eletro car builder.
The U.S. board supervision sued him for fraud, but now both have agreed.
Tesla and Musk have to pay, and Tesla boss withdraws from the Supervisory Board, but he is allowed to stay.
British Conservatives Party Day
Sharp guard - the Party of the Tories
Birmingham becomes the stage of a power struggle.
On the day of the party, it will be about foreign policy, trade and development policy, but the four-day conference will be overshadowed by the dispute between Prime Minister Theresa May and the Brexit Hardliners, the foremost Front Foreign Minister Boris Johnson.
referendum for a new state name
The Foreign Ministers of Macedonia (right) and Greece have already agreed
Macedonia is a state in the Balkans, but Macedonia is also a province in northern Greece.
Skopje and Athens have been fighting about these name dolls for years.
Now they've come together.
The country of Macedonia will be called North Macedonia in the future, and this Sunday the population will vote - whether it's okay?
Protests in Brazil against right-wing populists Bolsonaro.
"Ele Nao" is meant to be Jair Bolsonaro.
A week before the presidential election in Brazil, the mood is divided in the country.
Thousands went to the street in several cities to protest against right-wing populist Jair Bolsonaro.
The "Trump Brazils" appears as an anti-system candidate and is thus in the front of the polls.
His hardest competitor is Fernando Haddad from the Left Workers' Party.
Audi: "Dieselgate" work takes longer than planned
"The Diesel Task Force is still in place," said Development Board Peter Mertens, the "Automobile Week" page.
In December 2017, the incarcerated and abandoned Audi CEO Rupert Stadler announced that the task force will soon be dissolved.
"In the first quarter of 2018, all engine/gear combinations were expected to be tested," he said.
Mertens now said: "At the beginning of July we achieved an important stage in the reprocessing of the diesel crisis.
We have completed the internal technical analyses of our VTDI engines.
The Task Force was founded in September 2015 following the discovery of the Diesel scandal at the Audi mother Volkswagen.
Mertens stressed that the car builder had made "graving organizational changes" so that such scandal would never occur again.
The VW Supervisory Board had postponed a decision on Stadler's future on Friday and will continue to discuss this Tuesday.
The investigative authorities accuse the Audi CEO of having authorised the sale of diesel cars with false exhaust gas values after the announcement of the exhaust fraud.
He knew of the manipulations or ignored them consciously.
The company is currently head of Sales Board Bram Schot, the Executive Board of the Company.
Due to the changeover to the new WLTP exhaust and consumption test standard, there were production failures at Audi, said Schot the "Heilbronner Stell".
Basically, he sees a falling demand for limousines such as the Audi models A6, A7 and A8, which are produced in Neckarsulm.
"The segment itself is difficult," he said.
Shot uses electromobility.
For the e-tron, the first Audi electric car, there are 15,000 reservations.
Grindle strives to re-election - Lahm is said to be in the DFB presidium
Mainz (dpa) - Reinhard Grindel wants to candidate again for the office as DFB President in spite of the criticism of his person after the World Cup and the Özil-Affaire next year.
"I do my job and try to make them as good as I can," said Grindel as a guest on the early Sunday morning in the ZDF's "current Sport Studio".
You have to try to re-election again and again, I will.
And then you have to see if the support is there.
The head of the association found it "notable" in his own words, if he did not "lust to work on the future project" after the award for the football EM 2024.
Since April 2016, Grindel has been the head of the association as a successor to Wolfgang Niersbach, who has fallen over the summer fairy tale event.
In autumn 2016 he was elected for a first full term of three years.
The next vote is due at the DFB Thursday, 27 September 2019.
According to Grindel, the future EM chief organizer Philipp Lahm is to cooperate in the DFB Presidency.
"I would be pleased if my colleagues in the Bureau agreed that in this role he would also be consulted in the Bureau and, of course, would be invited to provide his experience with sporting questions," said Grindel.
In speculation, if Lahm could become his successor as a DFB boss, he did not want to participate.
As a consequence of Mesut Özil's and Ilkay Gündogan's photographs of the affair with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Grindel expressed his wish for a national player to become an integration ambassador of the DFB without a migration background.
Currently this office is held by native Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic, the latter has family roots in Cameroon.
"If someone without a migration background has a significant impact on society and football, and says, "the topic is important, we have to take care of ourselves," said Grindel, "it would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our associations where integration needs to work."
Right to lose with half-klug scale
I've had a new toy for four weeks.
A balance that measures not only my weight, but also the body fat content.
Muscle and bone mass can also show it.
The body mass index also calculates the thing, but that's more for the sausage.
Don't tell him if I've replaced fat with muscle.
Basketball-Bundesliga: Clear sequence for Berlin and Oldenburg
Berlin - ALBA Berlin has started with a clear victory into the new season of basketball-bondsliga.
Against Science City Jena, the vice-master easily won with 112:55 (52:31) and offered a convincing match for over 40 minutes.
New entry Rokas Giedraitis was with 20 points top scorer of the dominating Berliner.
The national player Johannes Thiemann (18 counters) from Ludwigsburg also showed an appealing performance before 9113 spectators during his compulsory play debut.
Ex-Master Brose Bamberg won the compulsory play debut of Trainer Ainars Bagatskis with 84:80 (39:37) at s.Oliver Würzburg.
Augustine Rubit was with 24 points best thrower at the guests.
Würzburg-Profi Gabriel Olaseni came on 14 counters.
Last year's Playoff-Halbfinalist MHP Giant Ludwigsburg forced the Frankfurt Fraport Skyliners with 83:76 (41:34).
New national player Karim Jallow was with 24 points the most striking shooter in the team of coach John Patrick.
The EWE Baskets Oldenburg began the new season with a clear success.
At the Basketball Lion Braunschweig there was a clear 100:64 (48:30) and the first two points.
The new gamemaker Will Cummings overcame the Oldenburgers with 25 counters.
The Braunschweiger, in which NBA star Dennis Schröder has been majority owner since the beginning of the season, disappointed after a good first quarter.
A 26:1 run of the Baskets quickly provided clear conditions.
Erdoğan opens mosque in Cologne
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan officially opened the Dirib Mosque in Cologne on Saturday.
Erdoğan had previously met with Chancellor Angela Merkel and Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier during his three-day visit.
Criticism of Germany
In his opening speech, Erdoğan called on the German government to deliver living followers of the Gülen movement in Germany and to take action against Kurdish separatists.
We will protect our citizens no matter where they live.
We're not going to allow sympathizers of the PKK or gilding movement to shake our citizens and damage the German-Turkish friendship," he said.
For the opening of the Dirib Mosque, Cologne city centre had been partially blocked.
Several thousand police officers were on duty - including snipers.
The Islam Association of Dizib is criticised because it is considered to be the extended arm of the Turkish government.
"Global Citizen Festival": Music against Poverty: Stars, Bufrufe and Terrorology
Musicians such as Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn Mendes and Cardi B have applied for more commitment in the fight against poverty and disease at a joint concert in New York's Central Park.
"Enthuse you wherever you can," said Mendes at the festival in the night to Sunday before about 60,0000 spectators.
Thank you for coming here. That's a dream.
Cardi B appeared in a red outfit with French and golden microphone.
I'm nervous, I sweat, but it's okay, because I'm here and ready to change the world.
Also actors such as Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker as well as representatives of governments, the United Nations and aid organizations showed themselves on stage at the multi-hour spectacle.
In the meantime, however, there was a shock second when many viewers thought the sound of a falling metal lockout for shots, got scared and tried to escape.
In short, panic arose, people ran apart.
Seven spectators were easily injured, said the organizer Hugh Evans.
However, the New York police and the musician Chris Martin calmed people from the stage.
"No one's trying to hurt anyone," said Martin.
You're all safe.
Tickets for the "Global Citizen Festival" concert were available free of charge on the Internet as every year.
If you wanted to get one, you would have to read and spread texts, photos and videos on the Internet about the global fight against poverty and disease.
For the numerous musicians and actors there were cheers and applauses - buhrufe, on the other hand, for the Republican Senator Jeff Flake.
Although he and his democratic colleague Chris Coons spoke on stage for more equality between men and women.
On Friday, however, Flake had spoken in the U.S. Senate's Justice Committee for the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh as a judge at the Supreme Court and thus had many women in mind.
At least three women have raised abuse accusations up to the attempted rape against Kavanaugh, which he rejects.
Flake called for an FBI investigation of the accusations after two women, according to their own statements, had experienced sexual assaults themselves on the way to the committee meeting in an elevator.
"You can also get in touch with me at any time in an elevator," Flake said at the New York concert on the crowd.
Press freedom: Federal Government defends the outcast of the journalist
Government spokesman Steffen Seibert has defended the outrage of a journalist from the press conference of Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
In the Chancellor's Office, the Turkish journalist living in Hamburg had covered a T-shirt with the Turkish and German inscription "Freedom for Journalists" and had gone into the first row.
The T-shirt, had not been the problem, said Seibert the picture on Sunday.
It was about a disruption of the process of the press conference.
The action of the journalist caused a strong disturbance, which would not be acceptable.
He has therefore caused personal protectors to take the man out.
Seibert said it was not allowed to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences in the Federal Chancellor's Office.
This applies completely irrespective of whether it is a legitimate concern or not.
The rules are the rules.
In Turkey, many journalists are in prison.
Many of them are accused of alleged espionage activities or support or membership in banned parties or the Fethullah-Gullen movement.
The Turkish leadership makes the movement responsible for the failed coup on July 15, 2016.
Some of the accused journalists threaten imprisonment for several decades.
Foreign journalists are also not sure about the Turkish authorities: Austrian journalist Max Zirngast was arrested at the beginning of September.
Most recently, the cases of the detained journalists Meşale Tolu and Deniz Yücel had taken care of themselves.
Although they were free and able to return to Germany, there are still processes in Turkey against the two.
Munich: Florian David Fitz completely drunk with Ina Müller
His fans usually know him so fresh and beautiful: Florian David Fitz.
There you have to look twice: Yes, that's really Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and experienced a wild night!
Hamburg - The talk show "Inas Nacht" produced by the NDR is known for moisturous conversations at the counter of the Hamburg port bar "Sellfish Posts".
Moderator Ina Müller, with her guests, starts on a lot of beer, some wine or even more high-percentage drinks to relax the mood and tongues.
Not a few Celebrities also drink for mandatory vocal insets courage.
On Friday another episode of the popular talk show was recorded.
This time: The actor Florian David Fitz known from films like "Menhearts", "Terror - Your Judgment" or "The horniest Day".
However, the trip to the high north didn't get well for the Municher.
On Saturday he posted a selfie - his face is completely cut, his eyes only two small slots.
The bed-selfy shows a totally sophisticated Florian David Fitz.
But he's not sick, he only has a powerful cat.
To his fans, he posted some - probably not quite serious - insights that he has now gained: "Regel eins: go NOT to Inas Nacht.
Rule two: never drinks the black sauce.
And syringe.
And the round of egg liqueur, the Ina swung by half three, also leaves.
Alcohol consumption is truly in the face of the 43-year-old.
His fans immediately posted a few tips to fight the aftertaste.
They ranged from instant brewing, fishbreading, or - probably the most targeted - headache tablets.
Others simply amused themselves over the sight of the normally attractive movie star.
As Ina Müller passed the nocturnal edition, it is not yet known.
However, since she has moderated the TV fun at the counter since 2007, the 53-year-olds seem to be clearly tested...
To a beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa has to fight with vandalism and unrat
The entry into the 36-kilometre railway cycle path in the Red Pot Country in Treysa presents itself difficult to find and waste.
Recipes against grassy vandalism are sought, but solutions are hardly distinguished.
Scherben, Zigarettekippen, Müller und Unrat, emulsified garbageimer and now disassembled signposts - so has been presenting itself since the longer term of the entrance with a seating group to the cycle path on the Haäze hill in Treysa.
For the show object Bahnradweg in the Rotkäppchenland a more than immeasurable sight.
The topic concerns members of the AdFC local group Schwalmstadt but also others for a long time, says the cycling officer of the city Ulrich Wüsterhagen.
The problem had already been addressed in the Council of Wheels.
There was no solution so far.
The proposals ranged from the relocation of the seating group to the regular discharge of the waste containers and cleaning of the areas at the entrance point.
"I think the latter would be the commandment of the hour - regardless of any other activities," says Wüsterhagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that the topic has also been introduced into the local advisory board.
Not only the garbage drives cyclists and residents around - the seating group is on weekends of regular meeting point for celebration.
Not only does it speak out frequently, there is also destruction in the layers: poles are torn out of the ground, garbage dumpers are demolated, signs are turned over, seat furniture is flattered.
Volunteers had already cleaned up more frequently, says ADFC member Susanne Klippert.
The actions, however, are only the proverbial drop on the hot stone.
They are angry that the rest area on the bike path is in Treysa meeting point for suspension.
"During the entire cycle path, the focus here is clearly on the Haaze hill," confirms the wheel traffic officer, who is now also concerned about the new bicycle site in Ziegenhain, which is being opened today.
"If they suffer the same fate, it will be really expensive."
Another idea was a video surveillance on the hill: "It may be that the threshold is much higher to get involved in common good.
This would assume, however, that a police step will pass in the near future.
In principle, desert hedges wish for a development of the haaße hill.
It had to be more attractive.
In fact, it is possible to be very satisfied with the frequency of the cycle path so far.
Tourist marketing is still expandable.
Our cycle path is very high in comparison to others in Germany", says ADFC members.
ADFC member Susanne Klippert appreciates the situation on Asheröder Straße in Treysa.
There's no sign of a detour on the Haaße hill.
In the case of rainy traffic, it can happen that cyclists have to wait in the middle of the road between both-sided traffic flows," she explains.
This is not a problem for sporty drivers, but it is for the elderly and especially for children.
Music contest at the Kulturbahnhof: The "Kö von Hiltrup" and the lake
The first call to the music contest was a success, creative and interconnected.
"D a song for Hiltrup" is the appeal of the district offensive Hiltrup, in the "Music contest for large and small, young and experienced musicians".
A contest "with eyewinkers in the sympathetic Hiltruper family", as Karl Franke formulated.
In fact, it was soon a family meeting with coffee and cakes from the honoraries of the Kulturbahnhof.
Seven formations occurred, from the one-man band to the big ensemble: Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel Unzeit, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Imig, a long live albachtener in Hiltrup, the nine of the "Hiltruper star colours", three members and three generations of the Trenkamp and Claus families, an ensemble from the Lummerland kindergarten and finally Rike Weßling and the Blackties.
This contest, said District Mayor Joachim Schmidt, was a novelty.
We haven't experienced this in other neighborhoods yet.
What were the lyrics connected with?
In the places of the Hiltruper lake and the market avenue were mentioned particularly frequently.
Rolf Ihmig gave the avenue in his camp-like song to the "Kö von Hiltrup".
The Kulturbahnhof was also honoured.
Again and again it was about experiencing together in these places, especially with Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke lived up to the short reconstruction breaks with short interviews with the interpreters or clues about their work.
So it was learned from Humberg that he actually studied chemistry, but now he also taught guitar.
Franke knew from sound engineer Stefan Schemmelmann that he had recently appeared in Ludwigshafen - at a large event of BASF with Barclay James Harvest in the program.
And Alvin Jasic has placed all kinds of things on Youtube.
"It's not about winning," said Franke.
In fact, all participants received a gift from the Hiltruper Gastronomy.
For the jury's favorites there was still something special - so that others can hear their songs.
A whole CD can be played by Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Unzeit with sound engineer Schemmelmann.
Other musicians can record one song: Ihmig with his Hiltrup-Schlager, who particularly impressed Franke with his musicality, and the "Lummerland-Rudel": "a very nice performance" with ten children and two educators of guitar and Cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.
Like everyone, the children also appeared at the finale once again - and even without electronic support sounded "rightly good", as Franke said.
The jury was guided by the aspects of originality, reference to Hiltrup, access to the melody and recognition value.
The jury belonged to Gisbert Keller from the Westfälische Schule für Musik, Andreas Klomfess from the KvG-Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers from the Wirtschaftsverbund as well as Jan Kaven, chairman of the district offensive.
The district offensive had created the event on the occasion of its ten-year existence.
She valued the event as a full success.
All are "very satisfied", and "the atmosphere was good" in the very full cultural station soon.
The word game: "decrypto" in the game test
The players form two teams opposite each other.
For each side there is a visual screen, in it four cards with keywords, which can be decoded - the old trick with the red foil - only when you put them in.
This ensures that the opposite side can not read by mistake.
On the cards is then, for example, to read from left to right: "1. Renaissance.
2nd window.
3rd cube.
4th Feast.
These are the terms to encrypt from now on.
Because we should not guess the terms but codes here.
In turn, a player per team is the encrypter.
He gets a code card that might be called 3.4.2.
In "decrypto", the terms behind the secret film are not to be advised, but their encryption codes.
His task in this case is to describe - in this order and in this example - the terms "dice", "Fest" and "window" - in such a way that his own team recognizes the correct order and the opposing team as far as possible, because this wins the game if it manages twice to crack the code.
So the encoder notes and reads aloud: "Throwing" for the cubes, "Lose" as a contrast to festival; here, of course, something like "Party" is possible and "Prag" because he has been careful in school and knows the window crash there.
So it continues round for round, team for team.
You don't know the terms of the opposite side - but it can be more easily combined with any hint given by the encoder there.
Perhaps mysterious, but not to be turned off, the terms should be, otherwise it will be unnecessarily difficult for his team.
Unfortunately, the most cryptic to "decrypto" is the rule book.
The co-players probably have to study it for quite long and detailed periods until they can finally play.
The explanation video under decrypto.info in the web makes it easier.
But whoever has first set free will be fascinated by how much feeling is in this seemingly inconceivable game.
Overall, "decrypto" is not as coherent as predecessors and genre-primus "codenames", which also puts an agent's theme on a game of less words, but is much better to play in small groups.
And whoever it's about guessing and not about winning points, he can easily find a version for two.
Kulmbach: Mann shows police Hitler greeting and harasss guests in the pub
A 48-year-old man employed the police inspection Kulmbach twice in the night from Saturday to Sunday.
Only in the Upper City did he show Hitler's greeting in a passing police step, and later he also fell in a bar in the Upper City when he harassed other guests.
After he had clearly failed to alcoholize the police's transfer of space, he had to spend the night at the police inspection Kulmbach in the prison cell.
In a sober state, he must also be criminally responsible for the use of trademarks of unconstitutional organizations.
Operation plant Pressig was home of the block
The railway station in Pressig was the hub in the Frankenwald for decades.
In 1991, a piece of railway history ended.
"When buffer buffers hit, it was heard in all the pressy," recalls Georg Dinkel, who archived the history of the place and the station.
That didn't hurt anybody.
There, the brakes swung, and the wagons gnawed.
That was just railway pure.
Statements that are symbolic of Dinkel's home Pressig.
Nowhere in the Frankenwald was a place so marked by the railway.
Here was the starting point of the steep ramp mountain route north, which after a rise of about 220 metres has its summit point in Steinbach am Wald.
In order to cope with this, train and drawer blocks were once needed, which had their home in Pressig.
In 1901, the Bavarian Landtag approved the construction of a railway plant with 21 locomotives, teaching workshops, coaching and railway championships.
"Herzstück was the turntable, which had a diameter of 18 meters after a conversion in 1899," says Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid, railway historian and professional railways for 47 years.
The BW Pressig railway station, which was under construction in 1968 Bamberg, also operated locomotives for the side lines Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - Nordhalten.
On July 15, 1950, the "Volksblatt" reported a staff of 160 men; 13 steam and eight elloks were stationed in Pressig.
The electrification of the line in 1939 already minimized the need for train and slide blocks.
From 1977 they were used only for freight trains.
By 1991 at least 10,000 weights were still placed in place per month.
In 1982, parts of the plant were cut off, and in 1991 the rest were broken.
Heidrich: "It is regrettable that one has not considered a better use of the site, even in freight traffic."
For the anniversary "50 years of electrification Nuremberg - Saalfeld" the Nuremberg Railway Director celebrated a pumping railway station festival in Pressig at Pentecost 1989.
"There were 10,000 enthusiastic spectators here," recalls Georg Dinkel.
Little later.
On June 1, 1991, the last 30 men were withdrawn, the Rangierbahnhof Pressig was history.
"The Rangiers and Hemmschuhlegs did the most difficult work in train traffic," recalls Dinkel.
Any mistreatment would have had fatal consequences.
Why the station has led Pressig-Rothenkirchen for the conversion of the hierarchy of the two places and many other historical and current pictures are available here in the infrainkingPlus article.
Kerber with update at China Open
Beijing (dpa) - Wimbledon winner Angelique Kerber and Laura Siegeund reached the second round at the tennis tournament in Beijing as before.
Kerber won the China Open 6:2, 6:2 against the Frenchist Kristina Mladeovic.
The next opponent of the world rankings-third is Julia Putinzewa from Kazakh or Spaniard Carla Suárez Navarro.
Siegeund led 6:3, 4:2 against Dariah Kassatkina, when the Russian who was set at number 13 gave up.
The Schwabin now has to do with Anett Kontaveit from Estonia.
In the course of the series "Art and Enjoyment", a special exhibition was opened on the weekend in Mitterehrenbach.
With great ease, organizers and visitors watched the ideal weather when the special Vernissage "Windspiel-Performance" was opened in the open-air area of the property Dahlmann- Schmidt, Mitterehrenbach.
It takes place under the roof of the tourism association "Round ums Walberla" as part of the series "Art and Enjoyment".
It opened its doors in the 15th year.
A large visitor's address showed the fascination of the exhibition.
21 copies of 20 artists can now be visited in Mitterehrenbach.
Mr. Ernst Jürgen Dahlmann welcomed the artists to the opening of the Vernissage.
He himself has been there since the first hour.
Just like Volker Hahn, who made himself a name for himself as the main organizer and artist.
A little surprising but a few days ago, Hahn announced his resignation.
With Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer, however, he put his job in proven young hands with good future prospects.
In the past, both have already actively participated in the selection of artists and formed flyers.
This year, too, there is another 70-cent special stamp designed by them on the occasion of art & pleasure, available at every art station.
This year's poster "Betzn uitzen", designed by Volker Hahn, can also be purchased for eight euros.
Hahn was pleased about the high appeal of the special exhibition.
Max Marcus Stadler from Nuremberg could be won for the musical framing.
As you walk through the generous garden, the visitor quickly becomes aware that the title "Windspiel-Performance" formally challenges the artistic imagination and finally expresses it playfully.
There are works of metal or ceramics, often with color accents.
At the entrance of the property, visitors are waiting on the right side of the "Glücksbaum" by artist Werner Baur, Eschenau.
It is a tree tumbler, brightly brightened, playfully equipped with 20 windshields, 24 hoofs and 24 alu tubes as a piece of sound.
With the sun soaking through the bushwork in the background, the object looks fairytalely sundial and invites you to stay.
From Eckental comes Barbara Wascheneck, who prefers three-dimensional letters dedicated to the event 15 years K&G.
There are many parts in motion in the wind.
In the middle of the line, Siegrid Frey from Eckental exhibited her work "The Wind the Heavenly Child".
And at the end of the area, Volker Hahn shows his colorful imagination design of clay, cement and stainless steel.
The theme of "Windspiel-Performance" is to swing through the versatile art exhibition.
The special exhibition can be visited by 31 December 2018.
50 years MGV 68 Albachten: singers celebrate 50th birthday festive
1968 - that was the time of protest and the student movement.
And the Albachtens also aired their anger back then.
At least five of them.
They didn't want to be partout with the fact that after the resolution of the church choir "Cäcilia" there should no longer be Sangesleben in the district.
It has now become a legend: At a bank in the tin bush they raised the MGV 68 albachtes from baptism.
That was 50 years ago.
Now the anniversary was celebrated in the "House of Meeting".
"It's going to be full today," thought President Jürgen Holzigere, and he should be right.
There were 150 guests, a real success for the Albachten singers.
On their own for the anniversary they had brought the Foundation Festival back to life.
For years it was tradition, then there was only a break.
The festival of tradition was back to its 50th anniversary.
An elegant ball it was asked for festive clothing before.
The guests did not sit in rows of seats as usual in the "House of Meeting", but were cozy at tables.
In between, movement was announced: DJ Matthias Drees from Nottuln attracted the controllers and asked for the dance floor.
Honorably, the singers of the MGV 68 Albachten even made the voice sound.
For the occasion, happy songs were announced.
Almost already: "So a day, as beautiful as today".
Matching the exquisite grape juice that many had in mind, there was the "Rüdesheimer Wein".
In an allusion to another cool drink, "Humulus lupus", which is the Latin term for "hopping".
Once again sovereign was Richard Homann's choir director, who was one of the five who were in the tin bush at the time.
"It's just fun to sing under his lead," Holsfahrte said, "He has such an easy way, it's a master's achievement that he does."This time, by the way, not only men presented themselves with singing.
The ladies' choir "Hohes C" was also a guest, whose repertoire includes especially Evergreens from the 20s to the 60s.
Finally, there was still poetry.
Singer Theo Weber had sat at the desk until three o'clock in the morning to create his own rhyme.
And Andreas Winterhoff also presented well-sounding poetry.
There was also a big tombola.
The proceeds will finance a visit to the All Weather Zoo to the children of the Albatros Youth Centre.

Volleyball: 3rd League Women: USC II wins high-class Derby against BW Aasee
The climber marches.
Three games, three wins - the reserve of the USC Münster under the auspices of Axel Büring is really right in league three.
No trace of shawl or frack sauces, the independents make her thing.
At 3:0 (25:15, 25:23, 26:24) against city competitor BW Aasee is really good.
"That wasn't clear, but we already left an impression," says the rather satisfied trainer.
BWA-Coach Kai Annacker immediately added: "This is a defeat with which we can live very well.
We are not satisfied". On the contrary.
In the evening at a postponing birthday party by Ronja de Boer, the mood was good, the game was cut off.
Yes, the result is indeed an optical deception.
In the third sentence the guests had a set ball.
"When they bring that goal to the finish, such a game can already squat," Büring knows from years of experience.
Finally, the USC made everything clear with its routinated forces and brought the full yield into the goal.
"All of us are aware who is on the other side in such a derby.
That doesn't break our neck.
I have seen really good volleyball in stages," Annacker did not have the 0:3 - and went to the agenda immediately.
Where the trip goes for the independent, after just three days of playing, does not seem to be visible.
"For that, it's just too early," says Axel Büring.
Only in one he feels confirmed: "The 3rd league has an incredibly good level.
With Regionalliga Volleyball this is not nearly comparable".In the fourth league, they no longer want to look down.
If the vests are not dirty in the next few weeks, they have to look up.
A first balance sheet can only be drawn after ten, eleven games.
On Saturday we'll go to Emlichheim.
Aasee will arrive in Essen on 14 October.

About her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband
Heide Keller became a star on the "Treamship".
Now she talks openly about the series having had a complicity in her wedding show with Hans von Borsody.
Her role as Chief Host Beatrice of Ledebur on the "Treamship" made Heide Keller (76), but on January 1, 2018 she went off board forever.
The series that made her star could be co-responsible for her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929 - 2013), with which she had been married for ten years.
"That could have been a reason.
Because I grew up with this work, I traveled around the world with a suitcase alone and many of my admired colleagues took me to the eye," says Keller in conversation with the "image on Sunday".
At first, she was only "the wife of Hans von Borsody", but that had changed with the "dream ship".
Because now the journalists only called Heide Keller.
"I don't know whether he liked it so well."
She considers it possible that her husband at that time might have been envious, but "how many men also shy Hans talks about problems and feelings."
Keller always tried to be the only one for Hans von Borsody and he didn't want to know my fears, my weaknesses.
That means in good German: I changed my mind", as she continues to explain.
She always felt "not good enough for him.
He saw in me an emancipated woman, whom I was never in truth, even though I sometimes appeared bold and courageous on stage.
I wanted our love to be forever".
After a previously failed marriage to Thomas Härtner, Keller once again said yes, "even though I was afraid that it could go wrong a second time."
On the day before the civil wedding, I sat in the wardrobe and wanted to cancel everything.
The marriage to Borsody also failed.
Why never worked with the men?
Because I wanted too much.
At that time, Keller's love was "to be imagined in the film.
Unfortunately, this vision is not daily available.
I have approached love much too naïve."
The night family, who regularly explores the nightlife of the city in the Zurich NZZ resort, has this time ventured to the ZFF opening party.
Our folder isn't a moth, but it's a little light-shoe.
And the gleaming shine in which a green carpet is dipped on the six-legged square blinds it over a fee.
But it's film festival, because more or less famous people want to sunk in the spotlight.
So on this late Thursday evening he tumbles over the square to facilitate himself in the "Aquaclean-WC-Oase".
Thus, the public toilet facility sponsored by a large sanitary company, which celebrates its premiere at the festival, is called: The need centre in the parterre of a new pavilion is making a lot of effort to immerse a luxurious atmosphere.
This evening, however, it stinks in the men's oasis for some reason to heaven.
So out here, over to the other side of the road: Loaded guests who have been in the cinema next to the opening film "Green Book" just at the best level, celebrate the festival beginning each year with a party in the 3-story warehouse.
His name fits perfectly with this film festival: It is known that the works shown come from the whole globe.
What do you have to do with an article about this festival, so that you don't fall into leash advertising for its 190 partner companies?
The folder binds a volume around the foals that have put a good fairy to him, and two bully doorsteps actually win him in.
Inside, the loaded ones press, they dance far after midnight to live music or are presented by DJ rhythms to which they scream at each other, and rinsing down with Cüpli exquisite caps.
In the delicacy shop in the souterrain, oysters wait for slipping mouths, next to that, the incomparable raw ham Culatello di Zibello is freshly cut up, a chocolate well is sprinkled.
And the hammer is: All the sales shelves full of exclusive products have not been cleared for the occasion.
This has been the case for years, so it seems to be working without major losses.
You have to love this country for it!
The folder studies the sign at the escalator: "Take a long dress, please be careful on the escalator".
Should the two be separate instructions, he has gotten involved in the dress code.
But it's more of a conditional construction, and it certainly has saved life.
In the household department on the upper floor, the poultry kicks a cocktail prepared with espresso called "Golden Eye", suitable for the festival award.
This mix, with which a capsule manufacturer presents itself, does not get the price for the best drink.
And George Clooney, who has been advertising for said brand for years, isn't here that evening either.
There, however, a face passes between local prominence, cash table and kitchenware that is known to the observer: Peter Farrelly, the director of the opening film.
His main actor should not be far away.
And really, Viggo Mortensen walks the same way, with soon sixty almost like a choir boy, through the crowd.
He is not appalled, not appeased, he was topped.
Especially for this reluctance, like to be misunderstandingd, international stars love this film festival.
Maradona celebrates victory in Mexico with Cumbia dances
Trainer and ex-football star Diego Maradona is delighted about the victory of his team.
Argentina's football legend Diego Maradona seems to have lived well in his new home Mexico.
After a 2–0 victory of his club Dorados de Sinaloa, the 57-year-old coach danced with a player in the cabin to Cumbia-Rythmen, as shown in a video on Saturday.
In the 15-sec clip of a team member, Maradona dances in a yellow jersey, fired by the players.
On Saturday, the Mexican second-ligor defeated the Leones Negros by 2:0.
After the game, Maradona called in a TV camera "Always with my boys, always".
The 57-year-old has trained the Mexican club since the beginning of September.
Handball: Verbandsliga 1: ASV Send after last minute drive "to destroy the ground"
Swen Bieletzki, coach of the handball bandist ASV Send, could hardly grasp it: "Such a bitter defeat". His shooters were "damaged on the ground" after the unfortunate 29:30 (12:14) - Pleite - the fourth in the fourth game - on Saturday evening at LIT Germania 2.
As in Steinhagen, as against Hüllhorst, they did not play bad over long phases, the transmitters.
Only the initial phase "we have totally fallen asleep", the ASV trainer was upset.
Quickly, the householders led 8:1, even the early break that Bieletzki had taken, did not at first bear fruit.
"But then suddenly a backpack went through the team," Bieletzki summarized for the second quarter of an hour.
For the break, the residue was only more than two goals.
Above all, Sendens Best, Marius Hintze, met once again in the phase.
After the change it became even better from the point of view of visitors.
After 33 minutes David Ernst was equal to 15:15, then the season changer was almost continuous.
Four minutes before the siren, the advantage was still apparently soothing three hits (29:26).
And then?
Handle the impartials.
Bieletzki tends to guard against searching for the guilt of others.
But: The 120-second sentence, which Steffen Mühlhoff collected, "was a joke".
LIT had a good laugh and met up to the end four times - during the decimated ASV also failed in the last attack.
The boys fought great, stood well against seven men and threw them to the empty gate again and again.
Only they can buy little for the compliments.
"Now a damn victory has to come," said Bieletzki.
ASV-Tore: Hintze (9), Ernst (6), Schlögl (4), Kretschmer (3), Kümper (2), Mühlhoff (2), van de Pol (2).
Cough (1).
Bavaria: Female missing for 30 years - Police graves by body parts
More than 30 years after the disappearance of an 18-year-old from Naila (Landkreis Hof), the police are looking for the mortal remains of the woman.
On Saturday at Marxgrün, forces are digging up a road.
For this purpose, the street floor and several layers of it were taken off, as police and prosecutors shared.
According to new findings, the missing may not have been buried far away from their place of residence at that time.
The woman has disappeared since 4 November 1986.
The investigators did not rule out a crime at the time.
Since last year, the Criminal Police Court has, together with the prosecutor's office, been working intensively on the case again.
Together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the Bavarian Monument Protection Authority, the investigators encountered a conspicuousness under the street near Marxgrün by means of a soil radar.
With the help of a dog trained on the smell of human bones, the officials limited the position to a few metres.
The results of the excavations should be announced during the afternoon.
The hacker attack on millions of Facebook users shows what dangers lurk in the network.
However, users can also provide additional security.
Instead of complicated letter sequences, users should prefer to use passphrases to secure their accounts on the web.
In addition, security updates, for example for Windows, should be installed quickly, even if it does not harm to equip computers with anti-virus protection.
Elon Musk, founder of the electric car manufacturer Tesla, escaped his threatening appointment as head of the milliard heavy-duty company.
He and the U.S. board of directors SEC contributed to an extrajudicial dispute over misleading Twitter messages in which Musk could have lost permission to lead listed companies.
As part of the comparison, Musk and Tesla pay $20 million each, and Musk also holds the Chairman's Office for three years, a position comparable to that of the German Supervisory Board chief.
He may stay on the other side of the board.
In the comparison, which must be confirmed by or confirmed by a court, neither Musk nor Tesla admitted misconduct.
The SEC had sued the world-famous manager before the U.S. Federal Court of Manhattan for fraud.
Musk, who is also president of SpaceX space company, is the public face of losses of writing electric car pioneers, who are now being evaluated on the stock market with more than $50 billion.
Musk isn't aware of any guilt
Musk had explained that he had done nothing wrong and was sad and disappointed about the complaint.
He has always acted in the sense of truth, transparency and investors.
On August 7th, Musk had written his more than 22 million Twitter followers, he might take the company off the stock market and pay 420 dollars per share, the financing is secured.
This would have cost Tesla a total of 72 billion dollars.
Later, Musk ran back: Tesla stays on the stock market.
After the agreement, Tesla now has to find one from outside chairman, recruit two independent board members, and also set up a committee that monitors Musk's communication.

Shortly before the end, Sturridge released the reds with a sling in the angle.
Recordmaster Manchester United has been going deeper and deeper into the crisis since 1989 after the worst start of the season.
The team of the controversial coach José Mourinho lost at West Ham United with 1:3 (0:2) and with ten points after seven days is only in the table middle field.
The pressure on Mourinho will continue to grow before the Champions League match on Tuesday against the Valencia FC.
The former Leverkusen-Torhütter Bernd Leno came to his first premiere-league after an injury by Petr Cech.
Prior to the Champions League game at 1899 Hoffenheim on Tuesday, Manchester City won by goals of Raheem Sterling (29.) and Sergio Agüero (65.) 2:0 against Brighton&Hove Albion.
Leroy Sané prepared the 1:0, and Ilkay Gündogan did not work with the new leader.

The dance expert has become known through the RTL show "Let's Dance".

Surveys: 46 percent do not want Merkel until 2021 as a chancellor
After the crosses of the past weeks, GroKo has collected several polls.
The SPD falls back in a survey behind the AfD - Angela Merkel is critically seen.
Berlin - The AfD overtook the SPD for the first time in the Emnid Sunday trend for the image on Sunday.
In the weekly poll of the opinion research institute, the AfD adds 17 percent by a counter, the SPD gives a point compared to the previous week and ends at 16 percent.
CDU and CSU also lose a counter and only reach 27 percent.
This is the deepest value for the Union so far in the Sunday trend.
Greens reach 15 percent, left 11 and FDP 10 percent.
If, according to Emnid, the government parties SPD, CDU and CSU had been elected on Sunday, only 43 percent of the votes would be taken together.
This has now lost the majority in Sunday's question for all major research institutes - with the exception of Allesbach.
Government parties reach 43 to 45 percent of the votes (Allebach: 51 percent).
At the 2017 Bundestag election, they received a total of 53.4 percent.
For the other parties, the bandwidth is also large: the AfD, in several surveys the second strongest party, amounts to 15 to 18 percent.
The greens reach proportions of votes from 12.5 to 17 percent.
The left is at an average of 10 percent, FDP at 9 percent.
For statistical reasons such surveys have an uncertainty of 2 to 3 percent up and down depending on the percentage of votes.
But also the backlog for Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in the population has fallen significantly since the 2017 Bundestag election.
Currently only 48 percent of the citizens find Merkel to be the right person in the chancellor office, as the Emnid survey found on behalf of the BamS.
According to the survey, only every second (50 percent) wishes to see the large coalition holding in three years until the next regular Bundestag election, 41 percent are for a new election.
A further survey published on Saturday also revealed significant loss of popularity for Merkel.
The Germans also assess whether Merkel should apply again for the CDU chair in December.
According to Emnid, 47 percent are in favour, 44 percent against.
According to 64 per cent, EU supporters do not wish a candidate, 35 per cent do not.
Hangout at Aldi: Reduced price for the happiness of love
Will Aldi become Tinder 2.0?
Who says in times of Tinder there are no more romantic acquaintance stories - he should talk about pudding meat at Aldi.
Munich - In times of digital "Fastfood dating" through Tinder and Co., the supermarket shines almost an anachronistic romanticism as an acquaintance place for great love.
Yes, right, a conversation about reduced pudding meat, boxer short puppies at the warm table or the favorite pudding is, in any doubt, still a better story for the later grandchildren than a mere pup to the right.
The Tinder app is called to be less a contact, but rather a slippery stock market.
We risked the test: How do women react, when the first message is not long around the hot fry?
Here's the amazing result.
Regular Hollywood-Lovestory-Potenzial has it then, if the happiness of love presupposes an out-of-the-eye-lost and recovered plot.
If the guy even reports himself to his candidates under the e-mail address bio-putenfleisch@gamx.de, that sounds very much like Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant and Consorten - Romantic Comedy at it's best.
So it is the author of this annoyance in an unknown Aldi branch that she will find her dream man, with whom she has briefly talked about the "30 percent reduced bio-put meat".
For believing in the magic of analog learning, she earned her Happy End à la Hollywood in any case.
Bilderbeck: 500 Lids for a life without paralysis
Since the beginning of the new school year, the Ludgeri School has been involved in the action "Deckele gegen Polio - 500 cover for a life without child paralysis".
Polio is the abbreviation of polyomyelitis, an infectious disease caused by poliovirus.
The disease called child paralysis in German leads from paralysis to death.
In Germany, however, Polio is considered exterminated, but there are still three countries around the world in which the disease occurs.
The cause of polyomyelitis, the polioviruses, can only be inhibited by vaccinations so far, as stated in a press release.
Football: Reus and Zorc demand peace for idols
Leverkusen (dpa) - BVB sports director Michael Zorc and captain Marco Reus called for an end to the public discussion on the form and fitness of Mario Götze.
"We should stop thinking about Mario.
That's not good for the boy.
And that's not good for us," said Reus, friends with idols after the 4-2 victory in Leverkusen at the TV channel Sky.
Zorc had already stressed before the game.
For him personally, this is not a simple situation.
Football: Eberl: No hurry in contract talks with Hecking
Mönchengladbach (dpa) - Manager Max Eberl from the football-bundesligist Borussia Mönchengladbach sees no hurry in a possible extension of contract with coach Dieter Hecking.
We haven't even talked about a contract yet.
There's no fixed date when we do that.
"But there will certainly be a moment when we sit down and talk," said Eberl on Sunday evening in the TV channel Sky.
Football: District League: Researchers appearance of the VfL Wolbeck against the SC Altenrheine makes courage
There were moments in this still young season, and Alois Fetsch went to court hard with hiss.
He, the coach of football-cirksligist VfL Wolbeck, first withdrew (internally) to sense the lack of willingness to perform on the green.
All history.
In the meantime it is again running around the Brandhoveweg.
Taufriger Beleg is the 1:1 on Sunday against the SC Altenrheine, in the past season only thin-thins passed by the climb.
Yes, I am very happy with the appearance.
"We have made the rooms tight and put pressure on the ball.
That could be seen," Fetsch praised his boys and looked for each one of them to say "Thanks" for so much resistance to the ambitious guests.
After 26 minutes the coach had to make a system change.
After the injury of Nico Frerichs (muscular problems) - for him Luca Rehberg - it passed out of the 4-4-2 almost seamlessly into a 4-2-3-1, in which Niklas Thewes waited for balls in the front.
Wolbeck had significantly more games in the first section.
And chances.
But Frerichs before his departure (17th), the changed Luca Rehberg (26th) and Jan Schroer (38th) missed the lead.
Almost this would have occurred when the SCA in minute 41 was dangerously hit by the Wolbecker box twice in person of Kevin Vollarath and Chris Naberbaumer - Tormann Damian Hallas proved to be master of his trade.
After the break, the VfL freakily took full control.
Thewes from 18 meters failed.
Even Schroer came too late after 58 minutes with a Thewes input.
With the change of Miles Geske, a fresh cell cure was missed on the left side.
When Altenrheines Chris Naberbaumer fell in the 70th minute Robin Westhues, there was an indirect release in front of the guest housing for the placekeepers.
The well-founded man himself demonstrated his danger at standards.
Westhues" thing with the right shell hit down left from the view of the shooter - 1:0 (71.).
20 minutes, they should be long.
And then that: VfL-Captain Florian Quabeck flew in the 80th minute the leather in the penitentiary was unhappy at hand.
Arbitrator Hüseyin Sahin (Hamm) immediately pointed to the point.
Jannis Schneider did not miss the present (79.).
In the final phase, Wolbeck had to survive for a few minutes, before Geske was still in the 87th minute out of twelve meters with the victory hit on the puss.
Maybe too much of the good would have been.
VfL: Hallas - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Schroer - Klemke (75. Seidel), Bensmann - Frerichs (26. L. Rehberg), Westhues, Vielmeyer (66. Gesche) - Thewes

Eintracht Frankfurt wins 4:1 against Hannover 96
Starting position: Four points after five days - that was not enough Trainer Adi Hütter.
With Hannover 96, Eintracht Frankfurt finally wanted to ensure the first home win.
Stürmer Ante Rebic, who was first in the runoff after an injury, should help.
Also, the midfielder Luca Torró was there again after an injury and with his headball strength he should prevent the SGE from cashing more goals according to standards.
Readable before the game: How Eintracht Frankfurt wants to scratch up further, which construction sites Eintracht Frankfurt must close quite soon - and how Allan Souza somehow wants to get through with Eintracht Frankfurt.
Review: Against Borussia Mönchengladbach, Eintracht Frankfurt loses after a disappointing performance with 1:3 - the analysis of our sports reporters Ingo Durstewitz and Thomas Kilchenstein.
Helicopter crashed in Kottingbrunn
On the airfield, there was an accident in the landing.
The four inmates were slightly injured.
At about 2 p.m., a drama occurred on Sunday at the airport in Kottingbrunn.
During the landing of a helicopter, turbulences occurred, as confirmed by the police over Oe24.
The heli was captured by a windbowl, powered on the ground and came to lie down on the side.
Immediately, police, rescue, and fire brigade were contacted.
With a great command, the forces came to the accident station.
The ÖAMTC medical helicopter was also called for caution.
Inmates only slightly injured
Fortunately, everything turned out to be largely harmless.
There's only one damage.
The four inmates were only slightly injured and were able to return home independently.
The exact circumstances of the accident have not yet been clarified and are the subject of the investigations.
According to fire fighter Franz Resperger, a small fire came into being, but it could be quickly erased.
Report from the Allbright Foundation: Women remain rare in corporate boards
This meant that only 8 per cent of the board members were female on Tuesday 1 September, as is evident from the report "The Power of Monoculture", which is officially presented by the Allbright Foundation on this Monday, and the German press agency was in advance.
"The companies will have to stand up differently, otherwise the international competitors will pass them," said Wiebke Ankersen, Managing Director of the Foundation.
In the United States, Great Britain or Sweden, male executives, with few exceptions, are no longer imaginable.
In comparison, the German competitors make less diverse, innovation-friendly and future-oriented.
It's another corporate culture.
The slight increase in the proportion of women among German stock exchanges was also due solely to positive impulses among the companies in the index of medium-sized values (MDax).
According to Allbright, only 6.8 percent of the board members are female.
In the previous year, however, the value was still at 3.8 percent.
For the 30 dax companies - in the past few years pioneers - the proportion of women stagnated.
Last, 26 women worked in the boards.
"I'm sure the Dax companies will recruit more consistent women in their own interest in the coming year," said Ankersen.
Only RWE and Heidelberg Cement would have signaled that they would not continue to commit themselves to increasing the share of "zero percent" so far.
Another picture is found in the Supervisory Boards: On 1 September, the proportion of women was 30.5% - 45 women more and 68 men less than a year ago.
"If women were recruited each year for the Boards, a 40 percent share had already been reached in 2023," says the report.
Some even make Miese: Luxury Cars: Which manufacturer earns the most per car?
The best thing is Ferrari.
The Italians take 280,000 euros with each Ferrari sold and make 69,000 euros operating profit.
Large cars, big profits: This slogan is still valid today - in most cases.
Who among the noble providers makes the most profit per car.
Munich - Ferrari, Maserati, Bentley: How much are the luxury manufacturers per car they sell?
With this question "Autopapst" and economic professor Ferdinand Dudenhöffer has worked.
His study shows that the differences are massive.
In the first half of the year Ferrari made 69,000 euros operating profit with each sold car - Jaguar Land Rover, on the other hand, only amounts to around 800 euros, Tesla and Bentley put a strong impact on every car.
Mercedes, BMW and Audi are well in the race with prices of 33,000 to 38,000 euros per car and around 3,000 euros before interest and taxes EBIT.

Torque train for the opening of the 60th Abtswinder Weinfest
With a torch train, the Tourist Association in Abtswind opened its wine festival session.
For the 60th time, the club is setting off the wine festivals that continue to climb every Saturday in October in the big Festzelt on Rehweiler Straße.
At the start of the anniversary, those responsible under the sounds of the Spielmann train from Wiesenbronn moved through the place to the Festplatz.
The chairman of the Tourist Association, Wolfgang Starz, Mayor Jürgen Schulz and wine prince Lisa Kursawe welcomed the guests in the already proficient Festzelt. "60 years of doing something like this - this is an insanity for a small town with 800 inhabitants.
On that one can be proud," Starz thanked all the helpers.
Weinprinzessin Lisa II later symbolically struck with the guests from the stage.
"Thanks that so many have found the way to us after Abtswind". Later, "The Troglauer" caused mood.
On Sunday, on which the Abtswinder Kirchweih was celebrated, on the occasion of the anniversary in the afternoon, the club had set the beverage prices as 60 years ago.
A holiday evening for the 60th wine festival will take place on Friday, 5 October, in the guest's house before it takes place a day later in the holiday tent in the second round.
In Bonn: emergency car power in Taxi
An emergency car is heavily damaged next to a road.
A 27-year-old passantine has been fatally injured in the collision of the vehicle with a taxi.
When emergency doctors are called, they should help - best even save human lives.
Such a rescue trip took a fatal end in Bonn for a 26-year-old.
Bonn - In the collision of an emergency car with a taxi, a 26-year-old pedestrian was fatally injured in Bonn.
The taxi driver, the notary and their drivers were severely injured, as the police reported.
The 46-year-old driver of the emergency car had crossed a red traffic light and Martinshorn on Saturday afternoon.
He then met on a crossroads with the taxi that drove at Green.
After the collision, the doctor’s car slammed against a traffic jam and a tree.
In doing so, he recorded the passantin who was still dying at the site of the accident.
Driver of the emergency car and taxi driver seriously injured
The 62-year-old taxi driver and the driver of the emergency car were severely injured in their vehicles and had to be liberated from forces.
The badly injured 29-year-old emergency doctor could free herself, but the pedestrian couldn't help her anymore.
Another emergency doctor called, however, tried this - without success.
The three seriously injured were taken to hospitals.
The police, in close consultation with the Bonn prosecutor, determine who is to blame for the accident.
Manchester United again loses it untidy for Mourinho
In the 7th round of the Premier League, Manchester United also loses in the first round of the league.
ManU 1:3 is subject to West Ham United. The way of defeat is likely to yet be spoken.
The scene was symbolic in the 74th minute, in which the recovered Marko Arnautovic shot the 3-1 West Ham; only three minutes after Marcus Rashford had led the Red Devils supposedly back into the game.
As they suspected an offside at Mark Nobel's passport, all of Manchester's defense players remained standing, and Arnautovic left all the time in the world to shoot the ball at the helpless David de Gea.
This was the negative highlight of a previously far-reaching performance.
Quite the opposite is currently the mood situation at Uniteds City rival Manchester City.
The Citizens trained by Mourinho's great competitor Pep Guardiola came against Brighton & Hove Albion to an approximate 2:0 victory.
After half an hour, Raheem Sterling broke out for the home team for the first time the defense lock of the outsider.
Sergio Agüero provided after a good hour and a double pass with the former goal protector to ensure the sixth victory in the seventh game, and thus also the jump to the top of the table.
Liverpool no longer spreadsheets
Xherdan Shaqiri and Liverpool fought for Chelsea in the Premier League three days after the 1-2 defeat in the league.
As at the Cup, the Belgian Eden Hazard was the best man with the Londoners.
The hit of the 27-year-old in the 25th minute remained until the final phase of the only hits of the game.
Shaqiri, who came to the field in the 66th minute for Mohamed Salah, missed the compensation after 70 minutes.
It was better for Daniel Sturridge to do it during the 89th minute with his leash.
So after the reds started with a flawless balance in the week, Chelsea was not to beat for the second time.
First of all, the Londoners eliminated Jürgen Klopp's team in the Cup, and the Blues Liverpool fell from the top of the table.
Like City, the two London city clubs Tottenham (in Huddersfield) and Arsenal (against Watford) celebrated 2:0 wins.
However, the fans of the Gunners, where Granit Xhaka played through, had to wait for a success message against the surprise team from Hertfordshire County until the 81st minute.
Nine minutes before the conclusion, Watford defender Craig Cathcart successfully introduced Alex Iwobi to his own goal, only two minutes later, Mesut Özil and his third season hit.
Arsenal passed Watford due to the fifth victory in a row and is just behind the great rival Tottenham in rank 5. A strong impression remains the climber Wolverhampton under his Portuguese coach Espirito Santo.
The Wolves remained unbeated at 2:0 against Southampton in the league for the fifth time in a row and prove the 8th place.
VW brand missing: Paris car salon in the sign of the diesel debate
The Paris Motor Show takes place every two years in exchange with the IAA in Frankfurt.
Paris - Officially no subject, yet omnipresent: The diesel scandal and the ringing of driving bans and retrofits should not let the German car companies go off even at the industry meeting in Paris.
At the 2018 Motor Show, they will show their new products from the coming week together with the competition from all over the world in the French capital.
The diesel doesn't really play a big role in this.
However, the possible exchange and retrofit offers for Diesel owners in Germany, which are still to be negotiated with the government in Berlin until then, should still be an important topic at least behind the shiny scenes of the booths.
A big name is missing in Paris: The Volkswagen Group is present with Audi, Porsche and other daughters, but not with the core brand VW itself.
Audi and Mercedes-Benz are there, among other things, with their first pure electric models: The e-tron of Ingolstädter is to be launched at the end of the year, the EQC of Stuttgart's 2019.
However, both were officially presented.
The iNext of BMW should not start until 2021.
The new 3er is at the heart of Paris.
In total, more than 250 exhibitors will be represented this year from 4 to 14 October.
In addition to car companies, motorcycle manufacturers as well as numerous mobility services and software providers are also present in each of their own halls.
The fair, which celebrates its 120th birthday this year, takes place every two years in exchange with the IAA in Frankfurt.
In 2016, close to one million visitors arrived.
In the severe earthquakes and the tsunami that followed, at least 380 people died on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Thousands are still missing.
In addition, there are more than 500 injured.
The island had been shaken by two earthquakes on Friday.
The first earthquake had the strength 5.9, the second the strength 7.4.
Communication and transport links are damaged, and there is enormous damage to property.
After the earthquake, the tsunami broke into the west coast of Sulawesi.
In the coastal town of Palu hundreds gathered on the beach for a feast.
It is feared that the number of victims is still significantly higher.
So far, the figures only come from Palu.
However, there are also numerous other municipalities affected - along Sulawesis West Coast.
About 150 bikers celebrate service in Werdohl
Motorbike pastor Frank Schröder (right) from Herne celebrated the final divine service for motorcyclists in the Peace Church in Eveking on Sunday with a team of helpers.
Werdohl - The square in front of the Peace Church in Eveking belonged to the motorcyclists on Sunday.
After all, the final divine service was on the program for the bikers.
Frank Schröder is the motor pastor within the Evangelical Church of Westphalia and thus responsible for the mental health concerns of the PS-strong two-wheelers.
Between April and September, the traditional motorcycle divine service (MoGo) takes place at the House of Nordhelle on the last Sunday of a month.
The bikers traditionally celebrate the end of the season in the Peace Church in Eveking.
There about 150 bikers met on Sunday to do anything but ordinary worship.
From 10 a.m. the Bolids had already been set up in front of the church's entrance portal.
First, the biker breakfast was on the program and it was allowed to be strengthened with coffee and cake or even with a rich curry sausage.
In addition to the MoGo team, the Holy Riders, a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach, were also present.
The sermon held during the biker’s religious service, pastor Dirk Grzegorek.
The singer-songwriter Valerie Lill provided for the musical underpainting.
"Although the bikers prefer the blues rock, Valerie Lill rather attacks poetically calm tones", said Fr. Frank Schröder.
This too was certainly a novum in the history of motorcycle God’s service yesterday.
Fuchtorfer Heimatverein celebrates great feast: After the apple comes the milk
And also during the actual action day Borisch was active.
She provided her hungry guests with freshly prepared apple pancakes.
Georg Hartmann-Niemerg also aroused great interest.
He had his apple press in the luggage and demonstrated his staggering spectators step by step the process from the ripe apple to the apple juice.
Then and when Hartmann-Neimerg left the children the field and let them fill the apples in the great funnel.
With a little muscle strength, a finely crushed mass was produced from the apples.
Not many of the children could yet imagine how it would make a tasty drink.
But they could also look at this important step on this late Friday afternoon.
Packed in shapes and enveloped by nets, Georg Hartmann-Neimerg stacked the apple layer for layer over one another a little like heels.
Thanks to some technical support, the last step was no longer so difficult.
The freshly pressed juice gradually ran into a large vessel.
But the farmer had already filled specialties with it.
So he opened his "shadow box" and presented the older visitors with the latest feather whites.
The demand for the good drop "Made in Füchtorf" was thus great.
The parents came into the conversation in a cozy atmosphere, while the children were able to follow not only the apple press process but also the built-up Hüpfburg for themselves.
Active of the former soldiers' fleeter camaraderie were also engaged in the festival and invited to play at some stations for a short time.
The home association will also be offering an action day in the coming year.
However, as Gregor Krutzkamp stressed, the home house in the heart of the Spargeldorf will not be the place of the event.
Instead, a farm will be visited.
This is also due to the subject at hand: Finally, it will go around the milk.
1:4 vs. Frankfurt: Hannover with fourth season course: "Bessisse Situation"
Frankfurt/Main After the fourth Bundesliga defeat, coach André Breitenreiter gathered his disillusioned professionals from Hannover 96 around and told them courage.
A lot of positive things were previously not seen at the 1:4 (0:2) of the last table at Eintracht Frankfurt.
"It's a shitty situation, but you have to get out of there as a team," said Pirmin Schwegler, 96-football pro, and she said: "This is, of course, disappointing, because you always take a lot."
The further winkless Lower Saxony, for which only Florent Muslija (86.) came to the conclusion, are at the bottom with two counters and in their current constitution are a descending candidate.
Frankfurt, on the other hand, won the first season home win led by the outstanding Ante Rebic.
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute, Rebic (45.+1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59.) and Luka Jovic (89.) scored 46.300 goals for the DFB Cup winner, who, after the successful general trial for the Europe League game against Lazio Rome, proposed seven points in the middle of the table.
Croatia's vice-world champion Rebic was almost involved in every dangerous offensive of the Hesse during his start-up debut and never to get under control of Hannover's defense.
The stormer, long after the World Cup, showed with his pace and persuasion why he is so valuable for the effort.
In addition to Rebic, Brazil's Allan, which was borrowed by Liverpool, was the first time in the initial formation of the Frankfurters.
A faked headball of Lucas Torró (17th) on the gate net led to a danger for the first time.
Six minutes later, Sébastien Haller was stopped in a promising position at the last moment by the 96 defense around the Brazilian Felipe, which replaced the short-term failed Kevin Wimmer (backs).
The leadership for the householders fell almost compulsively and completely deserved.
Filip Kostic raised the ball after a rejected corner in the penitentiary, Haller extended by head in front of the gate where Ndicka only needed to hold the foot.
It was the first Bundesligatre for the French second-person AJ Auxerre to come in summer.
And Frankfurt left before the break.
This time, Haller matched his storm partner Rebic, who was able to refuel himself and left no chance for 96 torwart Michael Esser.
In the mid-term, Hannover-Coach Breitenreiter responded to the weak idea of his elf and brought in Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt two new offensive forces.
The Lower Saxony now played a little more courageous forward, but inflamming ideas remained until shortly before the end, when the follow-up hit still succeeded.
The Hessens were much more efficient.
After a short hour Rebic started a solo and then placed across De Guzmán, who only had to push the ball into the empty gate.
The rest was only showtime for the Frankfurters, but Jovic also met one minute before the end.
The Morlaixplatz becomes a party mile

Geisingen: Geisinger Christian Celebrate Holy Cross Festival
The Geisinger Catholics celebrate the Holy Cross Festival on September 14 or Sunday thereafter.
The Feast divine service takes place in the Church of the City, and then a procession to the Holy Cross church with its final seg.
The Church of the Holy Cross houses the shot Christ, who comes from the 30-year-old war and on whom the legend is supposed to have shot after a Swedish soldier.
From the gunshot wound, blood flowed.
From this a great pilgrimage to the shooting Christ developed, which then also led to the construction of the Holy Cross Church.
This is not finished until today, only the altar space stands, the missing long house is indicated by the trees.
In his sermon, pastor Adolf Buhl reminds us that the Cross is a sign of hope, comfort and life.
Despite the significance for the Geisinger parish, the service was poorly visited.
After the divine service, the procession took place at the Holy Cross church and with the final seg. the church part of the Crucifixion ended.
For many years, the Catholic Church choir has been inviting to the Catholic parish hall for the worldly part of the festival.
The choir members provided the visitors with hearty food as well as a large selection of cakes and weather adapted, farm ice.
In the afternoon, the parish church offered guided tours around the town church, Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid-Seger informed visitors about the damage to facade, roof, sandstone works and windows as well as the upcoming construction measures that will continue until the next year.
After the scaffolding had been in place for some time, the damage could be more precisely identified and the individual calls prepared more concretely.
It is certain that the renovation will be more expensive than planned, because the damage already existing a few years ago has become bigger, but more has been found, which has only been possible by the appearance of the inadvertent by means of scaffolding.
The pedestal plastering work is completed, the natural stone works are still to be started before winter and half of this work is expected to be completed this year.
Inauguration: New residence in the Neu-Ulmer Münsterblickstraße
The life aid Donau-Iller opens a new home for people with disabilities in Münsterblickstraße.
The fact that "a very special house" of its provision is now being handed over in the Münsterblickstraße - there were all present at the opening date.
Finally, the twelve wheelchair drivers, who have been living in the residential home of Donau-Iller for some time, have depended on the special architecture of the new building.
Architek Rudolf Bader has taken into account broader courses, corridors and doors, larger spaces and barrier-free accesses for all areas in his concept.
The first plans began about eight years ago, when the former U.S. Army officer building was put on the test stand for the residents with cell phone cap: "The house had come in the years and no longer in the equipment at the time," said Bader in retrospect.
In 2016, the excavators moved to tear off the house.
The new building should be made as friendly and bright as possible so that the inhabitants can feel comfortable in it, says the architect.
Lebenshelp Donau-Iller opens new residence
About 4.6 million euros invested life aid in the new building.
The free state contributed 2.4 million euros to the district of Schwaben 450000 euros.
According to the architect Bader, the construction works have remained in the planned frame - in time and in financial terms.
He was also thanked by the CEO of Life Help, Jürgen Heinz.
The gap between a barrier-free and at the same time fire-proof construction has not always been easy.
Nevertheless, the planners and craftsmen had built a home with the many guidelines that allowed residents to experience the freedom to move even without foreign help.
In a similar way, Gertrud Kreutmayer, the head of the social administration of the Schwaben District, said: "The house is oriented to the special needs of its inhabitants, who need tools to be mobile".
In doing so, the habit and functionality had been well combined, said Kreutmayer.
And further: "The property in this situation is a real accident, because it is no longer to be acquired in today's situation".
In total, the new residence in the Münsterblickstraße offers space for almost 1500 square meters for 30 people with disabilities, which are divided into three groups of dwellings.
Pride is Life Help Managing Director Heinz to the eleven full-time workers, all of whom are employed by tariff.
Germany: Schwesig complains differences between East and West
Berlin - Before the day of the unity, Deputy SPD Federal Chairman Manuela Schwesig appealed to all compatriots not to be disadvantaged by East Germans.
There are differences that hurt after nearly 30 years of unity.
We must not be content with these differences," said the Prime Minister of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, saying the "Dayspiegel on Sunday".
The goal must remain to create the same living conditions throughout the country.
It is unacceptable for East Germans to work longer on average than the people in Western Germany, but 15 percent less paid.
"I can't explain this to anyone almost 30 years after the German unity," said Schwesig.
North Korea: Does this clean dog end the Korea conflict?
The one-year-old Pungsan-Jagdhund should smooth the waves between the two Koreas.
In an effort to relax relations with Seoul, Pjöngjang has presented to South Korean President Moon Jae in two North Korean pungsan dogs.
As Moon's office reported on Sunday, the two dogs about a year old reached their recipients on Thursday.
They therefore passed the border town of Panmunjom together with three kilograms of dog food to "encourage" the animals.
The dogs with the thick white fur, pointed ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent.
They belong to the national cultural heritage of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
The gift of friendship had announced the north at the third summit meeting this year between Moon and North Korean powerkeeper Kim Jong Un in Pjöngjang in mid-September.
Both countries also agreed to join international sports competitions such as the 2020 Olympic Games and apply together for the 2032 Olympic Games.
In the course of the mutual approach, Kim also agreed to close the Tongchang Ri test plant for rocket engines.
Austria's moving history reflected in 99 documents
What is Austria?
In the 100th anniversary of the Republic, which has been celebrated for almost ten months now, numerous new books have been published, mostly in the context of the past hundred years.
In a different way, it presents Wolfgang Maderthaner, historian and director of the Austrian State Archive, in the magnificent "Image Book" of Austria, which will be published on 1 October.
New week, new opportunity for government
Back to the material work - this is the unofficial motto for the Great Coalition working week that is beginning today.
Hardly an interview, hardly a speech in which the chancellors and their ministers from CDU, SPD and also from the CSU last did not object to the "return to material work".
This may have led so many craftsmen, doctors, cashiers and other citizens in this country to the legitimate question, which is actually the difference between work and physical work, but be it.
If the Federal Government is now ready to recommence its mission - to govern - it should not now be stopped with debate on terms.
If Union and SPD can actually do something together after the provocations and bladders of the last few weeks, perhaps already Monday will show.
In the evening, the heads of the government parties meet to the Coalition Committee.
Chancellor Angela Merkel now wants to regularly convene this round to resolve conflicts early; a lesson from all the disputes.
First, however, the diesel retrofits and the specialized immigration law are again on the agenda for conflict-related issues.
CSU Transport Minister Scheuer wants to get rid of the car companies with exchange premiums, SPD and CDU see manufacturers in the obligation to retrofit older diesels.
While there has been a rapprochement in the diesel crisis over the weekend, Union and SPD are still far apart in the planned labour immigration law.
The SPD calls for a lead perspective for rejected asylum seekers who are working or training.
The Union is strictly opposed to the "purchase" of the asylum system in the labour market.
So there will again be disputes among the coalition partners - and how should it be different?
Not equal to and equal with GroKo, but three partners with partly very different company images and priorities.
Dispute is good.
Without dispute, a society drawn by such diverse interests, sometimes contradictory, does not progress.
In order to be constructive, however, disputes must not be raised again for party-tactic reasons on the question of being or not being.
It's still about politics, not theatre.
The Union and SPD should fight - but always have a view of people's viability.
What is feasible and useful to many?
With this key question, both diesel and track change questions can be explained pragmatically - and thus regain confidence.
In particular, the people's parties must now fight.
Mushroom checked working hours at Hartinger
Minister for the Visa
Does the Minister of Labour reject the applicable law of service?
Daniela Holzinger wants to take a closer look at this.
"Real Day and Night" had worked on the social security reform, reported an overly weak Minister of Social Affairs in the presentation of the same two weeks ago.
In the case of Liste Pilz-Mandatarin Daniela Holzinger, the statement of Beate Hartinger-Klein (FPÖ) comes as a surprise - she now brings the matter to Parliament via request.
She assumes, "that the minister only expressed her enthusiasm about the use of her team and in no way wanted to declare violations of applicable rights of service in front of ongoing cameras".
Nevertheless, she now has questions to "quit Har tinger from every suspicion".
Police are taking a road to find women's lilies
Marxgrün - Lange did not want the police to express themselves.
Now there's a confirmation.
Since early Saturday morning, the state road between Naila and Bad Steben has been dug.
The route is closed in the area of Marxgreen until Monday.
Previously, the investigators had previously employed an archaeology dog.
The dog specially trained for the smell of old human bones, along with his guide in multi-use, finally could limit the relevant site to a few meters.
In addition, a ground anomaly has been discovered together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the Upper Bavarian Monument Protection Authority in the area of the said street piece.
For more than a year, prosecutors' office and criminal police court have been processing the crime.
Time and again a cycle path was blocked at Marxgrün and examined with sonar devices, because the investigators suspect that here in the course of the new construction of the Staatsstraße 30 years ago Heike's body could have been hardened.
Color powder and eggs: Krawalle in Barcelona before Catalonia
On Monday, the controversial independence referendum in Catalonia lasts for the first time.
But already before, it comes to scratches.
The separatists did not forget the use of the police in autumn 2017.
Barcelona - Shortly before the Catalan Independent Conference of October 1, 2017, a conflict between separatists and the police occurred in the centre of Barcelona.
Catalan security forces were attacked by independent supporters, including color powder, when they wanted to prevent them from approaching a demonstration of the National Police and Civil Guard.
About 3000 police officers in Poland Nacional and Guardia Civil wanted to honor their colleagues who had been in use in the electoral venues in the last year at the referendum that was classified as illegal.
In an attempt to prevent citizens from voting, violence had also taken place at the time.
The Catalan police had formed a chain to keep the demonstrations of the separatists and the central security forces separate, reported Spanish media.
However, some of the 6000 separatists would have tried violently to break through the police chain, and the officers, among other things, threw paint bags and eggs.
Six persons had been arrested, 24 others had been slightly injured, it was referred to the authorities.
On Monday, for the first time, the independence referendum will be held.
Following the vote and a subsequent decision to separate the wealthy region of Spain, the central government in Madrid Catalonia had been forced to take over in autumn 2017.
The then regional president Carles Puigdemont fled to exile in Belgium.
Other politicians also moved abroad.
However, several ministers of the then regional government and other activists of the separatist movement still sit in U-Haft.
In December, new elections were held in the region.
After the accession of the new Catalan government in May, the forced administration was terminated.
But the new regional president Quim Torra also insists on the "right to self-determination" of the Catalans.
Football: Oberliga Westfalen: Congregated impunity: FC Gütersloh and RW Ahlen separate themselves torlos
Red and white ahls continue to appear.
Even at the FC Gütersloh it only reached a 0:0 decision.
The final light and the third, before 438 spectators in the Heidewald Stadium, they uneducated them as a congregated impunity.
The first half was very manageable by the entertainment factor.
Therefore, anyone who wanted to get a beer or a bratwurst could do so without worry.
There was no danger of missing a  Torchance because there was practically none.
First shot after half an hour
Gütersloh's Nick Flock was responsible for the first (harmless) goal shot of the entire lot during the 28 minute.
As Cihan Yilmaz FCG-Torwart Frederic Westergerling after 32 minutes with a shot from the penitentiary border, the Ahleners had the best - and in principle only real - option.
Even more harmless were the hosts.
Their most effective action was in an early change.
Stürmer Lars Schröder had to be replaced as a result of injury, for him Sinan Aygün came.
After the change, both teams decided to do something against the increasing boredom.
In the 48th minute, Sebastian Mutzel from 18 meters aimed just over the housing and after an hour the Gütersloher appeared offensively for the first time.
After a ball conquest of Matthew Wieckowicz it went fixed.
The fast presented counter via Sinan Aygün "krönte" Nick Flock (62.) with a but laughing shot into the arms of RWA-Torwart Bernd Schipmann.
In addition, they played with a headball of Wieckowicz (66.) after an corner ball of the ex-Ahlener Tim Manstein.
RWA-interimstrainer Angelo Daut responded, initially brought Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy (60.) and a little later Enes Güney for Sebastian Mutzel (70.).
It didn't do anything.
More than optical superiority thanks to their own initiative, the Ahlens did not succeed.
Only in the 91st minute did Cihan Yilmaz have the last chance, but they also brought nothing.
Angelo Daut tried to push out the positive: "I like that we played at zero." But unfortunately the zero also stood in the front.
"This time, we were not as dangerous as we were against Holzwickede and although our opponent didn't want to play with us," said RW Ahlens Interim Trainer.
Offensively, "everything had a bit of a joke" against a team, "that just wanted to defend.
At least I didn't have the feeling that we could get an anti-terrorist," said Daut.
However, as a spectator, one did not feel as if his team could shoot a goal.
The idea was too poor for this.
Reckenfelden Crop thanks market: Luckily, there are enough Kreimers
That's what Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler are pleased about from the Reckenfeld table edition site for which these donations are intended.
Insure the voluntarys: "These donations also remain in Reckenfeld".
At the opening, the sky was bright blue, but the place was still empty, but this should change during the day.
Because: "Here it is so nice, that's why we're here today," said a visitor.
Organizer of the festival Franz Josef Holthaus welcomed guests in the Kiepenkerl outfit as always with a proper price humour.
For Brockmann, who was supposed to be balanced against food, Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer jump in the short term.
The Verena (daughter of Ferdi Kreimer) has become ill.
But there are enough Kreimers.
And the "replacement" didn't allow itself to entertain the more and more visitors in between musically.
This was so good that some folk songs were sung at a later hour.
"Simply great", Marcel Kreimer rejoiced.
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to accommodate the opening date this time in his schedule.
He is happy about the many assets with their stands, among them mostly clubs.
"There should not be something like a table at all," he thanked for the action of the male choir.
Andreas Hajek praised the use of all those who were in use at the booths and also included the other festivals and the "clean up" action that took place in September.
Our garden town gives itself a colorful painting - here's something going.
Then the Maikranz was taken off by Georg Knorr and Gerd Klück with the help of the fire brigade and brought to the winter quarter.
Many stands were worked for the physical well-being.
From sweet to hearty everything was to have.
Stefan Hagemeyer, who has only lived in Reckenfeld for a year, became creative at his decoupier's saw.
Furnace work, beer lid with reel fields motifs and a lot more he had on offer.
A speciality offered three corners of beekeeper: "Reckenfelder Honig", brought by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian Wettershoven and Helen Roth-Buschschlüter.
The latter has a speciality in it.
Honey cake in the glass, of course with honey from my own production.
The little Elsa had to access again and again, so well tasted the cake.
The gathering is what the visitors then allowed to stay long until the evening hours, even without the stage program that is not available at the Autumn Festival.
Lubrication with Local Political Message: No Successful Advertising for Skate Plant
In Lengerich, unknowns have no way of promoting the construction of a skate plant.
In several places there are similar lubrications, says Jürgen Kohne of the city administration on request of the WN.
In at least one case, the police have had a criminal record for property damage.
In large letters the three words "Skatepark für Lengerich" were spoken on signs, including at the Gempt Hall and the Alte Rathaus.
Michael Rottmann, manager of the Halle, reports that a corresponding letter on the advertising sign was already discovered after the professional election fair on 19 September at the stairway to the Gempt-Bistro.
Since the short message at that time had apparently been left "only" with an edding, it could have been easily removed.
"A few days later, however, this was back, this time it was sprayed up," said Rottmann.
He assumes that the appropriate advertising sign must be replaced.
A special note is given in this case by the fact that on the table several large companies from Lengerich are also called.
If the skate system is built, its realization is also to be made possible by sponsors.
There have already been commitments, explains Jörg Hesselmann from the municipal department of school, sport and culture, without mentioning any name.
However, it is possible that one or more of the sponsors are identical to those companies standing on the flat table.
For years local policy and administration have been dealing with the issue of skate plant.
After the old one had been dismantled at the LWL clinic, after some time the search for an alternative location began.
Finally, the Council expressed its support for the fire park.
However, this idea was not implemented - too many factors apparently spoke against a construction at this point.
At the end of June, a turnaround followed.
The members of the main and financial committee now voted unanimously for the area of the Gutenberg School.
Jürgen Kohne says on the state of affairs that the administration is currently in the middle of concrete planning.
The city council then had the last word.
It is based on a decision this year, so that it could be built in a positive vote in 2019.
Air traffic security bottlenecks are getting worse
Frankfurt/Hamburg After the European air traffic check in summer, the German air traffic controllers see no signs of improvement in the coming year.
"This year we had wind, in 2019 we will have strong wind and then the storm will come," said Matthias Maas, Chief of the Air Safety Union, the German Press Agency in front of the aviation summit in Hamburg on 5 October.
An important reason for the many delays and falls in flight was the long-known staff shortage in European air navigation services, for which there was no quick solution.
"The airlines and airports can achieve rapid improvements for the coming year, but the training of new lotts takes four to five years," said the trade unionist.
The market for finished lotts has been cleared across Europe.
In the centre of Karlsruhe alone to monitor the upper German airspace, about one hundred people were missing.
Maas again criticised that several aviation trade unions were not invited to the summit.
In Hansestadt, representatives of the federal government, countries, air traffic control, airlines and airports meet on Friday to address the causes of delays.
"If you want to talk about additional work compression and overtime, it won't go without us," explained the head of the GdF, who has many members in German air traffic control.
Maas once again made recommendations of the European Commission for the Lotsen-Miseres responsible.
Transport forecasts for the current regulatory period until 2019 were far too low.
The resulting costs and personnel savings of the national air navigation services now fully depend on the operational business.
Maas appealed to Federal Minister for Transport Andreas Scheuer (CSU) to work in Brussels for regulations that "cannot further separate air from air navigation."
At present, the EU's targets would be agreed by 2024 and further strengthening would be to be feared.
The EU has been subject to constant lobbying by airlines.
"Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary and his colleagues are now reaping exactly what they have sown in the past years," Maas said.
He hoped that the high delay costs of airlines would lead to rethinking.
The GdF will only contribute to the improvement of the situation if Deutsche Flugsicherung (DFS) offers a "voicing training and future pact", said Maas.
The up-to-date admission of 120 lotts per year over the next five years is just enough to compensate for the age-related declines.
The necessary staffing is not yet connected.
Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board agrees for corporate conversion
The members of the Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board voted unanimously for the plans for the conversion of the Group.
Following the will of Thyssenkrupp Interim Chief Guido Kerkhoff, who was appointed Chairman of the Executive Board at the Sunday meeting, the criticizing group is to be split into two independent companies.
Both companies are supposed to have their seat in food and be listed on the stock exchange.
There should be no additional reduction in staff beyond the already known cuts in administration.
After two withdrawals, the control body on the capital side counts only eight heads.
Ten representatives of the employees are opposed to this.
However, the final decision is expected to be made by an annual general meeting in 2020.
The new Thyssenkrupp Materials AG is to include, among other things, the 50 % share of the merged steel business with the Indian partner Tata.
In the second company Thyssenkrupp Industrials AG, the business will be bundled with elevators and supplies.
Barcelona: Violence in demos by police and Catalan independent advocates.
In two simultaneous demonstrations by Spanish police and Catalan independent supporters in Barcelona, there have been violent conflicts with numerous victims.
According to the city administration, about 3,000 police from all over Spain gathered on Saturday, as well as some 6000 independent advocates.
The Catalan police tried with a big command to keep the two protests away from each other.
However, according to information from the forces, independence advocates repeatedly attempted to break down the security barrier.
They would have attacked the officers with color and throw shots.
According to the report, they were also available between the participants in the various protests.
According to rescue forces, 24 people were injured.
The police told me there were six arrests.
Better pay and recognition of colleagues
With their demonstration, the police wanted to honor the colleagues who had been opposed to the Catalonia independence referendum banned by the Spanish Central Government almost a year ago.
At the same time, they demanded better salaries.
The members of the Spanish police and the Guardia Civil considered it unfair that Catalan and Basque police officers deserve far more than they do.
The demonstrators felt that the Spanish police were demonstrating in Barcelona.
"Why did they come here to protest?" asked the 55-year-old Catalan demonstrator Manel Perez of the AFP news agency.
Just to provocate and celebrate the fact that they have drowned us a year ago.
A 31-year-old police officer from the Balearic Islands, who only wanted to give his name with Daniel, rejected the accusation.
"Of course, we want to support our comrades who did only their duty last year: defend the law," he said.
But the demonstration is there to enforce our rights and we are doing it in Barcelona because this is a great European city and there is more echo here.
However, he and his colleagues had "not come to provoke," the police assured.
Panne permitted access to personal data of British Minister
A vulnerability to a mobile phone app has led to the temporary access to everyone by ministers and delegates of the conservative British Tory Party on Saturday.
According to British media reports, several ministers received calls from unknown people after the Panne became known one day before the Tory Party in Birmingham.

Football: Juve trainer praises top part: Ronaldos best game
The Portuguese star stormer "played the best game together with the half hour of Valencia on this evening," praised Juve-Coach Massimiliano Allegri after the 3-1 (1:1) victory of the record champion against the SSC Naples.
For the coach the expensive bought star was also without his own goal the decisive man in the important game against the persecutor.
"Ronaldo had a lot of fun and did it well," said Allegri.
Even though we started with tactical mistakes, Ronaldo was very good at our first gate - and from the moment we grew.
Thanks to Ronaldo's three goal templates, Juve turned the game after the early residue due to the hits of Dries Mertens (10th minute) and hung the worst chaser for the first time.
The Torjager, who was picked by Real Madrid, initially submitted to the former Bundesliga pro Mario Mandzukic, who provided a double pack (26./49.) for the leadership.
And Ronaldo also made the preliminary work on the hit by captain Leonardo Bonucci (76.), who only had to move shortly before the goal line.
"He gives a lot of templates," the coach praised.
But of course Allegri also wants to see goals of the attacker, who is both in the Champions League and in the Portuguese national team of the record tournaments.
"We need to get even better in serving him," the coach demanded.
Best Juve tourr is currently mandzukic with four hits - Ronaldo has three on the account.
With the purchase of Ronaldo for more than 100 million euros, the overpower of Juventus seems to become even more oppressive.
Seven wins in seven games is the flawless series in series A. At 21 points, the master of the past seven years already has six counters lead on Naples.
The table width trained by the former Bayer-Coach Carlo Ancelotti was not chanceless against Turin.
But at the latest after the place reference of the already warned Mario Rui (58.) the top party was decided.
The Portuguese had to get to Paulo Dybala with yellow red from the square after getting on too hard.
"We played well against a good Naples," commented the Turin Coach.
It was addressed that Emre Can felt as well.
The German national player has won over at Juve.
The professional who came from Liverpool FC was in use at all seven league parties.
The midfielder also played in the Champions League against Valencia, which allegri meant with the "half hour": Ronaldo had flown off the square at the 2nd0 victory of the Turiners and was blocked for the home match on Tuesday against Young Boys Bern.
Kanye West changes its name
Rapper Kanye West took care of the US TV show "Saturday Night Live" on the weekend with a particularly curious appearance.
Among other things, his joint performance with Lil Pump in a mineral water costume provided foreheads and question marks for the viewers.
In addition, the 41-year-old announced a change of name in time for the release of his new album.
From now on, let him be called "Ye," says the musician.
"The being that was formerly known as Kanye West," he thundered in response to the late singer Prince, when he gave his artist name.
The pseudonym, however, is not a newsman.
The tenth album was released under this name.
In an interview with the KRRL radio station, the artist had explained that "Ye" had a religious meaning for him.
"I believe "Ye" is the most widely used word in the Bible and there it means "you", says the rapper.
Football: Kreisliga A1 Münster: Finally!
It's done!
Hoetmar's coach Averhage did not make any hail out of his disappointment.
That was a weak game from us today.
The opponent was simply more gripped, we have put him as well as never before problems." According to thinly read the list of Hoetmarer shooting possibilities.
Grade two goal dances in 90 minutes, so games can rarely be made positive.
Football-Kreisliga A1: SC Hoetmar is subject to SG Sendenhorst with 0:2 (0:1) Photo: Heinz Schwackenberg
The SG also had only two options in the first pass, but the first used Maik Krause from an angle to an early tour (7.).
In the 43th minute, Steffen could have raised uphus, but after a great preliminary work by Krause, he concluded to be free-standing.
The hosts had only a double chance when Moritz Höne failed Torsteher Jos Schuhmacher at first, and in return Jan Blome also found his master in the Sendenhorster Keeper.
After the break the guests became more dominant and had a number of good opportunities.
But Uphus (49.), Julian Turl (61,) and Heinz Linnemann (69.) all forgive.
A trader - Louis Kortenjan had saved by hand on the gate line and saw red for it - Niklas Eilmann also could not use for the guests (75.).
It was only when Nils Berheide played the ball over the line that the game was decided (81.).
"We had previously criticized ourselves harshly, which was different today from in the last few weeks," said Florian Kraus's conclusion.
Sendenhorst: J. Schomacher - Linnemann, Scholz, Eilmann, Mey, Krause, Krause (77. Berheide), L. Hartleif, Uphus, Abu Dalal (90th Body), Turl.
Tore: 0:1 Krause (7.), 0:2 Berheide (81.).

Football: Kreisliga A2 Münster: Spektakelfußball in Albachten: GW Albersloh is subject to Concordia with 3:4
"I don't know what to think about it," he said.
"We don't have access to them at all." With this he thought probably the wing pliers with Colby McGill and Janis Kroger, probably but also all the other green-whites that came up with a collective offensive.
He could still laugh: "A dirty victory," he said, twinkling freak and drawn from then his players, on the other hand, was the relief to note that they had pulled out of the affair with three points.
Well noted, after a duel of two teams, one of which, namely Albachten, plays for the championship and the other, Albersloh, fights for class preservation.
With understandably mixed feelings, GWA trainer Sven Lewandowski looked back on the 90 minutes behind him.
"This was by far our best seasonal performance," he says.
"As we come back after the 0:2, as we keep against one of the top teams of the league over the whole season, that was really phenomenal."
The more bitter it is that you have to drive home with empty hands.
Top tourer Lars Zymner led the host with his 12th season hit (24th).
He needed exactly two ball contacts in this game for this goal.
The 2:0 he placed on the left side in pattern for Fabian Fröhning (39.).
We knew that, but you can't take such a player out completely.
"That was crazy, what he did," Lewandowski seamlessly recognized the opponent's quality.
Shortly before the turn of the sides, his own elf was able to compensate: McGill's free movement from the left sailed between Hövelmann and Concordia-Torhüter Hinkerohe through the long tork (45.).
After the side change it was again McGill who achieved the compensation (59.).
After that, it went back and forth.
It was a crunchy, action-packed game.
Nübel shocked Albachten again (64.), only five minutes later Patrick Horstmann looked like him (69.).
Despite the overnumber, Albersloh could no longer counter the last Concordia hit (80.) again.
We now have to focus our full attention on Wednesday.
"The game against schapdetten, that's what we need to win now," said Lewandowski.
Albersloh: Spangenberg - Hecker, Strohbücker, Adolf, Zur Mühlen - Kröger (87. Diallo), P. Horstmann, Thale, McGill - Hövelmann, Bonse (87. Bareksai).
Tore: 1:0 Zymner (24.), 2:0 Fröhning (39.), 2:1 McGill (45.), 2:2 McGill (59.), 3:2 Nübel (64.), 3:3 P. Horstmann (69.), 4:3 Jülkenbeck (80.).
Yellow red: Atalan (74./Albachten).
Football: TSV Straßberg battles point against Primus
There was no winner in the Landesliga-Doull between the TSV Straßberg and the FV Biberach.

Media: dynamo Dresden’s entire Bureau resigned
According to the media reports, the entire Bureau of Football-Zweitligist Dynamo Dresden has resigned.
In the evening several media agreed on a joint letter from the Board of Saxony.
A confirmation of the association was not available at first.
The reason for the withdrawal is to be internal power struggles with the former Bundesligist.
Erdogan in Germany: Politics instead of Pomp
Good thing he's gone again.
There are few public guests whose departure in Germany makes for as much relief as that of Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Three days the Turkish President in Berlin and Cologne was a guest, and many had meant that he should not have been invited at all.
Evangelische Akademie Tutzing: Celebrities Guests and new offers
The Evangelische Akademie Tutzing offers about 80 meetings until the middle of next year.
France's President Emmanuel Macron has now signaled that he would like to pick up the tolerance price personally in Tutzing.
For Christian Wulff, the term of office was too short: as president, he was not at Tutzings Evangelischer Akademie.
But before and after, Wulff was a guest there.
Thus, Akademie Director Udo Hahn charged him when he proudly said, "All the Federal Presidents and Chancellors were already with us". That at the Akademie im Tutzing in the castle of Tutzing repeatedly appeared prominently, but was also a topic in the presentation of the annual program.
At the end of October, songwriter Konstantin Wecker takes part in a conference on spiritual experience in philosophical perspective.On September 29, the writer Frido Mann is at a conference on his grandfather Thomas Mann.
Meanwhile, France's President Emmanuel Macron has also committed himself to accepting the "Tolerance Prize" awarded by the Academy personally in Tutzing, which also receives television presenter Dunja Hayali in another category (we reported).
The around 80 meetings will take place by mid- 2019.
"The pension is not safe!" says a conference title.
"SOS at Europe's borders" - this is how the Academy describes the "risk and deadly route over the Mediterranean".
"And to a meeting on Syria: "Barbarian without limit."
Deals of arms, destruction, torture, death - the war detests any humane idea."
From structural racism in society to the gap between the poor and the rich to the radical change in work through digitization, the spectrum is sufficient.
Akademie Director Hahn convinced himself: "Free democracy needs places where a civil society can come together to look for solutions or at least partial solutions."
At a meeting of 200.
In the near future, Karl Marx's birthday awaits a more visitor from the direction of capitalism-criticism, the others rather a tendency "from left to centre".
What about neutrality?
"We are 100 percent a daughter of the Evangelical State Church," said study director Dr. Ulrike Haerdel, "so we are not 100% neutral."
Music Cabaret: Gender Understanding with Heart - Wolbeck - Westfälische Nachrichten
" both adults and men" was the musical cabaret with Tina Teubner on Friday evening in the hall of the Christ church in Wolbeck.
As a cabaret test, Teubner anticipated gender understanding, not only with humor and heart heat for the (feeled) woman and (feeled) man and what else there may be, but also with music.
The mini guitar used it and also mastered their violins.
Ben Süverkrüp sat on the wing.
He is on the one hand the male sparring partner, who sometimes comes to words until the end of the sentence, on the other hand a true pianist: So congenially harmoniously accompanied Süverkrüp Teubner that some may have wanted a solo.
There was also that, with Beethoven and Chopin, but different, namely, as it fit the Red thread of the evening.
There Teubner had put a paradox into play: the satisfaction with the man, if he had a partner, but he didn't open the door.
A closed door without a partner, on the other hand, does not benefit.
The piano solo is now demonstrating the same: what would have been the result of Mozart's composition would "the Nanner" have opened the door unexpectedly?
Thus, Süverkrüp slides across improvisations, from Bach's "O head full of blood and wounds" to the "Lied of death", and Mozart g-moll symphony into a playful dance.
There was great applause and "Bravo" from the full hall.
Karlheinz sent flowers to Kleintje, treasurer of the club, the Chansonette.
But the chairman Heidemarie Markenbeck did not accept an additional thanks.
She had the idea to give the duo in addition to appearances in Stuttgart and Frankfurt also one in Wolbeck.

Handball: Women's Landesliga: Ahlener SG keeps the white vest against TV Wattsscheid
The Ahlenians had problems with Carolin Stallmann, a third-liga player, who only marked ten hits.
"In fact, I was well satisfied with the defense, only one player has made too many goals.
We didn't get hold of them," says ASG-Coach Dogan Aydogdu.
But the anger was more about the many opportunities left out.
The final concentration made his team miss this time.
As a result, the ASG almost ran after a residue until the end, was at 11:12 and later at 15:18 (45.) behind.
It was only towards the end that the wider bank of the host women made themselves decisively noticeable.
In addition, Aydogdu rear space Merle Klement placed on left-wing exteriors, which then made "extrem clever the decisive gates" (Aydogdu).
ASG: Buschkotter, Bolte - Bruland (2), Pumpe, Exner, Klement (5), Colbatzky (5/3), Drewes (1), Schlautmann (1), Deventer (6), Baer (1), C. Fitzek, Ruschhaupt (4), S. Fitzek.
Volleyball: 3rd League Women: Top performance of the BSV Ostbever in the top game at the VC Allbau Essen
Thanks to a top performance in the top game, the BSV Ostbevern’s volleyball players have once again established themselves in the top group of the 3rd League West.
At the second-liga downgrader VC Allbau Essen the blue-whites won at 3:1.
"That was a big step for a cool season.
It makes Lenz to play in the upper third of the league.
We have now developed this," said coach Dominik Münch after an almost impotent performance of his team at the fallen table leader.
The first passage dominated the guests almost as desired.
At 4:1, 16:10 and 22:12 he went to the vice-master of the previous year with 25:15.
Food has been accepted in the two-part lock, but has not come into play.
We got her busy.
Our opponent has raised high risk, but also produced several tickets.
In the second sentence, the BSV already led at 12:8. "Eats changed the assumption to three-parts.
We couldn't hold the impact pressure.
Food has grown, and we have a little let ourselves in," continues Münch.
At 18:17, the men of volleyball from the Ruhr area had their noses in front.
In the course of 19:24, the Ostbevern rejected four more movement balls, but the fifth attempt was made to achieve its goal.
"The game was now a class better," the exercise manager was at the rising level.
Maike Rüdingloh and finally Wiebke Silge, with their additions, contributed significantly to the fact that the BSV turned the sheet in the third section of 14:16 to 25:21.
Münch: "There we played consistently and quietly".
Over 7:3 and 15:13 the Blau-Weißen passed through four with 25:22 on their side.
Vera Horstmann was elected the most valuable player, but Maren Flachmeier also caught an excellent day.
BSV Women: Eggenhaus, Rüdingloh, Lea and Anna Dreckmann, Auen, Flachmeier, Mersch Schneider, Silke, Horstmann, Roer.
International: Turkish municipality: mosque opening as a missed opportunity
The Turkish community in Germany (TGD) has criticized the way in which the great Dihib mosque was inaugurated in Cologne by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
"In the German-Turkish relationship, the mosque opening in Cologne left behind a shabby pile, which can only be easily joined together," said the chairman of the TGD, Gökay Sofuoglu, the editorial network Germany.
Both Turkish and German sides would have missed the chance of a common, reconciled appearance.
"To underline the belonging of Muslims to Germany, Erdogan has used the date for his purposes with German top politicians," lamented Sofuoglu.
The widespread exclusion of the German public has "strengthened many reservations".
Home Club Nottuln: Offer has already established itself
After the long summer break, folk-treff time is finally back.
On October 18th (Thursday) at 7.30 p.m., the Heimatverein Nottuln already organizes his fifth Nottulner Folktreff in the fireplace of the Old Office.
Almost on the day it's just a year ago that for the first time we performed a folk trick.
In the meantime, this event has become an integral part of the musical event calendar in Nottuln," says Hanns Moormann, Chairman of the Nottulner Home Association.
I wouldn't have thought that our folk staff would be so quick in Nottuln.
No matter if Stormtief Friederike in January or heat wave in July, the fireplace room of the officials was always fully occupied.
"The program at the next Folktreff is like always a colorful mix of German folk songs, hiking and seamen songs, folk songs, evergreens and old hits," says Karl-Heinz Stevermüler, who always invites friends to Nottuln.
For the first Folktreff-"Birthday", Klaus Spellmeyer agreed with his accordion.
He was a member of "Gaitling" for many years, a group from the neighbouring circle Steinfurt, which played music with platt-German lyrics.
Now he's on his way with an Irish folk band.
The makers of the Folktreff are happy to remember the last event in summer when Christoph Schulz of the Folktreff Emsdettet, with his international version of the song "Frosche in the Night", excited the listeners and sent them home with an earworm.
"We expect many happy guests to spend a social and humorous evening again," it says in the invitation of the home association.
Anyone who plays an instrument and wants to be active is invited to participate.
Since the sought-after seats are fast and fast, it is recommended to be quick enough there.
The Folktreff starts at 7.30 p.m., but inlet is already at 7 p.m.
China approves planned merger of Linde and Praxair

From pure fruit to ecology
The 125th anniversary of the Kreisverband für Gartenbau und Landespflege was celebrated with a gala in the Dr.-Stammberger Halle.
On September 29, 1893, the last founding impulse for the Kreisverband für Gartenbau und Landespflege Kulmbach was set with a fruit show in Kulmbacher Vereinshaus, and exactly 125 years later he celebrated a great anniversary in the Kulmbach Stadthalle on Saturday evening.
In 1893, he was raised from baptism by Mayor Wilhelm Flessa, who was the "Bzirksobstbauverein Kulmbach Stadt und Land".
The purpose of the fruit-growing association was also different from that of today's work - it was actually about fruit-growing, flowers and horticulture nobody thought about at that time.
"At that time, in the epoch of Enlightenment, the fruit tree was a favorite child of the elites," explained Kreisheimatpfleger Günter Dippold in his lecture.
Fruit trees should line long distances, so-called industrial gardens were established in schools.
The fruit cultivation is still the task of the 55 horticultural associations in the district of Kulmbach, which comprise almost 7000 members.
But by far the spectrum is not exhausted.
A natural gardening, biological plant protection, village beauty and nutrition play an equally important role as the provision of knowledge, a healthy diet and youth work.
The many tasks of a horticultural association were shown on stage by the members of the Hutschdorf youth group "Maulwräcken".
"Youth work is especially necessary in the digital age," said the district chairman Günter Reif, and OB Henry Schramm also stressed the importance of nature's experiences for life.
The chestnut collection was a big thing for us children, I doubt you can collect similar joy with smartphone & co..
Schramm promised to plant two trees together with Landrat Klaus Peter Söllner for the anniversary.
"Where to stand, the Kreisverband decides," added Landrat Söllner and stressed the special importance of the horticultural associations for the villages.
The Kreisverband stands for ecology, beauty of the garden and green areas in the village.
The fact that this is a real concern of the many horticultural associations in the district, also left the county manager and expert advisor Friedhelm Haun in no doubt.
He led the many visitors with a picture presentation through the long history of the Kreisverband and reported, among other things, the need for self-sufficiency after the war.
In the past everything came out of the garden, for the winter it was put in.
At the end of the 1950s, however, the farm garden had turned into a garden of decoration and residence.
"Nature has stocks, it has been there before us and we have to orientate on it," pleaded the specialist for fruit and nut trees.
Therefore, there is the incentive for the horticultural associations not to abandon, so that our home remains beautiful and lifeworthy.
This also includes welcoming the new citizens in our associations, added Wolfram Vaitl, President of the Bavarian Federation.
"We have to stop the blatant decline of insects, we owe this to our children and grandchildren," Günter Reif concluded the successful celebration, which was solemnly framed by the towerwinds of the music club Thurnau.

Priority to Nafta talks: Canada's Foreign Minister moves UN-Red
Mexico's government wants clarity in the matter of Nafta: They are putting both trading partners an ultimatum for an agreement.
Canada's Foreign Minister now gives absolute priority to the trade agreement - and shifts her speech to the United Nations.
Because of the time pressure to re-open the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with the USA and Mexico, Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland has postponed her speech at the UN General debate in New York.
Instead of speaking on Saturday, the Minister will not speak until Monday before the United Nations General Assembly, she told spokesperson Adam Austen.
In the meantime, they focus on the renegotiation of Nafta.
Mexican Minister of Economic Affairs Ildefonso Guajardo had declared on Friday that the negotiators of Canada and the United States had 48 hours to agree if Canada would actually want to join the trade agreement between its country and the United States.
The US and Mexico had agreed in August to recast the Nafta Regional Free Trade Agreement.
President Donald Trump indicated that Canada could be excluded from Nafta in the future.
Talks about a new edition have been going on for over a year.
They are expected to be concluded by Sunday evening (local time), Trump's government intends to present the agreement to the US Senate before 1 October.
In the event of the negotiation failure, Mexico's designated President Andres Manuel López Obrador announced on Friday to seek a bilateral agreement with Canada.

Protests against presidential candidates Bolsonaro
The Brazilian presidential candidate, Jair Bolsonaro, who was injured in an attack on trade fairs, left the hospital.
The far-right ex-military wanted to fly to Río de Janeiro, where he lives, after a report from the daily newspaper "O Globo".
After his release, it is still unclear whether the 63-year-old will perform public appearances last week before the presidential elections in the South American country.
The politician had been attacked on the open road at the beginning of September during an election campaign in Southern Brazil.
Meanwhile, thousands of people went to the streets in several Brazilian cities to demonstrate against Bolsonaro.
Under the title "Ele não" (in German: "The Not") women's associations had called for protests against the ex-military.
In the social networks, the associations also made racist and misrepresentative statements mobile against Bolsonaro.
In São Paulo, several thousand demonstrators were expected.
In the capital Brasilia the protests were mixed with a rally of the presidential candidates of the Brazilian Workers' Party (PT), Fernando Haddad.
He replaced ex-President Inácio Lula da Silva, who had been sentenced to twelve years in prison for corruption and must therefore not be candidates.
The presidential election in Brazil is on October 7.
As an ex-citizen of the million-city of São Paulo, Haddad has been well behind Bolsonaro in polls so far.
The "Trump Brazils" has long been involved in political operations, but has recently presented itself as an anti-system candidate.
If none of the candidates reach the absolute majority in the first round of elections, there will be a vote on 28 October.
Observers assume that Bolsonaro will not succeed - no matter who he is against.
Bolsonaro is known for hating homosexuals and blacks and glorifying the military dictatorship (1964-1985).
Again and again he shocks with verbal derailments.

After a long illness: Danish Rock legend died
The Danish rock icon Kim Larsen is dead.
The singer died on Sunday at the age of 72 after a long illness, his producer Jörn Jössen informed Larsen's website.
On the deathbed Larsen was surrounded by his wife and his six children.
The musician had been in treatment since the beginning of the year because of prostate cancer.
Larsen had become known with the band Gasolin', which in the 1970s was enormously successful in Scandinavia.
Her songs were influenced by international music sizes such as Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan and the Beatles.
Larsen was a solo artist after the 1978 release of the band.
He sold about three million records in Denmark.
His 1983 album "Midt om wetten" is still the best-selling album in Denmark.
The Danish Prime Minister Lars Lökke Rasmussen praised Larsen on Sunday in a statement as "road boys", who "was contrary to everything but in all hearts".
The chief of government also recalled that the monarchy enemy Larsen had occurred on the 70th birthday of the Danish queen Margrethe II.
Rock Night at the shoe factory: Volume at press air hammer level
"Here we stand, take the bone saw and light a concert evening with the power of a tiger."The band names of "Lord We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" suggest such a description of the rocky live music experience on Saturday evening in the hall of the Bürgerzenzenzentrum Schuhfabrik: pure hard rock from three with another friend band.
After the sound check and shortly before the concert start, the musicians even take time for a group photo.
There's no trace of lamp fever.
After that, the rock protagonists from Ahlen and the surrounding area – all in association with the booking agency "Mosquito" from Oelde – are excited with their bands loudly the approximately 120 visitors of the "Mint Mosquito" rock night.
Already the quartet "Tiger Bonesaw" with frontman and guitarist Dennis Hadrika knows how to convince with the latest, unknown songs from his own feather and the upcoming CD.
In front of the stage, the band dances to the voice and pressure of the band.
Although "admission" not to be overlooked, "Tiger Bonesaw" then leaves the stage to the trio "Lord We Stand".
That hard rock is not as hard rock as well, guitarist Sascha Bregenhorn, Golo Meierhenrich on bass and drummer Kai Hölscher with her alternative, sometimes classical rock of the 1970s reminiscent sounds.
After the "High Energy Rock" of the "Tigers", "Lord We Stand" is also used for guitar rock as a synthesizer.
Not only the longing, ballading "Take Me Home" impresses with the switch of melodic passages to the guitar-laden rock riffs of the multilayered songs.
The quartet "The Ignition" from Tönnishäuschen, however, has been a special acquaintance since its foundation in 2005.
Full of agility, the band presents their hard rock on Saturday.
That "The Ignition" with its appearances has a very large audience - recently documented in a film by Max Meis on the Tournee in China from 2017 - has special stage experience, is obvious and unmistakable.
In collaboration with the band, singer and guitarist Tim Jungmann also puts his own accents on the only covered song of the evening, "Word Up" by Cameo.
For the feeling even more controlled sound than before, Guitarist Norbert Brinkmann delivers a joyful solo while he runs through the audience.
A certain volume is the result of such a hard rock concert: the "Mint Mosquito" Rock Night, according to information from the Mischpult team, lies at the three-concert of "Lord We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" at about 98 decibels.
This is, for example, at press air hammer level, but is still clearly under the controls of the "wacken-fesitval", to point to the "The Ignition" on their website.
The Ahlen audience, however, does not need ear-dumbling 120 decibels in nozzle drive thickness as usual with the annual metal-pubine in the north of the Republic during this rock night.
After almost four hours, the three bands of the harder, rocky gangart have long convinced with their sovereign, virtuoso game and their own compositions.
"Here we stand, take the bone saw and lighted a concert evening with the power of a tiger," all three groups, of course in the transferred sense, can say in the end.
And especially enjoy the great applause of the visitors.

A dead person at Essen/Mülheim airport in the case of a sailplane accident
There has been a fatal accident at Mülheim/Essen Airport.
A sailing aircraft crashed on Sunday at a parking lot at Mülheim/Essen Airport.
The pilot died in the accident.
Near Mülheim/Essen Airport, a fatal accident occurred on Sunday.
As reported in the West German General Newspaper, a sailing aircraft was crashed at the trade fairground at the airport.
The pilot was killed.
As the "WAZ" continues, the flight student had been on board alone - the plane should be a resident.
The plane had already arrived in the landing flight at the time of the accident.
The crash site is located just a short distance from a holiday tent on the airport site.
But since this weekend an October festival has taken place.
Mülheim/Essen Airport is located at the city border of the two Ruhr districts and right on the road to the 52 motorway.
From the parking lot there is a Park&Ride offer at major events at the Essen fair or the Gruga Hall in Essen.
Trump tells Kim: "And then we fell in love."
It is no secret that US President North Korea's powerholder Kim is well-fed despite nuclear crisis.
Now, however, Trump has made his colleague a true declaration of love.
It also has to do with Kim's "beautiful letters".
At the tender age of 72, the married US president has become known as a new flame.
The tragic: It's a long-distance relationship.
Donald Trump made an unusual declaration of love to North Korean powerman Kim Jong Un all over the public on Saturday.
Trump found almost tender words in front of supporters in the U.S. state of West Virginia for half the old sprinkling of Pjöngjang's ruler dynasty, although he proved to be quite tough in the ringing around North Korea's atomic disarmament.
"I was tough, he was also, and between us it went back and forth," said Trump.
And then we fell in love.
Okay?
No, really.
And not only the conversations with Kim would have melted his heart.
He wrote me wonderful letters, they were great letters.
Her personal connection also bore political fruit: Trump referred to Kim’s termination of all nuclear and missile tests, even though critics in the course of that period still see little more than lip knowledge.
The fact that the affection for the infamous "Rocket Man" - as Trump's nickname for Kim - should not be remembered by anyone, seemed to be aware of the US president.
In any event, he took the likely criticism at his appearance in a large sports hall in Wheeling City immediately ahead: "Donald Trump says they fell in love."
How terrible, how terrible is that?
It's so impresidial.
However, he did not care much about it, Trump explained and then directed his index finger to the crowd: "I always told you, it's so simple to be presidial."
But then there wouldn't be 10,000 people out there in this crowded arena, but we only had 200 people standing outside.
Octoberfest attracts many guests to Baesweiler
Baesweiler's best visit, enthusiastically and on top he spoils himself with sun: Very varied and with a good shot Oktoberfestflair has washed out Baesweiler's city centre on Sunday.
For the first time, the Oktoberfest did not just take place in the holiday tent on the fire tower, but was extended to the city from the trade association on Sunday.
Refugees rescued thanks to video from Libya Prison
Nigerian refugees have pointed out their disastrous detention conditions in Libya with the help of a mobile video, thus enabling their rescue.
The group had shot and spread the recording in its cell in the coastal town of Sawya in July.
"They refuse to send us back," said a man in the video message.
We're suffering here. We're dying here.
The recording was sent to the website "France 24 Observers", whose editors alerted the International Organization for Migration (IOM).
The refugees were finally flown to Nigeria at the end of August.
"Without the video we probably couldn't have returned to Nigeria," said Efe Onyeka, who had recorded the video, the news agency AFP.
The 25-year-old was arrested in Libya in an attempt to get across the Mediterranean to Europe.
The video put him in danger of life, as he said.
One of his associates was nearly killed by the guards, said Onyeka.
In general, the detention conditions were disastrous: "They beat us all with pipes and sticks."
They didn't give us anything to eat, we had to drink from the latrine.
The IOM organizes the voluntary return of refugees stranded in Libya.
About 2,700 Nigerian migrants had been sent back to their homeland this year with the help of the program, said IOM speaker in West African country, Jorge Galindo.
The case of Nigerians now saved is not exceptional in view of the poor detention conditions in Libya.
But he hasn't heard from a phone phone call so far.
International organizations have long criticised the conditions in the Libyan refugee camps as unworthy of human beings.
The North African state, which is largely dominated by militias, is the main transit country for migrants on the way from Africa to Europe.
When a teacher went to the public school place on Sunday afternoon to prepare her lessons for Monday, she surprised a breaker.
About 16:50 the teacher entered the building via the main entrance.

Only through a door, then over the roof terrace and from there via a stairway to the ground floor or the front court.
The teacher advised the police who took up the investigations.

German was caught in his own car for days
A 75-year-old has had to endure several days and nights in his car in a forest area in central Franconia, after driving the car away from all the forest paths and a tree blocked the car door.
On Saturday afternoon, rescue forces discovered the car by chance not far from a pasture and released the missing since Tuesday evening, the police reported on Sunday.
The 75-year-old from Pleinfeld said that despite the cold nights and the long time without care, the information was in good health condition.
He said he was looking forward to his home now.
The pensioner had been reported missing by his family after he had not returned from a ride with his off-road car on Tuesday over the local meadows and fields.
Despite intensive search, the man’s stay remained unclear for days.
Laschet warns the rule of law in Turkey
In conversation with the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Mr Armin Laschet (CDU) suggested that the rule of law be established in Turkey.
The relations of the two countries were currently "overshadowed", Laschet said on Saturday after a meeting with Erdogan at Cologne Airport.
This is primarily arrest waves, press and religious freedom.
He therefore made it clear to Erdogan that if relations are to normalize in the future, economic relations are to be deepened, the rule of law is a very important condition for them.
According to Laschet, the cases of Germans who are in prison in Turkey were also mentioned.
He had formulated the expectation that freedom of expression would be respected.
Erdogan once again stressed the independence of Turkish justice.
In the short term, Laschet and Erdogan's conversation had been transferred to a facility of the Federal Ministry of Defense at Cologne Airport.
Originally, it should have taken place at Wahn Castle – but the castle owners rejected it out of political conviction against Erdogan.
After the conversation, Erdogan continued to travel to the opening of the Dihib mosque in Cologne.
Laschet had cancelled a joint appearance in the building.
But he said, "The Muslims who go into this mosque are also citizens of our country."
And we are also their contacts - and not the Turkish President.
Missing confidence in the US: North Korea is demanding disarmament
While US President Trump will not tire of stressing the success of the negotiations on the denuclearisation of North Korea, the East Asian regime is the conditions of soberer.
Foreign Minister Ri calls for Washington to meet.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho accused the U.S. government at the UN General debate to block negotiations for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula with its continuing sanctions.
"The recent standstill is that the US is building on forced measures that are deadly for building trust," said Ri in New York.
Disarmament is unthinkable for North Korea under these circumstances.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances there will be no way of disarming ourselves as the first self," said the North Korean chief diplomat.
That punishment could force North Korea to "knee" would be "a dream of people who don't know us".
In order to build confidence, however, his country stopped its nuclear and missile tests and destroyed a nuclear test plant, pointed out Ri.
However, from the US side there were no "responsive reactions", the minister criticised.
Because of North Korea's nuclear and missile programme, the UN Security Council had decided three times last year alone sanctions against the internationally isolated country.
President Donald Trump and his Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo have been pressing the United Nations over the past few days for strict compliance with the sanctions.
At the same time, the U.S. government is working on an approach.
In June, Trump had first hit North Korea's power-bearer Kim Jong Un.
After the first summit in Singapore, the President of the United States is seeking a second summit with Kim.
In October, Pompeo will return to Pjöngjang for talks on the termination of the North Korean nuclear weapons program.
The HoT serves: New cuisine with donations from the municipality
The fact that they were actually in a youth meeting, the many visitors to the open-door house got nothing with it: White blankets and flower jewelry on the tables and a large buffet were waiting for the guests after the harvest thank-you service.
The young people of HoT had the buffet with delights from different countries in the new cuisine.
The institution was financed by donations from the community, for which the young people wanted to thank the food.
The start with the new facility was not easy, as Henriette Westbuer, the head of HoT, remembers.
We had our refrigerators filled with food and ingredients before the summer break and were well prepared for the big day.
But then the bad surprise came on the first day after the summer break: a power failure had put the huge, two-piece refrigerator out of operation, the food was spoiled and had to be disposed of.
"Now we had to start again from the beginning: although we have received a lot of support from friends and neighbors, the children and young people wanted to make it on their own," says Westbuer.
And that's how everyone gets on with it.
The result could be seen, the guests were enthusiastic.
"It's better not to cook them either," praised a visitor, while Hokkaido's pumpkin was served or allowed to serve guests on quizs, liver cheeses or cakes.
"It's really great what the children and young people have put on their feet," said Fr. Frank Beckmann, while magician Stephan Lammen with card tricks and other pieces of art caused amazement.
Jürgen Sator leaves the state board NRW of the board
From frustration about criticism from its own ranks, the head of the Essen table, Jörg Sartor, left his post in the Landesverband.
Sartor had become known throughout the country because the Essen panel had introduced a reception stop for foreigners.
He had already resigned in July as vice-president of the NRW summits, Sartor of the "World on Sunday".
I've fallen too many in my back.
The head of the Tablet Country Association NRW, Wolfgang Weilerswist, expressed an understanding of the decision of his long-standing deputy.
The harsh criticism had taken Sartor.
"I can understand his step - there were people who didn't know exactly why the Essen table did it."
Sartor is still active for the Essen table - "six days a week, nothing changes," says Weilerswist.
Sartor criticised again in the "world on Sunday" criticism of colleagues from other boards.
You should not follow the approach, "without us people starve to death in the city."
It is the responsibility of the state to ensure that people did not starve.
The Essener did not participate in a conference of the tables on Friday in Berlin.
"There's too much sweet chat telling me," he said.
There are all these social fuzzis that criticized me at that time.
SF Lorch Play 2:0 Guide - Gmünder Tagespost
Football, district league Lorch loses against Neuler 2:3 - TV Heuchlingen wins in Kirchheim after residue - Bettringen makes Lauchheim clear.
At 2:0 Lorch was already in charge in the home game against the TV newcomer - at the end it was 2:3 and the disappointment with the sports friends was great.
Quite different from the TV hypocrites: In Kirchheim, the TVH quickly got to the back with 0:1, but after 90 minutes it won with 2:1. At the top of the table, the SGB was able to achieve a 3:0 at the same time.
Gladbach plays twice guided tour - scarf without embryo with first victory
Borussia Mönchengladbach must continue to wait for an outward victory in Wolfsburg.
At 2:2 the foals play a lead twice.
Schalke comes against Mainz for the first victory (1:0).
(sda) In the first five league games, Schalke manoeuvrated with early countertors to the distance.
Now Domenico Tedesco's team again demonstrated the strength with which it took first place behind Bavaria in the last season.
Alessandro Schöpf led the homeequipe in the 11th minute after a strong preliminary work by Ewgeni Konopljanka by head, and subsequently the hosts preserved the mini-puster with a compact defensive power.
Thanks to an exceptional comeback Borussia Dortmund once again greets the top of the Bundesliga.
The team of Lucien Favre had entered into a 0:2-return against Bayer Leverkusen until the break, but in the second half of the season came to the 4-2 victory.
Jacob-Bruun Larsen (65.) and Marco Reus (69.) similar with a doublette innert four minutes, Paco Alcacer, who was replaced by Favre in the 63th minute, provided with another doublette in the final phase (86.94.) for the crowning conclusion of the performance increase after the break.
The VfB Stuttgart also won the first victory.
In the meantime, the Stuttgarters had to fear this because of a yellow-red map against Milos Veljkovic.
Borna Sosa and the unobtrusive Goalie Ron-Robert Zieler fabricated a curiosity throw owner who helped the guests in the 68th minute to compensate.

In Wolfsburg, Michael Lang did not experience a successful but also no mistaken debut for Borussia Mönchengladbach.
The Gladbachers, with the Swiss quartet Yann Sommer, Nico Elvedi, Denis Zakaria and Lang, twice gave a lead out of their hands, eventually played 2:2 and continued to wait for an outward victory in the VW city since 2003.
For Wolfsburg's compensation to the 1:1, Renato Steffen was responsible for his second Bundesligator.
On the flat shot of 20 meters of the Aargauer, Yann Sommer was powerless, as was the second hit after an hour.
Nevertheless, the trends at Gladbach are quite hesitant.
In the storm of the foals, Alssane Pléa turns out to be a goalgetter.

Although Stuttgart's defender Borna Sosa and Goalie Ron-Robert Zieler brought the Bremer back to the game through a curious casting owner (68.) a quarter of an hour before the conclusion, Gonzalo Castro shot the Stuttgarters in abundance back to the Siegesstrasse.
Nuremberg chose the duel against Düsseldorf 3:0 sovereign for itself.
After half an hour Hanno Behrens took the home team on course with Foulpenalty.
Macedonians agree on new state names
In Macedonia, some 1.8 million citizens today agree on the need to change their country's name to northern Macedonia.
In a yes, the almost three decades of distressing conflict with the neighbor of Greece could be solved.
Athens had passed a name change because of its northern province of the same name and blocked any approach to Macedonia to the West.
The voters therefore also decide on the future Western integration.
The US had announced that the country could quickly become NATO member when the referendum came out.
Syrer in U-Haft.
Refugee attacked three women.
A Syrian brutally beaten three pensioners and thereby injured them in part.
On Friday, the 41-year-old recruit had ransacked in the runway in Alsergrund.
When the police arrived, they spoke to the accused, who, with balled fists, went off to passersby and tried to attack them, on his behavior.
The Syrians then tried to beat and kick the officials.
Little later it turned out that the suspect had just hit the ground with his fists on Währinger Street at a tram stop three older ladies (65, 67, 75).
In addition, he had stepped the trio with his feet.
The pensioners were partially severely injured.
They suffered hematomas, provocations, and convulsions.
The asylum seeker was "for still unknown cause" as it was called by the police, also severely injured.
He was taken to the hospital and monitored throughout treatment.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Almost exactly one year after marriage entered into force for all, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his long-standing friend Christoph Rohde.
The two gave themselves the Jaword on Saturday in Hamburg.
A registered life partnership had not come into question for them, Kahrs had previously said the "image" newspaper.
"When we get married, then right." He's been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is a spokesman for the SPD-Bundestagsfraktion and one of the spokespersons of the Seeheimer Kreis, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of marriage for homosexuals on June 30, 2017, Kahrs had provoked a rage.
For example, he accused German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of having "adapted" himself on the subject.
"This was your Schabowski moment," he said in alleging the accidental proclamation of the GDR border opening by Günter Schabowski.
Since 1 October 2017, same-sex couples have been able to marry just like heterosexuals.
Previously they had been able to register their life partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, for example with the right of adoption.
Garden day: 400 meters hedge cut
There was a lot of work in front of the members of the Association of Children's Houses and the Society for Leprocology.
Because about 400 meters of hedge around the gardens of the inhabitants of the Pfründnerhaus should be cut.
Supported by the inhabitants, it went to work for around twelve supporters.
"We are doing this to reduce costs," said Walter Schröer, Chairman of the Association of Citizens.
And it's gotten so much together.
Due to the hot summer we're late this time, but luckily it's just a cut of shapes.
Because already in spring the hedge has already been shaved.
The following breakfast always follows on from work also has a long tradition.
"They should all stay with forces," said Walter Schröer.
World Cup in Rio: Hannes Aigner brings gold at the Kanuslolom World Cup
The Augsburg Hannes Aigner won the gold medal in Rio de Janeiro at the end of the canoealom World Championship.
The 29-year-old set a perfect course on Sunday on the Olympic track.
Two years ago he had missed Olympia-Bronze by three hundred seconds.
I was well prepared, had already had enough rides on the facility here and it has been all right today," said London Olympic Third in 2012.
In the goal, he threw away his pedestal from joy and pulled both arms into heights, knowing well that it would be at least sufficient for a medal.
After all, he had a starting number four.
But the six remaining starters could not top his fable time of 89.69 seconds.
Second, the Czech Jiri Prskavec became an egg in front of the Russian Pawel.
The Gauting police inspection listed the first attempt to break this autumn into a single-family house.
Fortunately, the perpetrators failed.
The days are getting shorter - that's what breakers want to take advantage of again.
So yesterday, police inspection Gauting mentioned the first attempt at this autumn.
It is due to the alarm system when trying to stay at the family house on the Königswieser Straße.
It went off when the culprits laid hands on Friday just before 20 a.m.
The intruders knew that the residents were not at home.
The alarm system, however, apparently surprised her so much that she took the flight without prey.

Pleite at Hertha: Collected from reality: Bavaria required against Ajax
The predicate is unbeatable: The defeat in Berlin wants to "not please" the FC Bayern.
The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach are now the first intermediate for Niko Kovac's term of office.
The first small power cell under the new Coach Niko Kovac is not to increase for the Munichs to the larger autumn low.
"One week ago we had the impression that we were invincible.
Now a little bit of reality has taken us in," Thomas Müller observed after the deserved 0:2 defeat at Hertha BSC and demanded a reaction for the Champions League doll with Ajax Amsterdam.
Whoever knows us knows we're really upset and that's why we're heading for Tuesday gas.
For the first time in more than a year out there has not been a goal of its own, as at the same time as the previous season, two duty games in series without victory, the table leadership in the football Bundesliga for the time being lost to Borussia Dortmund.
Although the overall situation is not as dramatic as the final phase of the failed Carlo Ancelotti at the end of September 2017, the record champion must be warned.
The FC Augsburg at 1:1 with its running man-to-man tactics and the Berliners through their playful needlesticks over the outsides have delivered two blue breaks within three days, as the most overpowering Bavaria is to be cracked.
"Those who know FC Bayern know that we don't like it and we're going to do everything we can to get us back to success," said Kovac.
Otherwise, however, he dealt with his losers in his birth city surprisingly gently and moved his first defeat as Munich Coach only to the again flawed handling of opportunities.
A victory against Amsterdam and against Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday would still be the first intermediate result of his term of office - otherwise the sound would probably become tighter.
Kovac did not take any exceptional measures before the second kingly class performance of this season after the 2nd of the season at Benfica Lisbon.
After the day off on Sunday, as planned, the short preparation for the second game against Ajax, which for the start of AEK Athens had also conquered sovereignly with 3:0.
"Now it's caught us in two games, but we're going to do our goals again," announced Manuel Neuer, national team captain.
As after the lost Cup finale against Eintracht Frankfurt in the same place, Joshua Kimmich spoke plain text.
The lawyer acted in the role of Mahner.
"I don't think it's all bad, we have to work it out again, because we don't make the variety of opportunities and make mistakes in the back," the 23-year-old stressed shortly before leaving the Olympic Stadium.
On the seventh day of the previous season, the Bayern were even behind Dortmund with five counters, which now took over the top with a point lead.
And so Kimmich valued at least positively with an eyewinker that now the public debate around the supposedly unbeatable Bavaria has found an end.
"Yes, that's a good thing," said the national player.
It's good for the league.
DFB-Boss in Shot Line: Özil-Causa: Sharp Attack of Erdogan to Grindel
With serious accusations, Turkish President Erdogan pleads an exclusion from Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan in Germany.
DFB President Grindel sees the mistake, but defends the line of association.
A new item is now to be created.
Berlin - Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought for the clarity of the interpretation in the permanent dispute theme Mesut Özil on various stages.
After the Turkish President, at the opening of the great Dirib Mosque in Cologne, vehemently criticised the relationship with the ex-world champion in Germany, the DFB chief defended the union line.
On the early Sunday morning, Grindel personally attacked by Özil in the Mainz ZDF "Sportsstudio" announced consequences from the Causa.
"In the future, because we also have many people with a migration background in the U.S., we have to draw very precise conclusions that something like this does not repeat," said the 57-year-old and wants to win a national player without a migration background as another integration officer.
At the same time, Grindel once again stated that Erdogan does not stand for the values of football and the DFB.
In sharp words, he had urged racism against Özil and Ilkay Gündogan.
Our born and raised Mesut Özil and our Ilkay.
They separated them from this society because they had taken pictures with me in England," Erdogan said on Saturday in the Domstadt.
Frankly, as their president, I could not digest the fact that our two young men, who have gone up to the German national team, had been separated.
Grindel pointed to Gündogan's statement that in contrast to Özil, he felt after the World Cup event, which had begun his photos with Erdogan, "responsibly treated by the DFB".
At the same time, he announced that he would want to face players in the future.
That someone says if I win, I'm German when I lose, I'm Migrant - that's not possible.
"I regret that he has such an impression," Grindel said.
We should've defended Mesut more, I've always said that.
However, he does not see a basis for a return to the national team either.
In addition to the native Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic, which have family roots in Cameroon, an additional integration officer is now to be appointed as a follow-up.
"If someone without a migration background has a significant impact on society and football, and says, "The issue is important, we have to take care of it," that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our associations where integration needs to work," said Grindel.
Despite the criticism of his person after the World Cup and the Özil-Afäre, he wants to candidate again for the office as DFB President in the coming year.
"I do my job and try to make it as good as I can," Grindel said.
Year-old builds three accidents within three hours
Coburg/Rödental - As the police report, the 75-year-old has caused the accidents on Friday between 10 and 1 pm.
First, the 75-year-old driver was approached by a lady at the red traffic lights in the area of Lautere Höhe.
This told the pensioner that he was driving her car.
But there was no exchange of personnel, as the 75-year-old couldn't find the lady in the parking lot.
A short time later, the police received a telephone report about a driver who had left the road and had been driven against a lead.
In response, the man didn't want a police station and then drove away from it.
After that, the Rödentaler drove home.
However, the pensioner has taken action in his place of residence, where he has lived for decades, and has rammed a construction vehicle while turning.
Finally, the police could find and stop him.
His car showed significant accident damage.
The 75-year-old made a whirling impression and couldn't remember much more.
The damage is around 1300 euros.
Moorbrand in Meppen: Still almost 1000 operational forces in use.
About four weeks after the outbreak of the Moorbrand on a federal defence site in the Emsland, 980 forces are still working on the demolition work.
This was reported by the Bundeswehr on Sunday.
According to a speaker, as the situation continues to develop stable, 70 volunteer helpers were recently withdrawn.
A further reduction in the number of forces is planned, it says.
In the night of Sunday, a fire above ground had been discovered and deleted.
Last week the disaster had been lifted, which was well proclaimed a week earlier on September 21st, because it was feared that the flames could endanger forests and settlements adjacent to the wind and spark flight.
On Thursday, it was then said that the fire on adjacent communities would no longer be a threat.
At times, more than 1500 forces on site tried to get the main fire under control.
The Luftwaffe further supports the work on the Bundeswehr test site at Meppen with a transport helicopter.
There are also educational flights with drones from the Bundeswehr.
According to the Bundeswehr, reconnaissance flights with "Tornados" are planned for 2nd and 5th October.
The fire had been triggered by test missiles that had fired Airbus technicians.
The moorbrand's smoking flag had temporarily moved up to a hundred kilometers across the northwest of Germany to Bremen.
On Monday, the Bundeswehr intends to set up a contact point that receives damage reports.
First claims for damages had already been announced by hoteliers and holiday home owners.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Johannes Kahrs (SPD, r) and his husband Christoph Rohde leave the main church of St. Catherine in Hamburg after their wedding.
Almost exactly one year after marriage came into force, the politician married his long-standing friend in Hamburg.
The two have been a couple for 25 years.
Hamburg - Almost exactly one year after marriage entered into force for all, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his long-standing friend Christoph Rohde.
The two gave themselves the Jaword on Saturday in Hamburg.
A registered life partnership had not come into question for them, Kahrs had previously said the "image" newspaper.
If we get married, then right.
He has been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is a spokesman for the SPD-Bundestagsfraktion and one of the spokespersons of the Seeheimer Kreis, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of marriage for homosexuals on June 30, 2017, Kahrs had provoked a rage.
For example, he accused German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of having "adapted" himself on the subject.
"This was your Schabowski moment," he said in alleging the accidental proclamation of the GDR border opening by Günter Schabowski.
Since 1 October 2017, same-sex couples have been able to marry just like heterosexuals.
Previously they had been able to register their life partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, for example with the right of adoption.
referendum started in Macedonia on new state names
In Macedonia the expected referendum on a new name for this small Balkan state has begun.
About 1.8 million voters will decide whether their state should be called North Macedonia in the future.
This is due to its northern province of the neighbouring Greece.
As a means of printing, Athens has blocked every approach from Skopje to the EU and NATO for almost three decades.
If the citizens vote in favour of Yes, they will also give the start of the Western integration of their country.
Elie Wiesel - The Author who saves Shoah from forgetting

Switzerland launches electronic register for organ donors
The register is intended to facilitate organ donations and relieve members in stress situations.
The new procedure does not alter the fact that organs are only allowed to be removed with express consent, emphasizes Swisstransplant.
(dpa) Switzerland will launch an electronic register for organ donors on this Monday.
This is designed to facilitate organ donation and relieve members in stress situations.
People who want to provide their organs in the event of death can register there.
Your wishes are then available in the case of Swisstransplant.
The new procedure does not alter the fact that, as in Germany, organs can only be removed with express consent, Swisstransplant emphasizes.
It is assumed that 15 percent of Swisss have a donation card, says Franz Immer, Director of the Swiss Transplant Foundation.
But only in five percent of cases a card is found at the decisive moment in possible donors.
In more than 60 percent of the conversations, family members do not know the wish of the deceased.
"You then have to choose alternately in the sense of the deceased, which is often very stressful," so always.
A similar registration system already exists in Great Britain.
In Germany, there are considerations about storing information on the possible organ donation on the health insurance card, as the spokesman of the Bundeszentrale for Health Enlightenment says, Marita Völker-Albert.
"A register where people can enter their wishes - per or contra organ donation - does not exist," she says.
Federal Health Minister Jens Spahn has voted for a new regime of organ donation.
According to his proposal, everyone would initially be regarded as an organ donor unless he or his or her object.
Among other things, the Catholic Church rejects this.
14-year-old student is the world champion in the headset
The 14-year-old student Tomohiro Iseda from Japan is the world champion in his head.
On the weekend in Wolfsburg, he fought against 39 fellow fighters.
Martina Flamme-Jasper of the Phaeno Science Museum, the venue of the competition, announced on Sunday.
The 16-year-old Wenzel Grüß from Germany took third place.
The youngest World Cup participant was a twelve-year-old Japanese student who was the oldest in France to be a 74-year-old pensioner, as main referee Ralf Laue said.
The computer science professor from Zwickau (Saxony) organizes the competition every two years.
Previous tasks were, for example: 14.430 214 x 17.981.822 or 57.809.355 + 28 x 16.448.333.
As spectators were not allowed, there was a show on Saturday afternoon in which participants met guests from the audience with calculator.
Wencesl from Lastrup demonstrated how he holds a ball with his head in the air while calculating.
He is one of seven Germans in competition.
A total of 82 candidates from more than 20 countries tried to qualify for the competition.
Greß was there two years ago as a 14-year-old in Bielefeld.
With terms such as superbrain, genius or miracle child, organizers Laue can do little.
"Calculator can be trained," he said.
Many participants practiced several hours a day.
In India or Singapore there are even stage-oriented computing competitions.
Among the disciplines, for example, the square root is drawn from six digits.
When calculating versatility, the candidates get surprising tasks for which they need to quickly find a solution strategy.
Here, too, the Germans would have good chances, said the chief referee.
Otherwise, Asians are often in a position to benefit because they have already learned headsets in early childhood and with other effective methods.

The emotional video is part of the "I Touch Myself" project that deals with breast cancer early detection that can save lives.
Serena Williams died almost a year ago.
At the birth of her daughter Alexis Olympia there were complications.

Government wants to ban more extremist symbols
Vienna - The Federal Government is planning a significant extension of the ban on the use of extremist symbols.
Next week, the turquoise-blue coalition will send an appropriate bill to the so-called "symbol law" in review.
This aims to significantly increase the number of those terrorist or similar groups covered by the prohibition.
Polar cold air brings new snow on the mountains in the west
Ms. Holle shakes her beds in the west for the first time next week: Polare Kaltluft reaches Vorarlberg, Nordtirol and Salzburg on Monday.
According to meteorologists of the Central Institute for Meteorology and Geodynamics (ZAMG), the snowfall at the beginning of the week drops to 1,500 to 1,200 metres - in narrow valleys it could snow down, with a strong intensity, to about 1,000 meters.
From the Bregenzerwald to the Hohe Tauern you can expect 20 to 40 centimetres of new snow above 2,000 meters.
On higher passways (Arlbergpass, Rimmelsicht, Bieler Höhe, Brennerpass, Gerlospass, Felbertauern, Großglockner Hochalpenstraße) the road conditions thus become wintery.
Farmers are allowed to start the annual knee care on Monday
Schleswig-Holstein's farmers are allowed to begin their annual knee care on Monday.
The unique "green whales" in Germany have shaped the landscape of the woodland for about 200 years.
The tree and straw hedges, up to five meters wide, are "forest set" and the last retreat rooms for many animals and plants.
Knicks connect as corridors scatteredly located habitats, through which the exchange of organisms can still work, as the Managing Director of the Naturschutzbund Deutschland (NABU) in Schleswig-Holstein, Ingo Ludwichowski, said.
Necks are living fences
The Knicks were laid on the basis of an order by the Danish King Christian VI in 1766, who ruled Schleswig-Holstein.
The "living fences" were not only field limits and cattle fences, they also provided the farmers with firewood and beams for their specialized houses.
His name "Knick" came from that time: the dense, intertwined demarcations were able to develop by "turning" the branches.
Today, some 45 000 kilometres of hedges extend between the North and Baltic Sea and give the picture of a woody, multifaceted landscape.
According to NABU, they are now used by around 7000 species as a substitute habitat.
In one kilometer of knick, up to 1800 different species could live and breed up to 30 bird pairs.
However, its ecologically important function can only be achieved if it is maintained in winter accordingly.
Otherwise, he takes care of a light tree row, which in addition to the variety of species also loses the wind protection effect, said Ludwichowski.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, the carnivores may only be operated outside the breeding period from October to March.
After Tsunami on Sulawesi Indonesian speaks about local situation
In an interview with the editorial network Germany (RND), the local Radika Pinto describes the situation on the island of Sulawesi after the earthquakes and the tsunami:
Were you on site during the tsunami?
No, I was just in Jakarta on the island of Java.
When the earthquakes were over, my wife called me, she was in Palu.
Then when I learned about the tsunami, I immediately made my way back to Sulawesi.
I arrived on Sunday morning because after a flight I had to drive more than 20 hours of car, as the airport on Palu was closed at the time.
What's the situation on the island now?
The national government has reopened the airport so that aid goods can also be flown in.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast that were all completely destroyed.
Our office of "World Vision" is also destroyed, but we have provisionally set up something where we have also accommodated other people.
Where are the people living on Sulawesi now?
Many are ran on surrounding hills, on which they are still afraid of another tsunami and earthquakes and where they have no access to water and food.
Some people are standing in front of their homes, there are still aftershocks.
Because many grocery stores and also the gas stations are completely closed, people sometimes steal food and gasoline.
The public service has gone down completely, the national government helps out.
A prison was also destroyed, the prisoners were partially free to walk around and the search for them is difficult.
There are still many bodies around, many people have not yet been found and are missing.
How is communication and information on the island going?
At the moment, we have cell phone reception, but before that, it didn't work, and we just got information on the radio.
Many people are still looking for their children, neighbors and other people, who do not know whether they live and where they are staying because people were not at home during the earthquakes, but, for example, on the road to work.
The tsunami warning system did not work properly.
Do you have any information about this?
We don't know the reasons for this, but when the warning came, many thought "Okay, no tsunami" - and then he came.
In other regions not affected by the tsunami, there was the misinformation that a tsunami hit the region and they were ran to the surrounding mountains.
Is not an island like Sulawesi on the Pacific Firering prepared for earthquakes?
Yes, there are earthquakes every day, but this was the worst.
We usually know how we react to earthquakes and also train evacuations.
But the entire infrastructure has collapsed, the earthquake has hit a lot of people.

Brett Kavanaugh: FBI investigation in Turbotempo
Time is extremely scarce and the number of planned hearings greatly limited.
With an FBI investigation in the Turbotempo, Republicans in the U.S. Senate want to secure the high-thin majority for the judge candidates Brett Kavanaugh, who are disputed for the reasons of need.
President Donald Trump has set a period of time for the investigators to go on Friday to clarify the suspected incidents that have occurred more than 30 years ago.
The most recent turn in the drama around Kavanaughs, accompanied by a cultural struggle, had been triggered on Friday.
After an eight-hour hearing of Kavanaugh and the first prosecutor Christine Blasey Ford, in whose course the magistrates spoke out against the opposition democrats, the Senate Justice Committee should open the way for the final confirmation of the ore-conservative judge at the Supreme US court.
The majority of Republicans seemed secured when suddenly Senator Jeff Flake declared contrary to his original announcement that he would agree, but demanded an FBI investigation.
After tumultous scenes, his party friends accepted.
President Trump, who had still called the heavy precepts on Thursday as a "chievous", initially held further attacks against the women and spoke of "luck in the bad luck".
In this way, the final doubts could be resolved, he said.
Later, during an election campaign, Trump attacked the Democrats sharply because they reject Kavanaugh: "They try to block and destroy".
Trump orders FBI investigation in Kavanaugh case
The White House has also extremely restricted the powers of the investigators.
One would specifically investigate the known accusations of two women, no more, a government representative said to the Wall Street Journal: "They don't go on a fishing trip."
According to the New York Times, only four witnesses are to be heard.
According to the municipal community of Ried, which is installed in a "civil vehicle", radar device for monitoring the speed limit is stationed on the garden road starting on Monday, 1 October.
There is also the Bundesschulzentrum.
The municipality also operates several fixed installed radar boxes.
FC Schalke 04 after victory against Mainz: One has felt the fear
Trainer Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated the first season against Mainz.
The relief on Schalke is great after the first victory of the season.
However, the factor time also played a role against Mainz.
Gelsenkirchen - In the meantime, Christian Heidel is a huge pessimist at football games.
That wasn't different in the home game against Mainz 05.
"I've seen every ball in it.
And there were many corners and many balls in our penitentiary," said the Sports Board of Schalke 04 - and breathed up.
After all, the royal blue was still able to bring the scarce 1:0 against the Rhine Hesse over time and thus the first season victory under the roof and trade.
In fact, it could have been different.
After the tour of Alessandro Schöpf 11. the team of chief coach Domenico Tedesco had given safety: "To sum up, the first half-time was good, both playful and pressing", apparently more and more played a role in the head.
Don't make a football monster, actually.
"The last ten minutes have felt like two hours for me," said Heidel: "If the team was only half as nervous as I was on the bench, I can understand it."
The boys were afraid to give it out of their hands and therefore kept withdrawing.
And with man and mouse defended against Mainz.
To save the first three counters of the season.
"All of us have fallen a huge stone from the heart," said Schöpf, who with his football hit had no insignificant part to do with it: "I am actually the worst football player in the manship."
But in the end, only the victory counts.
The relief was noticeable throughout the arena, of course also at Tedesco.
"We wanted to start with pressure in the initial phase and make a fireworks out of it," said Schalkes Chefcoach.
The victory was important.
At last we can enjoy a few hours.
I'm very, very happy for the team and the fans.
We have played intelligent, quiet and courageous, so we have to start playing games over 90 minutes
The biggest manko in the afternoon: King Blue missed it to worry more clearly.
The possibilities for this were finally there, for example through the strong Yevhen Konpplyanka, who met twice the latte 59./72. or Amine Harit 62.
"Then it wouldn't have been a tremor victory," Tedesco said, "you've already felt the fear a little bit."
That's why I'm glad we won.
He wasn't the only shalker.

Prof. Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani is discussing integration: A discussion at eye level
Before them stands the author, Professor Doctor Aladin El-Mafaalani.
He has repeatedly followed the invitation of Ernst Reiling and Lore Hauschild.
"I have made it my task to bring interesting people to Greven for many years," explains the founder and chairman of the "Reckenfelder Treff" - that association that cooperates with the "Culture Policy" alliance in the direction of the evening.
El Mafaalani gets very loose into the reading, describes the writing process of the book, talks about how difficult it was to explain the subject intelligibly.
With lots of gestures, hand-resistant numbers and some joke, he brings the listeners one of the most conflict-rich topics: migration and integration.
Despite successful integration, why do conflicts arise?
The Syrian author uses himself to answer the question of a metaphor.
At a table German society sits, at the cat's table the migrants of the first generation.
Their children grow up in Germany and want to get to the table.
The third generation of migrants is born in Germany, they have always sat at the big table and want to agree.
This leads to conflict.
Therefore, it is not decisive whether one orders himself politically to the right or to the left, but "Am I for or against an open society?" he emphasizes.
At the beginning, the discussion round is moving more and more quickly.
And there's a need for a speech.
An Afghan refugee reports from his perspective, two teachers tell how they see successful or unsuccessful integration among students.
El Mafaalani is standing, not on stage, a symbol for the discussion: she is at eye level.
Sociology professor does not press his opinion, stressing that he speaks of the average, not of individual fates.
He is pleased that there is interest in the subject, because "first, when we understand what the problem is, we can find solutions," says El Mafaalani.
Even during the subsequent signing hour, he continued to have an open ear for the questions of the guests and also in the foyer, with prepared Kurdish specialties, intensively discussed.

This is how Schalkes Naldo achieves "great sport" on the bank
For the third time in a row, Naldo does not want to start: Nevertheless, Naldo would like to thank Domenico Tedesco at Schalke-Trainer.
Gelsenkirchen - After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues for the third time in a row did not sit in the Schalker Startling, but on the exchange bank, understanding would have been great in many people if the Brazilians who were nearly two meters tall had talked about the frustration of the soul.
But after the 1:0 victory over the FSV Mainz 05, the Schalker players gathered in the middle circle as usual and thanked Domenico Tedesco for all his professionals, the 36-year-old, all of whom call the simplicity of Naldo, joined forces and said, "We have to thank, trainers!"
"That was very emotional, that was great sport," Tedesco later said about the reaction to his vice-captain, who despite his re-servist presence did not have any grudge.
Probably, Naldo, who was celebrated as the best shalker in the past season, knows that he did not actually get on the track with his coach - but for good reasons receives a break.
A reason called "taxation control".
It wasn't easy to tell him
"It wasn't easy to tell him that, I tell you quite honestly," said Tedesco of the moment he told Naldo that he wasn't in the starter.
He's an important player, he's an important person.
But it's always about the matter, it's about the association," Tedesco explained the step.
Naldo played against Bavaria and Porto 90 minutes.
He's 36 years old.
It's important that everyone can get through at the moment.
And that we all keep in the boat," Tedesco explained the rotation, which was last caught by Naldo.
And to which the Brazilian responded with the wisdom of his advanced age: by proving himself to be an exemplary team player on the bank as well.
The atmosphere in Austria's industry has continued to speed up its valley ride in August compared to the Eurozone.
The shopping manager index (PMI) was on a 37-month low with 46.7 points.
Throughout Europe, Austria still has the third best mood behind Ireland and the Netherlands, the Markit Institute announced on Monday to its survey of 3,000 companies.
Unlike in Austria, the euro zone PMI rose by 1.1 to 45,1 points, while the index is still the 13 month in a row under the brand of 50 counters indicating growth.
The only Irish industry hit this threshold in August with 50.9 points.
The final light was the Greeks (42.1 points).
Although in Germany, France and Spain the mood barometer fell, it was slower than in the months before.
In Spain, the index reached the highest level with 44.0 points since March.
"The slightly weakened valley ride could mean that the worst has survived," said Markit economist Rob Dobson.
However, industry - in the third quarter at least - remains number one growth brake.
A rapid return to the growth zone is not in sight: the export orders in the euro area have not fallen as much as since November 2011.
The companies were therefore setting up posts the seventh month in a row.
Industrial production also fell more strongly in China in August than was initially assumed.
The mood barometer sank from 49.3 points in the previous month to 47.6 points.
Experts initially expected 47.8 points.
The purchase manager index is based on representative surveys of 3,000 European industrial enterprises.
Developments in sales, employment, warehouses and prices will be raised, among other things.
