Food debt to European inflation
The main reason for the rise in inflation in the euro area was the rapid increase in food prices.
In the 13 euro-zone countries, the price was higher than expected in November - after the 2.6 percent in October, an annual inflation rate of 3.1 percent was recorded, as reported by the EU Statistical Office in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts are expected of only 3 percent, Bloomberg reported.
In contrast to the US, British, and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not lowered the lead. According to its discretion, the reduction in interest rates would favour the rise in commodity prices and the slight decline in unemployment in the wake of inflation spirals.
The ECB strives to keep the inflation rate below two percent, or at least close to the two-percent mark.
According to one analyst, the ECB is in the zwickmühle: one has to "speak" inflation in order to exclude later action.
By 3.3 percent, the inflation rate in Germany reached a 12-year record height in November; in Spain, the rate climbed from 3.6 to 4.1 percent.
The rise in inflation in the euro area was responsible for increasing food and energy prices.
The MATIF wheat quotations rose by 88 percent, and the price for soybeans also reached a record height since 1973.
There was also a significant price increase in 2007 for food oil and dairy products.
The world market price for crude oil rose by 52 percent this year - last month the price per barrel of black gold reached nearly 100 US dollars.
According to the ECB, inflation will rise from 2.1 to 2.5 percent in 2008, but in 2009 it is expected to fall to 1.9 percent.
For the coming 3-4 months, analysts expect a 3-percent inflation rate, but the average annual rate is 2.1 percent.
For 2008, experts expect the ECB to reduce interest rates twice.
Gallup locates government crisis
After a long stagnation, the number of Fidesz sympathizers has increased significantly by the beginning of December. For the first time since 2002, the party has the largest base camp, while the agreement for the socialists according to Gallup has reached an unprecedented depth of 13 percent.
The difference in opposition advocates is evident in party-reliable voters: more than two thirds (71 percent) are opposed to one fifth (20 percent) of MSZP approval.
According to the survey, MDF and SZDSZ are subject to the parliamentary drive-in: they reach two percent in the total population.
The number of party voters has grown by one percent in both camps.
Compared to the final lowest, the general economic mood has deteriorated further - never before has the proportion of those who regard the country's economic situation as "speak bad", so high (41 percent), while another 46 percent consider it "very bad".
After more hopeful prospects in spring and summer, families see the change in their financial situation again more pessimistic.
For the coming year, the majority of the population expects further deterioration of the situation; only one tenth is expected to improve.
A Gallup survey conducted in December showed that 71% of respondents - a historic high - judged the Prime Minister's work as "very bad as right".
Thirteen percent of respondents have great confidence or confidence in Ferenc Gyurcsány in general, while the share of supporters for Viktor Orbán is 38 percent.
About 54% do not trust the head of government at all, compared to 27% distrust of the Fidesz party chief.
One of the indicators of political mood is the number of people who think that dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister could be overcome without a change of government.
If, after the unrest last October, 35% were still in favour of the government and the head of government, this share is now only 20%, while the relative majority (33 percent) sees the solution only in new elections.
Asked for their interest in the referendum, 60 percent replied that they would participate "with certainty" and give another 20% their vote "probable".
In comparison, if the parliamentary elections took place this Sunday, only 55 percent would go to the urns "with security", another 15% would consider their participation to be "probable". In view of these trends, the result of the referendum would be foreseeable.
74% would vote against tuition fees, 79% against the practical fee, and 84% against hospital day money.
Based on the group of participants in the referendum "with security", the proportions of the opponents of study, practice and hospital fees would be 81, 84 and 89 percent respectively.
Also most expensive, Tesco increased by almost one fifth
This year's hypermarkets in the Budaörs trade area have also maintained the average price increase of 16% of last year, with the difference that there was no increase in VAT this year.
Articles from Napi Gazdaság
In the Budaörser trade triangle, the price of the usual Christmas basket of the "Napi" increased by 16 percent this year, but prices were recorded in all hypermarkets by over 1,000 HUF.
After prices in the food markets have been "galopated" last December, the price of consumption has not been drastically reduced, compared to the already high, previous level of output.
However, it is certain from the point of view of consumers that what they still paid for last year is far below 9 000 HUF not even available for 10,000 HUF.
The price of the "Napi" shopping cart exceeded the magical 10,000 HUF limit by at least 91 HUF in the examined markets.
The highest price was 10,573 HUF.
(In 6800 the price was 6,800 HUF.)
Prices for unicum and live fish remained almost at the previous year's level, but prices for puten breast fillets, walnuts and poppies have increased considerably.
Prices for flour and bread corresponded to the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary, but also there were 1 kg of bread watches for 139 Forint.
There was no price decline in the product as a result of competition at less than 200 Forint.
Also surprising was the price of a two liter Coca-Cola pan bottle of less than 200 Forint, so the drink, including pan, cost only 257 HUF.
Nevertheless, this year in the "Napi" shopping cart comparison also the most expensive, and Cora the cheapest.
Our calculations have shown that Cora has increased the prices in the "Napi" basket compared to the Christmas prices last year by 15, while Tesco and even by 18 percent.
The difference between the cheapest shopping baskets of the previous year and the most expensive of this year was 12%, while the increase between cheaper shopping baskets last year and most expensive of the current year was 21%.
The average price increase was HUF 1.480.00.
The average price increase in the previous year was 1.206.00 Forint, but the VAT increase at last Christmas prices was noticeable.
This is precisely where trade has taken place: it seems that the warehouses have not been able to make the right decision on the price range to be applied to the individual items, as the impact of the price increase on consumer behaviour was indispensable.
(If the dealer does not plan the circulation speed of a product, he may fall by substantial profit in the price range, which is based on the transport intensity.)
The price difference in the cheapest basket was only 844 Forint, but the price difference in the cheapest basket was so radical that the cost-effective tax-related condition of last year's "Napi" basket was so high that the most expensive basket exceeded the value of 2006 by 1720 Forint.
This year such extremes were not observed, as the most expensive basket cost by 1.630,00 Forint more than in the previous year, and even at the cheapest there was a price increase of 1,284,00 Forint.
Compared with the last two Christmas seasons, a catastrophic price increase was seen, with the price of daily consumer goods in the hypermarkets increased by more than 30 percent in less than 20 months.
(This in turn does not necessarily confirm the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary: in some basic foods, the Statistical Office established a more than 30 per cent price during the 12-month period.
So in about next to flour also with eggs.)
However, if you take a look at the "Napi" shopping cart, this seems almost impossible for the latter, as the price level of the already expensive product even in the worst case has increased by little more than 10 percent.
Obviously, flour suppliers are in a stronger position than the egg suppliers - after all, they have been able to shift the drastic price increase on the multis.
In the golden commercial triangle the hypermarkets do not complain; it is constantly reported of good years.
Our experience shows that the majority of customers in the three warehouses no longer look at prices.
It is bought out of all large quantities, durable food goes in pallets across the shop tables.
Wednesday morning morning there were endless snakes at the cash register in all three warehouses, when suddenly the number of customers exploded.
However, a lower customer frequency is reported by the country, so that many multis complain of the opinion researchers that they could not even achieve planned sales, not only in food but also in sustainable consumer goods.
In many places disinfectants are saved from disinfectants
Today, more than a thousand infections have been registered in hospitals that were due to improper treatment of antibiotics.
Hygienic conditions in hospitals, over-integrity of beds, overload of personnel - all the factors that are not exactly responsible for the control of infections, according to the senior physician of the National Epidemiology Center.
In many places disinfectants are also saved.
In the traumaatology department of the János hospital, an MRSA infection has recently been diagnosed.
The bacterium resistant to antibiotics was found in a male patient who was hospitalized after a severe accident.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year there was a similar infection here.
The injury of a serious car accident was released from the hospital, but a little later the man had to return with a MRSA infection. An important operation has not yet been performed because of the bacterium that is still in the patient’s body.
Until 10 December this year, infections to the National Nosocomialis Surveillance System caused by multi-resistant pathogens were reported, according to the senior physician of the National Epidemiology Center, Karolina Böröcz.
So many infections caused by multi-resistant pathogens have been registered in hospitals with certainty, but the dark count is likely to be higher.
About two thirds of the infections (683 cases) were triggered by MRSA, the staphylococcus aureus resistant to methicillin oxacillin.
The Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacterium carries about a third of the people in their nose without causing a disease.
SA-related infections (such as inflammation of the neck, inflammation of the almond, inflammation of the skin or wounds) usually respond well to antibiotics, they are well-healable.
However, if the mean is over-dose or improperly applied, the well-responding bacteria are produced antibiotics-resistant, which quickly spread in hospitals under appropriate conditions.
Especially in patients with weakened, or permanently functioning immune system, as well as in elderly, or patients with low body weight, these bacteria can cause serious infections such as wound infection or blood poisoning, i.e. sepsis.
According to János Hospital's medical director, MRSA infection is nothing special, such cases belong to the daily health care system.
One should not confuse the infection with the epidemic, Tibor Nyulasi - MRSA warned there is only where it is not sought.
Resists Antibiotic
"Such patients are isolated, the care staff wears rubber gloves and masks in the care, and we have the antibiotics required for treatment" - says Tibor Nyulasi.
While entering the hospital, patients are examined for MRSA, an infection cannot always be avoided.
Samples taken too rarely
The majority of infections caused by MRSA in hospitals would be avoidable, however, the current prevailing conditions and circumstances are unfavourable for the prevention of the development or spread of the multi-resistant pathogen, says Karolina Böröcz.
After this infection occurs mainly in hospitals and oldage homes, hospitals should investigate the patients given and immediately isolate MRSA infected patients.
In the Hungarian hospitals, however, microbiological sampling is not so frequently practiced.
Not least because there are no subsidies from the public health insurance fund for this investigation.
Therefore, most of the cases will only come to daylight if the patient already has a noticeable MRSA infection, according to the medical director of the epidemiology center.
From the European Union there are strict recommendations on the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine, but there are also guidelines in Hungary for the treatment of certain infections and diseases.
Antibiotic therapies should be targeted, i.e. microbiological investigations are necessary to prevent resistance to the drug, but this directive of hospitals is not always respected.
Among the outpatients, or patients in the basic care, microbiological sampling is even more rare, says Karolina Beroez.
Disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSA is most frequently transferred from one patient to another by the nursing staff.
This is precisely why handwashing or wearing gloves and masks is of great importance, but there are also significant shortcomings in this area in hospitals.
MRSA is transmitted by droplet infection or contact, but in the local hospitals there is not always the possibility to isolate infected patients.
The rooms are even often overcrowded, the beds close to each other, although there should be a distance of at least 1.5 meters between them from a epidemiological point of view.
Unfortunately, as Karolina Beroez continues to note, in the financially less well-informed hospitals even there is a saving of disinfectants, there are few caregivers, many patients - all factors that favor the emergence of infections.
Such infections have been shown to be far less common there, or the further spread of the pathogen can be stopped where these protective measures are observed, says Karolina Beroez.
Government programme against MRSA
Getting grip on MRSA infections causes the health insurance huge costs, so they are fought everywhere.
In England, for example, the prevention of MRSA or its restriction was held in the government programme.
After first signs, the program is successful - as published data shows - the tendency of MRSA infections in England is declining.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDC) has explained the prevention of the development of multi-resistant pathogens (including MRSA) and the prevention of infections in hospitals as one of its priorities.
Death liner polish was not drunk
In the case of the accident caused by the police chief of the XXII district, the official opinion is now available with a fatal outcome.
The police chief of the XXII district, who had killed a pedestrian on Tuesday in a car accident, was neither alcoholic nor drug-influenced, said Attila Morvai, the press officer of the Budapest Supreme Prosecutor's Office on Friday, after the official opinion had been submitted to the case.
The opinion confirmed the results of the initial investigation, according to which the chief of police had not consumed alcohol before he sat down to the tax.
The former police chief boomed his own car in the XXII district into Kossuth Lajos Street and passed over a 55-year-old man who crossed the road at an unmarked place.
(Laut StVO, however, this is not a milding circumstance - the handlebar has, even if pedestrians do not cross the road at the zebra strip, subordinate .)
The pedestrian suffered his injuries after he was delivered to the hospital.
According to police reports, the handleman suffered a shock, then put back his functions and asked for retirement.
The Budapest Public Prosecutor's Office has launched its investigations to the incident.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former chief of police had cooperated with the investigators from the beginning.
Further EUR 400 million for infrastructure
Minister of Finance János Veres and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB) signed three loan agreements in Budapest on Friday with a total value of EUR 400 million.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) approved a EUR 300 million framework for financing transport and environmental projects implemented with grants from the Cohesion Fund.
The amount of EUR 150 million agreed under the loan agreement will also be allocated to the budgetary financing of educational projects.
The EIB has granted a total of EUR 300 million to Hungary for this purpose; the use of the remaining EUR 150 million will be decided later as part of the extension of the loan agreement.
In the field of innovation, the contracting parties have signed an agreement of more than EUR 50 million, which will mainly flow into research and development programmes at the University of Debrecen.
The underground line 4 was also mentioned at the meeting.
It was agreed that once Hungary has clarified the details of subway financing with the EU, the original contract and possible modifications will be re-examined.
According to János Veres, this would be possible in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed a total of 113 projects of EUR 8.4 billion in Hungary.
The loan interest rates are EURIBOR-related, the loan is made available by the EIB with a commission-free deposit of 8 years.
Bulgaria, the EU's real estate paradise
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is fabulous - all Europe is looking closely at the previously rarely mentioned Balkan state.
What, where, and who is still buying the most cheap market in the EU, but which is rapidly becoming more expensive?
An analysis of the Bulgarian Re/Max division.
Bulgaria is currently the most sought-after patch for real estate purchases in Eastern Europe, with cheap ski apartments and houses by the sea.
Between the mountains, the regions Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are among the most popular, on the sea are albumina, the "Gold Coast", the "Sun Coast", and the historic towns of Sozopol and Nessebar the racers, but real estates around Kavarna and Balcik are also increasingly in demand.
According to Re/Max analysts in Bulgaria, the interior is dedicated to attracting investors sooner or later, such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, and Triavna, and also the extremely favourable area of Russians has more buyers.
The capital Sofia also offers seductive offers - commercial and office areas offer highest yields.
Bulgaria is on the best way to become one of the most attractive European golfing paradise, and thus to attract tourists in the other two seasons in addition to the summer and winter season.
Therefore, for example around Bansko, forward-looking investors are already buying in a big way.
According to analysts, people who acquire real estate in Bulgaria also strive to change their lifestyle.
Most buyers are English, but there are also interested people from France, Belgium, Spain, and more and more from Romania.
Investors from Malta and Cyprus are also present, while there are mainly Russian buyers at the Black Sea and in the ski resorts.
There are three groups of foreign buyers, says Georgij Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Those who want to settle, buy either revitalized properties by 50 to 100,000 euros, or lowered houses by 5 to 15,000 euros, which they then renovate themselves.
Good connections and accessibility as well as communication possibilities are very much written, but also the proximity to a big city, shops and doctors are crucial for the buyers.
The second category includes those who are looking for a holiday home (Bulgaria was listed in December among the top holiday goals of the Germans).
The third group is representing businessmen who invest with the aim of a medium to long-term increase in value.
Real estate in the capital is becoming increasingly expensive, due to ever growing demand.
In the EU, real estate prices are the lowest in Bulgaria, but over the past five years there has been a 21 percent increase annually.
The cost of real estate prices exceeds the increase in salaries by far.
Fodor and the six Hungarian percentages
As Environment Minister Gábor Fodor announced, the expert meetings will end on Tuesday, and the debate on the international climate regime after 2012 will continue by the ministers on Wednesday after the official opening.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries will discuss Bali's roadmap, setting out the emission reduction measures for the post-2012 period, i.e. after the end of the Kyoto Protocol.
At present, there is a heated debate between industrialized and developing countries.
The US has already signaled that they do not want to negotiate on concrete figures, but they would be ready to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 percent by 2020 compared to 1990.
The other major issue of the conference is whether industrialised countries are willing to support both financially and technologically in addition to reducing emissions.
An agreement on aid for developing countries was also reached.
The adjustment fund supported by the Kyoto Protocol is expected to be managed by a 16-member Council at the UN Global Environment Facility (GEF), as can be read in the "Piac és Profit".
Hungary 6 percent
On behalf of Hungary, Environment Minister Gábor Fodor supports the EU's efforts to maintain its pioneering role in global climate action and to reach a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister said that the EU would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020 (as measured by the 1990 values), regardless of whether the "after 2012" agreement would be successful, or not. The Union would even be willing to work for a 30 percent reduction, provided that other major industrialised countries in the world, or developing countries, are also willing to meet their obligations by strength and responsibility.
Gábor Fodor stressed that the objective of the states that joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 was a reduction of only 5.2 percent, whereas the EU had already committed itself to 8% with its 15 member states at the time.
Hungary's definition is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6% compared to 1985-87 - a requirement that will certainly meet the country, as can be seen in the press release of the Ministry of the Environment.
The commitment is high on Bali - after all, the long-term international climate policy agreement has to be completed within two years, otherwise it would only enter into force after 2012. In this case, the Kyoto Protocol will not follow a new, international emission reduction system, its importance also the IPCC, the UN International Nobel Peace Prize-winning Scientific Climate Change Committee, has highlighted in its recent report.
This would slow down the reduction of emissions, and the increase in earth's average temperature by more than 2°C would be inevitable, which, according to scientists, would result in very serious and irreversible consequences.
British army advertises on YouTube
Units of the British Army have published recordings of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan to increase popularity on the video portal.
First of all, the British Air Force (RAF) YouTube has discovered for itself: Special units stationed in Afghanistan have been uploading videos of operations conducted against the Taliban since March 2006, reports the BBC.
The film shots shot on helmets are controlled at the Air Force Base in Kandahar and then sent to London where they are placed on the Internet.
Political message inevitable
Air Force soldiers have already contributed 139 such recordings, their "channel" has been seen more than 75,000 times.
The British Ministry of Defense was registered under "defenceheadquarters" in spring 2007 to publish videos about Iraqi and Afghan operations, but also the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Commonwealth Office) and the International Peace Forces (MNFI) stationed in Iraq have their own YouTube channels.
Used in Afghanistan
Originally, the Air Force has published the videos aimed at recruiting soldiers, and as the Ministry of Defense says, the contributions also serve the purpose of informing the population of the actual objectives of foreign operations.
Propaganda such as this is published almost free of charge compared to conventional television advertising, says defense expert Gordon Mackenzie to BBC, but these videos always bear a certain degree of political message, as they confirm the existence of the military measures adopted by the government in their own way.
Americans advertise with game
However, the army must also fight against amateur shots, which create it in addition to carefully processed, censored recordings - such as those that show the death of the soldiers: in the slightly hypocritical, "official" propaganda films, the losses are spoken at most, but the bloody sides of the war are not shown.
Of the war sites in Iraq and Afghanistan, many already in use were loaded on the platform, but the British have only recently discovered this "gattering" for themselves.
The Americans, however, advertise in a slightly different way, namely with the free downloadable shooting game "Amerikas Army", in which the player can slip into the skin of the soldier as part of a more or less true simulation.
Christmas with Tombola and Pogatsche in the Ministries
Minister of Labour, Mondika Lamperth, is by no means mild: instead of a Christmas celebration, she organizes a working conference in which her employees can make 2007 work with coffee and pogatsche.
Some ministries celebrate with live music, other enchanting Christmas moods with tombola or inciting the officials' hearts.
Party, Christmas mood, concerts and buffet - so celebrates power.
The Christmas fever has already recorded the offices.
The largest Christmas celebration of a ministry is held this year in the defence resort, but not the staff of the Ministry are expected to do so.
At the "Christmas celebration" children are provided by fallen soldiers, at which "mission celebration" family members are attended by soldiers currently stationed abroad, but there is also a reception for the press.
The resort makes around 25 million available for the celebrations.
The National Agency for Development (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economics and Transport are beating the strands in comparison to other resorts.
The 4.32 million forint expensive Christmas celebration of the Ministry of Economic Affairs is held at the House of the Future, with about 350 of the 600 employees expected.
Although the celebrations will focus on Christmas, there will also be live acts and a tombola loss.
The National Agency for Development (NFÜ) held its 4.7 million forint expensive Christmas celebration on Wednesday at the House of the Landesjustizrat (OIT), with concerts and a feast.
The hall rent was 1 million forint, the rest was issued for the more than 400 invited guests.
According to our information, a division of the NFÜ is also invited at another Christmas celebration organised by the Hungarian Economic Development Centre (MAG Zrt) from EU funds.
For the celebration the building of the Lustspieltheater ("Vígszínház") was rented.
The MAG Zrt has not confirmed this information because we have not reached the competent authorities.
What's the suit for?
The OIT building was not only open to the guests of the NRP, but also to the Ministry of Justice and Police, who held Lucia ball there instead of a Christmas celebration on December 7.
They did not have to pay rent to the OIT for the use of the premises.
Around 500 visitors came to the ball.
The celebrations were opened with a speech from the minister, after dinner there was live music for dancing.
At the request of [origo] they told us: there was no ball dress or suit obligation at the ball.
The Ministries of Health, Work, and Self Administration are preparing each of them for Puritan celebration.
The Ministry of Health organizes the celebration for the employees in its own four walls for about 400,000 Forint.
Minister of Labour, Mondika Lamperth, officially invites her employees not at all to a Christmas celebration, but to the annual sound.
If you expect about 180 guests to be served with only coffee and pogatsche, then the celebration will take place with 350,000 Forint.
Self-administrative minister Gordon Bajnai with his colleagues will simply start in the aula of the ministry.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) organizes a Christmas celebration in its own festival hall, to which 436 employees are expected.
The expenditure was measured with 2,500 Forint per capita - for this money there is a buffet reception with subsequent launches.
Since the beginning of the term of office of János Veres, the PM staff have been celebrating in this way every year.
However, there will not be a proper party vote - not only because of the Minister's official speech but also because the celebration was started for the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture invites you to a New Year's reception on 20 January, this time the Ministry's Christmas celebration falls out.
The one hundred guests are invited to the Vajdahunyad Castle in the city park ("Városliget"); according to the information of the resort, the expenses are measured with 1,000 Forint per guest.
As the press department reports, it will receive a very simple stand, with foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary only.
The receptions, which are organised every year, traditionally begin with a short speech by the minister and sound like a sluggishing taste.
As the press offices on [origo] request report, neither the Ministry of Education nor the Ministry of Education will celebrate Christmas.
Asked for the cost of the Christmas celebration, no information could be provided to the press department of the Ministry of the Environment.
In any event, more than 400 guests were invited to the celebration, which is organized in the Art Industry Museum.
More and more forces mobilised for giant strike
The League of Trade Unions and the Hungarian Trade Union Federation will form their coordinating committee on Friday for the undetermined duration of the strike on Monday.
On Saturday, a large protest meeting will be held, on Monday - on the day of the referendum on the Health Insurance Act - the labour settlement begins.
It is expected that strike-related, significant traffic obstacles will occur, as rail transport is almost completely stopped, and Budapest public transport companies (BKVs) also stretch until 1 pm.
Details of the strike on Monday will be announced jointly by the League of Trade Unions and Trade Union Federation on Friday afternoon.
A LIGA - MOSZ strike committee is also set up which is responsible for coordinating the actions on Monday.
On Saturday a large-scale protest meeting will be held, and from Monday on, all the organizations that have joined the strike will set down the work for an indefinite period of time, provided that no agreement is reached with the government.
In other words, the end of the strike on the day of Parliament's vote on the Health Insurance Act was not defined.
If the National Council does not accept the Health Insurance Act, the trade unions will immediately withdraw the call for strike.
However, if the law is adopted, the strike committees meet to discuss further action.
On the basis of the agenda of the National Council on Monday, it is even possible that the vote on the Health Insurance Act will only take place in the later hours of the evening, or even at midnight.
The strikes that are beginning on Monday will have to be expected with significant traffic barriers: the railways will lay down their work for an indefinite period of time, and the morning will be the bulk of public transport and more than half of Volán companies will remain silent.
At the same time, there will be roadblocks in many places.
The call to strike has been followed by numerous trade unions and civil organizations - the list of participants is constantly updated on the League website.
Some organizations announced strikes for an indefinite period of time, others planning a temporary decommissioning of labour.
Until Thursday afternoon between the Hungarian Railway MÁV and the Free Trade Union of the Railways VDSZSZ have not yet been able to reach agreement on sufficient performance, although more and more people are travelling by rail just around the Christmas holidays.
According to previous reports, the BKV will be working for four hours from start-up to 1 pm, the Budapest Airport will be spread between 7 and 9 o'clock early, the LIGA trade unions for electricity and heat energy, and the teachers' union, for example, called for 2- and 2-8 hour strikes.
The Hungarian pharmacovigilance association strikes in various ways across the country, the EDDSZ, the Democratic Union of Health and Social Workers, a suborganisation of the SZEF, the Trade Union Cooperation Forum, holds a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four points required by the League is that the government withdraws the draft to reform health insurance and submits a new concept for social discourse.
The second is the gradual introduction of the new pension calculation model, which will be due from next year.
The claim number three is that the eligible occupational groups will be allowed access to the early retirement system before 2010.
The fourth point is that the VDSZSZ member of the League of Trade Unions has not accepted the offer submitted by the Ministry of Transport and now requires a new concept.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard Increases State Risk
According to the Risk Analysis Division (Risk Analysis Division) of Political Capital, the activities of the Hungarian Guards, founded in August, with the support of the "Move for a Better Hungary", have raised the risk of Hungary and the region in several respects.
The Institute's "Risikowarnungs-Report" states, among other things: in connection with the activities of the Hungarian Guard, the highest political risk is the "strengthening of the already existing ethnic tensions between the Gypsy and non-Gypsy population in Hungary, which could even lead to short-term violent ethnic conflicts".
The main reason for this is the Hungarian Guard's strategy, which is likely to lead to the provocation of such a conflict, says the research institute.
As reported, this is considered to be a failure from the political leaders: "People of public life have left the discussion of the Roma question to representatives of radical political groups who have now built their political strategy on the Roma-Hungary opposite".
One suspects that this would intensify the problem, make reasonable dialogue impossible, favour extremities, and increase the likelihood of violent conflicts.
The research institute also believes that the activities of the Hungarian Guard, not least thanks to the enormous attention of the local and foreign media, "has significantly damaged Hungary's image abroad, especially as regards confidence in stability and democratic maturity".
We remember: Since autumn 2006, the reorganisation of radical and extreme right groups in Hungary has been constantly in recovery, so that since summer 2007 several organisations called "national Self Defense Association" have been founded.
"These groups are common that they define themselves as a civil organization, while openly bragging to prepare their members on - sometimes armed - defence tasks (disaster protection, national defence, law enforcement), calling upon the impatience of the police, the army, or the state itself," it said.
And further: all of this is done in accordance with that method, which tries to camouflage various political and party-based efforts as a bourgeois initiative, based on the political and party persuasion of the population.
The emphasis on the civil character and the form of the association is not simply about circumventing legal obstacles that may arise in the course of registration at court - it is at the same time a political strategy.
As can be seen from the analysis, the activities of the Hungarian Guard represent a risk-elevating factor for relations with neighbouring countries.
"In recent months the Hungarian Guard has been cited as a potential source of danger in several neighbouring countries, according to some ultra-nationalist politicians of certain neighbouring countries, in the emergence of the Hungarian Guard sees the confirmation of its own anti-Hungary policy.
All of this has an impact on the political stability of the region" - it said.
From the point of view of the research institute, the establishment of the Hungarian Guard is not a single phenomenon in Central Eastern Europe, so the political risk for the whole region has grown.
As reported, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are comparable to those of the Bulgarian National Guard, whose foundation was announced in August 2007 by the far-right Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
In the background of the Bulgarian Guards, the Roma mass exorcisms that took place in a quarter of Sofia (Krasna Poljana) stood.
The BNU has taken the incidents right on the occasion of the establishment of the National Guard, with the argument that the aim of the organization of "national protection" is to be.
In her opinion, over the past 17 years, there has been a real "Gypsyterror" in Bulgaria, but the state remained unruly and indifferent - according to Political Capital.
Furthermore, the initiative would have begun a heated debate in the Bulgarian public.
As I said, the increased risk of ethnic conflict is also demonstrated by the fact that some Bulgarian Roma organisations have announced to set up their own guard for resistance purposes.
As the activities of the Hungarian Guard so far show many similarities with those of the Bulgarian National Guard, it is not excluded that the Hungarian Roma also react to the threats by organizing their own protection, according to the risk warning report of Political Capital.
Attila Juhász, Research Director at Political Capital, said on request of the news agency: The risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
Annual risk analysis reports would be published and risk-changed trends should be identified, public opinion will be informed as in the case of issuing the risk warning report.
Holidays are not everywhere holidays
In Hungary, holidays are precisely regulated by law, so that the practice of re-disposing the working days around the holidays has now become established, but the coming year gives us fewer days.
In the EU and in America, too, we understand something different by "Feiertag".
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes between state holidays and unemployed days.
Working days are mostly church holidays, or are related to significant historical events.
For example, we also celebrate New Year: both the last day of the old, and the first day of the new year are working days - the latter alone so that the New Year's New Year's parties can rest.
All year round, we have a total of fourteen holidays.
The State Day is the 15th of March, which commemorates the 1848 Revolution, and the 23rd of October, the Memorial of the 1956 Revolution.
On 20 August, the state foundation, celebrated on 1 May, is celebrated on 1st and 2nd November we commemorate our dead.
In addition, there are two holidays each for Easter, Pentecost, and Christmas.
Since our state, national or religious holidays rarely fall on a weekend, the practice of "work day shift" has proved itself in the cases where we would only work one day before or after the holiday.
The price of the extended weekends, however, is that we have to work at the Saturdays before, or go to school.
When this day, which falls before or after the holiday, is finally to be processed, the Minister of Labour has been defined in a separate regulation for a long time.
The legislation applies equally to all employers and employees, public employees and civil servants.
Only companies and facilities in which the operation is continued without interruption, i.e. on the holidays, are excluded.
Today, only the holidays at the end of the year only bring a little bit to light: from December 24th, the life of this country remains formal, since most of the days between Christmas and New Year's Eves compensate for time, or take their special leave.
In the next year, more holidays fall into the middle of the week, or to the end of the week, so that there will be fewer redundancies on working days than this year.
The calendar is first "set to the head" around the day of work, so that people can stay at home at the same time for four days.
Saturday, April 26 will be a working day so that Friday, May 2 can be a rest day.
The second redisposition is due to the holiday on October 23rd: On Saturday, October 18th, you will have to finish the Friday, October 24th.
However, the end of the year will remain in the mark of the holidays, after everything will be left and stopped from 24 December, even if New Year's Eve falls on a Wednesday.
Six dissuasive minors to make work colleagues annoyed
Emails that we forget to send, language news we never get - harmless lies that no longer notice us: they bring "color" into everyday life at work.
The question is whether one is accustomed to these small inconveniences, or is better faced with the challenge and tries to avoid these misunderstandings consciously for other annoying situations.
Tips.
"Sorry, I forgot to tell you that someone called from the marketing department" - says a colleague.
That one failed a meeting?
At best one regrets it and tries to make it right again, perhaps by calling and remorseful in the marketing department, one would have forgotten to send the message (this is the less common method).
Most of the time, it's done with an excuse.
Before one gets caught up in embarrassing excuses, one should consider what can really cause his colleagues unpleasant moments and try to avoid these situations consciously.
Something borrowed that doesn't belong to you yourself?
There's hardly anything worse than taking a document, office accessories, or a phone, but it's not there.
Yesterday, the driver was still on the desk - this morning it's gone?
Or is the lost ballpoint pen discovered on a colleague's desk?
Without question, you should not borrow from the colleagues, for they are rightly upset if they find that something has gone away.
So, don't put any envelopes or post-it out of the office in your pocket, because it could hit you yourself: none more, if you really need it.
Talk about the private life of the colleagues?
There is no effective means of stopping a trade that has already been put into the world.
Who's with who, what's going on?
Where and why?
You should not tie the information (or suspicions) about the private life of your colleagues to the nose if possible!
And if someone opens up and betrays us his innermost secret, we should not misuse this trust!
The best thing to do is to keep silent as a grave instead of correcting those who are not just present, even if others know about the problems of the colleague.
For no reason reported sick?
If you call the office to report sickly under appeal to tormenting headaches, because you just feel uncomfortable, or just want to rest, you should be aware of one thing: your own work, inexorable completions, projects with fixed appointments must now do the work of your colleagues instead of yourself.
So don't play bad with my colleagues!
If you already know the day before that you won't make it to the office the next day, or that something could come between, why you have to stay at home, you should report it in time for neither colleagues, nor the boss unexpectedly to be confronted with absence.
Total,Cooker, Telephone
You've just been deepened in his work, but is suddenly disturbed by the loud giggling of the ladies?
You don't want to hear a phone call that you shouldn't have heard?
One should not negate the colleagues with sums, singing, loud conversations (which one takes over their heads), tremors, constant shrinks or nostrils.
All of this can be very disturbing, even if they are not in depth just in a task (writing, planning, organizing).
Are the other guys always to blame?
If a project is not finished in time, you have forgotten to send an important letter or important messages, you should not look for the fault of your own forgetfulness with others!
If possible, don't talk about the chaos in the office or the loud colleagues!
It is best to admit his mistakes and apologize if others have been affected!
The question of how to fix the mistake or make up for the missed one is all too appropriate!
In the office - a feeling like at home?
Training pants and slumbers: Comfortable for home, but has lost nothing in the office!
Not even then should you dress so lower if it would actually allow the workplace!
Do not become too sloppy - you should respect both your colleagues and yourself so much that you dress yourself in the office accordingly - if desired, also pretty and elegant!
Everyone wants to do it right - or how to become uninteresting for others
Stop and go traffic, the car in the middle of the morning traffic.
From the radio sounds a strange melody: The sound of a violin paired with electronic effects.
I'm turning the volume up.
The pace changes, to the previous sounds comes the bass, and as a real sound jewel a female choir.
It is the song "Wings of Love" by Zagar, which sounds on mr2.
For a long time, the local music scene has not spoiled us with high-quality electrotope.
But now you even see the traffic jam differently when you hear Zagar's new album.
The appearance of Yonderboi, so many new and exciting productions from the domestic digital underground scene contribute slowly to a change in the overall image, and even if the garage rock with its guitars is "in" again, which proves native electropop: there are new ones under the sun.
Baláz's Zságer started in Pécs and even played in the band Yonderboi, before he started to walk his own way - perhaps because a host house does not bear two peppers.
The breakthrough with his project (Zagar) and his music, which melts elements from jazz, electronic, and pop, did not happen until he was approached with the request to compose the soundtrack to a film (e.g.
"Szezon" by Ferenc Török).
The formation, which initially appeared in smaller clubs, became known to the wider audience only when the magazine "wan2" scored its first album from 2002 among the top 50 domestic albums and Zagar, together with Yonderboi, was the most single trendetter, even in the West.
No doubt Zagar and his band were "trendy", but none of them was interested in wearing this brand.
The band has responded as it should: With a new, even better album.
This new album, entitled "Cannot Walk Fly Instead", could open up new ways for them, but the title already expresses the desire for continuity with the Pécser years.
The expression comes from the time when Baláz Zságer was still on the move with another band.
The airy, flying allusion would be okay, but besides the essential character of the music, the louder guitar, the influences of the Rock'n'Roll – corresponding to the zeitgeist and the trends – will occur.
With these songs, the singer György Ligeti, who lives in England and works with the band "The Puzzle", presented himself at the premiere in Millenáris.
A song from the album has even made it a radio striker - which has been broadcast since the latest from early to late pop music Mr2 Petőfi has gradually set the listeners with the song "Wings of Love", which was recorded with the participation of six local singers ("Underground Divas").
So it's all right (?).
The hvg.hu asked for information at Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: This new hit raises the question: To what extent is your music reserved for a certain layer?
Balázs Zságer: The term "Schichtmusik" doesn't mean much to me.
In my opinion, there are two boxes in pop music, not mainstream and underground, or alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
Even the so-called alternative or underground music can be silky and unspeakable, but they can also be produced only for sale, which makes them commercial music.
A good pop number can also come from an honest motive.
The reception willingness of the listener also works independently according to this principle, from languages and national borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference in the openness of the Hungarian and foreign audiences of your music?
B. Zs.: Pop music has a larger tradition abroad, especially in the west of us.
There, not only teenagers or Twens go on concerts, but also the older audience.
They are following the trends in pop music that are happening around them much more attentively, because they also consider it a part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the audience have in your work?
Is it important who, where, how many your music hears?
B. Zs.: Of course it is a good feeling to see that more and more come to our concerts.
But we've never composed for the market.
With us the music does not come about to serve a purpose, but for a certain reason.
The role of the audience is usually noticeable at the concerts, where there is already mutual interaction, but in turn there is only in the immeasurable changes of the moment.
But I noticed one thing: If you want to do it right, you're no longer interesting.
hvg.hu: How far do you want to follow the example of Yenderboi?
He is on his way as a soloist and has built his career in the west.
B. Zs.: We don't really go his way, not to say that you always try to interpret this into our music.
We see ourselves as a team player who rely on the musical presence of the other and let it unfold.
At the beginning, of course, comparisons of our work with that of Yenderboi were inevitable, as several of us came out of his band and took a different path.
hvg.hu: "Wings of Love" is the first place in the charts of mr2 Petőfi.
Many have only heard the name Zagar in connection with this number.
Was the opening consciously staged with a somewhat more popular style toward a wider audience?
B. Zs.: We didn't have any plans to write a hit that was supposed to be a train horse for the album.
This song is about more.
It was intended as the finale of the album that we wanted to solve the sound orgy and the slightly more difficult topics.
hvg.hu: How did you select the six female singers?
Why exactly them, what was the guiding principle?
B. Zs.: The basic idea was to make a gospel-like choir.
Then came the idea to assemble the choir from talented soloists of the local music scene.
This is how the six-person choir was created - that is, Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikő Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh - which we then baptized apatent "Underground Divas".
hvg.hu: Did you want the song to be the same, or did you make it with the girls?
B. Zs.: The number was in the instrumental version for a long time, but when the material for the album was finished, we thought that this number still needs something.
The sequence of chords has formally demanded a vocal voice.
I sang the melody that night, and later they taught the girls.
It all came practically on the edge and spontaneously spontaneous.
I remember, I was quite electrified back then, but the "divas" has already needed.
With my voice alone, the song would never have become so strong.
hvg.hu: But both on the record and during the concert you had the impression that the girls were in the background.
There is no solo part (except from the short solo of Judy Jay), they have no own role, they sing together completely and are not louder than the music, so their vocals are not only accompanied by the music.
They were also on stage behind.
Is it intention?
B.Z.: The fact that they stood behind was so because of purely technical problems.
However, we did not want to give them any solo roles.
The issue of the number is that you should forget your ego a little bit, forget who came from and where you're going, let's just allow us to lift up these certain wings, the wings of love.
I would like others to feel this euphoric state that we have felt when the song came into existence.
hvg.hu: Which was the most elaborate song?
B. Zs.: In the musical work, none of the work, there was more difficult tasks when mixing.
For example, for "Dorian Gray's Dilemma", where I play on a concert piano, or at "Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls", where the Groove didn't want to work any longer, but gradually everything went together, as at a puzzle.
hvg.hu: Which is your favorite song from the new album?
B. Zs.: This is changing continuously with the concerts and even now where I've "let go" the album.
At present, there are "Prophet Is A Fool", "Escape From The Earth" and the number "Never The Same".
Fraud brokers risked billions because of feelings of inferiority
Unsubstantiated fraud
This is how his former employees named Jerome Kerwelt of the French banking giant Société Générale, owner of the local Comerční banka.
It came for its part by nearly five billion euros.
But it seems rather that Kervel was just a big player who wanted to do it the same to his colleagues, and was certainly not capable of it.
In contrast to all large banking houses, he recognized the crisis in time on the American mortgage market.
"He is psychologically rather weak," was to be heard from the mouth of his superiors who showed him to the police.
But as is evident from the statements made by Kerwel, which the French media, for example the newspaper Le Monde, published, he was a human being who achieved profits of 1.6 billion euros in the end of last year with his business.
Crisis Not Just in America
"All I wanted was to earn money for my bank," he claims.
In summer, he was able to earn half a billion euros in the American crisis.
The opportunity he had already mentioned at the beginning of the year.
In February, there were already first news that so-called sub-prime mortgages, such as low-income customers or those who had already had problems paying off, would be in trouble.
However, influence on the whole economy should not have this crisis.
Ker much did not believe that and kept right.
At the end of the year, he had raised his profit to EUR 1.6 billion.
"Well, when I had earned the first half billion, I didn't know how to explain it," Kerver admits and continues, saying that he definitely didn't keep anything for himself.
During all the interrogation, he admits that he has faked documents so that they do not come to him on the slugs.
He even managed to keep his boss behind the light, even though the Eurex bosses were gradually interested in his business.
Risk benefit
He was afraid he was flying?
Hardly.
"I thought she was satisfied with the simple fact that I earned 1.6 billion for the bank."
How did he take the courage to risk that much?
He had to work out his position gradually.
He joined the Société Générale in 2000, immediately after completing his studies at the University of Lyon.
==References====External links==
After two years he was already an assistant to a broker and in 2005 he became an independent broker with an annual salary of 90000 dollars.
Nevertheless, he knew that he would never earn as much as others.
"At my first conversation in 2005, I knew I was watched.
Because of my training and also because of my professional and personal development," Kerwell explained to the investigating officers.
But soon after his entry, the first great success came.
With the shares of Allianz, he earned a lot by placing half a billion euros on the loss of course of this title during the London bombings.
And that was the trigger - now he wanted more.
As long as you win, we'll let you
"That's like a snowball," he told the police officer.
But the bosses allegedly knew of everything, or knew it.
"As long as I earned money, you closed your eyes."
But then the big blow came at the beginning of this year.
One day he lost a billion euros.
On a weekend in mid-January, he wanted to balance it.
When he got to work on Monday, he was no longer an employee of the bank.
And a few days later, the bank announced that it had lost five billion euros.
And how did they get to him?
He made himself suspicious by a vacation.
"I took only four days from the previous year.
A broker who doesn't take a vacation is one who doesn't want you to look at him in the cards," said Kerver, closing.
Czech Republic has the chance to reach 365 billion
Czech ministers and representatives of the European Commission signed a total of nine development programmes yesterday, allowing the Czech Republic to reach EUR 14 billion (about 365 billion) in the coming years.
It is about half the sum that the Czech Republic can get from Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
About 125 billion crowns come from seven regional development programmes.
Czech companies will be able to get about 100 billion crowns from the "Company and Innovation" programme.
Most of the money, about 150 billion, will flow into transport expansion.
The transport programme is the largest development programme and covers up to 22 percent of the funds that the Czech Republic can obtain from the Fund.
This money increases according to the budget of the State Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will have over 90.8 billion next year.
The "Company and Innovation" programme is intended to help entrepreneurs and companies win funds to innovative businesses.
In this way, companies are to win finances for the introduction of new technologies, for corporate research, but also for the introduction of more effective organisational methods.
In the previous EU funds, the Czech Republic is among the new candidate countries among the least successful so far.
Nicaraguan court confirms 20 years imprisonment for ex-Presidents
On Thursday, an appeal court in Nicaragua confirmed the 20-year imprisonment for former President Arnold Alemán, to whom he had been sentenced in 2003 for financial fraud of 100 million dollars (nearly 1.8 billion crowns).
But later he was released from prison and lived under house arrest on his Hazienda by the Micronesian metropolis.
Whether the former head of state (1997 to 2002) of this Central American state is back on grid, according to the news agency AP is currently unclear.
According to the Chairman of the Appeal Court, Ileana Pérez, it will now depend on the detainees whether you are leaving Alemán his punishment at home or whether he must be imprisoned.
A court held four years ago that Alemán had regularly transferred money from the government to accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These companies were fictitious and the accounts actually belonged to his relatives and closest followers.
Some of this money ended up in a fund that Alemán had set up to finance his 2001 election campaign.
Budget is through
Yeah, it's done.
The state budget is approved.
What is special about this budget?
It is the first budget that this government has designed and which was adopted by the coalition majority without the support of the opposition.
The year in question was approved with the support of the ČSSD (Social Democrats) because Minister Sobotka (of this party) had presented him and the ČSSD could not therefore allow him to reject him.
In contrast to the lively debate before the vote on the distrust request against the government, nothing dramatic happened this time.
The House of Deputies approved this traditionally little respectable, yet highly significant law at ease.
This is, in a way, paradoxical.
All government begins and ends with each chapter and item of the budget, whether or not you like it.
The budget is an essential part of the policy, but is concealed by the government's power struggle and opposition.
This is a more grateful subject for the media, and therefore they give him more attention.
A dispute among politicians is much more interesting to the public than sober numbers.
The state budgets of the past Social-Democratic governments were covered by three weaknesses which the 2008 budget cannot solve at once:
The first is the high proportion of expenditure required by law, which is not only pensions, but also social expenditure, which has decided the "silence-ending" coalition of ČSSD and KSČM (communists) last year before the elections.
The second is the deficit budgetary policy as a result of the first weakness.
The third restriction is in the deficits of public finances, i.e. the budget deficits of the municipalities.
The greatest risk, however, is not the government budget deficit.
This budget is publicly and in some ways under control.
However, a real time bomb is the budget deficit of the communities.
Many mayors, in addition to revenue from taxes, taxes and bank loans, often issued unthinked debt securities, which they overly indebted their town halls.
In recent years, they have succeeded in paying off these debts through mass sales of shares of energy and other supply networks which they had received from the State in the train of privatisation.
Now this source is already underway.
As far as we are concerned only with official and verifiable facts, we note that:
For a number of years now, like the rest of the world, our economy has been experiencing a growth phase, the ČSSD is famous without letup.
This was a unique opportunity for their governments to put public finances in order.
Instead, these governments owe the state even more.
Other countries, apart from a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have been far more reasonable than our Republic.
This is a great shame, which is primarily attributed to the former governments.
We are among the countries which, on a global scale, are at least at risk of poverty.
That is why no massive social programmes are necessary, unfortunately, in the last few years they have been very much inflated.
Although it has succeeded in deleting part of the absurd populist expenditure adopted this year before the elections, it is clear that if, in the near future, there is no shift in retirement age and pension reform, then virtually any policy in this country ends, and no matter who is in power, nothing will remain in his hands.
It is only easy to exaggerate if one says that then from ruling politicians become officials, who mechanically divide most of the tax revenue on pensions and social expenditure.
That is why this year's budget cannot be a revolution, but can only stop the pushing of normal expenditure through compulsory expenditure.
The deficit of 70 billion crowns planned for 2008 would be superfluous if previous governments had not spent over the last ten years, which only went.
If we do not want it really to happen that from ruling politicians we become purely administrative officials, then we must be patient and not overly strong coalition government, which is aware of the fact that the state can only spend as much as it is able to take in taxes and fees, want peace in preparing further reform laws.
Only these allow for the gradual implementation of a balanced state budget.

Banks want to deal with crisis
The US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the Central Banks of Great Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight the crisis on the financial markets together.
For example, more than 100 billion dollars will arrive on the monetary markets by means of auctions.
At these auctions, banks auction interest rates to which they are willing to lend each other money.
For example, the American Fed sends 40 billion dollars to auction, another 24 will loosen the European and Swiss central banks.
It is the first time after the attacks of September 11th that the central banks of each country agree on such a coordinated approach to the defence or mitigation of the consequences of a financial crisis.
"This step is intended to eliminate the greatest difficulties of the economy, i.e. the increasing lack of freely available capital that banks can grant," wrote his customers Bernard Baumohl from the consulting firm Economic Outlook Group.
"The coordinated action of the central banks has reduced the likelihood of a recession in the US from 65% to about 50%," added Baumohl in his report.
Banks have already lost around 60 billion dollars because of non-serviced loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts expect further billions of losses.
"The central banks must have been really afraid of what could happen when they decided to do so," said the chief economist of ABN Amro, Kieran Davies.
"It looks like the situation is really bad," he continued.
The central banks fear that if banks themselves have difficult access to bonds, loans to their customers will also become more expensive.
This would reduce consumption and plunge the American economy into recession, possibly with effects on economic growth around the world.
The central banks have decided to reduce the LIBOR so-called LIBOR, the London Interbank interest rate used in the sale of money between banks.
This means that the banks were constantly afraid to lend each other money, despite the fact that the US, Canada and Great Britain's central banks had reduced their interest rates several times during the autumn.
"This will have the same effect as a further reduction in interest rates," said Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting of the Reuters agency.
Some analysts believe that this step of the central banks contributes to the reheating of the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem, namely the case of the real estate market in the US.
Klaus: Debates of the ecologists are unbelievable
Global climate change is said to harm developing countries most.
President Václav Klaus spoke again on the issue of global warming.
The criticism now referred to Bali's final international conference on climate change.
In Vienna, where he presented his book "A Blue, Not a Green Planet", he stated that the debates of ecologists were unbelievable.
According to Klaus, not only is the structure of the conference unacceptable, which is a strange mix of government representatives and such of non-governmental organisations, but also the fundamental difference between rhetorics that accompany them, and reality.
"The debate there is unstructured, it is a word fireworks that is only substitute for a real solution to current problems," said Klaus.
The Czech President stressed in the presentation of his book that his topic was very important to him and that he was therefore so committed to it.
He also expressed his satisfaction that his book appeared in German translation because "I often encounter cartoons of my views."
Now, therefore, interested parties could read his attitude undistortedly.
Klaus recalled that he was not a climateist, but he felt that he had sufficient conditions to write such a book.
Finally, he was academic, capable of understanding and evaluating professional negotiations, had experience with statistics and was also more economic.
As the main expression of the book, he referred to the idea that the climate was constantly changing and that its changes were therefore normal, that there was no consensus among scientists on warming, that the consequences of current changes were not too large and serious and thus were no threat, and that efforts to influence climate development were unnecessary, ineffective and unacceptable.
Moreover, as one who has experience with totalitarian systems, he considers it unacceptable to impose other unproved views, he sees it as a dangerous restriction of freedom.
On questions asked by the present, he repeated that he was not against "a reasonable environmental protection, but against militant eco-activeists who did not consider the relationship between expenditure and earnings."
Klaus had already spoken about the same subject in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600000 people failed to change their driving licence
600000 drivers missed the time limit to change their old driving licence, the validity of which expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day where we can request the exchange so that the authorities can issue a new driving licence by the end of the year.
However, the Ministry does not fear that hundreds of thousands of drivers will be on the streets after New Year.
According to the authorities, mainly those who do not want to drive have not exchanged their licence.
While small towns report a strong decline in interest in the exchange of brochures, the offices of the capital are overburdened with applications, and the interest in the exchange grew this week.
The city administration processes around 2000 customers every day.
You have to stand for about half an hour.
In Prague about 140000 drivers have not yet exchanged their license.
The exhibition will take 20 days for a new driver's license.
But it is possible to apply for the exhibition with a reduced period of five days.
In this case, the driver must pay 500 crowns.
Automobiles who do not create the prescribed exchange until the end of the year and leave without a valid driver's license are threatened with a fine from January onwards.
The culprit pays a maximum of 2000 crowns.
The police, however, can also use an admonition to violate it.
In the event of a violation, the penalty may rise to 2500 crowns.
According to previous information, a punishment may also be imposed on the one of the congregation who does not drive at all.
He could, it was said, threaten a punishment of even 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry has already called on the offices to have a mild administration and to impose at most a penalty of 1,000 crowns.
According to Karel Hanzelka, the minister of transport spokesperson, but no one threatens a thousand crown sentence.
The driver's licence is a document for everyone to decide whether or not to own it.
It is not a question of a ID card that everyone, a valid one, must have.
People who don't want to drive anymore should give their driver's license.
It is sufficient to bring him to the competent municipal office or to send him there by registered letter.
At the end of the year driving licences issued between 1964 and 1993.
However, the drivers must gradually also exchange other types of driving licences.
People with driving licences from 1994 to 2000 still have three years for the exchange.
The validity of licences issued between 2001 and 2004 shall expire in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, it is about 2.6 million more driving licences.
Court lowers fines for detectives allied with Berdych
The former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Kořařík, who are accused of having made common cause with the band of David Berdych, received 13 or 10 years' imprisonment.
This was decided by the Prague Supreme Court in a judgment of law, which reduced its penalty by one or two years.
Originally, the detectives of "the Office for the Fight Against Organized Crime" threatened 14 and 12 years respectively.
There is no appeal against today's judgment, only revision of the Supreme Court is possible.
Berdych himself has been charged with this case, but the initial judgment is ahead of him.
In other processes, however, he had already received punishments of a total of 16 years.
More than that, he can't be sentenced.
In January 19 a district court spoke guilty mainly of being involved in robbery, the Oberlandesgericht negotiated the appeal of 16 of them today.
Most of the accused disputed the charge from the outset with the reason that it dealt with a constructed case.
According to the Central Bohemian District Court, police members, inter alia, gave Berdych criminals information from police sources, covered various robberys, and helped members of the gang to escape prosecution.
The band left Opava and Kořařík 30 percent of the prey for it.
The prosecution is about crimes committed by gangs from 1999 to 2001.
In particular, robbery, the victims of which often suffered serious injuries, as well as the presumption of office and the unauthorised possession of weapons.
In house searches, the police discovered illegal guns, ammunition with steel cores, a laser target tube and a machine gun.
According to the charge, the gang has enriched itself by many millions of crowns due to its robbery.
Apart from almost 20 men in this procedure, Berdych courts and a number of others were legally guilty of further robbery.
Other men from Berdych's circle have to take responsibility for another trial, and other cases have not yet been brought before the court.
To date, the main proceedings have been held by Tomáš Půta and Maroš Šulej, who are in Irish detention and who are waiting for the final decision on their extradition for prosecution in the Czech Republic.
Children exchanged - invoice: 12 million
For the exchange of children in a maternity hospital, the lawyer of the injured parents, Igor Veleba, wants to demand compensation from the hospital in Třebíč 12 million crowns plus court fees.
For each of the mothers three million, for the fathers each two million and for the children one million each.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200000 for each parent.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ondřej Dostál, is therefore not at all in agreement with the proposal Velebas.
"We reject such a proposal, it is too high a lot," said Dostál after today's negotiation.
"But in order to be able to make us an opinion on this counter-proposal, we need the opinion that the opposite has been drawn up.
We'll find out if it's even meaningful.
But we insist that this should be the case for all in the hundreds of thousands of years," Dostál stressed.
According to him, the amount should be between 100000 and 200000 crowns for each of the four parents.
In the beginning, she wanted to crown a million crowns for each month that she had not raised her biological daughter.
For Veleba, the basis for compensation negotiations was an opinion that had been prepared for him by the University Hospital in Prague Motol.
The parents of the children, in the opinion of specialists from the field of psychology and psychiatry, suffered mental damage and stress symptoms in different strengths and depths.
The men used the stress situation better, even if they saw accusations against them, they could have prevented the new-borns from being confused.
The women, in turn, cope with the consequences of the dream experienced worse, as well as with what is now happening, Veleba summarized the content.
Veronika and Nikola exchanged nurses at Třebíč's Retirement Hospital on 9 December last year.
Last week the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the Čermáks in Přibyslavice, and Veronica to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová to Jabloňov.
At the end of October, the District Commander of the Vysočina (Böhmisch-Mährische Höhe), handed over 100000 crowns to each family as a substitute for expenses incurred by the fault of the Třebíč hospital under the district.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are insured by law for liability.
In the event of a doubt, they must access a reserve fund, only in exceptional cases can they apply for assistance from the institution.
The courts have previously agreed to comparatively low amounts of compensation, the amounts were determined by tables and moved in the area of hundreds of thousands, with the exception of millions.
Polívka came to his Kingdom of Walachei
Bolek Polívka lost the fight for the "Kingdom Walachei".
According to the judge at the District Court in Ostrava, he was the first to use the term "Walachian King", but in many years of work the project had built a team around Tomáš Harabiš in collaboration with the actor.
Polívka did not participate in the negotiations today.
According to his lawyer, however, the case is probably not terminated and his client will probably appeal.
"The dispute is about Mr. Harabiš and his team wanting to participate in the popularity of Bolek Polívka's parasitic," said Polívka's lawyer after the trial.
In the words "Walachisches Kingdom" everyone presented himself to these actors and comedians.
The same opinion is also Harabiš.
"We have almost ten years of work behind us.
Creating money and concepts of activities," he said.
According to him, the occasion is disputed for money.
"After years, they noticed that the project was successful and that they could have something of it.
They want to gain parasitic in our work," he continued.
Lucrative Business
According to the court, Polívka used the name "Valachian King" for the first time in one of his television programmes.
In 1993 the actor Radoslav Brzobohatý crowned him.
At that time, however, this did not go along with the intention of establishing a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš came up with the idea of spending Welsh passports.
A business and entrepreneurial activity became crystallized out of an original fun action, which Harabiš then joined with the establishment of the company "Walachisches Gereich".
In 1997, Polívka agreed to the use of his name and signature in the passes and even offered discounts to their owners when visiting his farm and theatre.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge also suggested today that Harabiš used only the idea that Polívka had made public in the "Manege" broadcast for his entrepreneurial intentions.
"The popularity of Polívkas has certainly helped the project of the Welsh kingdom," said the judge.
She added, however, that the soul of the Harabiš project and his team had been dedicated to him intensively.
The cooperation of today's disbanded parties lasted until 2000, when Harabiš organized the official coronation for Polívka in Vsetín.
Since then, however, the disputes between Polívka and Harabiš began to accumulate, culminating in the "King of Boleslav I" until the Sankt-Nimmerleins Day.
Harabišs Jarmila Šuláková, a queen's mother, took the lead.
In 2002, Polívka filed an appeal against Harabiš and his company, which the court rejected today.
The battle prepared by Harabiš could bring clarity to the throne and half a princess.
This was to result in a new king.
Details and an appointment he didn't want to reveal yet.
"We don't want to rush anything.
It was supposed to be something like the king's move in the Walachei.
The king was to be elected for a certain period of time.
Mr Polívka can also register quietly," added Harabiš.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VT: Disadvantages disappear
To tell the truth, I was never a special fan of Peugeot 206.
His driving characteristics were not worth much, the quality of the gear circuit, the steering and also the processing could be described as rather below average.
But now his successor, the Peugeot 207, is on the market, and he is much better.
The combination with the name SW is still a bit further, and I only remain to review my opinion.
When I tested the classic Hatchback of the 207, I had to complain about the too low headroom on the back seats, for example.
These complaints are no longer available, as the body of the combi is designed in such a way that not even two-meter men will suffer.
Quickly Continue
I'm just going through the interior, so I can't repeat too much.
It is a quite successful design, where I only object because of the cool middle tunnel.
Since I would welcome a little more designer design, where the car otherwise makes such an elegant impression.
The seats are comfortable, and past are the times where we may be appalling ourselves over too short seats or headrests.
The page content has also improved significantly compared to the 206.
As far as the space range is concerned, you can also feel the enlarged dimensions of the body.
In combination, the already mentioned lack of headroom freedom has also been eliminated.
Victims in the trunk
The main thing about this car is the cargo compartment.
I have to call that very easy and space-saving (also because of the folding back window).
The hollow rooms are equipped with locks that represent an ideal compromise.
They don't disturb, can pull apart and hold even heavier objects.
But let's talk about the load volume.
According to the table in basic equipment, it is 428 litres, which is an average value compared to the competition.
However, not compared to the best sold vehicle of this class in the Czech Republic, the Škoda Fabia Combi.
When we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the product from Mladá Boleslav, we note that the Peugeot remains by clearly noticeable 52 litres.
This value is already critical for a stay abroad or when loading a stroller.
But in order to highlight the positives, I still have to mention the flat loading space or the very low loading edge after the folding of the rear seats.
120 hp in four rows
Our test car was equipped with a four-cylinder petrol engine with engine capacity of 1.6 litres and a power of 88 kWp.
And honestly, that's how a 1600-cubic engine should look that drives a family hackback.
He's quiet, has a low consumption and pulls away well.
If I compare him with his counterpart at Škoda, who sometimes acts as if his exhaust were stuffed with a rag, then I can only be enthusiastic about him.
The price list speaks volumes
The price of this car is not very popular.
We must remember, however, that we have tested a well-equipped car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with the 1400 petrol engine of 329900 crowns is still on the rise.
With our engine it costs from 410900 crowns, which is quite a lot.
The equipment Premium of the test car is added to the beech with 80000 crowns.
However, we had airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic wiper trigger, electric window lifts at the back and...
This is how the car costs simple 531900 crowns.
That's a lot, but you'll figure out the additional equipment of a Fabia and you'll get a very similar sum.
So only the choice of brand remains.
Integration of Slovak students in British schools is not possible
At British schools, the number of children from countries of Eastern Europe is increasing, resulting in local fears for the further development of local education.
To date, the integration of Eastern Europeans is facing a number of obstacles.
British schools even identify cases where disputes between immigrants and the children of the original inhabitants increase in violence.
The problem with the integration of children from Eastern Europe into British schools is well illustrated in the case of North Kent, where the disputes between the locals and Slovak immigrants gradually increase.
Disputes, shocks and robbery among students have shifted to relationships between parents.
The situation has developed so far that the police in Chatham arrested a Slovak woman who had beaten a ten-year-old boy with an iron rod.
The accused defended that the boy had insulted her with racist insults.
The police also had to intervene on a Slovak immigrant after an attack of two minors.
The girls had allegedly made racist remarks to the man and had cast stones on him.
"When we went home, a boy climbed onto a bus house and spit on us.
When I told him to stop, he recruited us with apples and pears and then exposed his buttocks," a mother of Slovak students from The Times described another unpleasant incident.
Complaints come from both sides.
One of the locals even referred to the struggle with the immigrants from Eastern Europe as a struggle for survival.
The cases cited testify that the mood between locals and immigrants in British schools is becoming ever more tense.
In the UK, 70000 Slovaks have been reported to come here looking for work.
Thus, some 30,000 Slovak students attend British schools.
Cuba - the most beautiful island of the Caribbean
For visitors it is really an island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your holiday, that will be true if you select only the right thing.
Golden and white beaches, high waves or a sea that is quiet like a pond.
Palms and All Inclusive with waiters offering on the beach pizza, ice cream and bewildering cocktails.
Kitesurfing, Golf and Roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean you will find this to an abundant degree.
Only on one island you will find much more, and this island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Big Antilles.
At the time of the Spaniards Cuba was their bastion for the conquest of America.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place a human eye has ever seen.
Havana became a camp or transit camp of treasures that the Spaniards had robbed in America and then transported to Europe.
And then came the American epoch.
The Nacional Hotel was built at the end of the 20th century.
It was one of the chiefs of the American Mafia, Lucky Luciano, because everything in the USA was considered to be crimes (especially during the prohibition), was gladly seen and supported in Cuba - drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were among others.
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, high-rises grew, and the wide boulevards drove cars that were among the cult symbols of the fifties of the last century.
Ernest Hemingway bought himself an estate in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojímar he had his yacht.
On the walls of Bodeguita del Medio, stars of the show business and politicians from all over America left their signatures.
And today?
You can also leave your autograph on the walls of the Bodeguita of Havana.
At the bar at Hotel Nacional you mix cocktails as desired.
And the 50's cult cars are going around in Havana to this day, because the once imported Schigulis and Fiats have long been separated in the salty and moist air.
May Havana, in particular its oldest part, have come down strongly, nowhere can one find in the circle as many wonderful colonial sights as here.
Other places are being washed out, for example Trinidad.
In view of the urgent need for money from tourism, there was a green light for this development.
In the last fifteen years new hotels have emerged not only in Havana, but also in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holguín and also on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a Marotte, which is unique in the world and attracts especially railway lovers.
The sugar cane of remote plantations brought steam and the same driven narrow trackways to the sugar factories.
Their fleet has not been renewed for decades, so you can see clean and fully functioning locomotives, whose peers are standing in the museum for a long time.
Trip destinations
The most important places do not leave the majority of visitors Cuba.
So you don't have to write about Varadero or Havana in detail.
Just keep mentioning that there is a museum in Hemingways, already mentioned, whose visit should not be missed by anyone who likes this writer.
The Viñales valley in the west of the island is one of the most picturesque corner of Cuba.
The lush vegetation grows on the floor of the lime.
Mogotas, limestone and rock, rise steeply from the bottom of the valley, in their hollow rooms, gathered fertile soil, which also covered weathered rock areas of dense growth.
This valley is where perhaps the best Cuban tobacco is grown.
In its final form, you can meet him when you visit one of Havana's cigar factories.
It may also seem interesting to some that the Chilean episode of the television series "Major Zeman" was filmed there.
Trinidad
An ancient city was founded shortly after the Spanish colonized the island.
Fame and riches brought her the trade of slaves and sugar.
Wealth was embodied in the beautiful beauty of the small town.
The Spanish colonial architecture, strongly influenced by the later French settlers, has hardly changed for four hundred years.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the Escambray Mountains, is such a remote place that in the 1950s there was no road that connected the area with the rest of the country.
This isolation contributed to the fact that it remained unnoticed.
Nothing was built there, but therefore nothing was torn down, everyone was glad that he had a roof over his head.
If you have more than one afternoon time for Trinidad, it is worth watching interesting places in the area, such as the beach Playa Ancón or the "Tal of the sugar factories".
In the evening you should go to the Casa de la Música, which lives after the darkness, and where the music does not keep silent until the morning.
Baracoa
This small town in the eastern part of Cuba is some of the most beautiful of the island.
Surely this view is also influenced by the way there.
Both roads, which lead from Guantánamo there, have to overcome high and crumbled mountains and pass through a landscape that is hardly touched by human intervention.
Thanks to the unspoiled nature there, UNESCO included this eastern outpost of Cuba into its world heritage directory.
There the best chocolate is produced, in the church you will see the cross of Columbus (in reality it was created about a hundred years after the rides of Columbus), and from the hill, where the former castle, the present El Castillo Hotel, is located, several table mountains of which El Yunque is the best known.
About the coffee, the rum, the cigars, the Sierra Maestra mountains, the pig bay and the island of Isla de Pinos, over the Tropicana cabaret, the sanctuary of the Cuban patron Caridad del Cobre, over the Santeria, an African religion to which the descendants of slaves confess, one could write about all this about many pages.
But, as you say, look better with your own eyes.
Allys in Afghanistan are passive, claim Americans.
Too few soldiers and the lack of necessary equipment affect the United States, according to the course of the mission in Afghanistan.
NATO should, in the words of Minister of Defense Robert Gates, design a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan did not follow their expectations, and the representatives of the countries that stationed units in the south of the country were agreed in Edinburgh in Scottish Edinburgh.
In addition to the growing resistance of the Taliban side, the eight participating states are also discussing further coordination plans among the allies.
While the United States, through its defence minister Robert Gates, called the NATO units to more activity, Britain sees the priority in strengthening the authority of the Afghan government and in the intensification of development aid.
"In Afghanistan, forward development is noticeable, but military power can only be part of the solution.
Another part is to enable the inhabitants to start their own economic development and security," says British defence minister Des Browne of the BBC.
Ninety percent
The activity of Afghan insurgents has, according to the US Army, reached the highest level for five years.
The number of acts of violence rose by 27 per cent compared to the previous year, in the southern province of Helmand even by sixty per cent.
The NATO countries have stationed about 40,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, of which about a quarter are located in the southern territory.
According to the United States, however, allies have reached an absolute limit on the organization and equipment of the units.
In concrete terms, they demand additional helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan units.
"We will have to think seriously about the concrete goals for the next time and how we can achieve them," Gates said.
Similarly today, the Secretary-General of NATO, Jaap de Hoop, spoke.
"I'm not happy about what we have available in Afghanistan to land and air.
We have about ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment we need, and that's too little," said De Hoop of the Reuters Agency for the conclusion of three-day talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
In recent months, there has also been disputes among the countries involved about whether all allies in Afghanistan are doing their best.
Germany, for example, has been criticized for being passive.
"The Germans are relatively numerous in Afghanistan.
But they are stationed in areas where there is only a minimum of violence and the fighting requirements for them are not as high as for us in the southern and eastern part of the country," said Gates.
The British boulevard newspaper "Sun" called the German soldiers lazy this week.
"The Germans are making games while our boys are fighting," wrote the "Sun" in a contribution, which was supplemented by photos of German soldiers, to play the table tennis.
The German picture newspaper went on to counter-attack and printed a picture of a British unit in a rugby competition in southern Afghanistan.
Government debt will accelerate to a trillion in 2009
In each Czech, a state debt of 84000 kroners is incurred.
Total debt rose to 842.7 billion crowns by the end of September.
The government had planned to go into debt this year with 159.2 billion cash.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion thanks to the better development of state budgetary policy.
The government debt of the Czech Republic rose to 842.7 billion crowns by the end of September.
Within the first nine months of this year, they rose by 40.2 billion.
However, they have been falling by 13.4 billion since June.
The Ministry of Finance thus confirmed its state debt figures from early October.
In each Czech, a debt of 84000 crowns falls.
Over the last year, the state was indebted by more than 111 billion crowns.
"Until now it seems that, thanks to the lower deficit for the coming year, we may only exceed the limit of a trillion crown in 2009.
Next year, the debt should move between 900 billion and a trillion crown," said David Marek, analyst of Patria Finance, the server iHNed.cz.
In a similar way, Vladimír Pikora, analyst of Next Finance, sees it: "We could come to the excess of a trillion in the course of 2009.
When exactly, depends on the next budget that we do not yet know.
If it turns out that the situation on the political stage is changing, and politicians should be more willing to save, it could last until 2010.
But I am not going out of such a change," he noted.
Growing Debt
The government debt stems from the debt of the state government and comes mainly from the accumulation of deficits of the state budget.
The government debt is financed by financial statements, government bonds, direct bonds or, for example, bonds from the European Investment Bank.
Domestic government debt has now risen to 719.4 billion crowns this year.
In the meantime, foreign debt rose by 1.7 billion crowns to 123.3 billion.
The so-called marketable government debt reached 803.3 billion crowns at the end of September and has fallen by 13.7 billion since June.
The average maturity of government debt rose to 6.5 years.
"Over the year from the first to the third quarter, total debt increased by 13 percent, which is really much in view of how good the economy is.
It is interesting to note that growth is mainly recorded in debt securities, where the increase is 20 percent.
It's bad that the debt is rising, but on the other hand, this shows that you can do something before the pension reform comes," Pikora commented on the data.
Better Than Expected
The financing strategy and the management of public debt for 2007 show that the government had planned to include 159.2 billion crowns for this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion crowns thanks to the improved development of state budgetary policy.
This amount is mainly due to the government budget deficit, which will obviously reach 76 billion crowns this year instead of the estimated 91.3 billion.
It is also a maximum budget for the consolidation agency of 13.3 billion kroner, a ten-billion reserve for the payment of pensions, the financing of government bonds for 43 billion, and the rates for borrowing to the European Investment Bank of 1.8 billion.
For giving a name to a teddy bear, she was presented to a court in Khartoum today.
According to her lawyer, the British teacher, who had been accused in Sudan for insulting Islam, was sentenced to 15 days in prison by a court in Khartoum on Thursday evening and then expelled.
The British was accused of allowing six to seven-year-olds to give a teddy bear the name Mahomet, although any representation of the Islamic prophet is forbidden.
She deserved to be whipped out.
After parents of students had complained several times to the Sudanese Ministry of Culture, the 54-year-old primary school teacher, who worked at the Unity High School of Khartoum, was at home on Sunday and accused of insulting Islam in accordance with Article 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code.
In fact, this matter begins in September when the teacher asked her six to seven-year-old students to choose a name for the class-teddy.
The children suggest eight names, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed, reports headmaster Robert Boules.
Finally, as the class vote, 20 of 23 children choose Muhammad as the favorite first names.
Certainly, Muhammad is the name of the Islamic prophet, but above all a very common first name in Sudan.
Then the children have created a book for the class, with the photo of the bear on it and the caption My name is Muhammad.
The bear itself did not bear a sign with this name, but the problem is quite simple that the representation of the Islamic prophet is considered an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbon’s Muslim colleagues, who taught at the same school in Sudan, explained that he knew them well, and she would never have done anything to get too close to a religious faith, I only regret that she asked the children to vote for a name, his opinion was just an innocent mistake.
An opinion shared by many students of the teacher who describe them as very attentive to their students and as a person who never speaks about religion in class.
Consider that the first name Muhammad is also the second most common in Britain, for which 14 different spellings exist in English.
This name, often chosen by Muslim families, is considered to be a kind of honor to the prophets (often given to the firstborn of a family).
But what are the rules in relation to the use of this first name?
Can you give him a toy, for example?
This is, of course, a question of interpretation.
On Wednesday, no agreement was reached on the future status of the province at the last negotiating meeting in Vienna.
At the end of the failure
The Serbs and Albanians from Kosovo ended a sixth and final discussion meeting on Wednesday in Baden, Austria, without being able to overcome their controversy over the future status of the separatist province.
It is regrettable that the parties were unable to reach an agreement on the status, said European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger at a press conference in Vienna.
Emphasizing that peace is at stake in the region, Frank Wilsner Belgrade and Pristina, his American counterpart, called for their commitments to maintain peace and for talks to continue beyond the end of the negotiations.
No violence is expected in the immediate future, but at the beginning of a very difficult time , he added and indicated that there are quite clear tensions.
End of mediation on 10 December
The mediators of the Troika, which unite the European Union, the USA and Russia, will meet last Monday in Serbia and Kosovo.
The future of the province inhabited by 90% of Albanian speakers could become clearer if Ischinger, Wilsner and the Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko submit their report to the UN Security Council by 10 December.
The talks of Baden, near Vienna, formed the sixth and last negotiating session since the Troika last August from the UN had received the task of a new mediation.
Americans and Europeans expect their mediation mission to end on 10 December.
The Russians, who have already blocked the approval of Kosovo's independence at the Security Council, insist on continuing negotiations beyond that end date.
Russia was and remains a advocate of a negotiated solution, a common solution, said Botsane-Khartchenko.
One-sided Declaration of Independence?
After being under UN administration for eight years, the Western countries hold independence under EU supervision for the only future solution.
Pristina is ready to announce this one-sided if the Security Council does not decide in its favor.
Belgrade is based on stronger autonomy
Unfortunately, no agreement could be reached , the president of Kosovo's autonomous authority, Fatmir Sejdiu, announced at the Baden hotel where these negotiations were the last to take place since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former leader of the cosovarian rebellion and future Prime Minister of the province shared his regret.
He added, however, that the plan proposed by Belgrade belonged to the autonomy of a past which led to murders and deportations.
Domino effect
The Serbian President Boris Tradic, on the other hand, considered that a compromise should always be sought, and warned the Albanian majority from Kosovo of the consequences of a one-sided declaration of independence of the province.
Belgrade believes that it is a "domino effect" in a region that is still weakened by the wars of independence of the 1990s.
For Serbia this does not mean that compromise would be impossible, he said.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that any decision will be taken only in the Security Council, where its Russian ally has a veto right.
The Kosovo Parliament will have the last word.
Only one decision from the Security Council is acceptable to Serbia, explained Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
These negotiations took two years.
They must end as they started: at the Security Council.
Fatmir Sejdiu replied that Kosovo's Parliament would have the final word on the status and added that any unilateral declaration of independence would be issued by the Albanian speaking population in agreement with the Western countries.
Bush draws an agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
At the opening of the International Peace Conference, which met on Tuesday under its leadership in Annapolis, Maryland, President Bush announced that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed to a joint declaration.
He further stated that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to start negotiations immediately to find a final settlement of the 60-year-old disputes between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men Bush promised that he would do everything to help them to conclude a peace agreement by the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, the Palestinians must destroy the terrorist infrastructures and Israel must cease its colonisation work, Bush explained, reminding the two parties of their commitments in respect of the road map for peace which they had agreed to in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian authorities under Abba's last end sought a peace agreement that would clarify all open questions without exception, and including the central issues.
This designation includes the three major problems that the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians is mainly about: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees, which were expelled from their home country, which is in the present state of Israel in 1948.
According to the U.S. president, Abbas spoke and insisted that the negotiations to come will be conducted in full and thorough terms and provide a regulation for all points, including Jerusalem, the refugees, the borders, colonies, water and security.
When Olmert took the floor, he committed himself to the immediate and without interruption of the forthcoming ceasefire negotiations and to the efforts to end them before the end of 2008.
Bush set the deadline for the implementation of its vision of two states , a Palestinian and an Israeli that co-exist for the end of 2008.
Saudi Arabia has revealed that it has received from Bush a guarantee in this sense from Bush before it decided to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a great success for Washington, has launched a plan adopted by all Arab countries that offers Israel peace, in exchange with its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the war of 1967, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis is a crossroads in the history of the Middle Orient, especially because it affects the roots of the conflict and its central points of view, says the Saudi Prince in his interview with the Arab-speaking daily newspaper financed by Saudi Money.
According to the prosecutor, the police are not responsible
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As always with this type of local news, official versions and rumors are opposite.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first results of the investigations of the National Disciplinary Authority of the Police (IGPN), a police car on Sunday, shortly after 5 p.m., drove to the Rue Louise-Michel direction Villiers-le-Bel.
He had no use, but was on stress, and drove at 40-50 km/h, without blue light, explained a police spokesman.
A green motorcycle of the brand Kawasaki, without approval, thus not released for public transport (see below), came, controlled by two young people without helmet, hit at very high speed.
It rammed the left side of the police car after it had ignored its drive from the right, a police officer continued.
Alcohol control carried out in vehicle passengers is very negative.
The condition of the car (forged wing, split windscreen, torn-off punch) testifies to the frequency of the impact.
Very quickly, as early as yesterday, the prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérèse de Givry announced that she had entrusted the IGPN with an investigation on the "facts of the involuntary person murder and the lack of assistance to persons in danger", in agreement with the main government for public security of Val-d`Oise.
In the afternoon, on the occasion of a press conference, the prosecutor stated that she was excluding the police from investigating the IGPN at this stage.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses of the accident that had been heard on Sunday evening confirmed the version of the police, namely that this mini-power wheel has reached its left side relatively quickly.
Yesterday, some kind of riots showed, certainly caused by the friction of the footrests on the ground that the two vehicles had been cut apart until the police managed to brake.
The vehicles have been confiscated and will be subject to a technical review.
The body names of the two victims were observed yesterday.
What happened next?
Yesterday, in Villiers-le-Bel, a rumor quickly made the round, as a result of which the police had left the accident site very quickly, and without helping the two young people.
Although the IGPN remains very cautious, it would exclude this matter concerning any serious error as well.
According to a police source , this is a difficult aspect of the investigations needed for further investigations and very careful action .
Libération has taken a witness of these few moments after the accident.
From one of his windows he had direct views of the scene.
We immediately went out with my cousin, who is a nurse in the hospital, to try to revive her, this witness tells me.
There was nothing to do.
Then he saw a totally disturbed cop who was limping.
Two other attempts were made to revive one of the young people who made the fourth telephone calls.
In view of the tensions that had taken place quickly and, as it seems, because of the certainty that those present had about the unexpected situation of young people, the police officers from colleagues who arrived at the site of the accident were taken in the car.
Still, according to this testimony, the rescue forces arrived about twenty minutes after the police left.
They also used heart massages, but in vain.
I'm not going to let the police say they didn't help the youth.
These young people have been given first aid.
The fire brigade came right away.
Everything was done to try to save her, the prosecutor emphasized.
Pakistan’s Voltage Increases
On Monday, the Pakistani police beat down the first demonstrations, since two days earlier the General Musharraf had been declared the emergency.
According to testimonies, in the city of Lahore in the east of the country, about 2,000 lawyers who demonstrated measures taken against the emergency were injured by the tears of gas grenades used by the forces there.
Those guys threw stones with which they injured the police.
At least 350 lawyers were temporarily arrested.
There were similar scenarios in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where policemen attacked and wounded lawyers.
Several would have been temporarily arrested.
In Islamabad the lawyers of the Supreme Court's attorneys have called for a general strike and announced demonstrations as a result of a wave of about 500 arrests of oppositionists, human rights lawyers and lawyers during the weekend.
Monday morning the streets leading to the Supreme Court had been blocked to prevent the assembly.
Further demonstrations had been held in Multan (Mitte) and Peshawar (Nordosten).
On Monday the attorney movement received the support of the religious parties united in the powerful alliance of Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, whose president urged the people to send flowers to the judges who spoke against the emergency, and to those who took an oath before Musharraf.
Musharraf's promise no longer applies
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly affected by the special measure announced on Saturday evening.
In the following days, he had to refer to the legality of President Musharraf's re-election in a direct election on 6 October.
The President of the Court of Justice, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was dismissed and replaced.
All that we represent is illegal, anti-constitutional and contrary to the decisions of the Supreme Court, explained the Magistrate of the newspaper The News.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to issue the command over the army and become a civilian president is no longer valid since the emergency was called, stated on Monday by the Deputy Minister for Information Tariq Azeem.
It was expected that he would surrender his military uniform until 15 November, date when his first term of office ended as president.
The Deputy Minister for Information has also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
The Pakistani government also denied the rumours that were persistent in the country, according to which President Musharraf had been assigned a residence by his deputy army leader.
More than a third of the pregnancies are still not planned
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%), as well as poor planned or unforeseen births.
Even today, 40 years after the adoption of the Neuwirth Act, which allowed contraception in France, one of three pregnancies (36%) is not planned, as a study by the National Institute for Demographic Studies (Ined) shows.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%), as well as poor planned or unforeseen births.
Ined estimates that the various methods of contraception such as the pill or spiral still have a 5-6% failure rate.
According to the Institute, which notes that the percentage of pill users aged 20 to 40 years who use the pill has increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today, the liberalisation of contraception has nevertheless made it possible to improve the control of fertility.
Today, eight of ten births are carefully planned.
With one in five pairs even calculated on the month exactly, and, if possible, in spring, the season in which it seems most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repair at the space station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and his comrades from the occupation of the International Space Station (ISS) will have needed more than seven hours in space to perform the spectacular repair of a defective solar collector that is essential for the continuation of scientific work at the station.
A risky exit, which, due to its duration, the removal of habitable modules, the speed with which it was organized, and the tools set by the astronauts to perform the repair, has achieved several records.
The problem occurred on Wednesday, when the astronauts had discharged Harmony module from the spacecraft Discovery, a large cylindrical part that is soon to take up the European and Japanese scientific laboratories.
This module is a kind of landing bridge for the module laboratory.
But you have to be able to supply them with electricity.
The second task of the crew was to implement a 17.5 tons heavy module for electricity generation through solar collectors already on the ISS to bring it into its final position.
After moving it, the crew took part in the restructuring of the solar panels of the module, whose span is 76 meters.
And it happened that one of the collectors that could be folded like accordeons was damaged by a clamped cable on a length of about one meter
The restructuring was stopped to stop damaging the collector.
The astronauts who originally left the space route Discovery for a control and then were to repair another solar collector whose rotational system was in error, saw themselves forced to dedicate themselves to the damaged collector.
And Scott Parazynski was selected to walk around at the end of the 30-metre-long remote control arm of the space ferry, which had been installed at the station to carry out the repair.
He is one of NASA's best spacewalkers.
Large, resistant, very clever, he has a well developed upper body and long arms.
The 46-year-old doctor was therefore chosen to operate the injured solar collector.
After carefully evaluating the damage, he cut through the faulty cable and fixed some kind of rail on the damaged spot.
He was supported by a second spacewalker who stayed near the lock, and, inside, by the other astronauts, among them Peggy Whitson, commander of the crew.
The tool he used, a mini-hockey racket, wrapped with insulator to prevent an electric blow on the solar collectors that produce several hundred volts, had the astronauts on board the station thought out and crafted.
When the action ended, Scott Parazynski waited until the collector was completely folded before he counted his tools and returned to the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts enjoyed half a day of relaxation before today seven astronauts returned to the spacecraft Discovery to arrive at the return flight to Earth.
The title of EADS on the stock exchange sanctioned
After the aviation and defence group has announced that it will have to spend between EUR 1.2 and 1.4 billion in order to counter the residues of the A400M, the EADS share shows a significant decline on the Paris Stock Exchange at the moment.
EADS currently loses 4% to EUR 21.96 on the Paris Stock Exchange.
The Group was forced to review its 2007 business forecasts once again in relation to the residues caused by the slow-moving development of the A400M engine, which delayed the aircraft’s young flight.
The costs announced in October to compensate for the delay in the delivery of their military transport aircraft amounted to between EUR 1.2 and 1.4 billion, of which more than one billion for Airbus, announced the European manufacturer EADS's parent group.
Based on these costs, EADS will be forced to announce new operational performance targets (EBIT) for 2007 in the presentation of its quarterly results next Thursday, and it added without further detailed specifications.
The Group also states that the assessment of the new costs is related to the six-month residue.
As a reminder, the EADS’ business performance has fallen of 86% in 2006, significantly due to the costs associated with the delay of another program, the very large carrier aircraft A380.
Originally, the group had planned a first delivery of A400M to the French army for October 2009.
The Choice of the Status Quo
On Sunday, it will not be exciting in the counting of the urns: the mass of the Russians will decide for President Putin's party, United Russia.
After a very locked election campaign, she confirms her desire for stability, even authoritarianism.
Three days before the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin sends a message broadcast to the public by the voters, who have already been recorded, but whose content is kept secret.
He does so in his capacity as the leader of the United Russia, the pro-Kreml party, for which an overwhelming victory announces itself.
Yesterday, the President made nothing clear when he received the foreign ambassadors, and he was content to deliver a new attack on the Western Powers accused of interference - his favorite theme during the campaign.
We know the prize of true democracy and hope for honest elections, extremely transparent and open, elections without fraud, he added.
From the point of view of the opposition, they have lost their minds there.
She's suspenseing a campaign that's contaminated by oppression.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says that there would never have been such dirty elections, even in the time of Eltsin.
After the suppression of the demonstrations last weekend, ex-Schach World Champion Garry Kasparovder had been sentenced to five days in prison for unauthorized demonstrations, according to his lawyer, continued to ban visitors.
The Russians have preserved the mentality of Homo Sovieticus
After these parliamentary elections, two far-reaching questions arise:
Who will take Putin's successor as president?
The official newspaper announced yesterday the date of the first election of the presidential elections, 2 March 2008; the candidates have time to make themselves known by 23 December.
Since he was elected in 2000 and was re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot stand for a third consecutive mandate.
And now there is no successor.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
President of the Parliament majority and the almighty United Russia Party, which will elect the Government and the President?
Whatever it may be, in the parliamentary or in the presidential elections, the previous power will triumph.
This is tradition.
The Russians have preserved the mentality of Homo Sovieticus, they are not master of their fate, says sociologist Lev Goldkov, director of the Independent Center Levada.
Historian Nikolai Kopossov of the St Petersburg State University goes even further back: Civil society has developed very slowly in this country, which was Christianized five centuries after Europe; the famous community spirit has delayed the development of individuality.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s Putin has again linked to the model of a paternalist state, which was fully adopted by the population, all the more so because this new paternalism did not follow terror, but a certain economic prosperity, says Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians refrain from the personal responsibility they have shown for a short time after the collapse of the USSR.
How much longer to think about?
This phenomenon affects all levels of society, including the business world.
And the administrative elite understands to hold the status quo: 65 governors (of 85 Russian regional leaders) lead the local electoral lists of the United Russia.
The new freedoms coming from the West are often identical to chaos, as in the 1990s.
The general government prefers stability.
In this sense, the Russians will not vote for the extremist parties either.
Conclusion of Tamara Tcherednitchenko, a 54-year-old professor: How long have we considered?
Those who are in power are not so bad as to redeem them?
A Hard Remember
After more than 60 years of confidential treatment, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which document the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are now freely accessible.
The 47 million documents of the archive, which are located at a total length of 27 km in Bad Arolsen, could not be viewed until now, except with a humanitarian intention, i.e. individually and on behalf of a former victim or his family.
The eleven States entrusted with their administration - including Germany, France, Israel and the USA - agreed in May 2006 to make them accessible to researchers and historians.
After the ratification process of this Decision has been completed, the opening has been valid since yesterday.
Heikle Information
The access of historians to Bad Arolsen will enable researchers to carry out research, above all about the deportations of prisoners, the prisoners of the concentration camps and the state of health of the forced workers, explains Reto Meisteren, head of this archives managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (CICR).
Until recently, several countries, including Germany, had made these name-related documents available to the public, because of the delicate nature of certain information.
Like, for example, the alleged homosexuality or the mental disability of some deportation victims.
After the war, the prisoners of the concentration camps or the arrest warrants issued by the Gestapo had been brought together for a practical reason: to find civilians who had been deported or subjected to forced labour, and possibly to provide them with evidence of their arrest in order to pave the way for their compensation.
Even today, more than 300 permanent personnel in Bad Arolsen are working on tens of thousands of personal requests.
Nevertheless, part of the scientific community shows only a limited interest in access to Bad Arolsen.
One should not expect anything fundamental new in these documents, explained Pr. Wolfgang Benz, Head of the Research Center for Anti-Semitism at the Technical University of Berlin in 2006.
The EU and India want to obtain a free trade agreement in 2008.
At present, trade between India and Europe is already reaching 60 billion euros a year.
The EU is India's most important trading partner and accounts for 18% of its external trade.
European Trade Minister Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath, indicated that the European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008.
The EU's Foreign Ministers had given the European Commission a green light last April to open negotiations with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) in order to sign free trade agreements (ALE) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean).
The EU is India's first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but, according to the figures of the European Commission, India is only the ninth EU trading partner.
A free trade agreement will lead the two economic areas enormously forward and India would improve its access to a market of 450 million wealthy Europeans, confirmed Peter Mandelson.
Europe is the first or second market for the ten most frequently exported products, the European Commissioner further explained. The Asian and European giants exchange goods worth 47 billion euros per year and services worth 10 billion euros, had this week declared Daniéle Smadja, President of the European Commission’s New Delhi settlement, and regrets that mutual trade has not yet exhausted its potential. The EU and India meet on Friday for their eighth diplomatic meeting in New Delhi, where Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and President of the European Commission José Manuel Durao Barroso will be present.

The Bank of England notes the concern and offers 10 billion pounds for five weeks
On Thursday, the Bank of England expressed concern at limiting the current recurring anxiety about the credit conditions and announced an offer of ten billion pounds with a basic interest rate of 5.75% for five weeks, an unusually long-term offer.
In order to mitigate the fears that the financial market conditions will be particularly harsh at the end of the year and to give banks a greater assurance of the way in which they are to organise their liquidity positions at that time , the Bank intends to offer a significant part of its savings deposits during the maintenance phase which begins on 6 December , in the form of an open market operation for five weeks , it states in a communication.
The Bank further explains that on 6 December by 12.15 GMT, 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be put into circulation at the basic tax rate and only until 10 January.
This seems to be the first time that the BoE is putting liquidity into circulation in an open market operation for five weeks.
This usually happens for a week.
The BoE adds in its communication that it is willing to take further measures to obtain the different interest rates of interbank loans from day to day with its basic rate.
The interbank interest rate varies from day to day, at 5,829% on Wednesday.
The three-month interest rate has been down to 6.6%, slightly higher since September 18.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the sums brought into circulation by the Bank of England have been linked to fines which the banks had prevented from making use of them.
According to certain rumors, reinforced by the development of the pound price in contrast to the euro, many preferred to sign up for the sums put in circulation by the European Central Bank, more favourable interest rates and with more secure discretion
UMP and NC refuse to review the proposals of the PS for purchasing power
On Thursday, the groups UMP and Nouveau Centre refused to discuss the articles of the socialist bill on purchasing power, which is equivalent to rejecting the text.
The text of a socialist niche (meeting on the initiative of a parliamentary group) contained about ten measures adopted by the National Committee of PS on Wednesday, of which 50% for the employment allowance, for the reintroduction of the TIPP fleet, for a transport check or for limiting rents.
After UMP and NC had voted against the review of the articles (180 votes against 115), the meeting was dissolved after the main discussion, which was due to partially violent changes of speech between majority and opposition, a few hours before Nicolas Sarkozy's television contribution on purchasing power.
The leader of the MEPs of the PS Jean Marc Ayrault announced that his group would present the whole of its proposals as an amendment to the legislative plan for the correction of finances, which had been examined by the Assemblee last week.
A new festival is born
As a result of numerous rumors about the creation of a new music festival in Philadelphia by C3 Presents, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with Festival Republic of British producer Melvin Benn.
It is an honor for our company to work with a person who, no more and no less, has served as a model for the current festival movement in America, Charlie Jones of C3 on Bilboard.com informed.
C3 hosts the Lollapalooza Festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for camping holidays.
The festival will take place from August 8 to 10 on a 500 Acre private farm about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
The director of Festival Republic Melvin Benn, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the world's most renowned festivals producers.
In 1989 he took over the management of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts around 80,000 people every year.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio, and then, in 2006, Festival Republic created the Latitude Festival in Henham Park in Suffolk.
Since 2002 Melvin Benn has also taken care of production in his capacity as co-owner, in order to obtain the license concessions and organizational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which in the meantime can accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Charlie Jones of C3, who describes Glastonbury as the most inspiring event he has ever been with, says that his company and that of Melvin Benn work alongside each other in parallel to each other to offer the area a festival event in European style.
We have selected Philadelphia as a market and are working eagerly with the Fairmount Park Commission to create a festival in the city centre of Philadelphia, says Charlie Jones.
We conducted negotiations with the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic about this project.
Unfortunately, we have remained stuck in political debates regarding the current administration, Charlie Jones continues.
"Happyly, we were able to discuss with Melvin Benn and we are meeting preparations to create a great festival in an extraordinary place that will ultimately benefit the population."
C3 Presents has brought the Lollapalooza festival back to life in the Grand Park Chicago in 2005, after it has profiled together with the Austin City Limits Music Festival in the world of the festival in 2002.
The two events were able to achieve both 9.8 million dollars and 11.8 million dollars in gross tax periods in 2007.
These two festivals take place in an urban environment.
"The European model of Melvin Benn is a rural festival, whereas the unspoiled are more likely to take place on the urban green spaces," says Charlie Jones.
"The aim is to combine these two concepts in one way or another, in order to give the impression of a rural festival in the American way in the European and an urban way."
Vineland is located approximately half way between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The community of Vineland, including the mayor, takes the burden of this event with pleasure," says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to reveal the conditions of the agreement, but he confirms that "they are sufficiently interesting to invest in such an event and to include a festival that hopefully will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says that the recording capacity of the festival is "very large", corresponding to the 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says the invitations have been sent to the groups, but nothing could yet be confirmed when they were printed.
"Vineland will offer tasteful rock, but the music will be very diverse in the hope of attracting all kinds of spectators," says Charlie Jones.
His partners from C3, who received the Top Independent Promoter Prize of the last Bollboard Touring Award, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal meets the Terminator.
It is not easy to get the main platform for Hollywood films to Montreal if no less than the Terminator does.
These lock tests are among the delegated tasks.
A political "heikles mandate" because the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, urges the Runaway Productions.
Is it difficult to negotiate with the governor?
"You have to be careful, because it is the industry that decides where to go.
If it finds that the conditions in Montreal are favourable, it will go there.
Our role is to offer those who are considered to be the best," he says.
The run to the festivals.
For Denis Turcotte, however, the best priority is to put forward the cinema there at the moment.
The Oscar hunt has begun.
At all the festival on the west coast, although that of Sundance, by Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, it will be about presenting the films from Quebec, evaluating them and making sure that the producers will give interviews.
The dark age had a successful performance at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shakespeare hands with the Devil is on the poster in Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
This month Quebec also presented four long and four short films at the American Film Institute Festival.
Is the stock exchange a final-year rally ahead? Disunity with the experts due to the US mortgage crisis
The investors already rub their hands on the upcoming end-year rally with just under five weeks until the annual financial statements on the stock market.
Nevertheless, the experts cannot make any secure forecasts in this regard.
Banif believes that purely statistically speaking, the month of December on the stock market usually goes hand in hand with a positive market development
Nevertheless, it is not advisable to draw up short-term forecasts only on the basis of statistics. Especially if tensions are to be taken seriously determine the current market situation
Although other experts do not approve of such a strong price increase in the last weeks of the year, they still note that the exchange price is determined by the given liquidity of the market and the market participants, which, due to the lack of secure equity funds, mainly invest in pension funds, which are heavily affected by the trend towards yield-rich assets.
As a result, these experts believe that the stock exchange will have a rather lateral price trend, influenced by market fluctuations, especially because we cannot yet estimate the extent of the possible decline in the interest rate of the U.S. Notebank, an uncertainty that is mainly due to the increase in the price of crude oil and the risk of an increase in the inflation rate.
Javier Barrio, chairman of the sales department at BPI in Spain, agrees that it is a time to announce a upcoming market rally.
The opportunities are not very good, assures the expert.
The Spanish stock index Ibex has already lost a value of 4% on November 8th of 15,945,7 points.
But not all experts share the same negative opinion.
According to Juan Solana, Analyst at Intermoney, the Ibex 35 could successfully complete the year with almost 16,000 points following the restructuring of the investment funds and the traditional pension fund made every year at this time.
Nevertheless, the expert points out that this year things could develop a little differently, especially because of the final year rally already taking place in the second week of December, and thus directly after the bridge day on the day of the Constitution.
According to the analyst, price fluctuations would not affect market trends.
According to Federico Olucha, Analyst at the Bank Inversis, the past market assessments are at an almost technical level, which could lead to a deviation from the index values which depended on the effects of the US mortgage market crisis.
The analyst trusts that these are positive.
When selecting the values that are to drive the Ibex to new heights, the analysts agree.
Solana from Intermoney indicates that this year's great values are in line.
The expert would count the two large banks and some real estate companies as the electricity sector will be too expensive at the given time.
In the meantime, Federico Olucha assures Bank Inversis that the increases in the banking and industrial sectors will go hand in hand.
If the Rally actually happens, the real estate companies will benefit from it.
The ACPs have been on recovery course in recent months and we hope that other real estate companies such as Ferrovial and FCC will follow the same path, says the expert.
With regard to increased consumption behaviour during Christmas days, the market situation will be determined in the last half of the year of periodic consumption.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technologies will also achieve positive sales results, even if they are only in a small number in the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, December only showed two declines in course.
When the technology bubble burst at the end of 2003, this led the stock market out of its crisis and, at the same time, initiated the last real-year analysis.
This year, the Ibex 35 raised by 28.17 percentage points, showed a rate increase of 6.68% in December.
Whether 2008 will be the fifth winning year in a row (the Ibex has risen by 8.36% since January) and also a final year’s show will show up.
Popular will have its 200 credit institutions opened from Mondays to Fridays 12 hours a day.
Popular has decided to modernise a large part of its branches.
A total of 200 of these are located in Spain's most economic regions.
For the Institute, which operates under the brand name Popular Max, these branches mean a large milestone.
But also for the rest of the Spanish institutions, as Popular is the first banking group to take the lead in extending the opening hours of its branches by 20.30h a.m. on Saturdays from 10h to 20.30h.
The BBVA banking group, which also repeatedly announced the extension of its opening hours in the branches, has not yet reached a definitive conclusion.
The Bank's current negotiations with trade unions seem to be aimed at reaching an agreement that closes 75% of all branches on Saturdays and opens them on a weekday afternoon, although not for the client.
Whether further banks join the new initiative, which adapts to business opening times, will depend on the experience of the Popular Bank.
And that is also the intention of pursuing the popular with their project.
The aim is to extend the opening hours of those branches, which, due to their situation, can capture the purchasing customers of independent, small and medium-sized enterprises, but also those of large department stores.
The Bank would like to open the new 200 branches over the next 18 months, as it is not new but changed opening hours.
For this purpose, the Bank will transform the premises of those branches that are already in business zones, and at the same time align them with the individual customer profile of the different zones.
The expansion of the opening hours is combined with a new spatial design of the branches, which is characterized by a more modern, colorful design.
The responsible bank representative Ángel Rivera assures that the restructuring does not require any major investment, but resulted in increased staffing, as a branch now needed no more than six, but eight or nine employees.
The branches, which will be equipped with additional premises for SMEs, will not sell any financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tried its concept at nine branches in Madrid.
And the experiences were positive, says Ángel Rivero.
The offices of the streets Bravo Murillo, O ́Donell and Gran Vía have been chosen for what seems to have been a clever decision.
Popular currently manages about 2500 branches.
And another 60 who operate under the name Mundocredit. These are specialized in immigrants and also have extended opening hours, even on Sundays and holidays.
In these branches of PopularMax the model of BBVA is not used, since most of them will instead offer a wide range of non-financial services for sale.
We do not want to compete for our customers, explains Rivero.
With Telefonica they have provisionally come to the agreement to sell mobile phones with the help of external banking personnel.
For the first time, the Spanish private station Telecinco doubles its stock exchange value and thus overgaps its rival Antena 3.
We did it.
With this sentence, the managing director of Telecinco, Paolo Vasile, announced his satisfaction at the closing of the stock market. The station led by him had increased its value by two times its rival Antena 3.
One aspect, however, dampened his joy: that's exactly what hurt me; not that we had higher growth, but that we had lower losses, he noted.
He stressed that despite the weak market, they did not fall too deep.
Telecinco finished the day yesterday with a plus of 2.54%.
This profit reduces its previous losses to 15.66%.
According to Bloomberg, the company value now reaches the 4.488.88 million euros, with Mediaset controlling the main share of capital (52%), and Vocento is only involved by 13%.
The rival Antena 3 lost 1.52 percentage points yesterday and has been reporting a total loss of 40.5% since January so that its market value of 2.193.46 million is half.
The market value of other listed communications companies, on the other hand, increases; in the case of Sogecable, to 3.571 million, with Prisa (editor of Cinco Días magazine) to 2.518.53 million, and at Vocento to 1.779 million.
The comparison with Antena 3 can be derived from the fact that it is two similar companies, says Vasile.
The question of to what extent we can actually act on the stock exchange, at what price and how we can make it profitable at customer level remains uncertain.
A week ago, Telecinco declared his project to rise this year as the first TV station with more than 1000 million gross profits from advertising revenue. This insured Guiseppe Tringali, the managing director of Telecinco and Publiesepaña, the advertising company of the group.
If the project were to be implemented, the sender would increase its advertising income by 3.6% compared to the 965.4 million from the previous year.
In the case of Antena 3, net turnover increased by 1.6% in the first nine marketing months (up to 734.4 million), while net revenues from the TV business only showed an increase of 0.7% (630.4 million ).
The main factor for Telecinco's improved stock exchange is that the analysts see the high payout ratio, which the company has been able to have up to the present time: in 2006, Alejandro Echelarría led the company to a 100 percent dividend distribution.
Vasile, however, assures that after buying 33% of the shares of Endemol, with Mediaset as a parent company, the ratio may vary, even if it is too early for an official announcement.
We are committed to the official compromise to pay at least 50% of the shares, even if we have always stated much more.
I hope that we can satisfy our shareholders this year, whose share values we have already increased by buying 33% of the endmol shares.
According to the analysts, the market currently has certain losses.
Lehmann Brothers recently reduced his profit calculation at Telecinco by 4% for this year and by 7% for 2009.
This was the result of the reduction in the expected growth rate, which will fall from 10.5% in 2008 to 8.4% in 2009 from 5.5% to 5.1%.
This also reduced the expected profit calculation of Antena 3 by 4.5% in 2008 and by 7.5% in 2009.
3 options.
1.
Ibersecures: relies on its high efficiency return and its sustainable potential and therefore recommends the purchase of both shares.
2.
Caja Madrid: measures Telecinco (purchasing) a more favourable position in the case of Antena 3 as a result of the multiple incentives and the prosperous market.
3.
JPMorgan: recommends reducing expectations in both cases in view of the similar threats (saturated market and worse economic climate).
The Congress agrees with the MIFID Directive which entered into force on 1 November.
In parallel with the parliamentary preparation, which today ended its meeting with the Senate Congress decision on the amendments to the project, the government published the provisions resulting from the new law with a view to enabling the entry into force of both regulations by the end of the year.
The representatives of the various companies unanimously praised the efforts of the Congress and Senate members, who had pursued in their negotiations and votes the goal of setting up the best possible arrangements to ensure the safety of investors and regulate the individual business activities in order to ensure a generally efficient market activity.
In addition to the modernisation of financial markets, the MIFID, which redefines the securities service regulations, is pursuing an improvement in investor protection, the increase in the control claim of the Spanish Securities Commission (CNMV) and the promotion of cooperation between the various control authorities of the European Union.
The new Directive allows specialised companies as well as natural or legal persons to provide financial advice and also contributes to the establishment of new financial services companies (ESIS) to the consulting firms which are associated with investment and financial intermediaries of securities.
Furthermore, it extends the number of systems for the execution of financial transactions, so that the regulated circulation markets are added to the multilateral systems of securities trading and to the systems for the internationalisation of commercial orders, which would eventually compete with the current economic operators.
The law obliges investment firms to announce the focus of their business profile, confrontation and forms of dealing with risks in the market and to register all the projects carried out in order to facilitate the CNMV’s control task.
The Congress Economic Commission subsequently proposed further changes, with the decision that the titled debt securities must now be considered to be complex financial resources for the investor due to their high level of risk, as confirmed by the US mortgage and banking crisis. (US mortgage crisis)
In addition, the entry into force of the Directive on the legal limitation of the fields of work of graduated economists was used; 30 years after 1977, the Regulation restricting the fields of work reserved for economics was adopted.
The Senate has set out new positions in the financial sector, such as that of the economic mediator, who works on a foreign account, does not require the authorisation of CNMV and can offer its services for commercialising products and for customer acquisition at the same time several investment companies.
The harmonised consumer price index (PPI) rose by five tenths in November and is now 4.1%.
The indicator used by Eurostat to assess the inflation rate within the European Union provides the average price trend in Spain in November.
Its publication is in line with the principles of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB), which seek to compare local and quality with US products by publishing the data.
The forecast for the indicator can be drawn up early by using the same approach as in the harmonised consumer price index, but at the same time using various other statistical modelling methods in order to assess the information not available at the time of calculation.
However, the Spanish Statistical Office (INE) suggested that the early-detected indicator should only serve as a benchmark, and therefore should not be in line with the final result announced on 14 December.
The Consumer Price Index (IPI) will continue to remain at a relatively high level
According to Deputy Head of Government and Minister of Economics and Finance Pedro Solbes, the increase in the VPI in November was a temporary development; at the same time, it assured that the price index would remain at a relatively high level in the coming months.
Nevertheless , Solbes noted in the halls of the Congress building that even if the current number is not good , the inflation gap between Spain and the other members of the Monetary Union has remained more or less the same in recent years .
He also stated that there were fewer surprises in November than in the previous month, in which the government did not expect such a high increase.
We expected a value of around 4% , announced by the Minister for Economic and Financial Affairs with a view to the forecast published today .
Virgin calculates revenues of over 42 billion euros for the next three years with Northern Rock
Northern Rock's assets have fallen by more than half since, in mid-September of last year, the Bank had asked for an emergency loan for the UK central bank, and in the meantime they amount to only 12,000 million pounds (this corresponds to 16.800 million euros).
At this point, the Bank's assets amounted to 25,000 million pounds, a sum which has fallen significantly within two and a half months due to the customers' loss of confidence and will continue to decline despite the government's 100% guarantee that the money is safe until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, who would continue the group after taking over the Virgin Money brand, will have to bring about a quarter of the revenue of the British banks, which will be put together from the facilities of the next three years, in order to acquire exactly those 18 billion pounds that are still needed to achieve their target of 30 billion.
The group of multimillionaire Richard Branson, known for his conspicuous advertising campaigns in the United Kingdom, intends to make 50,000 million pounds (approx. 70 million euros) flow annually in advertising and marketing campaigns to reach its target.
This week Northern Rock named the Virgin Group, in which three more companies are involved, as its preferred bidder to lead it out of insolvency.
The mayor of Totana arrested for suspected participation in urban corruption
This morning, the Spanish police arrested the current mayor of the town of Totano (Partido Popular) which belongs to the municipality of Murcia, because of the urgent suspicion of a settlement in urban corruption that was revealed this week.
In addition, one of the secretaries of the municipal council and the head of the municipal police were arrested.
José Martínez Andreo represented the office of Juan Morales, currently a member of the Partido Popular and at the time chairman of the Council of Totana, and, according to information from the broadcaster Cadena SER, could be the original wiredriver of the plot.
Officials continue to search the business documents of the municipality and the Ministry of Urban Planning and do not exclude further arrests in the coming hours.
In addition, the lawyer of Juan Morales was accused of the main suspect in the case of urban corruption discovered at the beginning of this week.
According to the information provided by the Cadena SER, the lawyer of popular , and thus privileged Member Juan Morales, was arrested in leaving his client's residence due to important taxing documents intended to be related to the plot.
In addition, other sources of information report the alleged order payments Morales to a Galizian construction company, which provided for the conclusion of an urban contract, in which the construction of a 200-hectare area was decided.
There are currently eight persons in custody.
Bono agreed to accept the PSOE candidate in Toledo and, in the event of a election, in Congress.
Former Minister of Defense José Bono has accepted the offer of the government president and Secretary-General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, who will lead the PSOE candidate list at the upcoming general elections in Toledo and, in the event of a election of the Socialists, take over the office of the Congress President.
For example, José Blanco, the organization secretary of the PSOE, and Bono announced at the press conference after a meeting with Zapatero was held today in the headquarters of the party.
The Head of State considers that the offer to the former Minister is justified, as it is important in politics to be able to count on the best and Bono is among the best.
In addition, in the event of a victory for the socialists in the forthcoming elections, the Mancha-born politician would appear to be the chairman of the Congress for the Party.
Bono would replace Manuel Martín as president of the Congress, who had announced last November that he would no longer enter the next general elections, end his career in public policy and instead work for climate protection in the university area.
The former minister had to admit that since his resignation two years ago, the president of the government had constantly forced him to return to political action.
Moreover, he pointed out that, as with the appointment of the vice-president of the economy, the party would not want to prevent citizens from taking over the position of the president in the event of a election, and called this an act of transparency.
If he should actually take over the office, he hopes to turn the board into a house of respect, not the insult or the journey, so as to make it appear more and more similar to the citizens.
Unfortunately, from time to time, one gains the impression that the only place in which one cannot speak quietly and let in Madrid is the Congress; so the president of the government in the Senate was interrupted once up to 26 times.
At the same time, he praised the current President Manuel Martín and his good work and indicated that he did not seem to have taken over the office, as otherwise his political opponents would call this arrogance.
Climate propaganda
Since the climate debate is criticised by the skeptics of climate change as well as by those who put social and political debate in the foreground, the movement as a whole must display strong cohesion.
Especially if it is a leader of the movement, which, as in the case of President Zapatero, considers the fight against climate change more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and even proposes to conclude a new treaty with the planet.
This proposal, however, brings it to a crisis of explanation regarding the act or non-trade of its government, which has contributed decisively to the fact that Spain is at the head of the countries that have at least fulfilled the requirements of the Kyoto Protocol within the EU.
Who are those responsible for failure to meet the requirements, to which sectors this is due, and why has his government, which had proposed the treaty with the planet, not stopped this development.
In addition, it is now forced to explain to the Spanish citizens the measures it intends to take to combat climate change without evasion.
Which companies will be affected by the behaviour of citizens, the individual and collective austerity measures to be implemented, and the economic consequences of this.
More specifically, who needs to sacrifice and pay for saving the planet.
However, there will and will not be any such statements in the future.
Just because it's about sacrifice and payment.
Because the measures that can really be used against climate change are unpopular.
They are expensive, uncomfortable and threatening for the accounts of companies and citizens.
Even the petrol cent proposed by the PSOE appeared so dangerous to Zapatero that he was forced to take the proposal back.
Accordingly, it is now necessary to save the planet with nothing, with pure propaganda and empty sayings without any real consequences.
With impressive statements, commissions, committees, protocols and new offices.
With his contracts with the planet, the otherwise suitable politicians for election campaigns must neither speak nor complain, nor demand, but instead follow the demanding issue, decorate the meetings and inspire others with his gentleness and goodness.
However, this can only happen if the contract does not deviate from its purely virtual nature and therefore does not suggest that the bicycle will become the only means of movement in the future or that we can only refresh ourselves with a fan.
The mayor and police chief of Totana, due to a supposed transformation into urban corruption.
Guardia Civil has arrested the mayor of Totana, the popular politician José Martínez Andreo, who belongs to Murcia. In addition, the local police chief, the mayor’s secretary and a hotel businessman were detained because of the suspected suspicion of urban violations, today it is from investigation circles.
The City Council was arrested at its residence, from where he was brought to the municipal office and in its premises he is situated until the present time, surrounded by numerous agents who also arrived in the municipal administration and in the municipal construction line Suelo Industrial y Vivienda.
The three arrests are related to the attacks already held in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid last Monday, which showed that more than 2 million hectares of unconventional land should be converted for urban projects under the direction of the Galician construction firm Nuaria, which should be built on the property 4000 apartments after the local administration had received illegal commissions during the last legislative period.
In addition, two more persons were not arrested directly, but were subjected to an investigation procedure initiated and carried out by the first court of Totonas.
The first six prisoners were presented to the judge today.
According to investigation circles, it is also determined against the former mayor of Totana and current independent PP member Juan Morales.
His ex-wife, owner of a real estate company registered in Totana, as well as his present friend residing in Murcia, is suspected.
The chairman and owner of the group Nuaria, the vice-president and entrepreneur Manuel N.A., was arrested in the village of Nigrán (Pottevedra), as well as the managing director of Suelo de Inmonuar Pablo José M.G., whose company is to be part of Nuaria and have received the lubricating money.
The investigations are carried out by the Municipal Authority against urban crime, under the supervision of the Central Unit of the Guardia Civil, whose representatives, in addition to the arrests, made eleven more searches, most of them in companies directly related to the arrests held in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
At this time, only one person was arrested in Totana: the owner of a regionally known poultry industry, which is supposed to have served as a middleman.
The Nuaria construction group was commissioned to build the largest residential complex of the municipality belonging to Murcia, which should include more than 5000 apartments, a golf course and two spa hotels.
In Totana, the company acquired more than 2.2 million square kilometres of land to be converted. The aim was to implement a construction project, which would raise the population of the community to 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group comprises other companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which promote the sale of real estate; Conyase, which operates in Vigo the parking spaces of the streets of Coruña, Venezuela and Plaza Fernando el Católico; Hogartel, whose activity is limited to the direct marketing sector and Preconiza, specializing in the promotion, sale and installation of building elements.
Things that can happen
1.
If you agree, we will turn away from the expression book of the month and instead try to invent a name for the price of other names with appropriate competences.
I already have a proposal.
People, life means change.
Of course you are cordially invited to submit your proposals.

Our Finnish correspondent explained the comment published yesterday in the most important Finnish newspaper Helsingin Sanomat (Finland, by the way, is at the head of the PISA study), which refers to the comment published in the same newspaper, on 18 November; incidentally, on that day, its issue contained criticism of the book Blackburns.
The content of philosophy has become the subject of public debate following the tragedy around the school of Jokela.
Responsible for the cruel murders is an Abiturant who quoted in his news the works of Platos and Nietzsches.
In an interview of Helsingin Sanomat, the chairman of the Education Council for Philosophy, Pekka Elo, asked teachers to take a more critical position towards Plato and suggested that Plato remove the teaching of Platos from the lower-level instruction plans for philosophy at gymnasies.

A colleague informs about the inclusion of illegal internet downloads into the Criminal Code:
A. The download of a song would be a breach of law involving six months of imprisonment.
But if you rob around a music store at a value of 400 euros, this is only considered to be a simple violation (Article 623.1).
For example, if you take away the business up to a value of 1000 euros, theft will be imposed as a criminal offence, but the penalty will be lower than for a download (Article 234 Criminal Code).
C. If you take a car and give it back forty hours later, then the penalty is still lower than with a download (Article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a beating than to a music data exchange.
In order to participate in a rebellious dispute, a prison sentence of three to 12 months follows (Article 154 of the Criminal Code), while the data exchange results in a withdrawal of freedom of six months up to two years
(Article 270 Criminal Code).
E. According to Article 184.2 of the Criminal Code, sexual harassment at the workplace is considered less serious than downloading a DVD film from the Internet.
F. Trade in copyright-protected films whose author's authorization did not take place is subject to a higher penalty than the distribution of pornographic film material to minors (Article 186).
Well, if my colleague has a right, then someone's demands are quite high.

My family doctor gives me one of his long, strange research articles, entitled: Money leads to activation of certain brain areas, especially when the others get more of them.
So the feelings resulting from the monthly salary payment depend on the salary of the colleagues.
The study was prepared with the help of a tomographic-magnetic reference analysis at the University of Bonn, and the results were published in the last edition of the science journal Science.
According to Bernd Webers, author of the study and director of the Bonn brain research center Life&Brain, the activation was the strongest if the participant gave correct answers and his fellow player failed.
The researchers found that brain activities were always very moderate when both participants were right with their response and thus received the same salary; but when one of them received the double, there was also a stronger brain activity.
I am not sure whether it actually takes so much scientific effort to achieve such a result.
The prosecutor from the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been carrying out his career for eight years after the criminals of the Balkan wars. Her office is located in the public prosecutorship of the criminal court of the former Yugoslavia, located in La Haya.
Their mandate will expire at the end of the year and Carla will leave her office with a crying and a smiling eye, as the chief responsible of the massacre of Srebrenica - killed by the eight thousand Bosnian Muslims - namely the ex-General Ratko Mladic and the former serbo-bosan leader Radovan Karadzic continue to be on their feet.
Their names are listed by the Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach as a presentation for the title of his documentary La List de Carla (2006, in Spain), a film that, at the pace of a political thriller, follows the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York in her plan to track the escaped criminals and put pressure on the governments to tighten their networks.
Which insurance is best suited for me?
The car insurance, which covers a possible injury caused by the driver, includes a high cost, the amount of which depends on various factors, including age, gender, time of driving licence creation, family status, type of car to be insured and its use, etc.
Owning a car is just the beginning.
Because it is even more difficult to find the right car insurance as the right vehicle model.
First of all, it must be clear what we are dealing with here.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and an policyholder.
This agreement shall be recorded in writing by means of an insurance contract stating that the company receives the agreed insurance premium and, in return, is obliged to submit the corresponding sum in case of damage.
The insurance premium is the price of an insurance which is composed of several factors, including age, gender, date of creation of the driving licence, family status, type of vehicle to be insured or used.
Insurance companies set their prices according to the statistics, so that higher risk of accident also becomes higher contribution payments.
For this reason, both over 25-year-olds and women have to make fewer contributions, as statistics show that these groups have a lower accident rate due to their caution.
The same applies to married persons, as according to statistical values and thus also to the conviction of the companies, to fewer accidents tend to be similar to those of the single person.
The benefits to the vehicle affect the frequency of driving and thus the likelihood of an accident.
The more frequent the use, the more likely the damage.
In setting up the premium, insurance companies must take into account a number of points.
For this reason, the driver also has to study the situation thoroughly to select exactly the car insurance that best meets his personal needs.
We are now listing the most important points that should be considered when selecting insurance in order not only to be able to make a performance, but also a price-oriented choice.
The under 25-year-olds face numerous obstacles in choosing a cost-effective insurance, such as low driving practice and the young driver's license.
Even if it would be best for an ideal insurance cover to complete a full insurance scheme, there are nevertheless cheaper alternatives.
The cautious drivers can choose a full-featured box so that the benefits of a full-featured insurance are covered but offered at a low price.
This type of contract means that the customer must pay part of the amount resulting from the damage itself.
The amount is set before the conclusion of the contract and on the basis of the amount of the insurance premium , which is higher the amount to be paid , explains Luis Noguera , the principal representative of Spain at First Europe , an intermediary for online insurance.
Another option is the extended insurance, which assures customers against external accidents, but not against the damage caused on their own car.
Furthermore, this type of insurance would cover theft, fire and vehicle loss.
Here's a advice.
If you are under 25 years old, it is in your hand to reduce insurance costs; so your credit increases by trying to drive carefully and avoid accidents.
A credit is a reduction in the basic rate for the corresponding insurance company.
On the contrary, a penalty payment involves an increase in the said tariffs.
The amount of credits and penalty payments shall depend on the company and its earnings.
When the company has a yield-rich year behind itself, it may allow itself to increase bonus payments, explains Noguera.
As soon as the 25-year mark is exceeded, it is easier for drivers to conclude a contract. Because of this, the fact is that with increasing driving practice the accident rate decreases.
Thus, it is most useful to opt for a full-scale insurance with self-equity.
Normally, young people cannot benefit from their past experience, both in the event of an accident and at the time of driving , explains the Spanish leader of the European company and adds that the majority of accidents occur in the second practical year after the fear of the beginner has been dropped.
Nevertheless, it is more advisable for a married customer who has no children to complete a full insurance insurance; of course only if it allows the financial situation of the person concerned.
Insurers are considered to be customers with children at the lowest accident rate and, accordingly, their contribution payments are also low.
In this case, a full-cash insurance with an amount of 300 euros would be the best option. In case you have received a high credit, an extended insurance is recommended, which will only be used for the third year of vehicle.
They drive more relaxed overall and possess a greater purchasing power that allows them to make a higher contribution, states Luis Noguera.
For pensioners, it is possible to complete a full-cash insurance with an amount of EUR 150 (in the case of an amount) or an extended insurance which only applies with a sufficiently high credit.
Finally, it must be noted that car insurance is something very important, not only because it protects the driver against possible accident damage, but also because it has high costs that require that a thorough selection be made that corresponds to our personal situation.
The Celtic Glasgow hopes in Milan to reach the point for the eighth finale
The FC Milan and Celtic Glasgow will be fighting in San Siro next Tuesday for the point they are missing to achieve their respective goals before the completion of the Champions League pre-rounds. The Italians need the point to reach the top of their group, while they decide on their participation in the Scottishs.
The Italian team already has five points and have already confirmed their participation in the fifth round with a draw in Portugal, while the Celtic Glasgow has nine more points to ensure that the Shakhtar FC with six points does not catch the Befica Lisbon with four points.
The two games of the group D will take place one week before the end of the sixth round, as the FC Milan will have to compete at the FIFA World Cup in Japan, where he will fight for entry to the finals on the 13th in the semifinals for the first time, which will take place on the 16th.
So this group will be finished in front of all others and the difference in the Guiseppe Meazza Stadium to the expected result, even if both teams will try to win. The Italians will not want to speculate at home the Celtic Glasgow knows that they would have a better starting position in the eighth finale in the event of a winning group star.
Gordon Strachan's team could even be a defeat to qualify for this. However, he should not rely too much on such circumstances, because at nine points the same thing is true for Ukrainians; although they had lost (2-1) in Glasgow last week, they could win in the second game (2-0).
Thus, the Milanese will try to miss the evening to the Scottishs, who hope to reach the eighth finale of the re-designed champion league for the second time in a row after they have been defeated in exactly the same round by a goal of Kaka in the post-playing period (1-0) and by a zero to zero draw on the game.
While the FC Shahhtar is waiting for the victory of the Rossoneri, the team will have to concentrate on its own game, as both the achievement of the eighth finale and its membership at UEFA depend on its victory and defeat of Celtic Glasgow.
In spite of its lower table position and without the prospect of continuing to participate in the biggest European championship, Benfica Lisbon could win third place and thus compete with UEFA.
20,000 people attend the first Spice Girls Tour concert in Vancouver.
The Spice Girls gave the start for their first tour after the release of the band in 2000, in front of 20,000 spectators in Vancouver.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) y 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) announced shortly before their concert at the GM Place de Vancouver stadium that the mood in the reunited band was excellent.
Around 20,000 people could experience the concert at the sold-out stadium, during which a video on the story of the band, which had provided for Furore at the end of the nineties, was shown.
The reunion and the world tour overlap with the release of a new album, which includes its biggest hits and two other new songs, headlines and voodoo, which appears in Spain under EMI's label.
The five members of the Spice Girls wore golden bracelets on stage that had previously given them the husband of Posh Spice , the English football player David Beckham .
The sportsman was among the fans in the audience who caused the GM Palace to glow, although the nerves of his spouse Victoria had forbidden him in the previous days.
During the preparations for the Shift Victoria Beckham announced that the British star had not even received our wardrobe, and that's why I'm really excited about what he's going to do about the show.
Sporty Spice , whose departure from the group in 1998 due to internal disagreements two years later led to the disbanding of the group, expressed their nervousness two hours before the concert at a press meeting.
I was shocked.
I was nervous, but I saw that the attitude of world publicity had changed that the feelings about the Spice Girls had changed.
And that's why I didn't think so, so I'm glad to have made this decision, Chisholm spoke about the separation of the band she had made nine years ago.
The singer also stated that the disputes had been resolved and now everyone had a great deal of love.
Nevertheless, many things have changed since the last joint appearance of Spice Girls in 1998.
First of all, the group arrived in a special engine of Virgin Airlines in Vancouver, according to the report of the TV station CTV.
On arrival at the airport, the band was received by an army of children's girls.
The five have seven children together.
After the concert in Vancouver, the band will appear next in California, in San José (December 4th) and in Los Angeles (December 5th and 7th).
In Madrid they will enter the stage on December 23rd.
New fears about natural gas conflict between Russia and Ukraine
A new price dispute between Ukraine and Russia raises the risk that Russian exports will be affected by fuel to Western Europe.
The majority of Russian natural gas exports to the European Union (EU) are managed by Ukraine and every dispute between the two nations is observed very closely.
Kiev warned that if Moscow increases the price it has to pay for natural gas, Russia will charge it higher transit fees.
An earlier conflict between the two countries last year reduced supplies to the EU countries.
The recent dispute between Kiev and Moscow is happening at a time when the Ukrainian government and the Russian, state-owned gas monopoly Gazprom are trying to reach an agreement on how much Ukraine has to pay for Russian natural gas in 2008.
According to Gazprom, Ukraine has to be calculated more because the Group has agreed to pay up to 50% in addition for natural gas from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say that this could mean that Ukraine has to pay 40% more for the imports of Gazprom.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit states in discussions," said Ukraine's Minister for Economic Affairs Anatoli Kinakh of the Reuters News Agency.
"The changing natural gas prices should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments regarding the level of transit fees [to Western Europe] through Ukraine."
In the last major natural gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev in January 2006, Gazprom reduced deliveries to Ukraine.
As a result, this led to a fall in exports to Western Europe, which dramatically increased prices.
Russian gas is a quarter of the European Union's supply.
Russia has the world's largest gas reserves, but much remains underdeveloped.
The result is that Gazprom complements its own supplies with gas from Turkmenistan and other Central Asian former Soviet nations.
NHS "must control foreign workers"
The Scottish State Health Service must improve the controls of the pre-crisis registers for workers from outside Europe, said a member of the Control Body.
The recommendation of the main financial controller Robert Black came after a foreign doctor in Scotland was brought in conjunction with the attack on Glasgow Airport in June.
Black also expressed concern that the Scottish public health service did not have any precise ideas regarding the number of foreign employees.
But his report pointed out that other important checks were carried out correctly in a sample of five health authorities.
The main financial controller examined personnel recruited outside the European Economic Area countries as a result of the attack on Glasgow Airport.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after an off-road car was driven through the doors of the main airport terminal.
He was one of three doctors who appeared in a video transfer in October and was burdened with the alleged car bomb attack in Great Britain.
It is expected that the State Health Service will carry out checks in advance of the appointment of foreign employees in order to ensure that they have the necessary qualifications, experience and authorizations to work in the United Kingdom.
Although the health authorities use Disclosure Scotland to review pre-crisis registers, the Agency does not have the power to obtain this information outside the United Kingdom.
The main auditor's report now states, in addition to other recommendations, that the Executive Board should pick up guidelines for the criminal register extract that will help employers in controls in different countries.
"Although we have found evidence on these controls in some personnel documents, they have not been carried out routinely." the report noted.
Black said that the Scottish health authorities would follow their investigation guidelines to a high degree before recruitment, but added: "Our report shows areas in which the system can be improved in order to ensure that accurate information on the number of foreign health workers is available."
BMA Scotland-Chairman Dr. Peter Terry said it was "extremely unlikely" that prior to the appointment of potential NHS employees, investigations would identify people who could commit future terrorist attacks.
"The report says that current pre-supposition tests of NHS Scotland are working well and it is not clear what added value the recommendations will provide," he said.
Scottish health authorities say they currently have 1,161 foreign employees, the vast majority of them doctors and nurses.
However, the financial controller warned that the number was probably higher, also because the boards had problems identifying those employees who had been on leave for an indefinite period.
The investigation continued to find that established control procedures were largely complied with by NHS authorities in Ayrshire, Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian.
These include passport, work permit, and qualification checks.
the Scottish Government is currently reviewing its policy and guidelines for controls before the start of the appointment for foreign staff in the NHS.
The Secretary for Health Nicola Sturgeon said: "I was concerned to carry out this work in the face of the terrorist attack on Glasgow Airport."
It added that the Scottish Government, in conjunction with the health authorities, would take into account the reports’ recommendations and would ensure that the best practices in updated guidelines on control investigations were reflected in advance of the appointment of all employees, including those from abroad, whose publication is planned next month.

Ray Winston, who has the reputation to play hard guys, has picked up the Richard Harris Prize for his outstanding contribution to the British film.
The 50-year-old, whose films include Scum, Nil by Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming the Indiana Jones continuation The Kingdom of the Chrystal Skull.
Winston said he was proud to receive the prize, which was named in honor of Camelot and Harry Potter Stars Harris, who died in 2002.
"There were people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney who opened doors for people like me," he said.
"I was lucky to meet Richard Harris a few times.
He's my guy, a great actor of his time, I'm really honored."
The independent film prizes, known as bifas, are selected by a group that includes filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
Bifa supporters and sponsors include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
208 Arrested in Saudi Arabia for a terrorist plot
Saudi Arabia discovered yesterday that it had arrested 208 militants because of their belonging to cells who had planned an imminent attack on an oil plant as well as on clergy and security forces.
The state television of the world's largest oil exporter said that one of the cells would have planned to smuggle rockets.
Sympathizers of Al-Qaida have launched a campaign against the monarchy, which has been an ally of the United States since 2003, following the invasion into Iraq.
A cell of eight militants, led by a foreign citizen, planned to attack an oil plant in the eastern province, according to the TV report.
Saudi Arabia has formed a 35,000 man strong quick intervention force to protect plants following a misguided Al Quaida attack on the world's largest oil processing plant in Abqaiq in 2006.
The report, referring to an internal ministerial statement, says that 18 of the arrested belonged to a cell led by a "racial expert" who immigrated illegally to the country.
He reports that the militants had planned to smuggle eight projectiles into the Kingdom.
According to the report, another 22 of the prisoners had planned the killing of clergy and security forces.
The government has warned clergymen to do more to stop Saudis who are striving for Iraq to join Al Qaida Milizen, who want to fight the Allied Armed Forces and the U.S.-supported Shiite Muslim government, which is considered heretic by the Hardliners among the Sunni Saudis.
Al Qaida Milizen considers many clergymen in Saudi Arabia to be in cooperation with the authorities in supporting the policies of the royal family who dominate the government.
The militias - accompanied by calls from Osama bin Laden, the Al Qaida leader born in Saudi Arabia to aim at the provincial Saudi government - have it on foreign residential areas, government buildings and facilities of the energy sector.
"This was a very great effort by security forces over the last... five months," a speaker from the Ministry of the Interior told the state television.
The arrests also involved a "media cell" of 16 from Medina, which aimed to promote "Takfiri think" - the ideology of radical Sunni Muslims that supports violence against Muslims who are being burned as infidels and backslids.
Among those arrested were 32 people who were accused of providing financial support to the militias.
The climate on Venus could reveal a view of the future of the earth
The Venus was perhaps once a pleasant place to live, scientists said yesterday.
Data from a European spaceship on a orbit show that the planet is more like a turned-off twin of the earth than was previously conscious.
Venus is the closest planetary neighbor to the Earth.
The two worlds have about the same size and have similar planetary orbits, but the Venus of the Sun is somewhat closer.
Billions of years ago, scientists believe that the Venus conditions, which would have been very similar to those on earth and could even have been habitable, would have ruled today.
But because of the unobstructed carbon dioxide greenhouse effect, the erosion of the atmosphere by sun exposure and a slower rotational rate, Venus took a completely different development course.
Today the planet is robbed of water and has a surface temperature that is hot enough to melt lead and is devastated by hurricane-strong winds and lightning towers.
The findings of the European Space Agency's Venus Express spacecraft, which has examined the plants for one year, provide a sobering view of how the earth could develop in the face of catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor of the Department of Physics at Oxford University, one of the leaders of Venus Express Mission, said: "It becomes clear why the climate on Venus is so different from that of the Earth, while the planets are otherwise quite similar."
"Our new data enable us to construct a scenario in which Venus started billions of years ago like the Earth, possibly with a habitable environment."
Confiscated "Enriched Uranium" by the Police
A kilo of radioactive material, reports enriched uranium, was confiscated yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police officer said three people were arrested and the material was tested.
He did not confirm whether it was enriched uranium, but said it could have been sold for 1 million dollars (480,000 pounds).
Everything still open
Mitt Romey said he was not worthy of being questioned by a snowman.
Nevertheless, the Republican candidate for the Presidency finally agreed to hold a debate on YouTube, to record and submit questions to the candidate in the normal voters in order to send them to the candidate.
None of the questions raised on Wednesday evening, November 28, were as ridiculous as the Snowman, who asked Democrats about global warming in the YouTube debate of the other party.
But the questions, and the answers, reflected this time exactly the condition of the Republican Party that broke up in the elections next year.
It is not known exactly like the producers of CNN who supported the debate with those who chose the upcoming candidates to show YouTube clips.
However, in the first half hour of the debate, which was the longest devoted to a single topic, immigration was the focus.
The topic is one of the most important topics for Republicans.
The CNN asked a group of undecided voters to use a dial when they heard things they liked: The TV station noticed tips of approval as the candidates spoke strictly across the borders.
The fastest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, the national pioneer, and Romney, who stepped forward in the decisive surveys in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani tried to shake off the call that he had been proficient about illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked Romney in which he accused the former governor of Massachusetts of having recruited illegal immigrants for work at his home.
The two were particularly violently disputing as a questioner as to whether one of the candidates would support an "amnesty" (the illegals would give a regular status and the possibility of citizenship).
Insignificant candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, succeeded in re-enacting on this subject.
None of the two men have serious chances of nomination, but both remain in the race, perhaps because they used to hang on the immigration stake before and harder than others.
At least in the area of immigration, the candidates generally share the same views: stronger borders, intolerance to illegal migrants.
This theme, along with fears about toxic toys from China or other concerns about the rest of the world, helps Republicans to forget or minimize the differences between liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate has clearly become problematic than other issues have been raised.
Mr Giuliani was asked why he had supported arms restrictions in the past.
John McCain and Romney discussed whether simulated drowning should be considered torture.
One of the questionser asked whether the candidates believe every word of the Bible.
This led Giuliani to take the view that although the Bible is his preferred book, he may not literally believe the history of Jonah and the whale.
Another questioner asked whether Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - now contrary to all expectations in first place in a recent survey in Iowa thanks to his long-standing Christian conservativeism - said that the death penalty is painful, but necessary.
When he was urged to see if Jesus would support them, he laughed at it and said that Jesus was too intelligent to apply for a political office.
The race remains extremely far open.
Huckabee's ascent in Iowa coincides with Ron Paul's recent donations and his sidewalks in Wednesday's debate.
These two have been shot out of nowhere because the two wings of the party have not yet been able to agree on one of the more well-known and traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate has the party from the beginning and convincingly united with a victorious message about the size of America and a kennel to both wings of the party.
This time the party is split and the result is far from clear.
Pain of the Labour Party
Gordon Brown has discovered another pit to fall in; his way out of this remains the same.
For British scandals, this is not particularly slippery.
No aristocratic titles seem to have been sold, no political Paris hotel bills paid, no extramarital toes have been sucked.
But the discovery that a rich businessman has veiled donations for the British ruling Labour Party over more than 650,000 pounds (1.3 million dollars) over four years under the name of other people, and that the party has failed to report this is something without which the rival Gordon Brown would have done well.
When two months ago the Prime Minister had rejected the call for an election, in a stupid way insulting the British intelligence by claiming that opinion polls had not affected this decision, there was hope that he would offer a robust, efficient government.
Instead, as Vince Cable, the increasingly sharp chairman of the Liberal Democrats, expressed it, has developed the once-feared Brown from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The unskilled rescue of Northern Rock, a beaten bank, showed regulatory weakness and poor judgment under fire.
Poorly thought-out proposals to change tax laws have imposed corporate associations against the government.
The tax-executive loss of personal data of 25 million people showed unimaginable administrative buffers.
A trio of retiring generals started a revolt in the Oberhaus from protest against cuts in military spending: to be Minister of Armed Forces, they claimed to be a part-time job.
Now there are the various donations from David Abraham; Peter Watt, Labour's Secretary General (and her former chief of performance) has already resigned.
Nothing of that means Brown will irrevocably break up towards departure.
Nevertheless, governments can reach a turning point after which they feel they are impossible to rule.
No one likes or trusts people politicians, but they usually hold back their skepticism when a new force takes office.
Once it is clear that a Prime Minister is unlikely to improve the situation, and he does not need to be there for a long time, this delay is over: the public service is beginning to become sick; the Cabinet ministers are beginning to chat; the press is looking for bad news; and the government is going to be defensive and aimless.
In a way, Brown's position is particularly difficult because, unlike other political leaders, he cannot claim to be a new broom.
If he wanted to deny Tony Blair, he was his superior.
The problems with Northern Rock and the tax jurisdiction documents, for example, are related to decisions taken by Brown as chancellor of the Ministry of Finance.
And even if he wasn't directly involved in Blair's miscarriage - as in the long "money for noble title" investigation of political party finance - the voters may assume that he was.
Nevertheless Brown's situation is not as bad as it looks
The sins are not as terrible as the conservatives describe them.
Like Mr. Bean, no one died, or was completely shuddered.
And the antidote, painful as it may be, is to deliver what Browns of course have always promised Stalinist tendencies: a reliable, solid and slightly brutal government.
The new practice of political donations is a good example.
The Garboeske Abraham, who compares his donations with his nonprofit gifts, says he does not wish to be publicly recognized for his goodwill.
It may be, but the decision on it did not allow him to do so.
The laws against anonymity for large political contributors are clear and they exist for a clear reason: the public has a right to know who can buy access to those who rule the country.
Watt, who says he knew of Abraham's agreement, but not that she is illegal, will naturally have to ask himself some questions; just like Jon Mendlesohn, Labour's main financial driver, who was told about the strange donations in October.
But Brown has not yet been involved: there is nothing that suggests that he knew about these confusions, although most of the payments were made after his takeover in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has done half of the work.
He quickly condemned the violation of the laws by his party, but he watered this determination by grasping a known instrument, an investigative committee on the subject - in order to complete the measure, by a bishop retired and a judge.
In this case, "the lessons to be drawn from" are not very complicated.
If the law was broken, it's one thing for the police.
Apart from that, there are other things Mr Brown has to do, how to find a permanent chairman for the Independent Committee on Standards in Public Life, which has been unoccupied for six months, and to move forward with a comprehensive reform of political party finance.
This would require the hardliners of the Labour to cooperate with the Conservatives and possibly give up the special financial relationship with the trade unions - bitter pills for a party colleague like Mr Brown.
But he should be aware of some partial facts.
The conservatives now have a clear leadership in the polls; he has two years to win back voters; and the only way he can achieve a victory is through unchallengable justice and solid competence.
Card sharks
Is the credit crisis going on in America's credit card market?
If blood is in the water, it's only natural for back fins to swirl about.
Now that America's real estate market is cracking, the predators have the country's credit card market in sight.
Goldman Sachs' analysts expect credit card losses to reach 99 billion dollars if the risk of infection from underfinanced credit spreads to other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases in both the disbursements and the exchange rates, which measure the proportion of loans that are not recoverable or too late for more than 30 days.
The HSBC announced last month that it has taken a $1.4 billion fee from its US consumer financing, partly because of the weakness of credit card users.
It is still too early to fall into panic.
Losses and obstacles are still low.
According to Moody credit rating agency, the third-quartal ground rate of 3.89% was almost a full percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration in the Councils may be explained in part by technical factors.
A change in US private insolvency laws in 2005 led to an abrupt case of bankruptcy applications, which, in turn, represent a large part of the card losses; the number of applications (and thus payment fees) would rise again, whether the general conditions for creditors deteriorate or not.
Industry also reports solid payment rates, which show how much of their debt is paid off to consumers every month
and confidence in credit card-based securities is quite strong, despite the standstill in other corners of structured financing.
Dennis Moroney of the TowerGroup, a research company, expects that the expenditures for 2007 will ultimately be 25% higher than last year.
There are certainly direct infection channels between the real estate credit crisis and the credit card market: it is more likely that consumers will accept credit card debts, now that home loans dry out.
The card issuers, however, look at the cash flow rather than at capital values, therefore house prices do not necessarily trigger a change in the creditworthiness of the borrower.
You can even be beneficial to the card exhibitors.
The incentives for consumers to continue to pay mortgage rates fall when real estate is less than the value of the loan; as a result, card debt becomes more important among the repayment priorities.
Card issuers can also respond much faster and more flexible than creditors to more stormy conditions by changing interest rates or credit limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risk of a rapid re-evaluation of assets.
"We won't wake up one day and revalue the loans completely," says Gary Perlin, Capital Ones' principal financial representative.
Even if a sudden undercoverage crisis in the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of a sustainable downturn are much more real.
If lower house prices and a reduction in credit are going to push America into recession, industry will undoubtedly face a worse future.
Keep looking for these shark fins.
British bankers confess guilty in Enron case
Three British bankers, who were to be put in court for their role in the fraudulent system with the former chief financial director of Enron, Andrew Fastow, changed their requests in debt on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew had originally pleaded on innocent charges for seven cases of fraud using telecommunications for alleged conspiracy with Fastow in a secret financial fraud in 2000 to enrich themselves at the expense of their employer.
The procedure had been initiated in January.
But during a hearing in court before the U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Junior pleaded guilty of a case of fraud using telecommunications.
The three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, a unit of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, were known in the UK in the course of extradition procedures that lasted two years.
In the United States, her case is a loose end to an investigation started after Enron's collapse in 2001.
The allegations initially filed against them in 2002 made Fastow aware that he was the objective of an investigation of the government in connection with the Enron decline.
The charges against the bankers - called the "NatWest Three" - claimed that they had come to Houston in 2000 to pick up a fraudulent plot with Fastow and his former top consultant Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of Enron's partnership, which was controlled by Fastow, the architect of countless fraudulent Enron agencies that contributed to tearing the company into the bankruptcy building.
At the beginning of 2002, the Bank had valued its participation in the subsidiary at zero, but the three British men knew that it had actually had significant value.
A company under Kopper's control acquired the Bank's shares in the subsidiary for $1 million.
The bankers paid Kopper $250,000 for a stake in this company.
According to the charge, Fastow falsely represented Enron that the energy company would pay 20 million dollars to Greenwich NatWest for its shares in the subsidiary.
But actually, the $20 million went to British bankers, fastow and others.
The bankers received 7.3 million dollars, while Fastow, Kopper and other about 12.3 million dollars, according to the charge.
In January 2004, Fastow became guilty in two charges for conspiracy for his role in the Enrons Pleite.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastov is in prison for six years in the Federal Prison of Louisiana.
Kopper's sitting in a facility in Texarkana for three years and a month.
Each of the three men was free on foot on the basis of a $1 million deposit, which required them to live in the United States in expectation of trial.
Enron, once the nation's seventh largest company, broke out in the bankruptcy in December 2001, after years of bookkeeping tricks could no longer mask billions of debts or weakening enterprises.
The collapse destroyed thousands of jobs, more than 60 billion market value and more than two billion dollars of pension plans.
The Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former Chairman Jeffrey Skilling were sentenced last year for their roles in connection with the Enron collapse.
Skilling has a penalty of more than 24 years.
Lay's convictions for conspiracy, fraud and other charges became void after he passed away last year because of heart disease.
Not quite down in Moscow
The price of an aircraft of the Gulfstream G550 brand, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and enough range to fly nonstop from Moscow to Los Angeles, is at least 54 million dollars.
But that's a change for some of the rich Russians.
"It offers space for up to 18 passengers," said Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
"But none of you ask for so many seats because it is for a private family or a business president."
Firer was at the Gulfstream stand last Friday at the Millionaires' Exhibition, a four-day orchestra of on-the-spot consumption organised in a nested exhibition centre on the outskirts of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury providers had built exhibition booths, hoping to interest newly come to money Russians in everything, from mahogany-frozen yachts to diamond-covered car grills that would be appropriate for 50 cents.
Firer carefully visited a shiny orange Porsche at the next booth.
"That's a nice car, but it's small money compared to us," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest private aircraft market."
Stimulated by an oil tree, the Russian capital seems as flooded with money as Dallas at its shine times.
"We went through the same phase in the 1890s when some Americans came to enormous wealth and went to Europe in crowds, where they were considered materialistic," said Marshall Goldman, a scientist at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
Like the Saudi-Arab superflyers of the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians are the world's most visible free-flowers of money.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their share of the gold rush.
Elsewhere in Moscow this week, a conference of the luxury industry Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the chairman of LVMH, attracted a conference to exchange ideas about how to sell high-priced goods on markets like Russia.
(The conference is organized by The International Herald Tribune, which belongs to the New York Times Company.)
Russia has 53 billionaires with a total of 282 billion dollars, according to the Forbes list of the richest people.
In addition, 103,000 Russian millionaires belong to the second class, worth 670 billion dollars together, according to a study on the development of private property in the former Soviet Union, written by economic experts from the Centre for Economic and Financial Research, a committee of experts here.
(The World Bank says in 2005 15.8 percent of Russians lived under the minimum of existence.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow - that's why we're all here," said Nicole Marais, a sales and marketing representative of David Morris, a London jeweler.
She had visited the fair for the first time together with the Russian dealer of the brand, Soho Jewelry Group.
"The women are all exemplaryly cared for and the men are all an asset."
While they go through the halls on Sunday night, two real estate agents, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, call themselves and their clients millionaires.
"I looked for the cars and I tried to decide between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche," said Ms. Yumatova, who delivered the designer clothing she was wearing, like a red carpet veteran with Joan Rivers.
The trade fair seemed to be aimed primarily at the new empires, the type of brand-conscious Russian buyers who would be ready to stand in the traffic jam for several hours to visit a cozy warehouse that would make fun of Cadillac Escades, pocket knife from platinum, mole pick ice cream, customized billiard tables, apartments in Dubai and Gund teddy bears side by side.
The public was able to buy tickets for 30 Euros (44.57 dollars).
"The Russians are interested in learning which brand is the most expensive and best," said Mr. Gijrath, who was patrioticly at a booth of the Dutch porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft in front of a wall-sized imitation of a Rembrandt image of hand-painted blue mosaic stones.
"Of course, Russians are more interested in Klimper-Klimper."
In fact, the dealers here say that the Russians with old money (10 to 15 years old according to Russian standards) have already moved from large-scale logos to the kind of sober brands with limited quantities that would not be marketed at a trade show.
Nevertheless, several thousand people, whether millionaires, envoys of millionaires or just tourists each day, pushed through the halls.
And some of them bought.
On the first night of the show last Thursday, Roman Ershov, the general manager of King Koil beds here, said he had sold two 70,000 dollars mattress sets, made of silk, cashmere and cotton, with sewn gold threads.
Also on the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, a sales manager for A1 Moto, told a company that the high-end cars with high-end alarm systems had sold his company the green orange Porsche to a Russian millionaire for 170,000 dollars.
Until the Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, the president of L.A. Connection, a company that adapts luxury cars to customer needs, said he had sold three car cooler grills for a Rolls-Royce Phantom, the interconnected chain bracelets for 55,000 dollars each.
He showed a reporter a car tire developed for a Russian casino owner, with spokes he had covered with colored Swarovski crystals, so it looked like a roubella.
The cost: $22,000 for a quadruple replacement.
"The Russian millionaire, the rhinestone leather wheels, or a picture of his wife's face from cubic zirconium, will not necessarily ride on these wheels," said Mr. Karapetian.
"He will keep it in his 30- or 40-way garage."
Even though many of his Russian customers are rich, Mr. Karapetian said that the phrase "Russian millionaires" would not express much exclusivity at the moment, given the rise in these real estate prices.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, they are probably already millionaire, at least on paper, if not already in cash," he said.
"There are more of those than you believe."
Those who were not millionaires could at least act as if they were rich at a booth operated by Alliance Continental, a Russian asset management company.
The company had set four red telephone cells according to British model, which were stuffed with mountains of false millions of dollars.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing director, said his employees had printed 500,000 false banknotes for the millionaire trade fair.
Passersby stopped to throw around the piles of money, mobile phone photos, while they leaned back in the middle of the substitute wealth, to get cut by friends, or just to put a few million in.
"Look, in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire," said Mr. Karryev.
Talled Operation Suspected in New Jersey Death
It was the day before the harvest thank you when Ronald Livingston saw through the large glass window of Just a Little Healthier restaurant here and observed two doors down the West Scott Avenue as an ambulance on the white Cape Cod.
Soon there was a police car there.
And then there was another one.
"Then I saw the van of the medical examiner coming," said Livingston, a restaurant supervisor, on Wednesday.
"That was the point when I knew someone had died."
The audience learned that the dead woman Olga Arroyo, 41, was an assistant to the director of the Newark Police Department.
Now the investigators are trying to determine if she died because of a procedure performed by an unauthorised cosmetic surgeon who did not identify the police and who worked in the house on West Scott Avenue 212.
The authorities have not yet determined what caused Mrs Arroyo's death, and are hopeful that toxicological investigations whose results could not be available for weeks will help to clarify a mysterious death that has sent grief through the leadership of the Newark Police.
Ms. Arroyo has been an assistant to police director Garry F. McCarthy since September 2006, and her voice was known to many in the department.
"She was loyal, hard working and persistent," said Mr McCarthy about Mrs Arroyo in a telephon interview on Wednesday.
"She was my Pitbull.
She protected me."
McCarthy said that Ms. Arroyo's wife was Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer working for alcohol control commission, leaving two sons, 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, a spokesman for the prosecutor of Union County, Theodore J. Romankow, said that investigators would try to determine whether Arroyo died as a result of an unauthorised, surgical treatment.
"This is one of the options," said Mrs. Walsh.
"It's an ongoing investigation."
The authorities said they had arrived at the house at about 3 p.m. in November.
And they found Mrs. Arroyo on a sofa.
She was declared dead on site.
More than a week has passed and the authorities have reported little about their investigation or about the owner of the house listed as Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh did not want to say whether Mrs Castro was questioned by the authorities.
The investigators try to determine whether part of the house has been used as a medical practice.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door to Mrs. Castro's house, where a withered rose shrub is in the scarce front garden and a Dalmatian calls behind the house.
A blue barrel labeled "Ethyl Vanillin" - used as a substitute for vanilla in foods and perfumes - sat in the parking space next to a door leading to the basement.
Two mountain bikes hung from hooks on one side.
McCarthy said that when he first arrived in Newark after spending 25 years with the New York Police Department, Mrs. Arroyo was of invaluable value and helped him find himself in the provincial and hard political culture in his new city.
"She said, 'You have to pay attention to this or that," he said.
"She was always here when I got here and she was always here when I left.
It was embarrassing."
Hope that the central bank will reduce interest rates will lead to an increase in world share markets
The shares jump on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday, after market hopes that the central bank will try to calm down the credit markets by further lower interest rates, with appalling comments from the vice-president of the US Central Bank.
The stock markets rose in London, New York and throughout Europe after Donald Kahn, Ben Bernanke's number two, said that the policy "flexible and pragmatic" had to respond to the continuing pressure on the financial markets.
In a clear effort to calm down threesome markets, given signs of rising credit tensions, Kohn said that the recent turbulences had "partly some of the improvements in market functions from the late part of September and October".
If the increased turbulence persists, it would increase the possibility of further strengthening the financial conditions for consumers and businesses, he said.
The comments were taken by investors as a signal that the central bank is ready to enter and to stabilise credit conditions with new capital injections into the US markets and possible further reductions in interest rates.
The statements also helped to calm down Wall Street, in the face of further bad news from the US economy, now that the sales of US real estate reached a new record low in October.
The consequences of the financial turbulence were underlined by the announcement of Bear Stearns, the investment bank, that they would eliminate 650 jobs, or 4 percent of their worldwide employees, in a cost reduction measure in order to compensate for serious losses from their lost US mortgage-credited bets.
It is expected that only 20 of these jobs will disappear in London, where the bank employs 1,500 employees.
In New York, the Dow Jones Industry Index jumped by 331 points, or 2.55 percent to close at 13.289.40, while the wider S&P 500 index, which was used, rose by 2.65 percent.
In London, the FTSE 100 index rose by 165.5 points, or 2.7 percent to close at 6.306.2, adding more than 39 billion pounds to British standard values.
Germany's Dax index rose by 2.6 percent and France's CAC40 increased by 2.3 percent.
Prior to this, the resumption of credit pressure on the markets had been underlined after strong demand had been granted to the European Central Bank’s auction of three-month guarantee funds granted to the European commercial banks to a considerable 4.7 percent, the highest rate since April 2001.
Pressure on the bank of England, the US Central Bank and the European Central Bank and to feed additional capital into the money markets in London increased when credit tensions were seen as the three-month "Libor" rates for lending between UK banks rising by 6.59 percent to their peak since late September, after a continuous increase since 21 November.
England confronted with decision on the statements of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here are two dilemmas, each of them almost as difficult as the other.
Who should hit the number 6 for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, no less relevant in a broader context than the first test against Sri Lanka, who should make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the election president, on call at least under this special title, here is to help the head coach Peter Moores and captain Michael Vaughan decide, and because the table of High Morries, the English executive director, gradually fills himself with applications for national voters, if not for which in part time.
Whoever does not get the sixth hit position will be unhappy, but life is often unfair and the sport is undoubtedly it.
It is never easy to nail exactly, which enables a person to reach the top of his profession, while someone else never goes beyond the lowest rank, sometimes because of lack of happiness rather than ability.
It is not only in the cricket, where the choice is difficult, where judgments are necessary, which are always subjective at the end.
Is it the right time to get up for Bopara?
Is it fair to Shah when he does?
The same may be possible in another area, for example, whether John Edwards or "Tubby" Bannerjee, both intelligent young managers, should be promoted with good conclusions that are well-known to the business.
Who can say what is the right class for a cricket player, unless he is given the opportunity to swim or go down.
Of course, figures have a major impact on decisions, but opportunities do.
Within a team, a cricket player has to catch the captain's eye at the right time if he can take a twist and a racket has to get regular chances on order if he wants to impress as a one-day cricket player.
Catching the eyes of the pickup is more complicated.
There were many who were better in the last season than, for example, James Anderson, who seems to be playing in the first test, even if Stephen Harmison says himself healthy and how the wind is tickling into the nets.
Anderson took 32 first-class Wickets with 33 runs each to earn a position in this tour.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 with the same modest average, but both had their highlights and hoped for even more.
Whether Shah or Bopara plays at the Asgiriya Stadium can only be a question of opinion.
The choice could decide the careers of both men, or it might make little difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Martha Batty played in every test and was successful in the first, with five Wickets and 40 useful runs, but it was Paul Collingwood, fighting at that time to strengthen himself, which made the breakthrough a significant testkricket player and which, although scored a double hundred against Australia in Australia, may still be underestimated.
It is likely that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores will follow their conservative instincts and abdominal feeling for Shah's greater experience of Bopara's youthful enthusiasm after a further discussion at today's Asgiriya Stadium network meeting.
There are arguments for both.
For Shah, his sparkling and valuable 88 test debut in Bombay speaks of 43 first-class hundreds and only six of Bopara, who is seven years younger at the age of 22, and an excellent balance against turned balls.
But Shah made only ten runs in his two innings in May against West Indies in the test in Lord, his native arena as a player from Middlesex, and this, plus his immediate rejection of the electorate as Vaughan, was healthy to take back his position for the next game, seems to have taken the swing out of his strokes that was still obvious in Bombay.
In contrast, the all-rounder from Essex has a decent joy of life.
He's not impressed by anything on a cricket spot and his attitude away from it was put to the point when he had recently missed a four-wheeled vehicle in an exhibition for England's sponsor Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and probably a shock, but the first thing he did was take out his vodafone (of course also sponsored) and call on his teammate Alastair Cook, who had observed this from a distance, and with enthusiasm to say, "Did you see this?".
Bopara is a much better field player, he bowls his middle rate with some effect here on the playing fields, which seems to fit to him and beats with confidence and skill.
To choose the right man is one thing to choose the right time to choose another.
Maybe that's the actual art of selecting.
I tend to give Bopara his chance now, which does not mean that Shah may not stand well, if, as the tea set from Ceylon suggests, he is the one who will play here this weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and to fight Al-Quaida
The first bus charges of Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived yesterday in Baghdad, with a stream of displaced persons whose funds or visas had expired, and others who hoped the city would return to normality.
Some had even returned to fight the rebels they had expelled from their homes.
At the Mansour Bus Station, even before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in an official government convoy of a dozen buses, the terminal was operational with refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned in private transportation.
"I decided to go to Syria after they had killed many doctors in Baghdad," said Sabah Al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
"I came back today because of what I saw on TV and what I read in the newspaper about what happened in Baghdad, and how it would be safe now."
They say that the Mahdi Army has stopped killing people," he said, in relation to the Shiite militias of the militant clariker Moqtada Al-Sadr, who ordered his forces to be restored at the present time.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shiite teacher from the vast Sunni part of Amariyah, returned with his two children because he could not renew his Syrian visa and because the regime did not allow Iraqis to work.
His Shiite neighbors in Amariyah called him to tell him that a local Miliz, supported by the United States, helped to drive Al-Qaida out of their bastion in the west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the new arrivals from Jordan was the leader of a Sunni and Shiite tribe who had been expelled from his house in Sleikh in the north of Baghdad by an attack with hand grenades after he had asked his fellow citizens to fight Al-Qaidas.
He had come back to fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they had started a anti-Al-Qaida mill in Sleikh and that they needed my support and that of my boys.
That's why I returned today," said Sabah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many have said that they have been attracted by the increasing calm in the capital since the rise in the US troops and the growth of local "citizens affected" who defend their districts armed and in cooperation with the American military.
But more spoke of having been forced home through visa problems and far-reaching funds in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, a 51-year-old three-year-old father, expressed the general suspicion among the exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shiite Prime Minister, had asked the Syrian government to impose visa restrictions on refugees to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people have probably fled from the sectarian death squadrons in the country.
"We went well until al-Maliki visited Syria and the government forced the Iraqis to stop giving them visas to force them to return to Iraq," said Sunni pensioner.
"I can't trust a government that supports the criminals who burned down my house after I left."
Part of the reason for the decline in violence is that Sunni were expelled from Shiite residential areas and vice versa, which led to the creation of many places where tensions have dropped.
There are fears that a sudden inflow of refugees will arouse sectarian tensions and conflict will arise.
Small Saarland, good education
The smallest state is a leader in vocational training and even shines with the international orientation of its universities.
Only in one field of education does the Saarland countries express the same deficit as the rest of the country.
"I explained yesterday for the 50th time to a non-saarman that we are not French" - this slogan places the smallest state self ironically on its 50th birthday.
France and Luxembourg play a major role in the education system of Saarland, which is in number five in the educational monitor of the Institute of the German Economy Cologne (IW).
The universities already cooperate closely with neighbouring countries out of tradition.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
To date, students can complete their studies with a double or even triple diploma.
Accordingly, the proportion of foreign students is 15.6 percent.
But the country children also bring Saarland to the universities in an above-average number - many of them without a degree in the gymnasium.
"The vocational education system is used in Saarland," says Axel Plünnnecke, educational expert at the IW.
More than every fifth youth acquires his degree in a vocational school, thus the Saarland is more than seven percentage points above the federal average.
The combination possibilities of vocational and academic training are also relatively widened.
As measured by the population, the equipment with dual study programmes is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical training and increasing demand, the number of engineering graduates has fallen by one third in recent years.
That is why the Saarland Ministry of Education has now committed the universities to a marketing campaign for engineering subjects.
"After the first Pisa study, we started several reforms at the general education schools," says a spokesperson from the Ministry of Education.
The government thus carried out national comparative tests.
For children to learn earlier, the last Kita year is free of charge - a model that is now also copying other federal states.
Whether the performance of the students can be improved in a sustainable way will only show future comparative studies.
Pisa 2003 saw the share of risk students shrink from 29 to 20 percent.
In total, however, Saarland did not increase as much as other federal states.
The Bavaria are more likely to be.
And to the Saar countries, foreign language skills at Pisa are not measured - in this area one could otherwise score.
For the language of the neighbors is compulsory to gymnasia - even though the Saarland countries are not French.
Chávez sets the clocks
In Venezuela the clocks will tick different from the rest of the world.
On 9 December, President Hugo Chávez has the timepieces in the South American country turned back by half an hour.
In Spain, Chávez is now becoming a joke figure.
According to a new law, as reported by the Official Journal of Venezuela, the clocks are set to the world time minus four and a half hours.
This gives the South American state a time zone that does not exist in any other country in the world.
The U.S. enemy Chávez justified his decision, among other things, that the United States of the world had imposed full time division.
In addition, on Wednesday (local time) Chávez announced the termination of relations with the neighboring country of Colombia because of a hostage affar.
The left-wing nationalist said that as long as the conservative Alvaro Uribe remains President of Colombia, he would not have relations with either the Head of State or the Colombian Government.
"I can't do this on my own because of my dignity," said Chávez, who is pursuing a constitutional reform on which the oil-landers must vote in a referendum on Sunday.
With the reform, he would significantly expand his power in the country.
The trigger of the dispute was Uribes' decision to withdraw Chávez's mandate to negotiate with Marxist rebels in Colombia, in which it was about the release of hostages.
Uribe had speculated Venezuela with his decision "in the face," Chávez criticised on Sunday.
Also in Spain is Chávez in all mouths.
A new cell phone ring makes for Furore in the country: "Por qué no te callas" (Why don't you shut your mouth) is the sentence that has already downloaded more than half a million people from the Internet.
He was spoken by Spain's King Juan Carlos, who, at the recent Ibero-America summit, was struck by the constant calls of the left-wing populist who had crossed his mouth.
German Threat 2007 Wage Minus
Despite the strong economic situation, German workers are forecasting a real wage loss this year.
Experts called a whole bunch of reasons for their pessimistic prognosis.
According to a calculation by the Hans-Böckler Foundation, employees could actually expect less on the salary account in 2007 than in the previous year.
"This is due to the modest wage development, the increase in VAT and the price gap in food and energy," said Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomics and Economic Research of the "Image" newspaper.
New burdens may also arise from unemployment insurance for workers.
Minister of Finance Peer Steinbrück said the "Neuen Osnabrücker Zeitung", the planned reduction of unemployment insurance to 3.3 percent on the change of year would be correct and reasonable in the current situation.
However, if the Federal Employment Agency should not again be embarrassed to ask for loans or grants from the Federation, the SPD politician was quoted.
On Tuesday it was announced that the price explosion in food and mineral oil products had driven the inflation rate to the highest level for 13 years.
Overall, prices rose by 3.0 percent year-on-year.
Venus is the heavenly twin of the earth
In spite of its life-enemy atmosphere, Venus is more similar than previously thought: The European space probe "Venus Express" has discovered lightnings in the atmosphere and wind whirls to the Poles, as they occur on earth in winter.
For almost three decades, scientists have suspected that it flashes on Venus.
Now the European probe "Venus Express" has provided proof - it felt electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere: the lightnings on Venus shoot at a height of about 56 kilometers from cloud to cloud, reports Christopher Russel from the University of California in Los Angeles in the science magazine "Nature".
According to the famous "Ursuppen theory", lightnings have created life on earth: thunderstorms should have stimulated reactions in the ocean that led to the formation of amino acids, the building blocks of life.
Not so on Venus: "If there ever was life there, it must have been in the very early history," explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
Today there is hardly any living thing on the surface of Venus: the atmosphere is about a hundred times closer than on earth, there are sometimes temperatures of 500 degrees.
"The Venus may be the devil's will for the earth, but it's a twin," said Russel.
Why Venus, which is similar to Earth in mass and size, has taken such a completely different development, is the fundamental question of the Esa mission.
The launch of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was a milestone for Venus research, as since the beginning of the nineties no probe had been on its way to explore this planet.
According to the researchers, the latest research results, which are now presented in several "Nature" articles, not only highlight the uniqueness of Venus within the solar system.
"They also show that the similarities of our neighboring planet with the Earth are greater than initially accepted," the Esa tells us.
In addition to the already known whirlwind on the North Pole, the researchers also found a cloud strudel on the South Pole, which rotates even faster.
The phenomenon is reminiscent of air currents on the earth's winter hemisphere, written by a research team around Giuseppe Piccioni from the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmoca.
The second-internal planet of the solar system has almost the same mass as the Earth and is nearly as large with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers.
The planet, also known as the morning or the evening star, orbits the sun in almost 225 days.
But it turns much slower around itself: a Venus Day lasts 243 days.
Although the Venus with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar hardly reminds the earth, scientists assume that both planets have developed under very similar conditions.
On both of them gathered water that remained on earth in oceans, but on which Venus was lost into space.
And while carbon dioxide is fixed on earth in carbonate rocks, it is the majority of the atmosphere on Venus.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama
Federal President Köhler calls for an end to the dispute over the reception of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellor's Office.
Indirectly he criticized the SPD for her attacks on the chancellor after the meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler is concerned about Germany's reputation and has asked the great coalition to end the fight for the reception of the Dalai Lama.
"We should not present a divided nation to the outside world on this issue," Köhler said to the Handelsblatt.
At the same time, Köhler signaled understanding of the reception of the Dalai Lama by Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
"Human rights have universal validity for me, even if I respect the diversity of cultures," said Köhler.
Everyone knew that Germany had to maintain sensitive balances in foreign policy, the Federal President stressed, but took Merkel in front of the allegation that they had a new China policy.
"The Chancellor did not distance himself from the traditional one-China policy.
That also knows China," said Köhler.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) had indirectly shown dissatisfaction about the reception of the Dalai Lama and had therefore been attacked from a number of the Union.
Steinmeier complained, among other things, of the Union's "window policy" in foreign policy.
After the reception of the Dalai Lamas in the Chancellor's Office, severe irritations occurred in the German-Chinese relationship.
For example, the Chinese leadership not only invited German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD) but, after information from SPIEGEL, also frozen the so-called Strategic Dialogue of the foreign ministers of both countries.
China's head of government Wen Jiabao has now asked Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel to admit the reception of the Dalai Lamas as a mistake.
China rejects it when European politicians officially receive the religious leader of Tibetans, Wen Jiabao reaffirmed the Chinese position.
The actions and words of the Dalai Lamas showed that he is trying to separate Tibet and the other Tibetan region, which includes other current provinces, from China.
Schäuble warns about bruising as in France
Street battles with the police, shots, burning cars: Wolfgang Schäuble warns of krawalls as in France.
Everything must be done so that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not discharge itself into violence on the streets, demanded the Federal Minister of the Interior.
Barricades burned, Randaliers shot at the police with shotguns: German Federal Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears similar development after the heavy youth crawalls in France.
"We need to ensure that social explosives are not built up and turned into violence.
We need to take this seriously," he said the "New Press" published in Hanover.
Not every young person copes with the rapid change in social reality.
Federal Government, countries and municipalities were already working hard to reduce problems, said Schäuble.
This is not just the integration of migrants.
"From the integration summit to the Islam Conference, this is already the first success."
However, it was too early for warning.
Schäuble also pointed out that in German suburbs there are no urban and sociological problems as in France.
In the northern suburbs of Paris, young people had supplied heavy street battles with the police over the past nights.
Also in Toulouse burned cars and public buildings.
On the other hand, the Chairman of the Turkish Community in Germany, Kenan Kolat, called for greater integration efforts by the Federal Government.
In view of the krawalls in France, Kolat warned about "impact effects".
Although the situation in Germany is not as fragile as in France.
But there is still a need for action.
Colat pointed out that the unemployment rate among young people with a migration background below 25 years of age was "over-average".
In particular, more training places need to be provided.
Colat stressed: "We must give young people a perspective."
However, the chairman of the Turkish community added that in Germany more than in France, "social control is taking place in the families".
Furthermore, many youths with a migration background did not want to destroy what their parents have built here.
Colat warned, "But we still have to be careful."
One had to give young people "fastly the opportunity to participate in work and training".
Meanwhile it remained largely quiet at night in the Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bel.
Hundreds of police were on duty, a helicopter was flying over the area with headlights.
The competent authorities reported three arrests as well as a few burning garbage and cars.
Since the day before, a command of around 1000 security forces has been a source of rest.
The police will intervene as long as it is necessary to announce that Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie announced a visit to the suburb.
During the night on Tuesday, about 80 police officers were injured at the Viliers-le-Bel in Krawallen.
On the following night, the troubles overcame Toulouse.
The cranes were inflamed by a traffic accident that killed two young people on Sunday.
According to the first findings of the prosecution, the police are not guilty of the death of the young.
In the Kingdom of Angela Wolke
The chancellor's remote appearance documents that the coalition is in the end - and that she herself is not expected to do anything.
In which country does this Chancellor actually live?
After their dismal appearance in the general debate of the Bundestag, which was angry and low in content, one has to say: not here - not in the country which has finally to be ruled by it.
The accusation that they are too focused on foreign policy has rejected Angela Merkel with a very superfluous sentence.
That's provincial, she said, and she only showed that she doesn't want to understand what the critics are about.
In the Bundestag, she has documented for everyone how much their accusations apply.
There was neither a concrete interest nor a feeling for the problems in the country.
Instead, Angela Wolke presented himself: a retired politician, who flees to foreign policy and remains in danger there.
Example Climate Protection: Since it praises itself unobstructed for the decisions of Heiligendamm, it does not say how the climate targets are to be achieved in this country.
In general, self-lob - so much indifference would the CDU Chefin have failed two years ago.
Now she clogs to the flossels that the upsurge with the people.
She thus damaged her image as a pragmatist, solving problems instead of making the world beautiful.
But in Angela Wolke's realm, internal problems are a margin.
Child poverty and the concerns of low earners?
She's got a few sidelines left for it.
It is significant how often it promises when it comes to the children's allowance.
Three runs need Merkel to produce a straight set in half.
It stumbles like on a strange terrain when it becomes concrete.
Attack Division
In the YouTube debate of the Republican presidential candidates, the two favourites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney deliver a hard hit exchange - and now have to fear an outside candidate.
The tension of the candidates is already happening on the first topic.
He has made New York a "place of refuge for illegal immigrants", beats Mitt Romney to his opponent Rudy Giuliani.
On the other hand, this concert was with serious accusations: "I would say that his own house was a port for illegals," Giuliani denied and accused the former governor of Massachusetts of having employed private immigrants without papers.
The candidates blew the attack: because the Republican base still has no clear favorites, the eight presidential candidates use the debate on CNN in particular to discredit their opponents.
The self-turned 30-second videos that Internet users have sent in via YouTube are hardly more than a keyword.
"With this kind of isolationism we have allowed Hitler to come into power," says John McCain to announce to his opponent Ron Paul, who is the only one in the round calling for an immediate deduction from Iraq.
Romney also gets a strong reading of the Levites from Vietnam-Veteran when he refuses to condemn the so-called "Waterboarding", an interrogation method in which drowning is simulated as torture.
However, that the important themes of the campaign are now beyond Iraq’s war and torture debates, the reactions of the Hall Public in St. Petersburg in Florida show.
Whenever conservative values are praised and future tax increases are rejected, the Auditorium is pleased.
The weaknesses of the two favourites are shown once again.
"I was wrong at that time," explains Romney.I am advocating that he was still one of the abortion advocates in 1994 before the base and television audience.
Giuliani, on the other hand, comes to sling when, in his opinion, he is asked about the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf reigns for the first time in civilian
One day after his resignation as army chief, Pakistani powerman Musharraf was defended as president.
This ended eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf has been defended for another five years on Thursday.
Pakistani television transmitted the ceremony live in the presidential palace of the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf swore to respect the Constitution and act for the benefit of the nation.
On Wednesday, he had handed over his army head to Ashfaq Kiyani, and with this international pressure he bowed himself, especially from the USA.
Eight years after his conquest of power, the former general now reigns as civil head of state in a bloodless military coup.
With his resignation as Chief Commander of the Forces, Musharraf had fulfilled a core challenge of the opposition and the West.
Another central requirement is an end to the state of emergency imposed on Musharraf on 3 November.
Soon after his oath, Musharraf, according to the Advocate General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, will remove the state of emergency and thus fulfill a further demand from the West.
The Supreme Court of the country, which Musharraf had occupied with him weighted lawyers at the beginning of November following the imposition of the derogation, had rejected all opposition to the controversial re-election of the Chief of State on 6 October last week.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed in the northern tribal region of North Wales in an attack on a military convoy and four were injured.
According to an army spokesman, the bomb exploded on a road near the border with Afghanistan.
The fathers of the herb skirt come back
Germany's seventies supergroup again plays: The three members of Harmonia re-recorded their consoles at a concert in Berlin.
At Revival, a part of their great time "Live 1974" appears.
They were already much more famous abroad.
The spirited sensation then takes place in the form of three men set at the evening table.
Everyone has his box in front of them, his cables and, above all, his buttons.
Dieter Moebius is staring in the flowery white shirt of 63 years in the middle.
Left flanked by Michael Rother, 57 years young and owned by laptop and guitar.
Right, viewed from the Auditorium, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, is concentrated on the console.
Everyone contributes sounds, sometimes even beats.
And sometimes it accidentally adds to a traditional piece of music.
This does not seem to be a big problem for the gentlemen themselves.
That the band has played Harmonia again has caused some excitement among herbrock lovers.
Where to reveal: Targeted demand has shown that the name was swirling through the collective pop memory, but not so sustainable in order to miss this band painfully for 32 years.
But why should not the Germans also be allowed to celebrate his living legends from the 1970s?
Especially what is meant by misleading herbrock in England and America was more and more true than in its own country.
When the music industry presented the echo award for the life work to the survivors of the Cologne group Can 2003, the hall saw in questioning German pop faces.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers also thanked the bands La Düsseldorf and New!, the surprise knew no limits.
Michael Rother later stared at the Red Hot Chili Peppers on stage like an old buddy at concerts.
The problem of ignorance at home and the renunciation in the stranger is the one.
The memory is therefore preoccupied with Harmony, because the trio existed only two years and at that time also developed a much lower power of action than was subsequently assigned to them by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had already played under the promising name Cluster with the artist Conrad Schnitzler.
At first you played in the basement under the Berlin Schaubühne.
Then in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons, for a plate label held by the Church.
Rother had briefly picked up at Kraftwerk and then became a guitarist with Neu!, who was perhaps the most radical German group at the time.
In 1973, however, Rother followed the cluster musicians into exile to Forst in the Weserbergland.
There, in the Old Weserhof, a ruins dating back to the 16th century, they lived as city-flighters.
Less ideological than in the municipality of I, where Roedelius was allowed to plague himself as a child girl.
It's rather in pointed artist's face.
It is said that a whirl of the singing club Harmonia Ottenstein and the name for art was also found in the bulk waste.
Some of them held Harmony.
The first album was called "Music of Harmonia" and the following "De Luxe".
For so let and modest the music also sounded, the band suffered material hardship.
The collection of rice was not alone for self-convention.
The CD "Live 1974" now released was recorded at a concert in Griesem, in front of a close to 50-member record scene, as someone believes to be inventing.
Rother's desire at that time was to force Harmony and to practice it occasionally.
For Roedelius and Moebius, an immoral demand.
The band declared its separation in 1975.
Rother landed in the Esoteric-Spherical and secured his existence with albums such as "Flaming Hearts".
Cluster was revived in the eighties and has been more successful since then than it has ever been Harmony.
The Griessem live album is due to Herbert Grönemeyer.
His record company Grönland has set itself the goal of caring for the herbrock as an expensive German contribution to living music.
New! has already been excavated like Roedelius Solowerk.
The physical resurrection of Harmonia takes place in the Berlin House of World Cultures.
Publicly subsidized, within the framework of the festival Woldtronics.
Julian Cope is there, the Brit, the old punk and author of the manual "Krautrock Sampler".
There's also the love parade inventor Dr. Motte.
The entire range of influences of the Krautrock was surrounded by the following pop music.
Harmonia fills the Supergroup space.
The movement of Brian Eno floats with the most unusual sounds in the hall: "The only true music, you belong to the future."
There are pictures that show the producers with harmonies in the farmhouse.
The legend is used by projections of further black and white photographs of wired equipment.
Before that, the three veterans are again involved in improvisation.
No longer by sticking microphones to the organ and drums to unearthed sounds to the instruments via self-bastling effects devices.
Today, electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three in the technical deepener.
The choir of the house doesn't change anything either.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgensterns, sound clouds are honed and erased and sung in a beautiful place with Emphase "Aaaaaaah!".
Krautrock was always a very English term.
It was never rock.
The roots were sought less in blues than in music universities (can), technologies (powerworks), or escape from artistic and social conventions (clusters).
Anyone who calls here "'68!" is not quite wrong, and Harmony can't get out of peace even now.
The most natural is thoroughly covered on stage.
Where does music start, and when does it stop?
This can rob you of nerves or bring great happiness to fleeting moments.
Richard Gere is just not cynical enough
Two films deal with the Balkan War with "The Hunting Party" and "Morderian Peace".
But both don't convince.
Either the concepts put too much on action and ball or they are too touchy.
Richard Gere in "The Hunting Party" can't help either.
The good news first: Although the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, but calculated there, in the dark hinterland of the Bosnia War, the actor Richard Gere has now been found.
We had finally lost sight of the most beautiful man of the 1980s, because all too many nice and careless roles in well-being films for women and all too many press conferences on Buddhism have driven out a desire to look at them.
Now, Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument to "The Hunting Party - When the Hunter Becomes Hunt" (Why do movie titles have to be always as long and hard as Lokführer-daily agreements?) perhaps to look at.
He provides a wonderfully eye-crowding representation: basically, his war reporter Simon Hunt is what could have been done from Gere if fate and the film industry were not so gracious: a man who has been behind him for a long time, but who has preserved himself as a ruined monument of his demise still considerable remains of the former charm.
But in spite of this trump, "The Hunting Party" continues together with the German production "Mordrian Peace", which also starts this week, only the endless series of failed Balkan war films.
The film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who save a Serbian from cosovarian hedge protectors, and one immediately falls in love with them.
Although it is welcome that the Serbs are not presented here as the sole root of all evils, the TV flat film loses itself too quickly in ginger and action.
It remains a kind of "alarm for Cobra 11" without highway but with war for it.
On the other hand, "The Hunting Party" can be investigated in an exemplary way, why there has never been a really good Balkan war film.
The story of three U.S. war reporters, who come up to track the Serbian chief war criminal "fuchs", might have become a new "Apocalypse Now" at another time with another director and screenwriter (both in Personal Union Richard Shepard).
Because the stories are quite questionable: both teams go to the woods to accomplish something that the military cannot do, and both times it will be a journey into madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is that Simon Hunt isn't just letting himself be the descending cynic with heart when he's introduced to us at the beginning.
No, the script has to join him on top of it a romantic affair with a later murdered Muslim Bosnierin.
Finally, "The Hunting Party" goes down the stream when, within the last five minutes, the reporters are able to do what Nato, CIA and all world's captains did not do in five years: Catch the war criminals and leave the Muslim Bosnians to a just revenge.
This is so bad that one wants to call on the International Court of Justice in The Hague for crimes against the Kinologik.
The film has a deep human concern.
He wants to suggest that Karadzic and Mladic are still running around freely, and he suspects the Americans and the French (in particular, they should agree) not too intensively to pursue the persecution due to secret political agreements.
But the good mind and evil are sometimes similar to that of a famous Brecht poem.
It says about the wooden mask of an asian demon on the poet's desk: "I feel I see the swollen foreheads, pointing out: how strenuous it is to be evil."
Films such as "The Hunting Party" have just such swallowheads, which however indicate how strenuous it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the genre of the Balkan war film.
Recently, this newspaper reported that all Iraq movies were Hollywood's big flops.
You can add: There has never been a good South Africa film before.
Almost always, if a star floats on the world's crisis heroes or minefields, then something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, "Outside all borders" with Angelina Jolie or "Blutdiamanten" with Leonardo DiCaprio will come out.
Perhaps all the conflicts are just too close for a while.
After all, it had to last decades before Hollywood with "Schindler's List" could film a good film over the Holocaust.
Some films will probably still mature - the now classic Vietnam works "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jacket" have not at all been single-lightly celebrated as masterpieces.
But perhaps today we know where every mass murder comes home in real time on two screens, too much about the world's conflicts.
And that robs the scriptwriters of the carelessness it needs to tell good stories.
After all, "his or not being" or "The Great Dictator" have become so good because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not yet know how bad the Nazi regime really ruled.
Maybe you don't want to be good if you want to make good movies.
Perhaps you have to have the sarcasticly distanced artist's view of the Romanian Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about parallels between his historical novel "Lemprière's Dictionary" and the Balkan War, he replied, "That's just because some things never change.
Big cities will always be terriblely dangerous, people will always be horribly murdered and always war will reign in Yugoslavia."
Criticism for Olympic Absage by Beust
In the case of politics and economics, the mayor’s withdrawal from the Hamburg Summer Olympics application has met with severe criticism.
Many want to keep fighting for the games on the water.
But by Beust realism exhorts in the assessment of opportunities.
The Chief Executive Officer of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, called a renunciation on Wednesday "not good for the business location".
No other project has recently developed as great motivation in the city as the Olympic idea.
"Without this goal, the sports policy momentum could not be maintained to the same extent."
Schmidt-Trenz urged the Senate not to bury the project, but to find a new long-term approach to "the starting point of a changed beam of time".
Mayor Ole von Beust stayed on Wednesday with earlier statements that the Olympic ambitions of Hamburg were unrealistic at least until 2028.
"Not Hamburg decides on an Olympic application, but the German Olympic Sports League," said Beust WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the Sportbund's expected decision on a Munich application for the Winter Games 2018 expected at the beginning of December.
"This preference means for us that we will not have realistic opportunities in the period until 2028 that we have been thinking of so far."
Nevertheless, the dream was not dreamed for all time, said by Beust.
The Hamburger Sportbund (HSB) regretted Beust's statements.
This gives the impression that Hamburg will no longer apply for Olympic Games in the next 25 years.
"It's too early to grow a chance by burying the plans already at that time," said HSB President Günter Pluss on Wednesday.
A refusal to apply is also contrary to the statement of the Head of Senate on the occasion of a reception to the General Assembly of the German University Sports Association.
There, by Beust, the application of Hamburg for the University of Hamburg in 2015 called "not a replacement" for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The University Sports Association had only nominated Hamburg as a candidate city last week.
The SPD-Bürgerschaftsfraktion accused the Senate not to have used valuable time for housing in Hamburg.
"The development of the Kleine Grasbrooks has been delayed for years by the Senate because it has placed on the map Olympia and stopped the housing building," said the SPD members Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD for the Kleine Grasbrook always demanded an integrated planning for Olympia and a later use of living, the CDU has set one-sided on the "event factor".
The application for the 2012 Summer Olympics had caused a great enthusiasm in Hamburg at the time.
Hamburg, however, had failed Leipzig.
These are not Warhol's boxes.
Those who connect the terms Sweden and the wooden box think of Ikea, but not of Andy Warhol.
Is it?
Currently, dark shadows on Warhol's work directory are being produced in Sweden.
Most of the fourty-four Brillo boxes listed there are counterfeits.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" a few months ago raised doubts about the authenticity of Andy Warhol's Brillo-Boxen of 1968, internal research in the Moderna Museet in Stockholm now results in a sobering result: The six "Brillo-Boxes", which the former museum director Pontus Hultén gave the Moderna Museet 1995 as a gift, are copies - and probably also most of the approximately one hundred additional Brillo boxes of "Type Stockholm", which are in circulation on the international art market.
The history is nested, a confusing chain of artistic and curatorial productions.
In 1964, Warhol created his first "Brillo Boxes", painted wooden boxes based on the red-blue-white design of the cardboard carton of the soap powder "Brillo".
An exhibition of his works at the Moderna Museet 1968 - with Warhol's consent - presented hundreds of Brillo boxes from cardboard: These (for cost reasons) did not come from Warhol, but were delivered directly from the Brillo cartridge factory.
It was not a work of art, it was merely a work of art, but a work of art.
At the same time, Warhol was granted permission in 1968 to produce a few Brillo wooden boxes in Sweden, but they were not exhibited in the Moderna Museet.
Contemporary witnesses now speak of about fifteen boxes, which at that time have entered the art and auction history as authorized original Andy-Warhol-Brillo-Boxes called "Type Stockholm".
Some of them have achieved more than 100 000 dollars on auctions.
The problem now is that the legendary museum director Pontus Hultén falsely later claimed that it had been produced and exhibited in Sweden in 1968 and that Warhol had then left him.
In fact, Hultén's 105 boxes were only produced in Malmö in 1990 for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
At that time, Warhol had been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, Chief Conservator of Moderna Museet, has also examined three of Swedish private property's six museum's Brillo boxes, two of which were made in Stockholm in 1968: their press boards were first grounded and melted off, and then white oil was applied with a brush.
The structure of the 1990 copies, on the other hand, reveals that the colour was applied directly to the pressboard with a painter's roll - in addition, it is not oil, but acrylic paint.
"These boxes were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol's Brillo Boxes," says the director of Moderna Museet, Lars Nittve: "If the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' in New York does not come to a different conclusion, the Moderna Museet will classify the six boxes in his collection as copies/exhibition material."
As early as July, the Authentication Board announced that it will follow the "heavy accusations" that will be made in terms of soap powder boxes.
But since then, one has been shrouded there in inexorable silence.
Rebelling soldiers in Manila give up
In the Philippines, rebellious soldiers gave up in a hotel in Manila and demanded the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
He could not blame bloodshed, said the leader Antonio Trillanes, who accused the president of corruption and election fraud, reporters at the hotel.
Governmental soldiers had stormed the hotel previously under tear gas use.
The about two dozen soldiers had been in the building for hours.
About half of them stood in court on Thursday for a failed coup in 2003 - among them trillanes.
He used the trial to suddenly drop with around 30 sympathizers.
The military police who were supposed to guard him had apparently passed over to him and joined his mutiny.
They invaded the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Loyal government troops shut down the district around the convenient hotel.
The President called for an urgent meeting of the Security Cabinet.
National security adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the actions of the soldiers.
"People have enough," said Trillanes.
"We call on people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, who had previously ordered the elite unit of the Scout Rangers, said that other army units wanted to join the march soon.
Government critics had called for great demonstrations against the President for Friday.
Your government has been overshadowed by corruption charges for months.
Manila's financial district was already the main site of the attempted mutiny of about 200 military members against Arroyo in 2003.
The uprising failed to join the army after just under 24 hours.
Since 1986 there have already been at least seven coups against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.

United Internet has secured a share of more than 20 percent of Versatel’s telecommunications company.
The average price per share is 14,46 Euro, as the company announced on Wednesday evening.

With this step, you want to push forward the consolidation of the German DSL market, United Internet said.
Previously, estimates of entry had already occurred on Wednesday after Berenberg Bank increased its participation in the Düsseldorf network operator by a further 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
The money house held the shares only for a third party, it was called the financial market.
The day before, United Internet had already participated in the mobile phone company Drillisch with just under 10 percent.
As part of a capital increase, Drillisch placed 17.4 million new shares worth 106.4 million euros.

In addition, companies have started discussions on marketing cooperation for DSL and mobile products.
"We strengthen our partnership," explained a United Internet speaker.
The two companies set up the joint venture MSP to take over the competitors Freenet.
For the time being, the two companies want to be satisfied with a share of almost 10 percent of Freenet and do not make use of their right to take on another 18.49 percent of Freenet, United Internet announced on Thursday.
The two companies, however, kept open all options, in particular to further increase participation in Freenet AG, said.
Talks between the United Internet and Freenet about a strategic partnership had ended in mid-November.
The poker around Freenet, which has continued for months and is still hard to see, is part of the consolidation of the German Telekom market.
Freenet had 2.9 million mobile contract customers and 1.27 million DSL and complete customers at the end of the third quarter.
The holding of United Internet and Drillisch held directly 6.01 percent of the freenet shares so far.
Now it has been agreed that Drillisch will bring another around four percent.
The right to buy the 18.49 percent of the investment company Vatas had already been agreed in August.
