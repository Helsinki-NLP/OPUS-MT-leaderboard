Triumph of right-wing populists in Austria, total they reach 29 percent
After the first preliminary results, the preferred parliamentary elections of Sunday in Austria brought a significant weakening of both parties of the former great coalition and a clear strengthening of the right-wing populist parties.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) has suffered losses in particular, where the position of former chairman Wilhelm Molterer is seriously on top of the chicken.
In contrast, the elected head of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), the Carinthian head of state Jörg Haider, is preparing for a triumphal return to federal politics.
According to the results so far, the S & D (SPÖ) remains strongest in the country with 29.8 percent of the votes, but it loses 5.5 percent of the votes compared to the last elections in 2006.
Even worse, the ÖVP cut, which loses almost nine percent of the votes with 25.6 percent.
These are the worst results of these two major parties in the post-war history of Austria, and especially with the People's Party, who had requested the preferred elections, this is a truly disastrous result.
At the beginning of July, when the ÖVP left the coalition, the People's Party had a clear lead in front of the SPÖ.
The electorate, however, probably punished the party for failing the government.
Already in the first reactions to the results, there were speculations about the possible withdrawal of the party chairman and former Vice-President Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this could already be the case on Monday at an extraordinary meeting of the Party Board.
Such a development would probably pave the way to the most likely way out of the constituency, i.e. to a renewal of the great coalition of SPÖ and ÖVP.
In view of the strengthening of both right-wing populist parties - the Free (FPÖ) received provisionally 18 percent, the BZÖ eleven percent of the votes - the S & Ds expressed their fear at the same time that the 1999 could repeat, when the People's Party had agreed with the populists (at that time the FPÖ was still uniform, in 2005 it split off the BZÖ) with regard to a common government, which had even caused sanctions from the European Union.
Jörg Haider, who has already stated that he is ready to cooperate with each party, is clearly committed to the Austrian federal politics from a return to Vienna.
In addition, the Green Party joined Parliament, but it suffered slight losses and slid down from the third place among the Austrian political parties.
No other party has probably mastered the four percentages and has thus failed to enter Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India can cool down
In the view of Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg, if it did not succeed in solving the problem with the Czech scientists who were accused in India because of the illegal collection of beetles, a certain cooling of Czech-Indian relations could be achieved.
This was emphasized by the minister in New York after today's meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherdshi.
"If this does not clarify, then certainly, then there will be some cooling," he said after a meeting that took place on a Czech initiative.
Mukherdshi said after the talks that the executive could be hard to intervene in judicial matters.
Despite all of this, he argued that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was acquitted by the charge and who received a fine, wanted the central government with the local government in Dardjiling, in which the case law falls.
"His problem could be solved," said the Minister.
According to Mukherdshis, for Emil Kučera, who was sentenced to three years of imprisonment, it would be best if he were in appeal at a higher instance.
He could thus seek bail release and wait for his sentence in freedom, says the Minister.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner had expressed himself in the same way during negotiations.
"He recommends an appeal at a higher court, and he would have a pardon for him," said the Czech diplomacy chief.
The only way the Czech side can intervene in the whole matter is to let the convicted "competent legal support" be shown by the Indian minister.
At the same time, he said that such help is already offered to them by the Indian side.
"We have a great interest in maintaining good contacts with India that have a long-term tradition.
The Indians also added that," led Schwarzenberg.
At the same time, according to the Czech press agency ČTK, in front of his partner, the Czech Republic was of great importance to the problem of the Czech entomologists.
"We really think it is a big mistake to arrest and accuse these Czech scientists," he said.
An answer to the question of whether he had received from the Indian side the commitment to deal with the matter was given by the Minister.
"I was already quite promised," he merely observed.
A Czech focuses on ringing around the sea floor
It comes at an electronic map showing Australia and the adjacent sea areas.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but a small point, lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and together with it also the adjacent seabed.
The area is as large as the continent itself," said the Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is one of the thirty-member employees of the UN-Divison for Oceans and Maritime Rights.
His boss, Division Director, Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows and adds the interpretation.
This is where work and enthusiasm prevail.
The sea soil has so far been a little known world rich in natural sources.
Here you can find oil, further ore and other non-reproductive raw materials, but also unknown living organisms, which, for example, bear the key to developing a drug against cancer.
A sea ground, larger than the mainland
Today, the Anrainer States announced vehemently their claim to the new marine areas.
After a UN convention, they make use of their rights to which they agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay in Jamaica.
It is the area of the so-called continental Schelf, which often reaches up to a hundred kilometers [100 km] from the shores of a country to the sea.
According to the Convention, this country has an exclusive right to all sources of continental schelf.
"Simplified, as a continental shield, is considered the part of the seabed and its soles, which represents a natural continuation of the continent below the sea surface.
He crosses the shores, often also the border of two hundred miles of the so-called exclusive economic zone," explains Mikulka.
The application submitted by the relevant Member State of the Commission to establish the external borders of the continental Schelf must be verified by a comprehensive scientific and technical documentation based on many cost-intensive studies and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparatory work.
"One of our tasks is to provide the Commission with technical and legal assistance.
The Commission has so far negotiated five applications, namely Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far, only the last three countries have had success," added Mikulka.
An international echo recently encountered the success of Australia, which was the first country to have significantly enlarged its marine areas.
But even New Zealand is a winner - the expansion of the seabed, which was approved by the Commission last week, is about 1.6 million square kilometres, about six times the size of the actual state.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in the investigations.
The gain that will flow to them in the future from the use of the seabed will, as they promise, have an invaluable value.
Other countries will also present their applications gradually.
They can do this for ten years from the moment they ratify the "Agreement of Montego Bay".
There, where the continental Schelf ends, begins the area of the ocean floor, which is referred to by the convention as the "common heritage of mankind".
There will no longer be a special state here.
The right to promote in this area is granted by an international institution established by the Convention.
"But the sea floor is not a gold tomb country", says with some exaggeration director Mikulka, adding that its "individual areas are legally precisely defined and the system is locked up by contract".
Czech Republic
Part of the seabed also belongs to the Czech Republic today.
It shares it with other countries of the former East Bloc within the framework of the joint organisation "Interoceanmetal".
In 1991, due to the convention, as did the investors of some other countries, it was given the status of a so-called "roadbreaking investor".
The organization has the right to promote in the ClarionClipperton zone in the Pacific Ocean between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The area to be examined by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The seabed is divided there, it is a kind of tatra on the sea floor.
"Funding can be done on a total area of 75,000 square kilometres.
The area is a rich site of polymetallic concretes containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," said another lawyer, the Inder Pakshi Rajan.
The Macedonian employee of the Rober Sandev division brings such a concretion as a pattern.
It reminds of a small potato or, with some imagination, of the legendary shem which the legend has brought to life after the Golem.
German specialists were in the event of hostage liberation on site
The Egyptian government had called for aid from Germany to resolve the hostage crisis - the experts came.
When it became serious, the special units were ready, but they were not used.
In the circumstances of the liberation of eleven European tourists kidnapped in Egypt, more and more details become known.
According to the Ministry of Defence and Interior, German specialists were indirectly involved in the rescue operation.
Thus, specialists from the Bundeswehr as well as officials from the GSG 9 of the Federal Police Flyers' Staff, the Federal Criminal Office and logistics experts from the Technical Aid Office were on the site of liberation.
However, as ministers spokespersons continued on Monday evening, the German forces were not needed because the hostages let their prisoners run and fled when they recognized signs of a violent liberation.
The Egyptian government has accepted the aid offered by Germany to involve it as local support forces.
"Happyly, that's not what happened," said a spokesperson of the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
The group had abducted attackers from the five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian and eight Egyptian companions on September 19 in southern Egypt.
After the kidnapping in a desert area in southern Egypt, the hostages in the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad had been dragged down and down.
Until last, the identity of the hostages remained unclear as well as the details of the liberation or possible ransom payments.
The gratettes have now arrived well-kept in Cairo.
Steinmeier said that the free hostages were in the care of the German Embassy.
He did not express himself to details of the release.
At first, there was no information in Berlin when they returned to Germany.
According to "Image" newspaper, the five holidaymakers and the specialists are to be flown out with an Airbus of the Air Force and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
House refuses rescue package
The first chamber of the US Congress has barely failed the 700 billion-dollar rescue package for the financial markets.
The Dow Jones ran out into the depths.
With 206 votes to 227, the US House of Representatives rejected the government's rescue package for the financial markets.
Despite all appeals by U.S. President George W. Bush and leading politicians of both parties, there was no majority in the programme to limit chaos on the financial markets.
In a dramatic action, the proponents had desperately tried to convince the critics of the $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, one of the democratic negotiators, had called on Members to vote, even if the plan was unpopular.
"It is difficult to get political recognition for the prevention of something that has not yet occurred," he admitted.
In the course of the vote, the Dow Jones broke down by more than six percent or by 600 points.
The reason was concerns of investors that the state rescue package could fail.
He recovered shortly before the end of the vote, and then, after becoming aware of the failure, fell back.
Experts now expect further severe turbulence on the international financial markets.
The programme's entry into force requires the approval of both the House of Deputies and the Senate.
Organizers record increasing booking numbers
It seems to be a good winter for the German tour operators:
In the case of travel bookings for the coming months, sales increased significantly compared to the previous year according to a study - even by more than 30 percent for the winter season.
Despite poor economic prospects, the Germans' travel desire for a study remains unblemished.
In the winter season, travel agencies recorded a 31 percent increase in sales compared to the previous year, as reported by the German Travel Association (DRV) on Monday in Berlin.
According to the study by the market research institute GfK, booking figures have already been increased for the autumn months.
For example, the increase in travel agencies' turnover for October was around 11 percent compared to 2007, the DRV reported.
These results are based on GfK figures, which evaluates monthly booking data of 1200 German travel agencies and calculates them for the overall market.
The travel bookings made by the end of August 2008 were taken into account.
Due to the weak dollar price, particularly travel to the US, the DRV reported.
The increase in the amount of the booking here amounts to around one third.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as the local regions, are particularly sought-after destinations for the Germans.
In particular, vacation packages are high in the course, explained DrV President Klaus Laepple.
In view of the increasing costs for energy and food, the cost "to the customer is better calculated than for the individually organized holiday".
Money could save consumers, among other things, through early-book discounts or all-inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
The summer months were also very well booked, so that compared to the previous year, sales would again be increased, although according to a further study, the number of Germans who made a trip decreased in comparison to the previous year.
My first time, Oktoberfest
Ballermann-Apres-ski-Hits in the endless loop, beer from liters-klucks and promis in designer-directles.
A Wiesn debut.
Susanne Kronzucker and I don't have much in common.
She's blond, television presenter and wears a tailor-made dirndl.
I have dark hair, I'm a student, and my dress is second hand.
But one thing connects us: in just three minutes on the meadow, the photographers are already falling on us and cut the memory cards full - very flattering and that on my first visit.
That's how you make friends.
The Cheap Dirndl seems to fulfill its purpose.
As Wiesn-Touri and actually north of the Weisswurstäquator, the well-being remained in the trach until now.
But it's all half that bad before we first got to the Theresienwiese.
Almost everyone wears dirndl or leather pants; no one looks answerable or embarrassingly touched - everything completely normal.
Rare views of the chocolate stand only reap my dirndle.
A Munich woman reminds me that I had wrongly bound the shoe: "Host free, Middle Virgin, forgived right, whitened back."
Home third party I am using the loop from back to left.
"Past," he said, laughing.
Others make less effort for subtle flirting techniques and carry simple felt hats, on which "To drunk to get dressed!" stands and stretch out the naked back to an unkind.
The young man with the exhibitionist attigues is Bob, comes from England and also visits the October festival for the first time.
He finds it "gorgeous", with a long drawn "oooooo".
He tells me that after he took off his previous drunken measure.
Right next to one of these hydrants, all of which think he's a trasher.
So Bob is one of these infamous "wildbieslers."
Others are not lucky to get rid of alcohol in this way.
At eight o'clock in the evening, sanitians run in crowds across the party square, which has to take care of the poor Schlucker.
The nurses always appear in the row - always four at once drag a covered wearing from tent to tent.
It works as with most Wiesn visitors: Empty back, full back.
Whoever is in the Promille-Sarg under the plan, you can't see.
"These are the ones where goarner pack," one of the sanitians called me on request and disappeared in the tumble.
Name of the accident victim announced by the police
The name of a 63-year-old female walker who died in the hospital after she was hit by a vehicle in Essex was announced.
Carole Paulson, living on Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the accident on Friday afternoon on Shenfield Road in the city center.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later died.
A 51-year-old man was arrested after the accident because of the suspicions of reckless driving.
In the meantime, he was released on bail.
Turkey extends the diplomatic horizon
Long before Turkey sought to join the European Union, the European powers were interested in entering deeply into the hinterland of Turkey.
On the eastern side of Bosporus, perhaps just 20 steps within Asia, is one of the finest relics of this failed, imperial striving.
The Hydarpasha station was designed by the two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in Neo-Renaissance style.
That's at least what the travel guides tell you.
The building sits riders at the end of the platform with a tower at each corner of the front and looks like any provincial German town hall.
The rock is dirty.
The whole building collapses, for example.
But once you are inside the curved ticket switch, there is no doubt as to the magnitude of the project, whose western access was that.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, the Anatolia-Baghad Society.
Germany, which was a spotter in the imperialist game, had to implement its ambitions to dominate the Middle East, by means of a train connection to Damascus, Baghdad, and beyond what is today Saudi Arabia.
But Germany's imperialist projects paralysed during the first world war.
His railway tracks were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arabs.
The relative isolation of its surrounding region, created by the insurmountable borders of the cold war, has disappeared.
British forces sprang out of Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies from Palestine and Syria
And there was also bad news for the Hyderpasha station.
In 1917 a munition train flew into the air, destroying the artistic roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then, it has slowly disintegrated, largely passed away from history.
Today, however, this railway line, at least symbolically, serves as a gateway to Anatolia and all east of it to highlight the extension of the diplomatic horizon of Turkey.
The ruling judicial and development party, the ACP, has introduced a new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of the neighbouring regions, created by the borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
There is now a policy of rapprochement.
Remarkably, the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian dividers Hamas and Fatah, with Iran and Iraq and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
In order to be able to assess the key facts of this new foreign policy, I boarded the night train to the Turkish capital Ankara to visit one of the leading ACP foreign policy experts, the Turkish deputy Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning, about ten and a half hours later, after a rough ride on tracks that produced the same step of the old world in the well-known documentation "The Night Mail", I arrived in the Turkish capital, which is considered a new city, for the new worldly state project, to return to the Ottoman past.
However, the ACP, known for its Islamist roots, represents a paradigm shift in Turkish unity
This has triggered some distrust in the West, especially in Washington.
A taxi took me to the main AKP office, a specially crafted state-of-the-art stone and steel construction, in a developing suburb surrounded by semi-finished shopping centers and pubs in which middle managers met in suits, both men and women, to complete the first shops of the day.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a middle-right politician of almost any other political party in Europe.
Dress, tie, I'm sure he even packed a blackberry.
"The goal of the party's foreign policy is now to reintegrate Turkey with its immediate neighbouring countries.
The Cold War was an exception," he tells me.
Turkey had been cut off from its hinterland.
Today it has to look east and west at the same time.
There wouldn't be either one or the other.
She'd have to do both.
"But certainly Turkey could sometime," I asked, "to be forced to decide?"
"Turkish," he said, "does not have to make this decision."
He then highlighted a point that almost everyone I spoke to here almost routinely said: Turkey's relations, not only to the Middle East, but also to the Caucasus and around the Black Sea, are just as beneficial for Europe and the United States as they are for Turkey.
With Turkey on board, the message seems to be, in the sense of being transferred, can drive Europe as a whole on flat railways east towards Asia and the Middle East.
Back at Hydarpasha's station, after another largely sleepless night, I thought of these two German rulers Mr. Ritter and Mr. Conu, who had watched during the construction of this building 100 years ago.
How surprised they would have been to learn that Europe's ambitions in the Middle East could now, to a large extent, be in Turkey's hands.
And when I waited for the ferry that was supposed to take me back over the Bosporus, I remembered that Turkey was always called "the sick man of Europe" in those days.
At least at that time there seemed to be little doubt as to which continent should have a claim to this fascinating country.
In memory of Vernon Handley and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford's musical director since 1962, Vernon was "Tod" Handley (revoke on 11 September) responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic and Choir.
As part of his music program for the city, he founded his great youth choir, Proteus the following year.
He was intended for young people up to 21 years of age, but when the choir sang for the last time in 1979 some of us were already at the end of 20 - we simply refused to leave the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological form changer) stood for the willingness and ability of the choir to attack any piece of music that was presented to him, whether it was a Madrigal or from the Messiah, whether a capella or with full orchestra.
The musical versatility of such a young choir was often amazing, always exciting, and was unique and alone Thanks to the inspiration of that man and his enthusiasm for the music that never failed for years.
How often did death stop us from "to make the music speak for ourselves".
He used to say, "The composer knows what he wants."
It's all in the music.
So sing it!"
His way of conducting was absolutely clear and precise, never hearty but never excessive.
No matter how high the musical level was, he always demanded a higher level.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any conductor had been beaten to the knight, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the last two decades, from 1962 to 1982, in which he headed the Guildford Philharmonic.
Over the past 40 years, I have written reviews for over one hundred of his concerts and I can sincerely say that I was never disappointed by a single person - often I was inspired by them.
Death Handley was that rare combination of size and personal modesty.
He abhorred conductors who, according to his words, simply "went to house with one or two well-known shovels in the world."
So many of us will miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
In your appeal for William Woodruff (September 25,), write that "in 1946 he took over teaching economic history again in Oxford and in 1950 received a Houblon-Norman research scholarship ... while at the same time he studied for a BSc, a MA and a doctorate.
This is a conclusion from an author's comment in Woodruff's book "Beyond of Nab End", but it is not true.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a lecturer in economic history at the University of Nottingham and during that time he wrote a doctoral thesis on the British rubber industry under the supervision of Professor J.D. Chambers, who later was published in 1958 as "The British Rubber Industry".
He was in the United States in 1950-1951 during a Houblon Norman scholarship, and spent the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he finally left Nottingham and went to Illinois.
It is not known why Woodruff wanted to cover this part of his career.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philology.
`I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino `Flamenco and Life' because his photographs are fantastic in black and white, in documentary style.
They drew my attention to them because of their simplicity and because of the power they radiate, as they always deal with the protagonists with.
An exhibition that shows many feelings.
Resino knows how to find the magical moments."
Second round of excellent sales at Honda.
In November, Honda begins marketing the second generation of Honda Jazz.
While his predecessor model had a large interior space, this large-scale limousine offers a much larger size.
The technical fines also come to save even more comfortable driving and gasoline.
Changes before the upcoming revolution.
So is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although, aesthetically, the new jazz has a similar line to its predecessor, the changes that have been made in this large limousine are numerous.
Among other things, the innovative design, the new room flexibility, the larger dimensions of the car and the new mechanics are to be emphasized.
Nevertheless, before you start analyzing the new model, you have to say that this new jazz appears six years later, after the first generation was released on the market.
According to the first observations, Honda was able to renew this model for a shorter period of time compared to the other manufacturers.
Although the Honda Jazz in Europe is less known, this model is a phenomenon in terms of its sales on the other markets.
This is a case in Japan, in the country where jazz is the best-selling car in 2002 and also in the course of 2008.
After jazz appeared on the market, about a million models were sold in Japan alone.
The second market was the Old Continent, with about half a million cars sold in six years.
Still, Honda tries to increase the sale of the new jazz model within the segment.
In this way, while Japanese companies sold a total of 83 000 models of jazz in 2007, the expected estimates amount to 10,000 cars, which is 17% of the increase in the European market.
As far as the Spanish market is concerned, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 jazz models since 2002, which is 6.7% of the total sales to Honda in Spain.
As for the new generation of the model, the leaders of the branch in Spain expect to be able to sell 2,000 jazz models per year.
More precisely, the appearance of the new Honda Jazz model allows to cover down sales in Spain.
In reality, the leaders of the brand hope to complete the year with total sales of 22 000 models, which are 4,000 cars less than in 2007, a reduction of 16%.
Despite this increase in sales, Honda increased its market share in Spain compared to the previous year (1.6%) to 1.8%.
At the same time, the Japanese company hopes to reach 2% in 2010.
To achieve this proportion, Honda relies on the appearance of a new model.
It's Insight, a five-door hybrid car with a compact length of 4.7 metres, the Japanese company hopes to sell approximately 200,000 models a year throughout the world.
According to the Japanese manufacturer’s market estimates, 50% of Insight Models are sold in the United States, while the rest is distributed on the Old Continent and Japan.
The appearance of the insights on the market is planned for the first months of the year, for the first time its public presentation will take place in Valencia in January.
With regard to the first generation, the new jazz grows in all its sizes.
Its length is 3.90 metres (plus 5 centimetres), its width is 1.69 meters (plus 2 centimetres) and the distance between the axes is 2.50 meters, which leads to the assumption that it has grown to 5 centimetres.
The height, on the other hand, does not change and remains 1,52 meters.
Together with the increase of dimensions, the interior is also enlarged.
This success is due, on the one hand, to the new space flexibility programme and, on the other hand, to the central position of the fuel tank, a solution which was also used in the previous model of jazz.
The capacity of the trunk, which has a double loading area, also reaches up to 339 litres, i.e. 19 litres greater than the capacity of the first-generation trunk.
It must be stressed that these measures are available in the version with a 1.4 litre petrol engine, as the capacity of the Honda Jazz trunk with a 1.2-liter petrol engine is 379 litres.
Among other improvements, apart from the additional equipment elements such as leather seats or the possibility of building panoramic windows, improved access to the seats is offered.
The opening angle of the back doors is 80 degrees, with the first jazz having only 67 degrees.
The engines of the second generation of jazz are also new.
At the beginning of its marketing, this small model has 2 versions of the petrol engines: 1.2 and 1.4 litres.
Both variants have i-VTEC system, which allows low fuel consumption and smaller CO2 emissions, has excellent technical performance and simultaneously provides torque performance for the entire engine life.
The first 1.2 liter version achieves the 90 hp performance with 6 000 rotations with maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4 900 min?1 .
This petrol engine - the predecessor model of Jazz reached 78 hp - has 5.3 litres of petrol consumption and CO2 emissions of 125 grams.
With regard to the previous engine, which reached 83 hp in the previous generation, he is now able to reach 100 hp.
The Jazz 100 PS model 1.4 has 5.4 litres of petrol consumption and 128 grams of CO2 emissions.
'Auto-Biene', which avoids collisions
In order to promote the development of technologies for accident prevention, Nissan was inspired by nature, more precisely by the bees.
The Japanese company has developed a robot whose flight dates back to the swarming behavior of bees and avoids accidents.
This robot is a bio-mimetic car robot drive or BR23C and represents the first step in the technologies for accident prevention.
The engineers from Nissan Motor Co.'s technical development center have developed these small robots in cooperation with Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology at the renowned Tokyo University (Japan).
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Head of Technology-PR and R&D-Brand Management, the BR23C represents an extension of the four-layer Nissan safety sign.
This robot is intended to ensure that the cars of this brand are able to avoid the collisions.
During the flight, each bee builds up its own oval aircraft, which is very similar to the Nissan safety shield.
But the most important are the facetews of the bee, which can be seen in all directions over a 300 degree angle, which allows you to fly freely in their personal airspace without interruption.
The technicians developed the so-called Laser Range Finder (LRF) to replicate the round perspective.
It notices obstacles in front of the BR23C at a distance of up to two meters and located in the radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance to the object and sends a signal to a microprocessor that is directly translated into signal for the prevention of collision
In the moment when obstacle is noticed, the small robot will imitate the bee flight and immediately change the direction by turning its wheels around 90o or even larger angles to avoid the collision.
The greatest difference to other systems is that this evasive act is absolutely instinctive.
If it were not so, the robot could not be able to react with sufficient speed to avoid obstacles, ’ explains Toshyuki Andoh, the director of the mobility laboratory and the leading engineer of this project.
In contrast to a bee, the robot can not deviate from the top or the bottom, but also not overeck; it can only move on two dimensions and in the direction that allows it to turn its wheels and not in the infinite directions and in infinite way, as the bees do.
For this reason, Nissan has used the rotation function in addition to acceleration and brake functions to prevent the small robot from colliding with the collisions.
This device only needs to process the information for a few seconds and act according to this information.
It does not require storing the information or intuitive logic of the maneuvers performed, so it can work continuously with only a few dozen KB of the storage space.
This sounds surprising, but it's not about the GBs and not even about the MBs of the storage space.
This is the first step in the development of technologies for the immediate prevention of collisions, a technology that Nissan is planning to introduce in the series cars over the next ten years.
The robot works with lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and last longer than a variety of lithium-ion batteries.
A further possible application of this technology in the future could be the integration of the unit with a GPS navigation system by satellite in order to lead to the goal while driving and avoiding obstacles on the way.
She's shivering before she's charged with a mortgage.
It must be recognized that the US Ministry of Finance, except that it has sufficient liquidity to provide the support, is not without skill.
Before the crisis and in order to prevent US citizens from being involved in mortgage stories of the supposedly payable banks, an entertaining and informative game for Internet surfers was developed: `Bad Credit Hotel', it says.
Or maybe, the 'Hotel of bad loans' or the messing up.
The third aspect of this accommodation and especially its receptionist is to think about whether it is the moment to ask for no credit, one, two and up to three times.
And especially where you can do it, which is probably the goal of the game.
She certainly has useful information, but without details.
This is more of a page for teenagers than a place for all viewers.
What will happen if the game is expanded?
Well, when a dreamy room appears in the hotel.
At least something because it's not about buying a better house
Morgan Stanley makes its capital available to MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) into its company, which would be the first bank in Japan to spend nine billion dollars and thus take over 21% of its capital, a new one due to a strong case of its stock exchange price.
One week after a preliminary agreement had been made public, the two banks explained that MUGG will buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's registered GDP at a uniform price of $25.25, giving a total of three billion dollars.
The price adopted is below 19% of the share's price value of 31 August.
MUFG will invest additional six billion dollars in the acquisition of convertible shares, which will secure it a profit of 10% and can be sold back at a price of 31,25 dollars.
Morgan Stanley stated that the global transaction will be made on the basis of a uniform average price of 29 dollars, i.e. 28% above the current price.
However, the Morgan Stanley share fell by 6.79% to 23.07 dollars at 17.00 GMT.
"This strategic link is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition to the status of a holding bank," said John Mack, Director General of the American Group.
Morgan Stanley accepted this status last week, which should enable him to extend their business to new areas, but under the supervision of the Federal Reserve.
Their connection with MUGG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces the biggest names of Wall Street to take a more cautious attitude than before.
The arrangements presented on Monday also show that the agreement has been changed over the last few days: last Monday Morgan had simply declared that it would sell up to 20% of its shares to Japan for about 8.5 billion dollars.
`Before a week ago', told Toshhide Mizuno, Managing Director of the MUFG, 'we thought that participation would consist entirely of common shares.
But in view of the current economic and market situation, we wanted to reduce the risks and secure ourselves.
Based on a balanced average price, MUFG will pay 7% for its Morgan Stanley shares under their price.
And the business will take place with a reduction of the profit by about 20% per share.
The agreement provides that in one year MUGG will be able to convert half of its preferential shares into common shares if the latter is exchanged by more than 50% over the sales value within a given period, i.e. about 47 dollars.
Morgan Stanley assures that the funds provided by MUFG will enable him to use investment opportunities, strengthen their balance sheet and increase sales.
However, a group press speaker refused to provide more detailed information on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After the investment of MUFG, Morgan Stanley should be able to book a payment capacity ratio of about 15%, one of the best in this sector.
Morgan explained that his balance sheet had fallen significantly since the end of August.
The last few weeks were hard for the group that had to look at how their stock exchange price decreased by half, while the price of insurance against inability to pay rose to a high level.
This price declined on Monday, but remained at a high level, at approximately 12%.
Goldman Sachs, one of the more survivors of the large investment banks on Wall Street after the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the purchase of Merrill Lynch, announced last week to have cancelled 15 billion dollars, in part at Berkshire Hathaway, the group of Warren Buffett.
Rafael Correa this Monday in Quito.
The Republic around the socialism of the 21st century refound.
This is the joint project of the Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Equatorial Rafael Correa.
That third party, following this Sunday, the example of his like-mindeds and friends, was the plan of a new constitution.
Mission fulfilled, because according to the public results of 80% of the vote, 64% voted with 'Yes' in the referendum.
According to these results, 28% voted with `No', 7% of the elections were invalid, and 0.7% were empty.
In order for the Constitutional Project to be adopted, a vote of more than half of the votes cast must be reached.
On Sunday, two polls conducted at the results of the electoral halls and a narrative of a non-governmental organisation announced a clear victory for 'Yes', and 63% to 70% prophesied to him.
In the night of Sunday to Monday, Rafael Correa had called for the victory of his constitutional project.
The `constitution has triumphed in an overwhelming way', he had assured in Guayaquil, the seat of the government 280 kilometers southwest of Quito, and congratulated the Equatorials.
Of course, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chávez and Morales, but also by his Chilean like-minded Michelle Bachelet.
The election, which was held in silence in accordance with the U.S. Organization's Monitoring Order (OAS), referred to a 444-point text to secure 'new socialism' for which the President is committed.
The constitutional project transmits state power to the economy by leaving it the sole right to 'development planning' in a country that lives largely from the oil promotion by foreign companies and from the foreign currencies, sending the dissociates to the country.
The project, driven by the Correa elected in 2006, also grants greater power to the Head of State, which will be able to exercise up to two successive mandates of four years each, and will have the opportunity to disband the National Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he will use this power and seek a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also ensures the principle of free medical care and education, which the President has already begun to introduce in this country with 13.9 million inhabitants, in which 50% of the population live below the poverty line.
Finally, it also provides for a ban on the presence of foreign troops, which will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington on the use of an Equatorial base as a base for American antidrug operations.
The 19 hostages were liberated in Chad
An Egyptian command launched the attack on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight companions who had been captured ten days ago.
You're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions, who were held in the desert for eleven days, were brought back to the Egyptian capital this Monday afternoon healthy and unharmed.
In the morning they had been liberated from an Egyptian command in Chad.
Apparently in good condition, the hostages reached the military base al-Maza right next to Cairo International Airport by 15.30 a.m. on board a special aircraft.
They were taken directly, without being able to speak to the press, on board a helicopter to the Maadi hospital, an alien district of Cairo, to be examined there.
They enjoy all 'best health' and the kidnappers 'no ransom was paid', explained Egyptian tourism minister Zoheir Garanna on the rollfield.
After she was captured on 19 September at an off-road safari at the foot of the Mount Ouanat in the border area of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, the group of hostages was brought back and forth by 35 unknown kidnappers from one hideout to the next.
It is eleven tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - and eight Egyptians as well: two leaders, four chauffeurs, one border guard and the director of the Aegyptus Agency, organizer of Safari.
An Egyptian security officer explained that 30 members of the special units, on board two helicopters, started the attack at night, shortly before dawn.
"On both sides, shots fell and half of the kidnappers were killed, the rest fled," said this responsible person who wants to remain anonymous.
He explained that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian special units had been sent to Sudan, where they received support from German and Italian commands.
The head of Italian diplomats Franco Frattini reported from Belgrade where he was just standing about the role of secret agents and elements of Italian special units.
"We must recognize that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and the performance of our men from the intelligence and special units," he explained without further details.
He also disputed that a ransom had been paid.
The evening before, the Sudanese army had claimed to have stopped an off-road vehicle in a patrol, where the kidnappers were killed six of them, including the Chief of the Chad, and two arrests.
The army declared that they were in connection with a rebel group from Darfour, the Libération du Soudan-Unité movement (SLA-U), which, however, was immediately opposed to this movement.
Letters - The silent majority of culture
A debate on the financing of culture makes headlines and is central to the current election campaign.
All the better.
But an area of our cultural life remains forgotten.
Who will rise and challenge the wretched sums that will starve to the small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historical places that starve?
Which politician will dare to remind the Federal Government that it neglects its monuments and its culturally important buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, there are no right laws that effectively protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government only provides 3.5 million euros for the restoration of Chinon Castle in the Loire Valley?
Our American neighbors have written in the constitution of their country that the protection of cultural heritage belongs to the culture of the American, and that this cultural heritage must be protected by all citizens, all Members and all governmental districts, in mutual agreement.
In Quebec, in the association of the history societies of Quebec, at least 40,000 honorary persons gathered in 211 historical societies are trying to deal intensively with history, save the numerous private archives with a few groses, and preserve the archaeological remains.
They are also often the watchdogs of our cultural heritage who protest with the power of despair when sponsors and decision makers release their bulldozers on our old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When will there be a stage for history and cultural heritage?
Benelux Governments National Parts of Fortis Bank
With a partial nationalization, the Benelux states are seeking to make use of the Belgian-Dutch Fortis Bank, which has been entered into turbulence by the US financial crisis: the three states provide a total of EUR 11.2 billion to the bank and insurance institution, which also has branches in Hungary.
The governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands discussed at the highest level on the weekend, together with the President of the European Central Bank and the Commissioner of the Competition Authority of the European Commission.
In the euro area, the Fortis is the first victim of the international financial market crisis that has been continuing for a year, and therefore decisions taken in connection with the Bank may have a precedent.
In line with the decision taken on Sunday night, all three countries buy the respective shares of the bank to approximately 49 percent.
The Bank will probably sell part of its holdings, first of all the insurance activities purchased by the Dutch ABN Amro last year.
The shares of the Fortis started a steep valley trip last week, with serious crisis scenarios already taking place in the second half of the week.
However, analysts agree that the bank with its 85,000 employees is far too big for a meeting.
The Institute's securities fell to a 14-year low on Friday by 12%.
Since January, the value of the shares has dropped by more than two thirds.
Given the current stock prices, the Group's market value amounts to EUR 14 billion, which is unrealistic according to management.
According to the management, the USD 700 billion U.S. rescue package and the resulting uncertainty in the markets are to blame for the runoff of the Fortis shares.
On Monday, however, the courses rose slightly.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed the new Director-General of the Bank.
The money institution was also looking for a private buyer, but it did not find any interested party with a material offer.
However, the Belgian government was trying to calm down - it was said that no investor should tremble for his money.
There has been no panic among the customers, the banks of the bank have not been stormed.
In Hungary, Fortis has its own branches, but it also calls leasing companies their own.
Fuchs in the chicken number
Due to the drug use of a person, life and health insurance often refuses to conclude a contract with a customer in America.
Data protection experts fear that the data market could become uncontrollable.
"There are data protection programs that link the use of drug data to the consent of the data subject in any case.
These should be in independent hands, otherwise we trust the fox to the chickens" - quotes Washington Post Richard Dick, developer of the program for tracking prescription data.
Insurance shall determine the fees and the amount of the payment in the event of damage, depending on the customer's health status, and if the risk is overestimated, the insurance shall not be completed at all.
In the past, the customer was sent to a medical examination and the contract was only concluded in knowledge of the results of the investigation.
Ten years ago Dick invented a much cheaper method: On the basis of the customer's identification number, he refers the data of the last one and a half years from the pharmacies, say which preparations were bought, and the program calculates from what illness the customer suffers and how his health condition is.
For example, if he regularly buys large amounts of cholesterol reducing drugs, it could be said that his blood fat level is untreated, which would automatically lead to a higher risk group.
There are several versions of the program in circulation - some even define a risk multiplier, so that insurances only have to deal with the paperwork, but there are smaller difficulties.
One of the disadvantages is that many medications can be taken for various purposes, such as migraine and heat walling, as well as depression.
The latter is a high risk factor from the point of view of insurers, whereas the above do not.
For the consultation and processing of the data, own companies have formed which, before referring the data, request the patient's consent.
They now have to do so by law, although omissions have not yet been anticipated.
Some companies even process the results of laboratory examinations and connect them with the data on drug use, thus providing an even more accurate picture of the health status of patients.
More and more companies have access to the data, and the control of their use is becoming more difficult at the same time.
Although there is a personal data protection law for health data, its effect is limited to service providers in the health sector and insurance.
The draft law has already been submitted to Congress, according to which the authorities could also control data processing companies.
Dick Richard sees that this is too little, so he wants to develop his program so that the data can only be passed on with the consent of the data subject.
Another question, of course, is that the person concerned can hardly refuse access to his data, otherwise the insurance companies will not conclude a contract with him.
And so the chickens are only quite somehow left to the grace of the fox.
Global food plan from Marseille
European Union and India double trade
After the European Union and India are both the leading trading partners of each other, this was the main theme in addition to other global problems at the ninth summit.
Today, the French-Indian summit is also taking place, mainly discussing cooperation in the nuclear energy sector.
While the European Union recognises that India is an emerging, democratic major power, which should be given more votes and co-voice in international concerns, Member States have not yet been able to agree whether to support the permanent membership of New Delhi in the UN Security Council or not.
This question was not discussed yesterday at the ninth meeting of Marseilles.
The French President and current President-in-Office of the Council Nicolas Sarkozy and President of the Commission José Manuel Barroso and Chief diplomat Javier Solana received the Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. An agreement was reached that trade should be doubled in the next five years, i.e. to about EUR 100 billion.
In view of the fact that the exchange of goods between 2000 and 2007 had risen from 25 billion to 55 billion, this target is not even so ambitious.
In this sense, the 26 existing civil aviation agreements with India have also been legally merged into an agreement, so that in the future air traffic will also be flown.
By 2009, India intends to sign the Free Trade Agreement with the Union.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the Pact.
The aim is to achieve a balance in the currently unbalanced relationship between the EU and India: while the Union is the partner number one India, New Delhi is only ranked nine among the EU partners.
The summit was dedicated to global concerns.
This included the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, or terrorism, which were strongly condemned by both sides. Also the calling of a UN conference was engendered.
The Doha round should also be concluded, with both sides indebted to the failure.
The EU stressed that it adheres to its energy and climate programme, i.e. that pollutant emissions should be reduced by at least 20% by 2020.
India was also in agreement with this, as well as with the proposal to make a sort of global compromise at the next climate summit and to reduce greenhouse gas production by 50 percent by 2050.
The rise in food prices should also be combated, so both support calling for an international conference on the subject of financial crisis.
The Indian head of government is visiting the French capital today, where he will sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy at a bilateral meeting.
In Paris, however, it is hoped that orders to French companies worth EUR 20 billion for the construction of nuclear reactors in India will be made.
The purpose of the Agreement is to be decided on by the Agency at 15 years.
Over 300 Italian publishers in Frankfurt
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the International Frankfurt Book Fair.
More than 300 Italian publishers will be present at the 60th Book Fair, the most important international event for acquisition of rights.
The international Frankfurt Book Fair awaits over 7,000 exhibitors from 101 countries for the current event. They will distribute over 171.790 square meters of the fair and present more than 403,000 titles. Turkey will be the guest of honor of the event.
The Under-Secretary for the Ministry of Cultural Goods and Cultural Activities Maria Giro will represent the Italian government during the opening ceremony in the exhibition hall: Italy will be represented by the 264 m2 exhibition room "Putto Italia".
The following will be followed by a press conference near the Room Structure in the exhibition hall 5.0 of the book fair: on this occasion, figures, trends and perspectives on publishing in Italy will be discussed.
According to the data, the importance of books by foreign writers is reduced throughout the whole, but especially in the adult and youth sectors.
The billionaire Steve Fossett's small plane disappeared a year ago
Steve Fossett's small plane, the billionaire that disappeared on September 3rd, 2007 on a flight over Nevada's desert, was found.
The parts have been found on a high plateau of 3000 m height, in the area of Sierra Nevada Mammoth Lakes between the states of California and Nevada.
However, no human remains were found inside the aircraft.
The sheriff of Madera County, John Anderson, completely dismissed the final doubts during a press conference: "The plane has been located on which a force was sent out. Now we have the certainty that it was the plane with which Steve Fossett flew on the day of his disappearance."
Mr. Anderson also confirmed that no human remains were found in the plane or its vicinity.
The 63-year-old billionaire was declared dead in February.
The US Transport Safety Office (Ntsb) noted that a team was sent out only a few hours after the aircraft was sighted, which identified the machine: it was the Bellanca 8kcab, which was lost on 3 September 2007 after Fossett started a 3-hour flight in Yorkshire in Nevada.
Yesterday, also in California, not far from the border with Nevada, some of the personal objects of Fossett were found by a couple near their home to the Mammoth Lakes.
These are two certificates with the name Fossetts, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash and a jacket.
The search for Fossett was abandoned one month after his disappearance.
The billionaire had conquered a place in history through a long series of records.
In 2002 he managed to circle the world ball in a hot air balloon in the sixth run: a two-week, lonely flight.
Three years later, he flew the world in a single flight without a landing with a plane.
Among his many records is also an altitude flight of 15445 m over the Andes, but with a co-pilot.
Glk, the advertisement you don't expect
A Suv that falls through its original design and special lines, the inviting surface and its clear angle from the conventional schemata.
Mercedes-Benz tried with this offroder to breathe new breath into the sector.
Due to its exceptional characteristics, the performance of the Suv GLk will also be unconventional, which will be seen from 17 October in the showroom of Mercedes-Benz.
The advertising drum, which will accompany the appearance of the new model, will also appear in new dress, namely in the form of a 3D campaign – this will be a novelty in the car sector in backward Italy.
A project with a maximum effort to be carried out in different phases, which will take the central shopping mile of Milan, the Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first phase will consist of the presentation of the car in form, with 3D glasses distributed near the Corso Como to give the whole a special look: the new Suv will appear as a three-dimensional model in its almost real dimensions.
In fact, the car is so apparent from the poster on which it is depicted.
With the help of the Elumina8 technology, the new GLK will be illuminated in different moments in all its details, in order to put it together again as a whole.
No doubt the concern of Mercedes with this advertisement is to introduce a new type of autoclame into this rather stereotype field.
But will it succeed to travel the interest of the future buyers? We will see it.
Now it is clear who the Italian Hooligans are
They come from the Triveneto – now they risk stadium ban
Who are only these 150-200 boys and girls who are now ashamed of all of Italy? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia", which has been traveling behind the Italian national team for years and who, honestly, until recently caused no serious problems.
So far, there have never been clashes with opposing fans.
The origin of the group is in the right environment.
The sponsors come from the Triveneto.
From Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
These included other smaller groups from Campania and Apulia in Sofia.
They carry the Tricolori on which the cities of the militants appear, but they were removed on Saturday to avoid identification.
Their models are the English fans.
In Bulgaria, a truly right-right radical fan scene, Levski's, now encountered a collision.
The Figc provided 144 cards for the game to the Italian fans: all were issued on behalf and thus easy to control.
In fact, they were also controlled by the Viminal: there was no one going to Sofia with an ongoing stadium ban.
Four Italian fans, which were already pre-taxed in this respect, were also denied the ticket and the trip to Bulgaria.
The Viminal is now waiting for the Bulgarian police reports to take further steps: in this case, the arrested or identified typosi can expect a stadium ban of at least five years.
This is an international ban that prevents access to stages throughout Europe.
So our Hooligans will no longer set foot in a stadium.
Good luck.
But now, of course, there is fear of immigrators, who could follow this little more than 150.
"This fire must immediately be removed, and in no case will it be possible to justify such behaviour," says the Viminal.
That's why, "Keep an eye on above all also with a view to the match of the national team on Wednesday in Lecce."
In fact, there is a small core of the Italian ultras in Apulia.
Tomorrow, the Osservatorio (Sport Supervision), on Tuesday, gathers the Casms, which can count on a part of the Aise, i.e. the secret services that deal with the problem of stadium violence.
"Duce-Duce Call and the raised right arm during the anthem of Mameli? In Bulgaria this is not a crime..."
This is the thought of Domenico Mazzilli (marked in no joy), who has been the director of the Osservatorio at Viminal for a few weeks (he took over the posts of Francensco Tagliente and Felice Ferlizzi).
Previously, Mazzilli was the police president of Trieste, where now a core of the supporters of Ultras Italia, founded in 2002.
It is true, Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not against the law to praise the duce, but undoubtedly it was a shame to these 150-200 people.
"I am not a sociologist – add Osservatorio's No. 1 – crimes are committed in the country of their deed.
So far, this group has kept itself in a row, but now it has to be considered what has happened and will happen.
But we also talk about the peppers during the Hymne Mamelis: even though this is not a crime, they allow me, there is no education ...".
