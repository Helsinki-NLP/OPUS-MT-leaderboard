No liberating novel for Tymoshenko by Parliament
Today, the Ukrainian Parliament refused to abolish the paragraphs on the basis of which the opposition leader Yulia Timoshenko had been sentenced under a novel of the Criminal Code.
The new regulation, which could pave the way for the release of the ex-premier imprisoned, was rejected by the Members at the second reading of the request for relief of penalties for economic offences.
In October, Timoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for the conclusion of a allegedly harmful contract with Russia on the purchase of natural gas.
The judgment is not yet valid, and in December the appeal of the defendants is to be brought before the court.
Timoshenko himself referred to the verdict as the political revenge of the regime and also in the West the trial raised the suspicion of the prejudice of the court.
The request to remove Paragraph 365, on the basis of which the Minister of Expremier was sentenced, was supported by 147 Members of the Criminal Code.
226 votes would have been necessary for its adoption.
Libyan Victory
The story of the Libyan liberation struggle or Libyan rebellion already knows its losers.
Muammar al-Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
Now only the winners are to be defined.
As is usual to this region, win in the elections Islamists, the question is only which - the moderate or the radical.
The National Transitional Council has known itself to the custom law of the Sharāňa, from which one now has a certain idea with God.
Libya would go to the country without crime, because for theft one hacks off the hand briefly.
Women, too, should forget about emancipation as soon as possible, possibly abjects of faith are executed, and so on.
Instead of a single dictator, society will in the future be inspired by the Koran by the intervening strains of each other.
In short - Libya will have an order that would hardly be imagined in this country and, above all, hardly desirable.
Only - our lifestyle is not the only one and objectively not the best either and would hardly fit the mentioned Libyans.
So it is rather strange that the Moslem fighters were even helped by the unbelieving dogs.
To her apologies may only serve the fact that NATO's air raids were not led by any general from America but by Allah himself, whose almighty power was praised after every successful hit.
The victors in Libya?
We only took part in a change of shots, served the interests of Islam and our politicians got rid of the person of the dictator of a political ally, without this having brought any advantage.
After the fresh and bad experiences from Afghanistan and Iraq, we preferred a military occupation of Libya.
This makes the Hits a concern, namely the expulsion of the crusaders.
However, does the oil companies get the black gold at the spot price without any occupation?
The West can at last boast itself with the right of its selflessness in terms of the protection of human rights.
If this is not the case, then the representatives of Sharāa will not destroy them.
Beginning of a new crisis era
France and the rest of Europe in the focus of investors.
On Tuesday a statistical storm broke through Europe.
Each country published its GDP data for the third quarter.
The Czech economy has stagnated in comparison to the previous quarter, Germany and France.
Today, however, the bond market rips all the records.
The investors not only keep an eye on Greece, but now also Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
The statistical offices of the European zone, Germany, the Czech Republic and some other European countries published their preliminary forecasts on economic development in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP grew by 0.5%, as expected, by 0.4% in France.
At the same time, both countries corrected their data for the second quarter, in which Germany recorded higher growth than had been originally expected (grow by 0.3% instead of predicted 0.1%), while France granted a slight decrease by 0.1% (original data only spoke of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent in this year's third quarter compared to the previous year.
However, compared to the previous quarter, the gross domestic product stagnated and according to Czech Statistical Office, thus confirmed the trend of slowing growth in economic performance.
So the results are worse than the analysts' forecasts.
The most important events are:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent in the third quarter of the year compared to the previous year, but stagnated in comparison to the previous quarter.
According to provisional and seasonal data, the German economy grew 0.5 percent in the third quarter.
In the euro area as a whole and in the EU, the economy grew by 0.2 percent between July and September compared to the previous quarter, which is in line with the analysts' expectations.
The Greek economy decreased by 5.2 percent compared to the previous year.
The return on their 10-year-old government bonds increased the value of 28.45%.
The return on the Italian and Spanish government bonds rose to their critical limits.
Also Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium and other countries begin to feel problems...
The return on Czech government bonds is below 4%, even if the situation in the region is getting worse.
In Germany, votes are said to become the creditor of the last instance.
Czechs qualified for EURO
In Montenegro they won 1:0 and now celebrate their qualification for 200 million
The football selection has mastered the most difficult task of the season!
Thanks to a well placed goalkeeper Čech and a magnificent goal of Petr Jiráček, she won 1:0 in Montenegro.
With a large portion of luck, Czech football has thus been able to defend its luxurious advantage of home play and will once again not be missing from the European Championship.
IHNED.cz followed the winning game in a detailed report.
Little excitement in the first half and a huge portion of luck in the second.
The Czech election also won quite happy thanks to the final weakness of the home team, a brilliant Čech's and the hero of the day Jiráček in Montenegro 1:0 and thus replaced their ticket for the football EM.
Also because of the precise defense game of the Czech team constituencies, they only put more pressure on Montenegrin during the second half of the season.
The game's pecuniary birds were Damjanovic and Vucinic, who shot two huge opportunities.
Also thanks to an excellent Petr Čech, the Czech election will join the European Championships next year, and it is also pleasing that a premium of about 200 million is applied to the domestic football.
From the first few minutes, quite combative football was played.
Both teams combined long and thus was mainly played around the middle line.
In the second half of the year, the pressure of the home team remained, and the large deposits before the penitentiary were successfully denied by the Czech defence.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country's core programme.
They formed a living shield.
Some hundreds of university students formed a living sign around a core object in Iran.
With this gesture, they wanted to demonstrate their support for their country's core program against a possible Israeli attack.
The students had prayed in front of the object Tuesday afternoon and then announced death to the USA and Israel.
A few hundred students at the University of Isfahan formed a living sign around the nuclear technology center in Isfahan on Tuesday, where uranium is processed.
They wanted to make known that they were willing to protect their country's core programme, if necessary with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) recently stated in its report that Iran has not long abandoned its efforts to achieve a nuclear weapon.
Also in Israel is talking about a possible attack on Iranian nuclear plants.
Students had prayed at noon before the entrance to the complex and then announced death to the United States and Israel.
According to the Israeli press from the Isfahan Centre, in the case of an attack that is intended to paralyze the Iranian nuclear programme to a large extent, the nuclear enrichment plant in Nathan’s target.
The menu of a fat child: It does not breakfast and eats to the evening bread sausage
More than a third of children from 9 to 13 have problems with overweight, with 9 percent of all students and 5 percent of all children being overweight.
Current surveys have shown - adaptive children mostly come from families with unhealthy lifestyles.
This shows once again how important for the healthy development of a human being is the environment in which he grows up and the examples that surround him.
On the tables of adipose children there are sausages up to half more often on the table than in families in which normal-weighted children live.
More than 19 per cent of overweight children had the early day of the Enlightenment campaign under the motto "Adipositas is not a coincidence" Pommes to the evening bread.
In families with Dickerchen, sports is not exactly one of the favourite jobs, but also the majority of today's students - only 15 percent replied that their parents find time for active movement at least once a week.
Survey of 900 children
The survey took place last year at the end of the school year, with nearly 900 children being interviewed from primary schools throughout the Czech Republic.
This was the second year of the action "Adipositas is not a coincidence", supported by the General Health Insurance and Society Unilever.
So far, more than 12 thousand students from 4 and 8 classes have participated in the project.
Unhealthy food and lack of movement in the family are crucial factors that are responsible for the terrifying increase in the number of children with overweight or even obesity.
"Only half of the children surveyed led, for example, five times a day, to eat in the mode breakfast-second breakfast-middle meal Vesper evening bread - one of the main requirements for a healthy diet," says one of the survey results.
No breakfast and sausage for the evening bread
Experts point out that even relative minors, such as the regular breakfast time of the family, are important for the healthy development of a child.
In the Czech Republic, however, only 23 percent of the students' families are breakfast.
And - in most families everyone eats for themselves.
The worst was the statement that is not breakfast at all in every tenth family.
Breakfast is considered the foundation of healthy daily diet.
The survey test showed, among other things, that children who are overweight in the families consume much more often unhealthed Pommes.
And almost everyone - without regard to the weight - drinks sweet lemonades every day (70 percent)
While more than 40 percent of the children surveyed are sports, only less than half of their parents are doing so - only 15 percent.
Create your own menu
Another part of the survey made it possible for selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools), to compile their own food plan from offered possibilities according to appetite and opinion.
"What Czech children prefer between 12 and 15 in food is far from the ideal of a healthy diet.
Among their favorite dishes were many flour dishes, meat dishes and, of course, sweet dishes.
"Almost alarming is the great popularity of sweet limonades," is emphasized in the final report on this survey.
During lunch, that is, the main dish, pasta won just before poultry.
The children almost didn't like pods, and also the popularity of fish and vegetable dishes as lunch was very low.
Return to health
At the same time, however, the survey also showed that children are willing to change their eating habits if they get correct information.
"In many cases, the survey participants' control group, which completed the questionnaire after completing the educational talk "Adipositas is not a coincidence", showed a clear shift in preferences towards the principles of healthy nutrition," was mentioned in the results of the project.
This was obvious, for example, with the sweet limos, where many children began to give priority to ordinary water.
The children also crossed many common poultry or fish in the questionnaire as the main dish of the day and were willing to eat less noodles or sweet food.
claim professionals - a stylist must also be a good psychologist
In the opening article on how stylists learn, I had tasted a bit that this was a little too much fabric for the beginning.
I didn't know what was coming.
Presentations by three professionals from the industry, the clothing of problematic figures and a seminar on how the "on the square" runs.
It's supposed to be worse.
The closer the examination, the more information and practical tasks we are facing.
But even if the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, it is still fully established.
This time, we debated with director Alena (no man participates in the course) how to put on a woman who has no ideal proportioned figure.
And after all, that's most of us.
One has one too short neck, the other have a too young figure without proper curves and another are chubby.
It is a matter of stylist to cascade wide shoulders visually, extend the neck or conjure up the necessary curves.
We also got tips on how to attract a woman-type like Jennifer Lopez - with a big bust, wide hip and narrow waist - pretty and figure-bedred, without it being all too provocative.
For example, if the difference between waist and hip is so great that the skirt or pants really do not fit, at least one piece should be cut to size.
You won't regret that because good sitting clothes are simply priceless.
In such a tailor-made skirt one feels much better than in one of the rod, which slides up and down always, in the waist, etc.
Boylike figures can, in turn, allow themselves to wear clothing with folds, constructions, applications, embroidery or raffling.
With this amount of information and figure types, I'm glad I've had a whole week to let everything go through my head thoroughly.
And yet, I'm afraid that it's almost impossible to do this in the face of the homework that's being done.
In fact, each of the students was assigned a promi for which she is supposed to think out suitable outfits - day clothes and evening robes.
We should take into account the current appearance, the fashion style of the star and its figure type.
I'm supposed to "put on Miranda Kerr" that you may know from Victoria's Secret campaign.
In the interior I am glad, because this is much better for me personally than to attract Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who in recent times has probably increased to the hundred kilos (after well, that's a bit exaggerated), or also the young Selena Gomez.
We should cut out the garments from magazines or look for them on the Internet, print them out and then edit them graphically.
In the "moodboard", as the whole result is called, our very personal style and our relationship to graphic design will then be expressed.
It is also very important to think about the graphic side of the styling.
The stylist not only attracts the models physically, but also designs the so-called product page in the journals (by specific requirement, for example trend handbags, coats, etc.).
The stylist and designer Mario Kameník told us about that.
But it wasn't until Sunday.
That means that a stylist must have a good overall view.
The Saturday talk, filled with information about figures, was equally seasoned by three visitors from the industry:
by the stylist Jan Pokorný, by the fashion artist Jakub Polanka and by fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is illusion and that a stylist should be able to exploit it.
And a clever stylist can work with a single garment in a very different way.
The magic word is variable.
For example, you can wear a trenchcoat as usual over the jeans, so like a T-shirt or coat, but you can also wear it on the naked body, wear heel shoes and wear it as a dress.
It's enough to mess up the sleeves or collars and the whole look looks very different.
"Plays with it," he stressed.
But most of the advice came to me: "First, you need to know the rules perfectly."
"Only then can you hurt her," Jakub said.
Finally, I will see why we need to pause all these courses, what can be combined with what and why, even if you get to see quite different things in fashion journals.
Not to mention fashion.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I now know that a stylist must have prepared a lot more clothing variants than he does.
So you have to be prepared for a fashion story with ten sides ( ten outfits) to style at least fifteen.
And also that the clothing on the photo in combination with other accessories sometimes looks quite different than in reality.
So you have to expect all of this in the design of the outfit.
That image and style sometimes make up half the success, which also confirmed us Jan Pokorný.
There you only need to see Madonna, a not exactly brilliant singer, from which image and marketing have made a world star.
In the Czech Republic, the services of a stylist are rather reserved.
Also, well-known personalities often think this is for spent money (the main thing is that I bring something I look like is secondary).
And if someone can let us stylize, we should expect him or she to force us to a very different (smaller) size than he or she really needs.
Then you only need to googlen in order to ensure that the boulevard press writes, that the corresponding promi has increased or decreased again, etc.
Jan and Mario gave us heart on Sunday, not to believe that a stylist only needs to focus on fashion and then "construct" the outfit.
In his work he must communicate primarily with the people he styls and he must be a waved psychologist.
To assess people without offering themselves and to stand by him.
"If any manager orders us to look out for her wardrobe and to add pretty pieces, then we can't clear her out the whole closet and tell her - my God, that's terrible."
"At least you have to find some praiseworthy things to which you recommend what you can wear," says Mario.
He also showed us very concrete what such a so-called "placebag" must contain.
So this is a bag that you put on the waist and in which you carry all the necessary compromises.
In addition to such clear things as scissors, rollers for hair removal or safety needles, it also contains such utensils as nylon thread (this will help the stylist photographing products, such as handbags or hats), special clips, with which the clothes are rubbed in the back, if they are too large (stick needles or other clamps are prohibited, so that the fabric does not break) and, of course, sewing.
In order not only to listen but also to try out something practical, we learned how to properly stick under the shoes.
Even while shooting in the studio, where the floor is just, you can damage the shoe sole, let alone the outside.
We stick and stick...
You can't even touch the shoes with the scissors, so you don't damage them.
So you really have to do it.
Mario delighted me by praising my "creation" without restrictions.
The skill mentioned is not exactly my strength.
All this was just the fraction of what we got to hear at the second weekend continuing course.
One thing has become clear to me in the meantime - dedicating to styling at a professional level is not a children's game.
V Need for Speed: "The Run" - the illegal race across America
Review
The originally carefree drive is avoided by a series of completely preventable dilettant errors to the routine drive to the early layer.
Although it managed to fulfill the ambitions to a large extent, what is useful if no one obviously wanted to do a little more?
Already before he came to the shop tables, the new part with the subtitle "The Run" aroused high expectations.
He promised to move the already old series "Ned for Speed" a piece back into a new dimension and in the playable demonstration examples he actually seemed to be not just one of many action racing games.
We were also curious about the fitting passages in which the main protagonist gets out of the car and continues on foot.
But how you get used to it at NFS is much different in the final effect than you expected.
Sure - potentially it's quite decent arcade races, but overall the game is shrunk at by some superfluous errors that are present in this series for more or less years.
So it's actually no more mistakes, but rather signs of an incomprehensible laziness of the game developers.
The adventure starts very well.
For the first time, one is introduced into history, whose main character Jack has certain personal problems; the only solution seems to be to participate in an illegal race across America.
In San Francisco, that is, on the west coast, you sit down on the steering wheel - with the task of being the first one in New York.
The basic idea includes a number of interesting elements.
The entire route is divided into ten stages and more than fifty individual races.
This means that each race takes place on a different route and that the stages take place in different, sufficiently different and interesting environments.
You don't have the impression that game would always offer the same thing.
Some environments are still very nice to see, although the technical level of the graphics does not go beyond that of the earlier parts of the series.
So there's nothing world moving.
But the journey through the desert, through autumn landscape or high above through deep snowy landscape works visually very pleasant.
Occasionally, untypical elements bring a little variety into the individual races.
In the desert, for example, one is surprised by a desert storm, which greatly limits the view.
In the mountains, on the other hand, you have to be very careful not to be thrown by an avalanche.
On the other hand, the individual races are built in quite well in a row.
It's just a few, but they're rich.
For a while one tries to overwhelm the prescribed number of opponents (in principle a classic race), then one has time to pick up (classical race against the stopwatch), then another personal duel awaits with a single opponent.
And for that, too, the police are mingling in, trying to screw up the whole thing.
A novelty are passages in which Jack leaves the car.
It's more about some interactive animations in which Jack is fleeing from anyone and where the player has to help by pressing the right button at the right moment.
So nothing complicated.
It is surprising, however, that in the game there are much less passages than one would expect (mostly only three).
Finally, this is more of a benefit, because this element has at least no chance of becoming boring - it belongs in the context of the above-mentioned elements that make the game more varied.
The driving model runs into the footsteps of the previous parts.
In other words, seeing from today's point of view, it doesn't rip trees, on the other hand, it could not be said that it would be bad.
If you are looking for realistic simulations, you have to look around elsewhere.
But a action-packed race will continue to be quite fair to this model, even though one could find better in the competition.
Until then, everything is in the best order.
Real problems appear only after some time.
Unlike the driving model, the collision model is not quite O.K.
From a game of this kind it is hardly expected that it calculates complicated deformations and collisions, but if you have practically no impact on any object of how the car behaves, then obviously not everything is fine.
Typical example: In some places, when you overwhelm or pass by on the opposite cars, you just "stiff" the other car easily, in other, almost identical situations, you get to shake and turn wild pirouettes.
Or the car's going to scrap.
Thanks to the restart system, this doesn't matter, from annoyance it's all the time.
The restarts are so solved: if you have total damage or land far off the route, then throw the game back to the last point of the track.
Only - in each race you only have five restarts.
If you've exhausted them, everything's going off the front.
So the restarts are more like a tool, in case something fails, but you should not rely on it.
Sometimes, however, the restart doesn't even help, as nothing helps to learn the critical section from the head.
It is unpleasant that the same things often happen in the same places.
For example, some curves have to be passed in a very specific way, otherwise you simply don't pass through.
Elsewhere you always meet "civil" cars in the same configuration, whether you come first or fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
This is particularly annoying in situations, when you see that the opponent comes by in front of a playing two opposite cars, but until you arrive there yourself, the cars are already in such a position that you have to drive them or brake them.
And it doesn't matter when you get there, because everything is designed in such a way that it always comes close to that situation in front of your nose.
Contractors have additional advantages.
Throughout the game there are a few places where you will always be overtaken at the same place by the same opponent and here again without regard to the time.
The most crazy thing is to end the game on the long bridge that you pass in opposite direction.
The opponent obviously has to get a devil out of here.
And if he's in front of one, he'll take a look, of course, so you can start by driving your car in Klump a few times.
Of course - you just want to make the game more exciting and exciting but this intention is so clear that it will quickly miss you the joy at the game.
And that's a pity, because despite a simple driving model, the game is quite entertaining and, in some cases, also so loaded that you almost don't know where one of the heads is.
And in principle, it doesn't matter what "guilt" is about it - the concept with fifty unique routes, the arrangement of the races in a way that can't get bored, or something quite different...
An unusual idea is also the change of car over the course of the race.
You can't miss the gas stations on the route, because here you can change the car, even though in most cases the car that you just have is sufficient.
The cars are divided into three categories.
The sports cars are well suited for the urban areas, the strong American limousines for the straight highways and exotic super sports cars for the technical rides, for example on the Serpentines in the mountain range.
Hand in hand with the mode of the history of the game, the task mode (requirements) - that is the race in the individual localities you know from history.
Here there are not only medals, but also points to gain experience for your own profile, which is common for the tasks (demands) and the history.
In order to reach the higher level of the driver, different items must be locked up: from the car to the backgrounds for the profile.
This is connected at the same time to the online Autolog function, which compares its own results with those of other players and also provides additional collective functions.
One of another incomprehensible carvers is a situation in the last race of history.
Here you get by car into a subway tunnel (menetways), where you run long in the dark on the rails (menetwegen).
On the Tacho you can see numbers between 150 a 200 km/h (menetways), but there comes a subway from the back and drives a uncompromisingly to scrap.
In our editorial work, we will probably argue for a long time about whether this was a blackout of the game designers or whether the authors think we are so stupid.
The technical side is nothing overwhelming but at least the visual overall impression is quite appealing in most cases and here and there even brilliant.
All the more annoying is that, at some exciting moments, the frequency of the images is slowing down and sometimes quite dramatic.
However, in particular, this concerns accidents with a larger number of participants, where a continuous FPS does not benefit from anything at all.
The sound reproduction is O.K. as far as possible and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In trying to address a young audience as wide as possible, a soundtrack a lá "of every thing" was created - but who buys such a game because of the music?!
The overall impression of Need for Speed: The Run? The feelings are rather mixed.
If the game would not be weakened by the mentioned totally unnecessary errors, we could have maintained with the breast tone that The Run is the best piece of NFS in recent years.
But that's the way the game doesn't seem ready.
For yourself a great pleasure, but you should be prepared to put these errors in your eyes with the power of airport lights.

EU Ambassador Vicenová:
The Czechs have the reputation of negatives and Eurosceptics
"The Lisbon Treaty has made the balance felt among the various institutions."
I would not have expected such a hard war to burn."
"It will last five, six years until the waves are smoothed and all are accustomed to their new role," began Milena Vicenová, Czech ambassador to the European Union, quite sharply at the Faculty of Law.
How seriously she takes the motto of "understanding and open about Europe", she showed in the first part of her lecture, in which she managed to describe the individual institutions of the EU and their interrelationships in such a manageable and understandable way that they could have envyed such a number of readers of the Faculty of Law of the Charles University.
Ms Vicenová also praised the new permanent chairman of the Council of Europe Herman Van Rompuy:
"At first, criticism was voiced that he was too inconspicuous - a gray official who hadn't grown such a role, but I have to say that it has all struck the breath of how well he has accepted the matter.
"He is a human being who manages to patiently listen to twenty-seven member states, communicate with them, and who, above all, has clear ideas about how the EU should continue.
The new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy then explained it as an answer to the question: Who is this really - the European Union? What number should I call?", that is, an important step towards the agreement and better readability of EU policies towards countries such as China and India.
Nobody wants to ban us our oil hat quargel
Ms Vicenová also devoted himself to the agenda in which the European Union lived and intended to live in the near future.
The Czech Presidency of two years ago called it a success.
The Czechs had mastered the financial crisis and the gas crisis and also organised the Eastern Partnership Summit.
The government's case during the Presidency called it a major negative factor which had seriously damaged the Czech Republic's image.
The Czech representation in the EU is currently in full swing.
In the words of the Ambassador, the Presidency was not only acquitted, but also the subsequent crisis, which has not yet been overcome, quite hectic.
And the seven-year budget of the EU still needs to be approved, which makes things much more complicated precisely because of today's economic situation.
Whether it becomes a slender and economical budget, which sectors get priority, which countries are more and which are less supported - all of this is now on the agenda.
The ambassador also recalls her own slogans, with which she came to Brussels: "Intelligible about Europe".
"If I don't like something, then it's a kind of cruel accelerator, foreign words and technical jargon that no one understands.
How should I know, as a citizen, whether one really thinks about being curved or round cucumbers and various big bananas in Brussels or whether someone actually wants to ban us from the quargel?
It would also have liked to use the EU's soil to get more Czechs in European institutions.
Europe of two or different speeds in view
In the opinion of the EU ambassadors, the Czechs are in a position to be Euroscepticists who perceive more negative than the positive side of the matter.
The weak representation of Czechs into European institutions is all the more annoying.
There are many factors to blame for, among other things, the reluctance of our candidates, their inability to write motivation letters and, last but not least, the weak support of the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, it also stressed the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group, the so-called V4.
"Do you believe me when a Pole or Hungarian comes to me and a Slovak is nearby, then the Frenchman says next to me, "Hey, what are you talking about together - is this your V4 again?" and there is a rather sour mine.
According to Ms Vicenové, the EU expects particularly tough rules for the budget policy of the Member States in the future.
As much realer as a "European Federation" it sees the concept of one Europe of two or even different speeds.
"We have the countries of the Eurozone and the countries away from the Eurozone here.
"We have the Schengen area and we already have the Institute of Strengthened Cooperation."
"At first it was said that only the countries that want to work together and those who do not want to do so should stand away from the ground."
"There will be more and more of such institutions, which ultimately leads to a strong "Europe of different speeds," Ms. Vicenová expects.
In this respect, she also appreciated the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuyes in the enforcement of the principle that all issues with an impact on the whole EU should be discussed by all Member States and not only by the euro area countries.
Brand Story:
The Innovator IBM enters the second century of its existence
If one wanted to look for a suitable word that characterized IBM's strategy most precisely, then this would probably be the word "long-live".
For the general public, IBM is the synonym for technological revolution, and it is known as a modern company, although since its inception, it has been extended for a century.
The basis for this longevity already laid its first boss - the visionary Thomas J. Watson sen.
Even he represented the slogan that countless global problems could easily be solved if people were willing to think a little.
His slogan "Think!" thus became a trademark for the life of the future giant (and, at the same time, the title of the company's internal magazine, which began to be published at IBM in 1935).
This was also the basis of the company culture prepared by Watsen.
"For us from IBM, this long-term thinking means a sustainable movement towards the future.
IBM survived and was also successful for a whole century because it remained faithful to its principles and did not hold back from changing everything else around.
This allowed us to transform technologies, business and society over the course of our first century.
We hope we will be able to do more in the next hundred years," said Samuel J. Palmisano, today's director of the company on the occasion of the anniversary.
Appreciative system
Watson operated social care for his employees in the 1930s - in the same way as the businessman Baňa in Czechoslovakia: the IBM people had paid a holiday as one of the first American employees, an insurance by the entrepreneur plus elegant uniforms as workwear and a thoughtful reward system for best newcomers and dealers.
The long-term relationships of IBM with their customers are equally sophisticated.
The company was brilliant from the outset in promoting talent - as one of the first companies worldwide, IBM raised any discrimination - and was able to choose accordingly.
In line with this anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan to replace Palmisan at IBM's top next year is a woman by Virginia Rometty.
She has been with IBM for thirty years, and so far she has taken the position of the head of society, marketing and strategy.
IBM has been making so-called online brainstormings in recent years, from which many future strategies and innovations grow.
No wonder - ideas are enough, in the company almost half a million people are employed.
An institution with a reputation
Their unshakable position in business guarantees the company a strong image and this to the inside and to the outside.
"From the beginning IBM had the concept of an institution rather than a mere technology company," said Economist Professor of Harvard Business School and author of a book on IBM, Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems with technology," added George Colony of Consulting-Company Forrester Research.
As the company itself emphasizes, it is a difference to be present on the market only or to form it directly through this presence.
IBM - called "Big Blue" in the states of its logo because of its family name, has grown into one of the largest companies in the world in a century.
It is one of the most versatile technology companies ever - IBM develops hardware and software, infrastructures, hosting and consultation services in an incredible product range - from servers to nanotechnology.
Of all American technology companies IBM has the most patents and five of its employees have been awarded the Nobel Prize.
His most famous inventions include, for example, ATMs, credit cards, financial swap, bar code or the diskette.
This year, IBM was the second largest technology company (equivalent to Apple) with a market capitalization value of about 220 billion dollars, and it overtook Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
The look ahead
Not all products and innovations met the taste of today's customers - unfortunate were, for example, the attempt with its own OS/2 operating system, the online service prodigy or also the computers IBM PC jr.
"Business is based on the forward movement, so you must not be emotionally bound to the past," says Samuel J. Palmisano.
That's why IBM has no problem building its foundation walls on different platforms - and if they don't work, leave them again.
In contrast to the opponent Microsoft, which basically stands and falls with its Windows operating system.
Satisfaction technologies
IBM's profits involve a large part of services, software and hardware, each of which has a fifth share.
In 1990 hardware with a more than fifty percent share was still the most represented.
Since 2000, IBM has sold little profit-reducing assets worth 15 billion dollars, but at the same time it invested 58 billion dollars in the purchase of future-proof technologies.
In these investments IBM continues after 2008, when the modern financial crisis for the first time swept like a storm over the world.
Here, IBM remained faithful to the legacy of his first boss Thomas J. Watson, who in the middle of the great global economic crisis increased his investment.
Up to now, it seems that IBM is facing today's crisis unharmed.
The value of IBM shares has increased rapidly since 2008 by 120 percent and the Company's profit from profit from it is growing continuously.
IBM's company log is: everything can be changed - only the values can't.
It can also be expected that this flexible giant will also cope with the next crisis.
IBM History: From cheese tailor to world-wide flights
Founded a hundred years ago in New York, IBM (International Business Machines) initially had a rather complicated name - Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name IBM took it only in 1924 - originally it was a brand name for a branch in Canada and South America.
The foundation stone to the later company IBM set the fusion of four companies, whose history dates back to the 1980s.
They owned technologies such as the famous Stechcard Watches for registering the start-up and end-of-work.
As the architect of this new company, Charles Ranlett Flint, who also chaired the Supervisory Board until 1930.
And it was Flint who appointed the head of the competition firm Thomas J. Watson to help him with the management of the company.
This leader even put IBM's founders in the shadow - Watson's ideas are based on the company's invincible culture and identity to this day.
Watson headed the company until 1952.
IBM, as already the name reveals, began to manufacture and sell all kinds of machines for trade - from sausage and cheese tailors to checkouts.
During the first four decades of Watson's leadership, he doubled its sales to nine million dollars and the company gradually expanded to all continents.
Watson was so indispensable to the company that he sat in the chair for forty years, only then was he replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his direction IBM began to work on the development of artificial intelligence and also developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, technicians and computers from IBM helped the NASA lead flights into space - to Mercury and Saturn and in 1969 also the famous flight of man to the moon.
Meanwhile, in 1964 IBM developed the first computer family with the same computer architecture - the IBM System/360 series.
A classic PC, which determined the computer standard of that time, came on the market in 1981 under the name IBM 5150.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to Lenovo, but on the other hand it bought the consultant part of PricewaterhouseCoopers, thus fully getting into the business with consulting services and services with high added value.
The strategy that IBM has paid off over the last three years is the concept of "smarter planet".
It embodies the intention to use technologies in a smart way in areas not even planned so far, e.g. in order to improve the situation in transport and urban administration.
In the trade sector, IBM recently introduced the "Smarter Commerce" platform to help dealers manage the entire commercial cycle.
IBM also has a strong history in the Czech Republic.
In 1932, IBM established a branch in Czechoslovakia - as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe at all.
Today IBM ČR also operates a strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
The Central Office for Central and Eastern Europe is located in Prague and there is also a world-level top research team that deals with the technology of voting recognition.
Darina Rychtářová on her unfaithful addresses:
Iveta - this donkey you can keep, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rychtářová (53) says - now it's over!
After her husband Josef Rychtář (53) from the protector of Iveta Bartošová (45) had become their lover, Darina was still hoping that Joseph was awakening from his pink dream and coming home.
But now it is finally over with patience and for the further life it has set clear rules.
"Josef can come home, but no more than my partner," explained D. Rychtářová.
When Darina Rychtářová offered refuge to the singer I. Bartošová in her own house, you wouldn't have even come in a dream, as her husband did.
When Iveta moved on her pressings after 30 days and returned to Łíčany, Joseph went right with him.
Yes, he even publicly knew that he loved them.
In time Darina resigned, even it seemed as if she wanted to reconcile with her unfaithful husband again - but now she finally gave him the running pass.
Rychytář doesn't care who's sleeping with his wife.
If Rychtář Iveta should leave Bartošová in the future, he will certainly not receive open arms at home.
"He's the biological father of my dreams and if he wants to decide his days in our common home, I won't chase him out."
"However, not as beloved, lost old donkey, but as a man to whom I still have certain ties," said Mrs. Rychtářová, but she also said that she has already emotionally separated herself from him and insists on mutual discretion alone.
The fact that Darina has locked the back door to him, Joseph so far bears dignity.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'm staying with Iveta, nothing changes."
"My wife wants a paper heel and I respect that."
"The company continues, I care about the repairs, the garden, the property, I make the purchases."
"With Darina, I am chatting quite normally, only the bed we don't share," said J. Rychtář (the sheet) Blesk.
If Darina wants to find a new love, he doesn't want to hinder her.
"We don't sleep together, so I don't care if she has a friend or who that is.
I realize it's my fault, I fell in love with Iveta, and that's why I take responsibility.
The worst female unthinking: How about you?
If the men are asked to name some typical female undisgustings, they shake some quickly out of the sleeves without exception.
Dear women, do you recognize yourself in the following lines, in which we let a few unsitten revue happen again, which let the men wall the blood into the veins?
Shopping
Are you asking them to be a shopping addict?
Do you have to buy at least one Hader weekly?
Do you like shopping and may it be a bit more for actions?
Then in your case, it's really about a weakness.
Some women are at least aware of this and try to keep their shopping lust under control.
But hand on heart, which woman does it stop looking for a well-sitting topwear just to stroll through a dress store and not try all (in all possible color combinations) in the cabin?
Although shopping for most women is a hobby, for men it is often pure hell.
Think about how many times they've already said to their husband - you'd rather stay outside...
Permanent dissatisfaction
"Am I not too thick?"
"I have to lose at least five pounds - should I start jogging or doing gymnastics?"
"Do I even like you?"
Is that kind of familiar to them?
Yeah?
Then you may also be among the women who are legally possessed of what they look like.
That doesn't mean you should let go, but many men are allergic to it if her wife is constantly sorry about her appearance.
The stronger gender is united - with increasing frequency of complaints the women are increasingly unbearable.
Order and cleanliness in the first place
It's a fight against windmills.
Clean windows, wipe tiles and dust, shave the tubs - and this at least twice a week.
Smite with their partner, because he's throttled with dirty shoes on the clean tiles again, the children shuddered because the just shuddered sink is already dirty again and because the glass door on the living room cabinet already has fingerprints, where the polishing makes so much effort?
If you are suffering from this kind of "deviance", then you should know that you cannot exaggerate anything and that the order and cleanliness in family life are not the first priority.
This measureless purity mold can ultimately also harm mutual relations and, above all, peace in the family.
Swirls
"Shrewd gymnastics come into the laundry basket."
"Do you really want to put on the old socks again tomorrow?"
"You don't just throw a wet towel on the floor."
If your partner is exposed to such a tirade, you must not be surprised that this brings him to the palm.
Of course that's not meant bad, they just want everything to have its order.
If the men knew this, then the women might not need so much to mess.
Klatsch und Tratsch
Some women clap and croak, there is no squeezing behind the back or even slandering or forging alliances.
Women are now focused on relationships, so they like to have such topics, such as who, where, with whom, how and why.
I'm sure each of us women has a little harmless clasp and trach in stock.
Hand-in-law - that's probably all women's own.
But this is not to be confused with claspants of grave calibers, to whom nothing and no one is holy, which probably despises everyone in their environment and which, especially for women's collectives, is a major danger.
Jágr and Voráček helped Philadelphia win with their assistants
The ice hockey tower Jaromír Jágr had a large share of the 5:3 victory of Philadelphia on the ice in Carolina during the NHL's Monday game, making it again the most productive Czech player in the NHL.
In both cases Claude Giroux, who added an assistance and was called the best player of the match, was the winner of the review of the thirty-nine-year-old ice hockey star.
Two assistants in the same game also recorded Jágr's co-player Jakub Voráček.
After the game Jágr claimed journalists that he had prophesied Giroux a great evening.
"Before the game, I tell him that today a Hattrick will succeed."
I kind of felt that."
"He and again overcame such a feeling," said Jágr, after his action Giroux already reached a goal at the first shot of the flyers.
A little later, the second hit also had "a Czech track".
Voráček fought the puck behind the gate of the Hurricanes and presented it to the successful Maxim Talmud between the circles.
A second before the finale of the first third, the home player Patrick Dwyer scored a short hand, but the second third belonged to the flyers again.
Objection Giroux.
In collaboration with Jágr, he scored his third hit, and after that, Wayne Simmonds led his shot to the fourth goal.
"I love playing with him."
"I don't want to say he's the best player in the league, but I'm sure he's one of the best three," Jágr praised his center.
"I didn't realize in life that I was playing with such an ice hockey player as with him at the end of my career."
"I'm very happy."
"I cut my game on me."
"All the years in the NHL my fellow players started their game on me and now the spear turns around," Jágr smiled.
Carolina made game to the drama - by the hits of Tuoma Ruutua and once again Dwyer, who got out of a penalty shot, it came to a gate.
Matt Read, however, prevented any further complications in which he was successful in excess of two against one.
"Excellently, Pronger was still active in our zone."
"He caught the puck, I took off and (Read) moved to more distant post."
"I tried to meet him and I'm glad it worked out," wrote Voráček the last hit of the game from his perspective.
This victory led Philadelphia to the head of the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defense player of Montreal Jaroslav Špaček was injured in the game against Buffalo and in the second third broke out because of an injury to the upper body.
In addition to her, Beck also experienced her leadership in the Penalty shoot 2:3.
One of the crimes could not change Tomáš Plalanec.
More than the lost points probably pained the coach of the home team the high disease-related failure in the defensive - the game they played only with five defense players to the end.
"That's bad."
"We only finished the match with one experienced player, the rest were young players."
"But there's nothing to be done with, so we have to finish," said Jacques Martin.
"Every time we switched, we had an attack wave after another, and we had nothing to do with it."
"We should have made the game easier and brought the puck out of our third."
There were still reserves here," said P. K. Subban, one of the defense players.
The Czech goalkeeper Ondřej Pavelec rejected thirty shots from Tampa Bay and thus contributed significantly to the 5-2 victory over Winnipeg.
At the gates of the jets, which ended with a series of five defeats, five different shooters had a share.
Development of travel prices since 1989
Until 1989, there were only five approved state travel agencies in the ČSSR: Čedok, sportsurist, CKM, Recrea and autoturist.
At the time, travel agencies mainly sold travels to the socialist East Block countries, and in the West only were allowed to choose at the time.
And so Czech tourists traveled to the Baltic Sea (in the German Democratic Republic - the GDR), to the Soviet Union (Sochi on the peninsula of Crimea on the Black Sea), to Bulgaria and Romania to the Black Sea and to Hungary to the Balaton.
A slight exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when one was also allowed to travel to Yugoslavia, then Yugoslavia took a provincial course and therefore travel to Yugoslavia was severely restricted.
A great paradox of these socialist times was that it was not even allowed citizens of the Eastern Bloc (also the Czechoslovakian) to travel freely within the socialist countries.
For example, if a citizen of ČSSR wanted to travel individually to Poland or even to the Soviet Union, he would need a so-called invitation letter, otherwise individual travels would not be possible.
Even back then, travel agencies also offered travels to the West, but then one had to buy huge snakes or stay in the sleeping bag in front of the travel agency, or at least have "good acquaintances" in the travel agency.
This was not the case for a long time.
The so-called foreign exchange commitment - the condition for leaving the West - was only given "politically reliable" people - the others were not allowed to travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely exchangeable currency, so without a foreign exchange commitment it would have been impossible to raise the necessary financial resources (Western currency) for a trip to the West.
Most Czechs therefore spent their holidays domestically, no wonder the Czechs bought countless weekend houses and dates - a habit that continues to this day.
The 1989 total revolution followed a travel revolution of the Czechs.
While by 1989 a holiday in the GDR or Bulgaria was the measure of all things, the Czechs spent 4.5 million of their foreign holidays in countries around the world last year.
A huge paradox, one of which is no longer aware of today, is the fact that one could not travel to the most popular holiday country in the Czech Republic by 1989 because it was part of Yugoslavia.
Right from the beginning of the 1990s, the foreign exchange obligation was abolished in the neighbouring western European countries, which created a huge wave of short visits, especially to Vienna in Austria and Germany.
For a long time the Czechoslovakians could not get enough of their journeys to the West, everyone wanted to have been there for at least a few days.
This was how Czech holidaymakers slept on trips to Paris in the tent in the park, because who already had the money for accommodation in the hotel or in a pension at the time.
A typical feature when traveling abroad from the Czech Republic was a trunk filled with canned, beer and permanent sausage, etc.
Another important milestone was the introduction of the freely interchangeable Czech crown - after decades, our tourists were finally able to buy the Western currency freely.
Our standard of living and thus also the average salaries rose, which resulted in a further important moment in 1997.
Thanks to the increased demand for travel, the travel agencies began to regularly prepare trips after 1997 through charter flights, making flight travels incredibly reduced thanks to the possibility of negotiating quantity discounts compared to the past.
At the end of the 1990s, the Czechs, with the exception of the USA, had already had no exchange of payments with all the advanced countries in the world, making travel even easier.
Another interesting moment in the history of "post-smart" travel came in 2000, when thanks to the high demand of the first direct charter flight to an exotic country - to Thailand.
Since then, direct charter aircraft with Czech passengers have been flying in distant sunny countries every year; this year twelve exotic destinations are flying directly from the Czech Republic.
To the 100 csd. Czechs travel to exotic countries every year!
Another important moment in the epoch, which marked our "post-revolutionary" development, came in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the US lifted the visa requirement for Czech tourists, which definitely included our country among the advanced countries of the world.
In 2008, the Czechs spent more than half of their holiday abroad for the first time (50.3%) and for the first time in their history they spent more than 15 Tsd. CZK per capita for a single holiday stay including the costs at the resort.
The Annual General Meeting is expected to find a new chairman - again a pat threatens.
For almost five months, Czech football has no chairman, and it is threatening that Ivan Hašek's successor at the head of the Czech Football Association (FAčR) will not be known even after the extraordinary general meeting on Thursday in Nymburk.
To date, there is no agreement on what sort of electoral order to vote for.
And without this there is no vote at all on the three potential successors.
Three interested parties want to manage Czech football - Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
In June, Hašek resigned from his position, calling on his colleagues to find themselves together and a strong personality that could lead football in the future.
Only - in the era after Hašek the old circles between the two board chambers broke out again, which cannot agree on a common candidate.
This was shown to be stoned and clear on 16 September when the new chairman was to be selected.
The delegates of the Annual General Meeting had come to the People's House in the Smíchov district of Prague for no reason, because the trial did not lead to any result and it was not just about the election itself.
One could not even agree on who is in fact entitled to vote in the full collection - only the representatives of the Staff Regulations or the officials equipped with authority.
In this one point, at least partial agreement was reached, including the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law, which, in its opinion, was not a proxy-based representation.
However, the dispute over the electoral order continues.
Nor did the Executive Committee bring any more clarity into the matter, in which meetings - whether ordinary or extraordinary - nothing else is on the agenda at all.
Although the views regarding the election changed a few times - the neural point remained the same.
The question is: how to proceed in the 3rd round in order to avoid a pat situation?
"The issue concerns the question of whether to proceed in accordance with the statutes, or whether a completely different model has to be found," said Dušan Svoboda, one of the three vice-presidents of the FAčR, who represents the professional football in the management.
According to the statute model, in the third round, the candidate who receives the greater percentage of support in the chamber for which he is candidates will win.
Moravia is said to be ready to compromise that the candidate wins the higher number of votes from both chambers.
The Czech side, in turn, insists on the fact that the winner receives at least a two-thirds majority in this percentage of votes.
"Then the two preliminary rounds have no meaning at all that this mode would question the entire two-chamber concept," understands Svoboda's objections to the Moravian side, which it would be best not to add to the electoral order, but to vote according to valid statutes.
Surprisingly, Tomáš Paclík agrees with this, even if it is clear that the statute of the electoral system is the best way to meet Pelta from all candidates.
"My wish is for most of the time to be elected according to the statutes."
"This does not mean any absurd replacements, such as at the last general meeting," said Victoria Plze, the owner of the football club, who for the first time candid and was especially opposed to Pelta in his comments.
Pelta, however, remains optimistic.
In his opinion, the new chairman will be known in Nymburk and he believes that the candidates will also work constructively in the future.
"The possible qualification of the national team for the football EM today would certainly contribute to calming the mind."
"If football only rides on the euphoric wave, then also the willingness to cooperate is greater," says Jableec, who has the greatest experience of all three adcepts, at both professional and regional level.
Rajchl's more reserved.
"I hope that an agreement will be reached, but the situation is unfortunately clumsy."
"This is not a matter between people from Bohemia and Moravia, but there are certain efforts to "justify" the rules for their own purposes."
"That is why a further blockage at the Annual General Meeting is not excluded."
"However, I hope that the common sense ultimately wins," said Rajchl.
Only - a lot of time to agree on all sides no longer remains.
Some negotiations are supposed to take place directly in Montenegro, but who knows whether football generality will be complete until the qualifying game at all.
The charter aircraft with which Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl were supposed to fly to Podgorica in the morning could not start because of a technical disturbance at all, and so one was feverishly looking for a replacement variant, as one still brings part of the Executive Committee to the venue of the Barrage Hinspiel.
In the end, the meeting at ministerial level is certainly crucial, to which it is supposed to come on Wednesday.
Josef Dobeš, the Minister for Education, Youth and Body Education, would have liked to bring the split parties to an agreement within the country's largest sports association.
It is a lot at stake: state subsidies, Czech football's confidentiality and the upcoming Annual General Meeting of the ČSTV, which should point to the financial problems of Sazka to Czech sport.
Paclík is in the fight for the position of the chairman because he sees no suitable candidate
If Tomáš Paclík, the head of Pilsner Footballers could have made a strong candidate before the extraordinary general meeting, who would have fulfilled all his ideas about the new chairman of the football association of the Czech Republic (FAčR), he would not have been able to fight for this leading position at all.
"If there were a good candidate, I would fight for him and give up my choice."
"But in the current situation, it was not possible to find such an adept," said Paclík ČTK.
The main reason for Paclík to go into duel with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl is thus to prevent the alleged favorite of choice, Pelta, from reaching the top of FAčR.
Paclík also emphasizes that in the event of his victory he intends to exercise the function of the chairman only one year, that is, until 2013, until the date of the Annual General Meeting.
In the position of the chairman, he would have liked to see an experienced top manager who is not too much encroached into football.
"With some people coming in question, I have spoken personally."
"It's hard to believe that some of them told me they didn't want to identify with Czech football at the moment.
"These views would have changed," he suggested.
Most of all, Paclík is said to disturb Pelta's with the chairman of the Pilsner District Football Association Roman Berbr, a man of controversial reputation, who is considered a powerful lobbyist behind the scenes, with the ability to influence delegates' votes at general meetings.
For Paclík, it is therefore unacceptable that Pelta would have the position of the chairman.
"In his victory, today's state would be preserved, and in Czech football it didn't move at all."
"The support from Berbr, a clever businessman, was twice bad for football," said Paclík.
He also points out that Pelta's name fell some time ago in connection with telephone hearings in order to detect a corruption affair, but that Pelta did result in impunity.
"I don't know what prestige a victory of Pelta should bring to the (c.) football."
"And how would we stand in the eyes of the UEFA and FIFA," said řekl Paclík, who said his earlier statement, "he would sell the Pilsner football club if Pelta became chairman," but he already saw a bit more late.
If Paclík were to win in the Thursday election, he could well imagine a future cooperation with Pelta.
Another candidate also thinks - Rajchl, who had supported Paclík before the Annual General Meeting in October, who ended with a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first to go to."
"He has great abilities."
"I could well imagine him as the head of the national team."
"But I don't think he's able to lead the association as a manager."
"I don't put my nose in matters of which I don't understand anything," said Paclík, who in September looked forward to replacing Dagmar Damková, who had replaced Damková, behind the conjugation of the Arbitration Commission with Luők Macela.
Paclík himself claims that he feels the role of the president of the association grew.
And he calls for his skills in the management of private companies, since last summer he is also chief of Pilsen, who celebrated the first triumph in the league with his support in May.
"I have the power to change something in the football environment and to contribute to a certain cultivation of this."
"In order to limit the influence of certain interest groups that tend to influence disciplinary and appeal commissions, which can be seen in present situations," said Paclík, who does not make a hint of antipathy against the Sparta chief Daniel Křetínský, for example.
One of his priorities was the strengthening of relations between the FAčR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which he would praise the political leaders to ensure that more money flows from the lottery tax into sport.
"This is one of the crucial things the new chairman should devote himself to."
"When it comes to the taxation of gambling, as the political parties declare, I understand their argumentation, but then they must also say stone and clear where the money goes," he said.
His connection to the Pilsner Klub also does not regard Paclík as a handicap, although he himself emphasizes that the chairman of the FAčR must be "over-party".
Pelta is connected to Jablonec, Rajchl to the Prague Dukla.
"That's not exactly ideal."
"But I don't think it makes much sense to transfer my shares in the Pilsner Club to a third person in order to return after a year and a half," said Paclík.
Pelta promised new statutes of the FAčR that would trigger a pat situation in the future.
Two days before the general meeting of the Football Association, one of the candidates for the Presidency promised, Miroslav Pelta, that in the event of his election, he would make strong efforts to ensure that the FAčR will receive new statutes which will in future rule out disputes about the electoral system.
The Jablonec officer is confident before the Thursday hearing in Nymburk and believes that the election campaign will be secure if the Czech election is successful.
Pelta had promised to focus on the national team and the acquisition of financial resources in the event of his election before the unrealised election in September.
He decided only at the last moment to participate in the election before the last general meeting, thus helping him to defend his ideas about the leadership of football and to present them in a broader context.
"People at all levels devote themselves to football, they are impatient and therefore expect the chairman to be known on Thursday."
"He feels that it is high time that the association was guided by someone, the man who is especially connected to the Jableecer club, who also served for many years at Sparta and the Executive Committee.
That is why he also believes that he has sufficient experience to lead the Czech football.
He is convinced that today's problems with the election are the euphoria that existed at Ivan Hašek's time.
"Unfortunately, at the Annual General Meeting in June, regulations were approved, which were not as perfect as all of them had accepted.
If they had not allowed different interpretations, we would have had a chairman since September," said Pelta.
In particular, he used the revision of the most important document of the Citizens' Association as a means of locking for delegates.
"If I become chairman, then I accept it personally and am willing to bear personal responsibility if it does not work."
"This is a fundamental thing without which he cannot be," Pelta claims.
Furthermore, he does not attempt to limit himself to his competitors.
He had previously announced that he could present himself to a cooperation with Jindřich Rajchl, whom he recognized for his legal education and he knew well that his other candidate would be his first deputy.
He also stopped attacking Tomáš Paclík for a long time, who in turn did not leave any dry thread on Pelta.
In football he has been moving for over a year and can already point to certain successes."
"His attacks, however, were depressing and many people were shocked by his campaign for election."
"That's why many doubt his real character," Pelta addressed his opponent, who probably remained faithful to his proclamations, which he said already in September.
In his opinion, his strongest weapon is the knowledge of football from the lower classes of the game, to the national team.
And this was supposed to be a Czech football suspension.
"I would also try to end all affaires - from the Causa Bohemians to the descendants of the corruption scandal of last year."
"After that, I would fall into negotiations with the private and public sector to ensure sufficient funding for the whole football," said ČTK, forty-six-year-old candidate two months ago.
At that time he also promised that his entry into the top of the Czech football would not mean human cleansing.
"I first had to familiarize myself with the work content of all the employees," he said, heading towards Strahov, where because of the long anarchy is supposed to be nervous.
Despite the recent catastrophic scenarios that accompany the upcoming general meeting, he believes that the delegates are not going to Nymburk for nothing on Thursday.
"If really should be the only disputed point as you choose in the third round, then we'll get over it."
"The football needs credibility and he wins back only if he finally has a new leader," Pelta remains optimistic two days before the possibly decisive day of his functionary career.
Rajchl promises that the FAčR under him will start working hard
If the former Deputy Chairman Jindřich Rajchl were to be elected new Chairman of the Czech Federation of Football on Thursday at the Annual General Meeting, it would be said that many people in the Association would miss the mood.
Rajchl promises to start working hard in the event of his choice.
He wants to introduce system changes and to make members of the Executive Committee responsible for individual football areas.
He also promised to solve the Bohemians case, to improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, to bring more money into football, and otherwise to continue the work that Ivan Hašek had started before.
"As chairman, I want to dedicate myself to football as a whole."
Starting from international contacts to UEFA and FIFA, to the national selection, professional football, to performance football for the youth."
"I don't want to say that I want to do everything alone," said Rajchl in conversation for ČTK.
"I am a team player and therefore would like to distribute the competences in the Executive Committee in such a way that each member is dedicated to a certain area."
And I'm going to distribute hard tasks to make the football progress in every segment with milestones."
Many would not have been delighted about this because instead of simply criticizing the work of others, they would have to start working really hard themselves," he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement, it has not been possible to candidate at all.
"I know that I work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that it makes sense and that people are behind me who don't undispute me between the legs and question any step I'm taking," he said as an explanation why he hesitated.
"But many people told me that I should not give up because otherwise others would."
"That's confidence you can't play," he said.
He is said to be also motivated to continue the work he started under Hašek.
"In two years we've done a lot of work and I don't want to just throw it away."
"There have been processes that will only come into force in a few years, and I would hardly see them stopping anyone," he said, expressing his concern here that, in the event that the other candidate - Miroslav Pelta would be elected, the situation could return to the times before Hašek.
"I believe in systematic action and that's something Mirek Pelta doesn't bring."
"Behind him are mainly people who would make the football so that he would only be there for the chosen."
You can probably blame me for something, but not that I would be partial."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want football for everyone, because then everyone goes well and not only the chosen ones," said Rajchl.
He also contradicts the claim that he is only one of the Czechs.
"Even if some people claim the opposite, I really intend to do the best possible for mothers."
"For example, it is time to consider whether one should not divide the league into a Czech and a Moravian part, whose winners then ascend to the first league."
"Then it could not happen that only three Moravian clubs are playing in the league today, which is a problem especially for young players in Moravia," says Rajchl.
Because the head of the Pilsner club Tomáš Paclík has joined the fight for the function of the chairman, Rajchl does not dare to assess his chances of being elected.
"I feel a strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has elected me as its deputy chairman, and now recognizes that there are clear successes behind me," Rajchl said, who also regards the saving of twenty million crowns for unfavorable contracts, the agreement of TV contracts and the negotiations for the lottery law as his success.
On the other hand, he partly blames himself for the fact that the association does not attract a single strand.
While he says of Pelta, "He has been disqualified from the outset to help the Czech football to regain confidence," he believes the second rival - paclík for a strong candidate who really has something to offer the football.
"No one can question that he has done excellent work in Pilsen in just one year."
"If he were to be elected, then he would probably continue the things Ivan Hašek started, and also the staff in the commissions would obviously not change in principle."
He would certainly not want to bow things to his favors," says Rajchl about his rivals.
Europe's most beautiful pools
Jump to Blue
By Julia Stanek
Planschbasin in UFO-Optik, Prunkpools in Budapest: Those who travel through Europe can experience their blue wonder - and after a city tour or hike rest the tired legs in Sprudelbädern.
A book shows where wellness in the water is most beautiful.
If Iris Meder went on a search trip in the past one and a half years, one of them was not allowed to miss her luggage: her swimsuit.
Backlings lying on the water, she looked high in artificially designed domes, she stood out for wild marble butts that were waiting for them on the edge of the basin, and amazed at the acribally restored Art Nouveau di Swims.
She liked a bathroom, she quickly included it in her notebook - including knowledgeable details about the building's design and history.
More than 200 swimming pools explore architecture historian Meder in this way - and now presents her in her recently published book "Badefreuden": Volkswimmerhallen in Munich, historische Badepaläste im Schwarzwald, "Hardcore-Betonbauten" im Taunus.
Through 13 countries she led her "Travel to the most extraordinary baths in Central Europe": In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and each one a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old German is a true bathing culture enthusiast.
With sport, she doesn't have much to do with her hat, says Meder - it's only in the water that's different.
Annoyably only that swimmers have to find themselves with blue tiles and chlorinated tanks, while joggers can breathe in the provoking scent of spruce forests or listen to the joyful bird-wisker in the park.
"One day I wondered why swimming pools must always be so ugly," says the Meder living in Vienna.
"So I started collecting beautiful baths."
Water surface doubles architecture
In the jump pool and essential sauna oils - the wellness factor in baths is therefore so great because all the senses are served, so Meder.
And when the builders have struggled, swimming halls can be a real eye-taste: "A floor has a water surface in baths."
"On the one hand, it is transparent, but on the other hand it reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything doubles visually: high vaults, colorful tiles, springboards.
The small-format picture book "Badefreuden" reveals on 190 pages the value of knowledge about the architectural and cultural history of historical wellness oases - but above all, it is a pleasure to jump to the blue.
The pool collector Meder discovered remarkable specimens during her research in Hungary.
In addition to magnificent spas such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi Bath in Budapest, it found a nitrate-containing water in a burgeoned Karsthöhle (the cave pool in Miskolc-Tapolca) and a thermal bath, whose pools are filled with alkali-containing water and located in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).
Spectacular views, on the other hand, offer many heated outdoor pools in Switzerland and Austria: While you have an eye on the whole city from Zurich's roof pool, you can see the snow-covered Arlberg in the outdoor pool of a bathroom in St. Anton - and: There is a window in the steam bath from which you can watch the drifting on the ski slopes.
The most exceptional swimming pool design awaits guests in Längenfeld: The Aquadome Ötztal looks like a UFO that has just landed in the Alps.
From three bowls open to the top it steams in winter, while in the background the mountains of the Ötztal climb into the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Not in every swimming pool did pool collector Meder raise the smell of chlorine into the nose.
Many thermal baths smell like sulfur, in the Árpád Bath in the Hungarian Békescsaba, it smells so much like heating oil that you hardly believe to have landed in a health bath.
The smell comes from the alkali-hydrogen carbonate-containing healing water, which is almost black and whose slick sticks to the skin as soon as you can slide into the basin - a spa experience of the special kind.
In one place, however, Iris Meder was disappointed in her search for beautiful bathing areas: When she wanted to visit the outdoor and solar pool in the Czech bath of Luhatschowitz, she found a locked terrain.
The bath, designed by the architect Dušan Jurkovic, has since been closed.
When Meder looked through the weathered windows of the red-white-yellow Art Nouveau building, she saw how weed grew between the tiles.
On the other hand, the loss has been countered by a magical swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
Three phases of construction already have this bathroom behind them; one can discover not only neo-Roman elements that came from the times of its construction in 1844, but also a Moorish hall in the Alhambra style, which was added around 1900.
Since the careful modernisation of 1995, the Palais Thermal has been the favorite pool of the Iris Meder pool, not only because it originated in the Black Forest.
"It's already a performance to merge different styles into such a great unit," says Meder.
With such a palace, the dive in the thermal pool seems to be only minor.
Agricultural speculation
Deutsche Bank makes raw material business clear
By Christian Teevs
Does the Deutsche Bank give up its business on agricultural raw materials?
Following SPIEGEL-ONLINE information, Josef Ackermann commissioned a working group to examine the consequences of speculation for the poor in the world.
In January, the head of the Group will then have consequences.
Hamburg -
The matter is clear to citizens: 84 percent of Germans find it unacceptable, according to a study, that banks speculate with agricultural raw materials such as wheat or maize.
Two thirds of the respondents are even demanding that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions get out of this business because it is aggravating the problems of the poorest in the world.
This is the result of a Forsa survey on behalf of the consumer organisation Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
In this, the author Harald Schumann shows that the bets on the global commodity markets are raising prices - and the banks are therefore indebted to the global hunger problem.
The campaign of the consumer protectors is directed specifically against Deutsche Bank CEO Josef Ackermann, even though large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act similarly.
Raw materials laws were originally intended to secure dealers against price fluctuations.
In the meantime, however, most experts agree that the forks have decoupled themselves from supply and demand - and at the expense of the poorest profits.
Unlike the U.S. competitors, Ackermann responded to the criticism: he promised to examine the accusations and said no business was worth putting the good reputation of Deutsche Bank at risk.
According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently examining the accusations from the Foodwatch report.
The audit will be completed by the end of the year, and the results will be presented to the Board of Directors of Deutsche Bank - together with recommendations on how to deal with it.
At the end of January, the bank's head will tell us what consequences it will have.
In the end, there could be a reduction in the raw material business, or even a complete departure.
Ackermann bastels on his image
Foodwatch CEO Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but at the same time reaffirmed his criticism of the financial sector: "Betting at rising prices of food shows particularly drastic how reckless banks today damage the general good."
Ackermann, as the top banking lobbyist, is now especially under obligation.
"The Deutsche Bank must remove all investments from its portfolio where money is used for bets on food prices," Bode said.
"Whether Mr. Ackermann is concerned about people suffering from hunger or about the call of the Deutsche Bank."
At first glance, the insight of Ackermann comes as a surprise, but it is clear that the CEO wants to give a perfect picture a few months before his departure from the office.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the Chairman of the Board will not change to the Supervisory Board other than planned.
With a departure from the controversial agricultural speculation, he could improve his image.
And in order to break down, he hardly needs to shave - that would eventually have to do his successor.
Each second would terminate raw material plants
Foodwatch tries to keep the pressure on the manager high.
To date, more than 30,000 Internet users have already participated in the Organisation’s campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey for which the Institut Forsa interviewed 1001 people on November 7 and 8.
Thus, just eleven percent believe it is legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer facilities that are used for food prices.
Many bank customers would also have personal consequences if they learned that their bank is involved in such transactions: each second would, according to the survey, cancel all investments where money flows into the commodity speculation.
43 percent would dissuade acquaintances from such a bank, 49 percent said to think about canceling their account and switching to another institution.
21st House in Vienna
The drawn pavilion
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
An architectural history with heights, depths and happy ends: The Austrian World Exhibition Pavilion of Brussels in 1958 received awards, became a museum in Vienna, stood empty and arrived.
Now he's being reopened as an exhibition house.
When modern post-war architecture warms up, by clear forms, glass halls, courageous swings and new building materials, which are typical of the belief in technical progress, then the Austrian Pavilion of architect Karl Schwenzer for the world exhibition in Brussels in 1958 is a striking and famous example.
At the time, Swanzer's Pavilion received the Grand Prix d'Architecture for his lightweight and floating steel glass construction.
The construction is still considered a milestone in contemporary architecture.
He announced to the architect that he was also building at the next Austrian Pavilion World Exhibition.
With his legendary BMW four-cylinder house plus skulllike side building in Munich, he eventually became internationally famous in 1973.
After the World Exhibition in the Swiss Garden at the Wiener Südbahnhof, his Pavilion was set up as a temporary exhibition building, and in 1962 a 20th-century museum was opened - the "20th house" was called it.
However, the building was neither spatial nor technical as a museum - no walls for hanging art, no good climate.
Nevertheless, it was used until contemporary art got a new house in Vienna.
Since 2001, the building was empty and came down more and more.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has converted the pavilion, now called "21er Haus" and will be used as a museum of contemporary art in the future.
Tuesday evening, the Belvedere Museum, to which the house belongs, opens the first exhibition there - a lucky case in every respect.
The new beginning of Agnes Husslein-Arco, which became new director of the Austrian Gallery Belvedere in 2007.
Husslein-Arco, a doctoral historian with considerable careers, among other things, in youth as an ice-creating artist, later at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and as the founding director of the Museum of Modern Salzburg, made the conversion strong among politicians and monumentists, she created public funds and private sponsor funds and determined the use.
In addition to contemporary art, the works of sculptor Fritz Wotruba were to be exhibited by the foundation of the same name, there was to be a café and a bookstore, and an office building had to be built.
Strict supervision, small budget
For the implementation, Krischanitz was the ideal occupation.
Not only because he had changed and expanded Joseph Olbrich's Secession in Vienna and won the competition, but because he studied with Schwenzer at the Technical University of Vienna and the Pavilion was for him a "very important place" where he "almost every weekend" viewed the exhibitions.
He knew the original design, and he knew the problems of the building, which was already lost in his move to Vienna and his re-use of generosity and ease.
In the current reconstruction there were far more problems: the building was "an energy locker", says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass facade were replaced, glass fibre reinforced insulating glass were used and the glass roof replaced by special safety glass.
Refrigerated steel beams have been reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled ceilings have been renovated.
Two basements brought space for the new use, a lowered light tomb between house and street provides for exposure, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new building, but still the light cock-pavilion.
The original exterior doors have remained, the house has been removed in the old reddish reddish rust protection colour.
And the cinema is even quite the same as he was before.
And all this under strict supervision of the memorial authority and with a small budget.
"Using to find a material that is good and cheap and also liked the monument protection office," says Krischanitz, pointing to a rough floor in the basement.
Despite all constraints, problems and reconstructions, the building has remained flexible and easy.
It had been difficult with the pavilion, "the one that came from Brussels," Krischannitz recently said, a typical "drop-in-the-City story".
Such an architecture is "always in the wrong place" and still wants to "reciprocate a true consciousness".
In this case, however, the 21st house is not in the wrong place, because it is a city-building accident: around the Swiss garden, the newly planned "Main Station Quarter", with office and residential houses, is just emerging.
And another lucky case may happen: The 21st House could get reinforcement from another Krischanitz building, because the collector Francesca from Habsburg has bought the Berlin Temporary Art Hall, and as one hears, she is already negotiating with the city for a neighboring location in the Swiss Garden.
Railway plans winter crisis package at millions altitude
The railway has fulfilled a crisis plan that is intended to prevent train failures in winter.
The number of employees should be doubled.
It's costing millions.
According to a newspaper report this year, Deutsche Bahn will issue more than 70 million euros in the fight against winter-related train failures and delays.
The "Image" newspaper reported in advance on a group-internal crisis plan that investments of around 300 million euros were planned by 2015.
This aims to achieve better availability of vehicles and rail network even in extreme weather conditions.
Among other things, the planned doubling of internal and external employees for snow removal on railways and railways to 16,000 people is planned.
The aim was to release rail platforms from snow and ice within four to five hours until the start of operation and 90 percent of the operating speeds needed.
Two months ago, Bahn-Chief Rüdiger Grube warned against train failures and delays this winter after a peak meeting with government and industry.
Last winter, the railways in passenger transport had considerable problems, as it lacks reserves, among other things, under difficult weather conditions.
For example, many new regional trains have been waiting for approval from the Federal Railway Office for many years.
There is also a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The railway has also made it possible for years to have the axles of ICE trains examined significantly more frequently in the workshop after an ICE at the Cologne Central Station had a break of axles.
Deutsche Bank pays millions of fines in the US
After the tumult for head Josef Ackermann comes new trouble from the USA: Deutsche Bank has to pay a million fine there.
As if the problems were not enough for the Deutsche Bank at home, the industry giants are still bringing their past to the US: the Frankfurt Institute pays in a comparison of 145 million dollars (106 million euros) to settle disputes due to the ple­tence of five large cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
It's about selling mortgage papers.
The NCUA financial market regulator has proposed a number of large-scale banks to have seduced cooperative banks with false promises to buy financial products and they would have played down the risks.
Such papers lost a lot of value during the financial crisis and took the banks to a depth.
"We are pleased that we were able to solve the issue without the parties having to move to court," said a German bank speaker in New York.
The Bank did not accept any debt with the comparison.
This also applies to the Citigroup, which committed to paying 20.5 million dollars.
NCUA chairman Debbie Matz welcomed the presence of the two money houses.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for the U.S. cooperative banks and jumps in at the same time to protect customer deposits.
The NCUA tries to replace the milliard damage caused.
The now closed comparisons are the first of their kind.
The regulator had also preferred other large banks and in the summer JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
The mortgage papers in question are so-called Mortgage-backed Securities.
This is based on household loans.
When the US real estate bubble burst in 2007, this became a death penalty for a large number of financial companies.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the U.S. Investment Bank tipped Lehman Brothers.
Although the events have been past for several years, the banks are currently blowing a sharp wind in the US.
Investors and supervisory authorities have tried countless actions to obtain reparation or to suspect infringements.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has triggered the biggest wave of action.
It offers 18 large international banks to have over-divided two US real estate financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in mortgage transactions in the volume of around 200 billion dollars.
The Deutsche Bank also has to file a claim from FHFA, which concerns several transactions worth a total of 14.2 billion dollars from 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authority demands that the Frankfurters stand for "substantial losses", without mentioning an exact sum.
The Deutsche Bank had rejected the claims as unending and declared its intention to defend itself.
Warren Buffett is rising at IBM with 10 billion
Finanzguru Buffett invests heavily in IBM's IT company.
Since March he has bought up shares worth more than ten billion dollars.
So far, the great American investor Warren Buffett had always declared that he would not invest in IT and computer companies, as the long-term development of the companies would only be poorly forecasted.
But now he has read IBM's annual reports and changed his opinion on investment in the industry.
He has already had to understand much earlier that IBM mainly provides services and provides computer systems for the IT departments of other companies.
An investment by Warren Buffett is considered to be a knight's blow in the financial world.
As a result, the IBM IT Urgestein may now call itself "Sir IBM".
Buffett now revealed in the US business station CNBC that he had bought IBM shares worth $10.7 billion since March.
His investment holding Berkshire Hathaway has thus risen to one of IBM's largest shareholders with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said that not even IBM had known about the commitment so far.
He praised the management that, even in the economic crisis, had made for proper profits.
"You did a great job," Buffett said on the strategy.
IBM has been relying for some time on the random IT services such as the operation of data centers.
The more than 100 years old computer pioneer also offers software and advice to and powerful company calculators.
Buffett had avoided technology companies so far.
He says he invests only in companies whose business he also understands.
Instead, Buffett joined, for example, a freight train, a lubricant manufacturer or machine builder.
In addition to around 80 own subsidiaries, its Berkshire Hathaway holding shares in a number of large companies such as Coca-Cola and Munich Re, the former Munich back.
The 81-year-old had taken over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and expanded it into one of the most valuable companies in the world with smart investments.
Nevertheless, his lifestyle is modest.
He is therefore a cult figure for countless investors around the world.
His almost inconspicuous sense of money deserved has brought him the nickname "Oracle of Omaha".
After the Buffett investment became known, the IBM stock increased by one percent.
"Big Blue", as IBM is also called, is worth more than 220 billion dollars on the stock market, making it one of the most valuable technology companies in the world, along with Apple and Microsoft.
At Microsoft, Buffett said, but he doesn't want to get in.
Founder Bill Gates is a close friend.
The threat is tangible
Following the discovery of the "Zwickauer Zell" Turkish media doubted the German rule of law.
A newspaper even speaks of a "bloody ideology" that is now alive again.
The murders of eight Turkish tribes and a Greek small entrepreneur between 2000 and 2006 had a right-wing extremistic background.
This message is being responded with fear and concern in Turkey and within the German Turkish population in Germany.
For many German-Turks a long-belted ghost returns: since the fires in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no comparable violence with right-wing extremistic background against Turks.
Nevertheless, the fact that there is extradition in Germany was never in question.
The revealed right-wing extremist network, however, reveals dimensions whose dimension is still not yet apparent.
"Is Bloody Ideology Relived?" entitled the Internet edition of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
On the other hand, the "Sabah" newspaper emphasizes that one of the perpetrators should have been a v-man of constitutional protection, and is concerned that German authorities could also be involved in the right-wing sump.
In particular, the Turkish community of Germany responded: on the weekend, she reminded the victims of racist violence with a guard in front of the Brandenburg Gate.
Only two weeks earlier, the Turkish community in Berlin, together with German and Turkish politicians, had thought in a celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
In happy colors, it had been staged together - as a story of success.
Like an ear fig, the reporting of some Turkish media: "Germany's gift for the fiftieth" is the headline of an article in the Turkish Internet platform "Haber X", which refers to the backgrounds of the murder series.
The German edition of the "Hürriyet" can't be taken to make this mental connection.
"It starts to stink," says the title of Ahmet Külahci's column.
He stressed that people had been murdered, who paid taxes and had made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany with their work.
In German Turkish Internet forums, extremely critically, the action of the police and their subsequent framing success are discussed.
The authors wonder why it wasn't for the German authorities to look for suspects in right-wing extremistic circles.
Some people show themselves at least rhetorically ready for drastic means: "If they continue to slam, there is nothing left for migrants but self-defense and armament."
"That will probably be the best self-protection."
"From the goodness of the Enlightenment and adequacy of the punishment of the whole network depends very strongly on the inner peace in Germany," writes "Selen".
What it means if inner peace is in danger in Germany, the attacks of Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s revealed.
The photo of the fire ruin of Solingen is deeply anchored in the German and Turkish memory.
No other event showed the Turks living here more clearly that there is a tangible threat, and the Germans that mistrust and distance can lead to right violence.
The attacks, however, sharpened the feeling of the we-feeling on the Turkish side.
Do not repeat the mistakes of the past
In the Turkish press, the failure of German politics was mainly affected by the attacks: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the fire attack of Solingen, he sent a complaint to the Turkish president, but was represented by his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel at the funeral in Cologne. Kinkel was in his speech at the time to see how many charges the Turks made.
Quite the same as the value of a person according to the amount of his tax taxes.
The current reporting of the Turkish media once again shows how deep mistrust of many German Turks has been in the local rule of law since then.
In addition to the efforts of extensive education and re-evaluation of far-right terrorism in Germany, it needs open words this time.
The Scandal Bank of the Cürisee
The most adventurous bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
UBS went bankrupt in the financial crisis and since then they have been sleeping from a crisis to the next.
Now let a German judge it.
That's how Axel Weber probably didn't think.
After his spectacular departure from the head office of the Bundesbank, he announced in July that he would take on an almost as spectacular new job in 2013: Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Swiss Grand Bank UBS - an unexpected and random career step.
Axel Weber rejoiced publicly, praised Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its new solidity and made kind remarks about future colleagues.
"The UBS has made the turnaround".
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Viliger and Oswald Grübel".
But in September it became clear that everything would come completely different.
A dealer of the UBS in London had bypassed all the bank's security systems and had lost some 1.7 billion euros.
UBS Chief Executive Officer Oswald Grübel, a banker not only famous in Switzerland, had to leave.
Since then, UBS' Chairman of the Board of Directors has also been considered to be a hit - and everyone has asked: When does Axel Weber finally come?
It has already been announced that Weber will be allowed to advise the bank from February 2012.
And he already takes over the Chairman of the Board in May - not only in 2013, as the bank announced on Tuesday.
For Axel Weber, it becomes hard.
He is not a banker, he is an economic professor and not a banker and would certainly have needed a working time.
He then assumes responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which has just proved once again that it has long earned the title of "the largest scandal bank in Europe".
For the UBS is huge - until recently it was the world's largest asset manager - and, on the other hand, has slumbered from a scandal to the next for years.
Nothing, it seems, remains the once so proud Swiss bank.
It started in the financial crisis.
Until 2007, UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the silent and solid, but also exploitable Swiss asset manager combined it with ambitious goals: She wanted to become a very large number in investment banking.
In 2007, UBS managed with 1.6 trillion dollars more money of wealth customers than any other bank in the world.
On the other hand, as an investment bank, it was the largest banks in the world.
That made an impression.
The former banker and later long-standing bank professor in Zurich, Hans Geiger, said: "My students always put UBS as a model of a good bank at that time."
"From today's point of view, they ask themselves, "How could I be so wrong?"
He was very wrong.
In 2007, it became apparent for the first time that something was wrong in the UBS.
In the middle of the year, Chief Executive Board Peter Wuffli resigned surprisingly, which until then was considered highly intellectual and also brilliant banker.
A few months later, he knew why he had gone.
The bank's investment segment had been pummeled with subprime papers and had to write down billions.
To study this, UBS announced a capital increase in the amount of the capital and wrote 13 billion francs.
For this, she actually found investors, however, who had been shoved over some of them until recently: an intransparent Asian state fund from Singapore and an Arab State fund, which was so hidden that one could not even learn his name.
But that was only the first blow.
It was worse in April 2008.
The bank had to report new billion losses, Chairman of the Board Marcel Ospel, who was still the second best-paid Board of Directors of Switzerland in 2006.
In October 2008, the disaster followed: UBS was facing the collapse in the financial crisis in view of its failure to invest and had to be saved by the state.
The National Bank bought off the UBS for twenty billion problematic securities, and the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for a forced change bond that it could become co-owner of the bank.
All Switzerland was shaken - because it noticed how dramatic it is for a small country when it houses so large banks.
Finally, the balance sheet of the UBS 2007 was more than five times the economic performance of Switzerland (see Graph).
"At one time we couldn't save the UBS," says bank researcher Geiger.
The second was joined by the first catastrophe.
For a few months after that, UBS succeeded in the tax dispute with America and agreed to release the data from the well-performing customers, who might have withdrawn taxes with the help of the Bank.
In addition, she agreed to a payment of 780 million dollars - as a repayment of unjustified profits from these transactions, including fines.
This has made UBS more or less known to have helped with tax evasion.
At the same time, she lost something that had always been her capital in competition for rich customers: the Nimbus of silence.
After the scandal, the Swiss banking secret was no longer the same.
It followed the resignation of Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chairman of the Board.
And the Exodus of customer money.
For example, within a few months, the bank had lost its credibility in both central business areas: in investment banking through mis- speculations and asset management through aid to tax evasion.
And just when it got a little calmer again, just as you thought, now the UBS will get it back, then this unbelievable dealer story follows: A single dealer pummels 1.7 billion euros before the bank realizes that something goes wrong.
And it will be clear: Risk management in investment banking is still not working.
"In the case of Adoboli, it has been necessary to note that risk control has changed too little," says Martin Janssen, economist and financial professor at the Bank Institute of the University of Zurich.
The financial director of a large German bank is also certain: "UBS's problem is that it does not control risk control."
It was the very idea of caution that the Swiss bankers had taken a long time ago to become the guardians of the great wealth of the world: no too great risks, security for money - even beyond the Alpine republic, the world had to collapse.
The safes of the Swiss banks had become the symbol of unshakable reliability such as Lindt and Sprüngli for particularly noble chocolate.
The headquarters of the UBS in Zurich still fits the cliché of the Swiss private bank - it is only a little bigger.
Already the situation is classic.
The bank has its headquarters on Zuricher Bahnhofstraße, which runs directly from the main station to Lake Zurich, which is framed by the snow-covered peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are magnificent, the shops are among the highest in Europe.
Jewellery and Tiffany's can be found here between Swiss traditional shops such as the Confiserie Sprüngli.
For centuries, the Swiss banks have resided here: from the National Bank and the Palace of Credit Suisse to the elitist private banks such as Julius Bär.
The reception room of the UBS is entered by a heavy turn door.
Inside the walls are marble-dressed, there are thick leather chairs, next to the bank logo a large sign of "safe".
The UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
This idea of the Swiss bank has both Swiss big banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, but sometime it has been repressed - or betrayed as the head of a small Swiss private bank finds.
He prefers not to read his name in the newspaper, and finally, like all Swiss bankers, he does business with the two big banks.
The UBS has become far too large, he finds - especially in investment banking, where the fishing axes have also spread.
The Swiss would have nothing more to say.
"And if so, they've long adapted to the customs of the fishing axles."
In fact, it was the Anglo-Saxon Investment Banking, which changed the UBS, that gave it first high profits and then the debacle: No European financial institution has lost as much money in the subprime jungle as the Swiss big bank.
On October 15, 2008, the catastrophe became visible.
"On that Wednesday, the government coalition of the small seven million country decided to take the biggest rescue action in the history of its nation," writes the author Lukas Hestig in his book "The UBS-Crash".
Up to 68 billion francs or around 45 billion euros, politicians approved to save the big bank in front of the bankruptcy.
How could this happen?
If you speak with Swiss bankers, you will see the problem especially in the size of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three large Swiss banks joined a huge group.
There was a bank that was already too big for small Switzerland during the merger - and kept growing.
This helped the two different predecessor banks of the UBS to complement themselves: a rich but sleepy bank with the focus on asset management in Zurich and a poorer, but increasingly internationalized.
Suddenly, the internationalized investment banks came at a low cost to make a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with this rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007 CEO of UBS, and Marcel Ospel, then Chairman of the Board of Directors.
"I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team," says bank researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the highly intellectual, modest, who understands a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, the abdominal man who has worked up from the teaching of the bank up to the top."
But Ospel left for Wuffli in the end.
And in the end, Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake: "He thought his models were the reality," says Geiger.
"This is a tragic case."
Tragic, maybe.
It's clear: arrogance came before the case.
UBS employees remember clearly the executive meetings on which CEO Wuffli repeatedly releases the same parole: Goldman Sachs from the throne.
The US Bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
She introduced the "League Tables", the rankings that documented the success of the banks of that time.
That's where the UBS wanted to get up.
Some steps you've been able to do.
In the foreign exchange business and stock trading, she played on top of it.
However, business consultants who were commissioned highlighted a weakness: in international interest rates, in the banking language "Fixed Income", there was a huge distance to the largest banks.
UBS has gaps in American mortgage products.
In order to close this gap, UBS entered into an adventure that cost it almost the existence.
Hungry for growth, both the bank itself and a hedge fund founded in front of it invested in American subprime plants.
She developed into a huge machine that packed and passed on securities on American mortgage loans, but also maintained risks.
Also, when other banks long sought the exit.
"But in the summer of 2007, when the American real estate market was in flames, the UBS bought there," says Geiger, bank expert.
So great the euphoria, so deep the case.
One manager after another had to go as much as the attempts to clean up more difficult than they thought.
Posts at the UBS have become a locker seat and are still wobbly today.
Anyone who runs the big bank now has an almost impossible job.
It must find a strategy for a bank that has come to grips with all the obvious business models.
Bank researcher Geiger already has an idea: closing with investment banking, focusing on asset management, returning to the Swiss roots.
The bank does not want to go (yet) that far.
But the investment banking is supposed to shrink sharply, so much is already clear.
Next Thursday, the new boss Sergio Ermotti will present his future strategy to the world.
The 51-year-old Italo Swiss was actually only intended as a transitional solution when the bank was surprisingly separated from the predecessor Grübel.
In the meantime, he has been persuasive: he is expected to run the business of UBS permanently, the Zurich Bank announced on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to return the investment bank to the stand in the mid-1990s.
He deletes 3500 points.
But that won't be enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does she want to earn money with?
These are the questions that Axel Weber is sure to ask himself right now.
To date, he has only publicly said that he will look for an apartment with his wife in Zurich.
Next year.
Afraid of recession in Europe taxed US bosses
The threatening recession in Europe has encouraged US investors to start the week.
The changes of government in Athens and Rome remained without any impact.
Drowned industrial production on the continent suffocated the hopes of stabilising the debt crisis in the germ.
The general relief over the change of government in Rome and Athens could not prevail.
The euro fell across from the dollar.
Last week the Italian and Greek glass was still half-piled, not half empty - but now the problems were in the foreground again, said Mark Luzini of Janney Montgomery Scott.
In particular, financial values were placed on sales outlets.
The Dow Jones index of the standard values recorded a decrease of 0.6 percent at 12.078 points.
In the course of trade, the market barometer commuted between 12.027 and 12.170 points.
The wide-ranging S&P-500 index closed at 1251 points, a minus of one percent.
The index of the Nasdaq technology market lost 0.8 percent and went out of trade with 2657 points.
In Frankfurt, the Dax passed with a minus 1.2 percent at 5985 counters.
The industry in the 17 euro area countries has significantly reduced its production and is facing the end of the upturn.
The companies produced two percent less in September than in the previous month, as reported by the Eurostat Statistical Office.
That was skeptical: "We're not an island, we're not dependent," said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe will not be able to get rid of a recession as soon as possible, and there are other signs of weakness in the banks.
The investment legend Warren Buffett only confirmed this caution: It was not yet clear whether Europe was strong enough to do everything for an end of the crisis, he said in a CNBC interview.
It is therefore too early to invest in European government bonds or banks.
Instead, Buffett threw a decade old principle on the pile and entered the U.S. technology industry.
His investment in IBM more than ten billion dollars supported the share price of the traditional group and initially had it recorded almost one percent higher against the trend in trade.
The paper closed almost unchanged at $187.35.
Buffett has, according to its own data, paid an average of 170 dollars per piece and now holds 5.5 percent.
The share price of its investment company Berkshire Hathaway lost 1.3 percent.
Shares of the Bank of America decreased significantly more than the market by 2.6 percent.
The house silverifies almost all the rest of its shares in the China Construction Bank and invests 6.6 billion dollars for it.
With the net profit from the business, the Institute wants to raise its capital ratio and therefore meet harder regulatory requirements.
The aircraft manufacturer Boeing increased and thereby limited the losses in the Dow.
The stock gained 1.5 percent after the Group had collected the largest order of its history.
Airline Emirates ordered 50 long-distance machines of type 777 on Sunday and counted the value of the order to 18 billion dollars.
Including options to 20 more machines, the volume even amounts to 26 billion dollars.
At the New York Stock Exchange, around 710 million shares changed ownership.
719 values increased, 2281 gave up, and 79 remained unchanged.
At Nasdaq, 630 shares in plus, 1913 in minus and 82 in sales of 1.38 billion shares were unchanged.
Intelligent Crowing Expands in Cities
In many places seeds are considered "problem birds": but from the cities, the highly intelligent animals can no longer be driven out, say experts.
Some like them, others want to get rid of them very quickly: Crowds have been part of the cityscape for centuries, but in many municipalities there are local complaints about the dirt and noise of animals.
A means against the "problem birds" is not yet in sight.
Seeds were no longer to be extracted from the cities, said experts at the first crane symposium in East Frisian empty.
Specialists from all over the federal territory are there about possible exits.
You are looking for alternatives in the cities
In doing so, naturalists also brought the problems in cities back to the country flight of the particularly protected seeds: the use of chemicals in agriculture has increasingly destroyed traditional habitats.
The hunting, increasing cultivation and the fall of typical brooding trees made birds difficult to live.
Claws are protected by nature.
Large colonies with more than 600 breeding pairs exist, among others in the Westfälische Soest, in the northwest, among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen as well as in Leer.
There in 2005, a controversial project on the mass killing of cranes in the county for negative headlines had taken place.
Critics had called the catch of the animals in bird traps and the slaughter with bats particularly brutal.
"The normal exaggeration, the gratification, brings nothing," said Werner Klöver, the urban and landscape planner.
Throw away nests with water or fall trees, often have undesirable consequences, said the environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
"The animals differ, large colonies split up and spread in other places."
Glorification is only possible as an exception to hospitals, oldage homes or schools.
"We have to live with them, we can't get them away."
Without the surrounding area, the problem could not be solved in the cities, said Mayor Wolfgang Kellner from Leer.
A combination of glamours of animals from sensitive residential areas and locks is imaginable to settle them in other places.
On the other hand, the psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens used "infoboards instead of chainsaws" for a completely different treatment with the animals: "At last we can best endure a pimple in the face self-confident."
Jürgens had co-founded in Schleswig-Holstein the Ascheberger Krähen-Lehrpfad, informing the sign of the life of the highly intelligent seeds.
The project has already been accepted by tourists.
For the criticism of the noise of birds, Jürgens had his own opinion: "There is a lot of communication, they have a lot to say."
The intelligence and skill of the animals are legendary: Seeds not only use tools to get on a treat, but make their own tools as a tool.
Behavioural researchers at Cambridge University recently tested four seeds, the extent to which the intelligence of birds is sufficient.
In an experiment, the birds quickly learned that with stones they have to bring down a scaffolding structure in order to get to a motten lave.
Without a lot of training, they determined what size and shape a stone must have in order to let the platform collapse.
In a second attempt, the plumbing cranes then had to solve a more tricky problem.
In a vertically positioned cylinder, the researchers had placed a small bucket with a motten larvae.
With the beak, the birds could not reach their prey.
However, the researchers had laid down wire pieces for them.
From this, all four animals formed a hook, with the help of which they took the bucket to the handle out of the tube.
Three of the four seeds did this even on an anhiev.
Cristiano Ronaldo shoots Portugal to the EM 2012
The Bosnia and the Turks' hopes for a coup remained.
The favourites of Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and Ireland are also present at the EM 2012.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have solved the last European Championships for 2012 in Poland and Ukraine in the Play-offs.
Guided by the double successful Superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8th, 53rd) Portugal beat Bosnia-Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and made the fifth EM participation in a row after the 0:0.
The Czechs reached a 1:0 (0:0) in the play-off replay at the external side of Montenegro, after the play (2:0) had already been a clear thing.
No longer left to burn in the 0:0 against Turkey, Ireland took a loose 1:1 (1:0) against Estonia.
Nani (24th), Helder Postiga (72nd, 82nd) and Miguel Veloso (80th) scored the other hits for Portugal.
The former Wolfsburger Bundesliga-Profi Zvjezdan Misimovic with a transformed trade meter (41.) and captain Emir Spahic (65.) had twice shortened for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic saw the yellow red card (54.).
Bosnia had already failed in the play-offs for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa in Portugal.
In the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal caught a measure-by-measure start.
Ronaldo chased a free stroke of about 30 meters to the early lead into the stitches.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani showed his performance and met from 25 meters to 2:0.
The Bosnians, who did not take place in the first half hour, had their first clear chance by Tory hunter Edin Dzeko.
The ex-Wolfsburger from the English table leader Manchester City put a headball at the lower edge of the latte, but the ball did not cross the goal line (33.).
Jiracek meets Czech Republic
The focus was then on referee Wolfgang Stark from Ergolding.
After an attack against Helder Postiga in the Bosnian penitentiary, Stark decided on Schwalbe and showed the Portuguese yellow card (36.).
On the opposite side, Stark gave a controversial trade meter after an action by Fabio Coentrao, which surely transformed Misimovic.
But after the break the vice-European champion of 2004 made everything clear with four hits.
For the Czech Republic, Petr Jiracek also ended the final doubt in the 81st minute.
In 1976, the European champion went to the EM for the fifth time in a row.
However, the team of trainers Michal Bilek with the Bundesliga-Legionaire Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1st FC Nuremberg) also had luck and had to survive a shock second in the initial phase.
Endemann Petr Cech prevented a possible owner by Tomas Sivok with a reflex at the last moment (9.).
Montenegro had its greatest opportunities if the Duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic shot in the 40th minute from the rotation of the penitentiary border just past the gate of Cech.
After the break, the crossover had to save for the Czechs' already beaten world-class goalkeeper, again the stormer of the Seoul FC had withdrawn (50.).
The gate finally made everything clear shortly before.
Turkey has since missed the football wonder of Zagreb.
Four days after the 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb did not go beyond a 0:0.
While National Trainer Guus Hidden has to give up his place on the bank of the 2002 World Cup third, the Croatians can enjoy their fourth participation in an EM final round.
Before 31,000 viewers in Maksimir Stadium, the Turks would have caught a dream start.
In the seventh minute Selcuk Inan met with a distance shot only the post, Angrifer Kazim Kazim could also not sink the exhibitor in the gate.
However, after the horror of Croatia more and more took control.
Even after the break, the Croatians left nothing to burn.
In addition to Mario Mandzukic of VfL Wolfsburg, who made his seat for Dortmunder Ivan Perisic from the 62nd minute, the Bundesliga-Legionaire Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) were in use.
Trapattoni drives to the EM
In Dublin, the Irish celebrated the first EM participation in Germany since 1988.
Stephen Ward led the team of coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who had already made a preliminary decision with the 4:0 success in the play, in the 32nd minute.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57.) was equal for guests.
Ireland had to wait until the 23rd minute before Robbie Keane from Los Angeles Galaxy had the first good chance.
Only in the last moment did the Estonian rear team prevent the possible leadership hit.
But in the 32nd minute it was time.
After an unfortunate defense of Endemann Pavel Londak, Ward was on the spot and pushed the ball over the line to the 1:0.

SAP wants to double the number of employees in China
Europe's largest software manufacturer SAP is investing billions in China in the next few years and wants to almost double the number of its employees in the country.
By 2015, around two billion dollars (about 1.5 billion euros) are expected to flow, the Dax Group announced on Tuesday.
"We will create additional research and development facilities and recruit employees accordingly," said Co-Chief Bill McDermott at a customer trade fair in Beijing.
The workforce is expected to grow from about 2500 to 4500 employees at present.
The number of branches of the world market leader in corporate software will double from five to ten or eleven.
So far, SAP is present in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
About 4000 of the world's more than 176 000 SAP customers sit in the Boomland.
The growth plans in China are also an important component of the strategy 2015 of the Dax Group.

SAP has been active in China for 20 years.
"Now we want to expand our activities (...)," McDermott explained.
"Our goal is to promote sustainable growth in China through comprehensive awareness."
Mass slaughter on a personal level
Stunned and generous, Peter Englund’s new book "Beautifulness and Fear. A History of the First World War, tells in Nineteen Destinies" begins with a long list of main persons that can reach your heart.
Here's a tip of how to proceed: Cut this page carefully and make it your bookmark.
You will get to know these people in Englund’s romantic story very well. And these main people will function as your GPS, as a lighthouse in these few moments when you, like Englund’s men and women, are lost in the fog of war and your illusions are robbed.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which sets the Nobel Prize for Literature.
He has written an unusual book that he does not refer to as "a work of anti-history".
It contains only a few big names, important contracts or famous battles. There are hardly any ambassadors, rushing reporters or discussions about tactics and equipment.
It's less a book about what happened, he explains, but rather "a book about how it was". It's about "feeling, impressions, experiences and moods".
"Beautifulness and terror" almost the war experiences of 20 more or less inconspicuous men and women on both sides of the war, from school girls and botanists to mountaineers, doctors, ambulances and office workers.
Some of these people become heroes.
Some become prisoners of war, lose limbs, get crazy or die.
Each of these lives flashes on like the Votivkerzen in a church, some come to add while others disappear.
Englund's book deviates from the usual history books.
It also corrected the idea that the First World War had only been the devastating war on the Western front.
"Beautifulness and terror" travels with expert views over other war sites: the Alps, the Balkans, the East Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book fall on beehives, one celebrates Christmas among the pyramids in Egypt, Tsetsfliegen are an insoluble problem.
This is almost a moving book from the beginning.
The war floods the lives of these people like a natural disaster, like a Hurricane Katrina, which smells like Kordit.
Imagine you're a woman at home with her children and you hear gunfire in the distance.
Who even comes?
Hardly anyone understands what is happening or why this war is being waged at all.
"Finally facts," says Englund, "were furnished with suspicions, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
"Beautifulness and terror" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German ship sailors.
Their stories were mainly taken from memories, letters and other material already published.
Their life reports can be terrifying or poignant, but they are extremely lively in Englund's detail-losing small moments.
Many of them act with flaw and help themselves.
In the story of a German schoolgirl, he says, "Replacement, replacement everywhere."
"Survey coffee, false aluminum, false radial rubber, paper associations, wooden buttons."
He tells more about the replacement dinner in Germany.
He describes "Fleisch made of pressed rice and baked in hammuff fat (and last served with a false bone of wood), tobacco made from dried roots and dried potato shells, shoes that were stolen with wood."
There were, as he noted, "837 registered food substitutes that were allowed in the production of sausages, 511 registered coffee substitutes."
Some stories act of honor and bravery.
An American recognizes his own urge for wildness and says about the war: "One feels that despite all that is intended for men rather than sitting in the chair, with the evening leaf or the bestseller and a cigarette and a whiskey in hand, and so to do, as meant such a facade civilization and as if there were no barbarism behind its own strengthened and lamented shirt breast."
On the other hand, a British soldier recognizes that he is likely to die and no one will take note of it or take care of it.
"If you distance yourself from the thought of sacrificing yourself, you want to think that this is happening before an audience," he writes.
Instead, it is as terrible as "a condemned man who was hanged in secret."
Other observations are about the old Europe that falls apart and about new forms of terror.
"The conflict became increasingly an economic contest," wrote Englund, "a war between the factories."
He begins the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the bestiarium of the yet young century": "the word turned and ideologically convinced mass murderers in the suit, who slaughters while sitting behind a desk."
Human beings behave in an unforeseen way and there is just as frivolous behavior as heroism.
Englund discusses the soldiers who actively tried to get involved in a prostitute with a sex disease to escape the front service.
"The grotesque expression of this can be discovered in the trade with gonococcles eggs, because soldiers bought and smeared on their geniuses, hoping to get to the hospital like this," he writes.
"Those who were really desperate would put him in the eyes, which led them to be blind the rest of their lives."
In this translation from Swedish by Peter Graves, Englund's poetry is smoothed and yet unobtrusive and adapts perfectly to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes, he begins the way in which the war "unconnected uniquely uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred".
People begin to wonder why their leaders bring them to fight.
The best books about the First World War were usually more falsified than Paul Fußell's "Great War and Modern Memory" or novels like Erich Maria Remarque's "In the West nothing new" than extensive history books.
Englund's band joins an unconventional hall of fame.
His book has the most devastating end of which I have ever read in a book.
I'm not giving it anymore.
But it's like he took us with his book this page with the main characters in front of the nose and lit us with a match.
After an early error, a minutely planned assault
Hundreds of police officers were involved in some of them carrying helmets.
One had decided to spend the night from Monday to Tuesday, because at that time there were hardly any people at Zucotti Park.
The operation was kept secret and only a few senior officials were informed. At first, everyone else believed they were taking part in an exercise.
Police president Raymond W. Kelly was in the middle of them and his presence underlined the fact that the operation was full of challenges.
The incidents of recent weeks, such as the use of pepper spray against Protestants, which violates the rules of the Senate and has given the householders a tremendous increase in public sympathy, were no longer allowed to repeat.
And so was the police action to remove the Protestants from Zuccotti Park after two weeks of planning and training.
Officials had prepared them by observing how occupations were handled in other cities.
A disaster exercise had taken place with a view of Zuccotti on Randalls Island.
Officials strengthened the so-called chaos training - anti-terrorism measures, including the rapid laying of a large number of police officers - to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training unit took place on Monday night on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The command to move into the park came "in the last minute," someone who was familiar with the orders, who spoke for a declaration as "exercise".
"The few police officers who were involved in my knowledge didn't know it was about Zuccotti Park," said someone who wanted to remain anonymous.
"The only ones who knew it was about Zuccotti Park were the senior officials of the resort."
One reason for the secrecy was a lesson that the city had learned.
On October 14th, officials wanted to clear the park, but then turn back when hundreds of Protestants came together after they had learned about these plans.
Officials from various police units were involved in the Tuesday operation, including commanding from all over the city - hundreds of mobile officers who are normally employed in high criminal neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that during the day many people go in and out in the park, almost like Pendler, so that 1 o'clock at night is a good time to go in.
"It was appropriate to do this if the least number of people are in the park," he said.
Rescue car with Jupiter lamps and loudspeakers were ready before the descent at Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive near Manhattan Bridge.
The lamps and the previously recorded messages that were threatening from the speakers seemed to intimidate many Protestants.
When the public officials got into the park in their light blue wind jackets, many protesters simply picked up their stuff and left the place.
The police said that until 1:45 a.m. no tents would be touched to give the Protestants time to pack their goods together.
Other teams of officials were seen as they gathered in the area to intervene, arrests in the park should become necessary.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Paul J. Browne, spokesman of the police president, said this had happened to their own security.
But many journalists claim that they wanted to stop them from watching the police operations in the park, and they said that the officials' business was very rough.
Mr Browne said that television cars could have taken photos on Church Street on the west side of the park.
When the police moved west through the big mess of personal things of the Protestants, including suitcases, artificial grass and bags with clothes, their employees of the city cleaning followed, which had been left behind.
Some Protestants who refused to go were dragged outside. Pictures of this appeared in the Internet a short time later.
A main center of Protestants was located near the camp's kitchen area in the center of the park's position.
Some established barriers and the police continued their methodical arrests.
Around 10 people in the camp's epicenter are connected to their arms.
And two persons chained themselves to trees, said Mr. Kelly.
Civil protection officials were called to cut them off.
As Mr Kelly said, no arrests were carried out in the park by about 3:30 a.m.
According to police statements, the room was completed after 75 minutes.
Mr Browne said 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most arrests occurred, as he said, because of "unprecise conduct and resistance against arrest."
The most prominent official on the site was Joseph J. Esposito, the head of the department, the highest uniformed official in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, head of the crime department, was also there.
Despite his presence, Mr. Kelly "didn't conduct the operation," as Mr. Browne said.
In case they were to access, a second group of officials were waiting on the eastern side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Street.
On Cortlandt Street, a road block north of the park, and on Pine Street, a block farther south, Barrikaden were built.
It could be observed how from these police sites the circle continued to extend around the Zuccotti Park.
In one place, it was observed that several officials, many of them with shields, drove people out.
About 28 people were in the northern region.
Some of the most violent actions of the night took place in the south of the park.
At 5 p.m., a Protestant jumped south of Pine Street on the roof of a police vehicle and other demonstrators left the air out of the tire of a police bus.
In one place the quantity threw a piece of plywood.
In the end, an official and a protestor came to the hospital.
The Trade Union of Advisors will file a complaint against the city due to redundancies
The union, which represents hundreds of school providers who have lost their jobs last month, plans to sue the city on Wednesday, as redundancies due to their inappropriate influence on the schools teaching poor students are not necessary and discriminatory.
The action is probably the last option open to the union, District Council 37, in their efforts to reverse redundancies.
Six hundred and seventy school assistants, support coordinators and other employees who were among the worst paid employees in the city and lost their work on 7 October in a checkout, described the trade union leader as a political revenge for refusing access to a health fund held by the working groups in the past year, with which the budget gap should be closed.
This accusation was categorically rejected by the authorities.
At a hearing of the City Council, Dennis M. Walcott, director of the schools, said last month that the redundancies were part of the budget that one had adopted in June.
A member of the City Council shot back and told him that the budget did not specify that staff would be released from school.
Officials of the City Council 37 said they had and warned the Ministry of Education of a complaint. On Wednesday there will be a press conference on which the submission of the complaint will be formally announced before the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The complaint will be brought by Mr. Walcott and the Ministry of Education of the city as accused and will count eight dismissed workers as all of them colored or Latin-American women, like most of the helpers who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokesperson of the Ministry of Justice of the city, said that the city did not pretend to be the case, so their individual claims could not be commented on.
According to a draft complaint filed by the New York Times, the trade union has focused on the number of redundancies in the schools in the poor areas of the city in order to support a complaint for inequality. It claims that poor schools have lost more helpers because they were chronically underfinanced.
She explains that while there were no redundancies on Staten Island and few redundancies in the schools of the Upper East Side or TriBeca, 17 school assistants lost in the district 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 helpers were released in the districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
With the determination of the loss of five out of eight school assistants employed in the public school 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the complaint states: "This is not a neighborhood of depraved parents who can organize donations to pick up budget cuts."
P.S.: The 36th district budget was reduced by 3.26 percent this year. Furthermore, money was lost when the city changed its method of calculating the extra funding for each poor school enrollment.
The trade union also complains that the leaders of the high schools were led by the language in a memo into error, which approved the release of the care coordinators.
The memo used the English word "excess" to describe the action, even if "excess" (transfer) in the US usually describes the change of a teacher from the salary list of a school to a pool of available workers who are paid by the central office.
"Sixty-six care coordinators have been released, not transferred", states the draft case.
Mission finished, Congress ready to agree with Libya
In the end, Republicans and Democrats in Washington already seem to have agreed on the uprising in Libya.
All that was necessary was the success of the revolt, the arrest and murder of the long-standing dictator Muammar Gaddafi and the end of the American interference.
On Thursday, the Senate's Committee on International Relations decides on a resolution which is based on the chairman John Kerry (Massachussetts) together with Senator John McCain (Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Connecticut) who praises Libya for the successful rebellion and the US troops for their "must".
"This resolution honors the courageous people of Libya who have begun to rebuild their country," said Kerry.
"It is a confirmation of the support of its democratic efforts by two parties."
The language may sound innocent, but so far nothing was simple in the Libya debate.
This summer, legislators of both parties and the White House argued about the election of a series of resolutions to approve or disapprove the role of the U.S. military in the NATO Libya mission.
In June, Kerry and McCain presented a resolution approving the limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The law was rejected in the Senate by a broad group of both parties and there was no vote.
The same day, however, this law fell in the Senate. In addition, the board passed a decision to reduce the funds for American operations in Libya.
As a result, the US mission got into a kind of legislative purgatory - with a congress, which was enough to criticize Obama's approach in the course of the mission, but not angry enough to finally pull the ground under his feet.
Then the inconsistency of the Congress was overtaken by the events.
Tripolis fell among the Libyan rebels in August and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October.
Now the Senate may be ready to act.
The resolution of the Committee on International Relations "gratulates the people of Libya for their enormous courage and extraordinary endurance in their self-expression" and "appreciates the men and women of the US military and their coalition partners, who support military operations to protect the people of Libya, for their extraordinary courage and professionalism."
The resolution also reaffirms "the national interests of the United States in a successful and irrevocable transition from Libya to democracy".
Will the new measures receive full support from the Committee on Foreign Relations or will they divide the legislators as the June Act did?
The last version is based on the resistance of Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indianapolis), the leading Republican of the Committee.
Lugar's spokesman said on Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new law.
According to Kapitol, it is up to the Senate to vote this week on a constitutional change that calls for a balanced budget, a top priority in almost every Congress legislative period of the Republicans and some Democrats.
The measures under the direction of the Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia) will be the first constitutional change of the budget or any other area that is currently coming to the vote in the Senate or Congress.
To date, other legislators have tried unsuccessfully to bring their changes to the vote, even though they have often tried enough.
Goodlatt change is just one of 68 constitutional changes that have been presented to this Congress and which cover a whole range of topics.
Some are double - the same law was presented to both Congress and Senate - others are only slightly different from each other.
There are at least 15 versions of the budgetary adjustment in the Senate alone and another dozen that would "control federal spending".
Some of the laws are also identical, but they give their clients - especially beginners with Republicans who want to polish their CVs - the possibility to boast that they have "strengthened" such a measure.
The Budgetary Control Act, adopted in August, requires that both Senate and Congress vote on a change in the budgetary balance.
In March, 58 Senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such a change.
In addition to the budget, some members want to limit the number of provisions that members of the Congress may submit, while Republican José E. Serrano (New York) intends to abolish the limit to two term of office of the President.
Republican Jesse L. Jackson (Illinois) has proposed a series of amendments to ensure, among other things, the right to good education and health care.
A change which prohibits marriage among sexes is a recurring template, as is a change that prohibits the burning of flags.
Some legislators also want to allow the abolition of federal laws if two thirds of the states reject them.
As zealous as the members propose amendments, they move as rapidly as they have been in recent years.
In the 111th Congress, legislators submitted 77 such amendments in the 110th Congress 66.
The pace fades in comparison to that of the early 1990s, in which members regularly propose more than 150 changes every two years, according to the figures provided by the Senate library.
But they were not much more successful than today.
The last amendment - the 27th - was ratified in 1992 but was actually proposed to the Congress in 1789.
"Affected, but not defeated", Giffords said in the first TV interview after the attack
Ten months after an armed man shot her from the nearest distance during a Tucson election event, Republican Gabrielle Gifffords (Arizona) appeared on national television on Monday evening. She sang alone to the Broadway piece "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said the desire to recover was greater than to return to Congress.
When she joined Diane Sawyer in the ABC news "20/20", she rose by words and needed help walking.
The mission showed the heavy slow recovery from the damage that the bullet, which divided its skull, has pierced the left side of her brain and crossed her head from front to back.
Three months ago, she returned surprisingly to Congress to triumphantly give her voice to the debt brake.
In her first television interview after the attack in January, in which six people were killed and 13 injured, Gifford smiled, laughed and sang - and described her recovery as "slow".
When Sawyer asked her how she felt, Gifford (41): "All right."
The interview with Gifford and her husband, Astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a one-hour "20/20" special that was recorded shortly before the publication of the new book of the couple: "Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope."
The special follows Gifford's recovery since the attack of January 8.
In videos that Kelly had recorded in the first weeks, she was seen in hospital bed, with a bald shaved head and a long scarf above the forehead.
She can only lift one or two fingers if her husband encourages them to do so.
Months later Giffords sits in a wheelchair while therapists show her how she performs simple movements.
A nod with your head.
A tuck with the lip.
And then, their first words, "What."
After a few days Giffords whispers another word: "Toast". She wants her breakfast changed.
Videos that are played in the ABC show show show show that music played an important role in Gifford's recovery: You can see how the congress members sing together with the therapists to Cyndi Lauper's "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" and to Tom Petty's "Free Fallin'".
In an interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who spends two hours daily with therapy, said that she cannot remember the day of the attack.
Her husband said that on March 12 he had read an article of a daily newspaper about the attack when she interrupted him and for the first time asked about the six people who had been killed during the attack.
The alleged shooter Jared Lee Loughner is in a prison in Missouri and is compulsively treated medically while waiting for his trial.
"Many people have died," said Gifford's Sawyer.
"Heart, heart, heart."
As his wife recovered, Kelly Sawyer said, "I was hit."
"So, I would say, "Gabby, you weren't defeated?" said Kelly.
You've only been hit.
And you will endure it, and you will recover, and you will come back stronger than ever before.
Forces feel more compassion than respect
The event was a Wall Street gala that collected millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss.
On one tag a hundred soldiers, sailors, pilots and marines gathered around him.
The amount in black smoothings stood up and applauded.
"The soldiers and soldiers were seen as heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the donation campaign in spring.
A senior military officer on the Gala, who was watched by the Chief of Staff and then Chairman, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops differently.
"They were introduced like orphans," the officer wrote in an email.
I'm sure the organizers meant well.
I know.
But it wasn't respect, it wasn't.
The dissident impressions illustrate the difficult relationship between the military and the mostly distanced, sometimes admirable American public.
The troops are filled with praise for their sacrifices.
But the praise has its price, say servants.
The public is increasingly acting as though it were suffering the people in uniform.
"We were by no means victims," said Brigade general Sean B. MacFarland, who ordered troops in Iraq and will soon go to Afghanistan.
"But apparently the only way of supporting him is to push us into the role of unhappy souls."
The issue is extremely sensitive to military leaders who do not want to appear ungrateful or in dispute with the public who serve them.
They also realized that the anger against returning troops in the last years of the Vietnam War was far worse.
As a result, discussions about compassion in silence and privacy between war veterans take place.
After his two sons returned from battles with the Navy, the Colonel a.D. Mark Cancian warned them that people outside the military world could see their service from two different perspectives.
Some would look at them with a sense of reverence because they had defeated rebels and traveled to exotic places.
Others would ask themselves if a "wrong, violent veteran is hiding under the surface," said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and took over a raised state post in Washington after his return.
During his job search, he said, he felt that some of the respondents were subtly asking whether he was able to stop the pressure of a demanding post in Washington right after his return from the fight.
"If you talk about your service, you have to keep the negative impressions against it," said Cancian to his sons.
The lack of lightness of the military is partly rooted in the lack of interest of Americans in the war.
Performances on the battlefield are rarely taken out as praise by a country that has little experience with the military and sees little benefit in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"We as a nation no longer appreciate military heroism as it was in the Second World War," said Lieutenant General David Barno a.D., the U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the praise of politicians and the public concentrates largely on the suffering of a servant.
troops find recognition for the number of attacks they have endured, the number of friends they have lost or for the severity of their injuries.
The military is putting increasing pressure on the hard to get through with rape
This week, an important hearing decides whether 28 women and men are charged with non-intervention in the event of rape before the military court.
If this is not the case, hundreds of applicants will be ready for the next hearing.
Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and pregnant in the 11th week when she was raped by a soldier colleague at night.
It was in October 2008 and she just returned to her barracks in Miramar north of San Diego from dinner with a friend when she met a male colleague who carried a 12-pack beer with her.
He asked her if he could accompany her on a drink in her room.
"My alarm bells went on," said Lyman.
But the Texanes knew their concerns aside.
I thought, "Oh, what, he's 19.
He's from Texas," she said.
"I wish I had listened to my gut."
A few minutes after they went to Lyman's room, the man stepped behind her, pushed her down and raped her, she claims.
This week, on 18 November, Lyman and 27 other current and former military workers are anxiously waiting for a trial with a historical hearing in Arlington, Virginia, in which it is decided whether an action they have filed against former Minister of Defense Robert Gates and its predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will be brought before court.
The claim claims that Gates and Rumsfeld did not object to widespread rape within the military and breach of the constitutional right of the soldiers.
In February by Susan Burke, a lawyer from Washington, D.C., the action included 17 injunctions, but in the following months rose to 28: 25 women and three men, all claiming that they were raped or sexually abused by soldiers, and that the military failed to determine, condemn, or provide an appropriate jurisdiction according to the alleged attacks.
Burke says she's following the top military leadership, because the problem starts there.
"The military is hierarchically built," she says.
"Who are the individual people who are in the position to eradicate the culture retribution of those who are led?"
Burke also says that she has contacted almost 400 survivors since February, many of them could be part of future complaints.
Their strategy: Instead of the fact that all the complainants put their eggs in a basket, they will, if necessary, submit many more complaints in order to maintain the pressure.
The Defense Team, led by Mr Neil MacBride, has filed an application to reject action.
The files of the Court of Justice, which are available on the newsweek, show in detail the defence strategy, primarily that the military cannot be sued by current or earlier soldiers for injuries that have occurred in the armed forces.
According to a law of the Supreme Court of 1950, the so-called Feres doctrine, the government is not liable for injuries committed to soldiers in active service.
"The alleged damages occurred during the military service of the defendants," the document states.
The Ministry of Defense refuses any comment on this story.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
If women are still not allowed to serve in battle, the distinction is only in the name: modern wars have rarely clear fronts.
In Iraq and Afghanistan, soldiers' teams play increasingly important roles, especially in contact with local women in the war zones.
The result: between these two wars, 150 soldiers, two thirds of them died in battle.
It's time the military was modernized, says Burke.
And she is not alone in her battle: three more complaints besides her are pending.
At Yale Law School, Veterans' Legal Services Clinic is preparing an action against the four major military academies for supposed promotion of a anti-female atmosphere.
Independently, the non-profit Vietnam veterans of America filed a suit against the military, focusing on the diagnosis of "personality disorder" that rape victims received in order to release them from the service - a common practice according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati of the Service Women's Action Network, a human rights group.
In December, her group filed an appeal against the Veterans Administration (i.e. the administration of the Veterans of War) in which she proposed their discriminatory practices in dealing with rights of performance for persons who stated that they had been sexually abused in service.
Nine laws were presented independently of each other by a mixture of senators and representatives of both parties to the Congress, which offered a number of clues.
According to the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office (i.e. Office for Prevention and Reporting Sexual Abuse) of the Ministry of Defense 3.158 sexual abuses were displayed in 2010.
But most abuses are not reported at all and, according to the Pentagon’s own estimate, this figure takes into account about 13.5 percent of estimated 19,000 cases per year.
The report, which was published in March, also examines the prosecution rates: in 2010, 20 percent of the cases in the military were brought before court, only half as many as in civil law.
The complainants in Burkes case describe their attacks as just the first of a series of dreams.
In Lyman's case, she reported the suspected rape of the military police less than one hour after the attack.
That night, she says, she was asked 11 times to tell the details of her rape to a whole range of police, doctors and commanders.
She had a rape set and the blood of her attacker, who came from a cut on his arm, was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was heard by a judge. During this hearing, she was asked about the sex she had in front of the assault with her friend.
Six persons expressed themselves as characterists in the name of the suspected perpetrator, who was ultimately acquitted.
"I still remember the day the verdict was read," says Lyman.
"I thought the pains would use. I ran out of the courtroom screaming."
"They took me to the psychiatric department and I remember that when I got out, I said to my commander, "That wasn't his procedure. That was my procedure."
Lyman was asked to visit a military psychiatrist who eventually diagnosed a personality disorder and declared her inability to serve.
In January 2010, she was disdained, so that she would not receive any support.
Whether the action filed by Lyman and the other complainants is progressing, is purely speculation, says John Turley, professor of law at George Washington University Law School.
Nevertheless, he says, "In my opinion, they should move forward."
What is between them and a verdict is this doctrine that has been criticized since it was first questioned.
I'm a critic of the Feres doctrine.
The military is lagging behind for a decade because they do not have the same incentive and the same deterrence that comes with liability.
He adds: "The chances are against them... but it is important for them that they try."
These things will only change when good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing does not follow her path, Burke, the lawyer of the complainants, will start with hundreds of other complaints for future cases.
"We will continue to fight the military in this respect until reforms occur," she says.
Or until we die, whatever happens first.
Walls have eyes: How researchers watch you on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was only one of many guys who sent their anti-immigration opinion online.
On Monday, Breivik, who had agreed to have committed his first public hearing in court at an apocalyptic in Norway in July, where 77 people were killed.
Although Breivik may have acted alone, he is by far not alone in cyberspace: he has spent a lot of time in front of his computer and chatted with some of the millions of nationalists who support far-right groups on social networks.
After the tragedy of this summer, researchers wanted to find out more about these people.
But how do you find them?
This is easy - you just have to log in to Facebook.
"We have found that it was not difficult to come to them," says Jamie Bartlett, the main author of a recent report by the British design factory DEMOS on digital populism in Europe.
Facebook's hiding of personal data is so encyclical, Bartlett says that researchers simply have to use the site's advertising tool to precisely define their desired demographic data with scientific accuracy - just as marketers have been doing for years.
Bartlett's team found half a million fans to the right-wing groups throughout Europe and then visited them with add-ons, but instead of linking with a new band or a new diet product, the Adds invited users to a survey that asked for their education, attitude towards violence and the assessment of their own future.
Thanks to Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to question more than 10,000 followers of 14 extremely right-wing parties in 11 European countries - without even having to leave their office once.
"It's a quite new research method," says Bartlett.
Some of the results are hardly surprising. Online funding right-wing extreme groups are mostly young, male and angry about immigration.
But in a kind of surprising twist, "those who combine their online activism with an offline activism are more reasonable, democratic and less violent than those who stay behind their computer screens."
DEMO's work is just an example of how Facebook becomes a new hot tool in the hands of scientists.
Ideas factories, medical researchers and political scientists use this page to study everything, from health issues to social trends such as in "likes", text messages and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users, who on average add three content per day, Facebook's "Data Supernova" generates a research tree that has increased the number of scientific work with the name of this page in the title by almost 800% in the last five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is the fact that you can study through this page people that you usually cannot reach with your clipboard on the street.
"If you used to try to question people of the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"They had to inform the party first and they would never have allowed them access," says Bartlett.
"With Facebook all this goes away - you go directly to them."
Others say that the site offers an opportunity to identify and solve social health problems.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno from the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues found out that students who discussed their full noise on Facebook tend to drink more significantly than students who are silent about this topic.
Moreno suggests that senior students, such as residential consultants, monitor the site and help a student when it posts too many status updates.
"You can't solve a problem if you haven't recognized it," said Dimitri Christakis, Morenos co-author and head of Child Health, Behavior and Development at Children's Research Institute in Seattle of Washington Post.
"We have found a way to identify vulnerable children who would not otherwise have been found."
Facebook also constantly addresses the data of its own population.
The site's data team has created statistics on relation status and Valentine's Day, election participation in the intermediate elections 2010 and a National Happiness Index (which has primarily been used to access information only Facebook - Masters of digital freedom have long known that the site should make its large data base for other research purposes accessible.)
However, Facebook users know that the page they are watching whether they want it now or not. To be able to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, you allow the site to deliver your own personal data.
But what if Facebook users become part of a survey they don't even know about?
While researchers have strictly defined guidelines on how to collect their data offline, online everything is allowed.
"I don't think that many users have ever thought about the fact that a researcher could study their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at London Knowledge Lab, to a study from 2006 in which he examined the public pages of students on Facebook.
"As far as she is concerned, it was only about her and her friends."
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline there is no guarantee that a researcher is absolutely honest.
On Facebook it is impossible to know how many of the information is true in a user profile and in posts.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things," says Selwyn.
Therefore, in spite of its years as a technology researcher, Selwyn thinks that a clipboard and a pen are still the best research tools anyone can use.
"There is no substitute for going out into the real world and talking to real people," he says.
"Social research must take care of social life - and a lot of social life is still taking place offline."
"Kalt and inhumane": Anders Behring Breivik appears for the first time in a public court
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who managed two apocalypse runs, in whom 77 people were killed in Norway this summer, described himself as a "resistance" fighter in his first appearance in front of a public court in Oslo.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and a temple rider in Norway," he said to a courtroom with more than 500 people.
"I object to the court, as you have received your mandate from organizations, which support Hassideologies and because this supports multiculturalism."
"I recognize the laws, but I don't recognize myself guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue because he "did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform on which he can express his views."
For the same reason, he refused to allow Breivik, who spoke in advance, to turn to the members of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered that the police keep Breivik in custody for 12 more weeks, he has no access to the media for four weeks. He said that the authorities will control all visits and all correspondence over eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and members of the victims participated in the hearing.
Some came in the hope of being able to see Brievik in the eyes, others wanted to confirm that he was staying behind the castle and bars.
All participated with the aim that everything would go out on a trail.
"I thought he was cold and inhuman," said a survivors of Utoya to the Norwegian channel NRK.
"It was unpleasant, but for me it goes a bit further after I have seen and heard the suspect."
Breivik wore a dark suit and a blue tie and worked calmly and professionally throughout the hearing. He looked journalists and survivors in the eyes as he entered and left the building again.
Despite Breivik's bizarre notice that he was part of a larger resistance movement, the judge concluded that he was not mentally ill and said that there was no evidence that he had complications.
It may be some that the attacks of July 22 were apparently the work of a single extremist and not that of a group of radicals.
But does this automatically ease the sorrow and confusion that a whole nation still feels?
"I wish he looked like a monster, but he doesn't," said the victim's family.
"It would be so much easier if he did it."
7 lessons of the interview with the late Steve Jobs, which was shown at a theatre this week
After Steve's death on October 5, some compared him with Henry Ford, highlighting the engineering genius as a great modern inventor.
However, what Apple fans might find most interesting in the recently discovered Job Interview, which this week was exposed to special film screenings on the important markets, is how much this creative head understood business processes and workflows.
He was certainly a designer, a dreamer and self-appointed hippie, but he was also an acribious organizer who was very zealous in charts - a man who believed that many managers suffer from "an illness of thought", "that is a really great idea 90 percent of work... [but] there is an enormous amount of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product."
In 1995 Bob Cringenly developed the TV series "Triumph der Fachidioten" on the outbreak of the personal computer. And he sat together for more than an hour with jobs in which they conducted one of the rare, detailed conversations.
At that time, jobs had passed 10 years since they had been forced out of Apple. And he was already working hard on his new computer company NeXT, and was looking forward to the broad adoption of the Internet.
While a small part of Cringley's interview was used in specialized periods, he says that the copy templates of the interview were missing during delivery.
Only after jobs were discovered a full VHS copy in the Director's garage.
This slightly revised film material is the basis for the 68-minute film "Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview", which will come to the Landmark Theatre on Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone who is aware that he hates extensive interviews, jobs here seem surprisingly zealous in explaining his technological philosophies and business strategies.
And incredibly thoughtful.
In the course of the interview, there are four longer breaks between question and answer - 10 to 15 seconds of thinking, in which jobs are clearly weighing their thoughts and trying to achieve accuracy.
There are also moments when jobs' perfectionism comes up when he seems impatiently reacts to Cringely's questions and moves him to respond more quickly to topics or side-effects of greater importance.
Before the era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone recorded, the lost interview seems somehow eerie when jobs assess what other companies of their opinion do right or wrong and its own vision of the future of the computer.
It's one thing to read post-human approvals of career jobs'. But seeing jobs here as the greedy dreamer, who is on the jump to grandeur, is something quite different, original and inspiring.
He has a vision of how things could and should be.
Shortly after he had done all this here, he pulled out and did it.
A quick look at seven remarkable sequences of the lost interview:
How he learned to run a company:
"During all the years of business, I always ask, "Why are you doing things?" And the answer you always get is, "Oh, that's how it is done."
No one knows why he's doing what he's doing.
That's what I found.
Jobs continue to carry out its efforts to rationalize the accounting of Apple.
Surprising how costs were recorded - most of the time one started with "standard costs", which were calculated on mere presumption and which were then adjusted with "deviation" - he developed an automated factory that ensured that the business costs could be determined to the smallest.
As the Pope was especially told:
Jobs tells of the "Blue Box", which he built with Steve Wozniak, a device that could be used to plug into the phone company and run long distance calls for free.
Much has already been written about the device, but jobs enthusiasm when he describes the Blue Box as an act of self-authorization is contagious.
He describes how Wozniak and he would test the box by using a payable phone, make a call, and then connect from an AT&T network to another, while dragging as many satellites as possible.
"We sent things around the globe for half a dozen times, and if you're digging into the phone, it came out in the next phone one minute," says Job-kichering.
"We were young and we learned that we can build ourselves up something that can control trillions of dollars of infrastructure around the world."
Both of us, we didn't know much, but we could build this little thing that could control a gigantic thing, that was an incredible lesson and I don't think there would be without them Apple.
Jobs went on to tell of a glorious strike, the Wozniak and he almost moved off when they called in the middle of the night via Blue Box in the Vatican and spoke to the Pope while they were so good they were able to imitate Henry Kissinger.
Since several members of the Catholic Hierarchy were called in the middle of the night to speak with the American diplomat, the two had to laugh off before the Pope himself came to the phone.
How he fell in love with technology (and unprepared called Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12, when he was looking for spare parts to build a frequency counter, he searched for Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called him.
Shortly after her 20-minute phone call, jobs for the summer received a part-time job at Hewlett-Packard.
"That had a remarkable influence on me. It was the only company I had seen at the age and it shaped my views on what a company was and how well it treated his employees."
Later, jobs became one of the HP employees who visited the company's research laboratories in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desktop computer ever produced".
He was as big as a suitcase, had a small screen with Braunscher tube and I fell in love with him.
I would climb up at HP as a teenager and hang on this machine and write programs for her.
How to Improve Innovations:
Jobs discuss how to spontaneously invent new products several times in the interview.
Early in his career, when he built some platinums, he was asked by a customer to assemble the whole computer.
He worked with a payment period of only 30 days and had to think about the assembly as well as the delivery of the finished equipment.
Later on at Apple, he recalls the problems he had in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember striking arguments... you screamed at me that it would take five years [to build a mouse that would cost $300] and I stood up, went out and found a manufacturer."
Ninety days later we had a mouse that we could have built for $15. That was incredibly credible.
About large enterprises that are leaving behind:
Long before he revived Apple, jobs anticipated the paths on which so many industrial giants came into danger with their visions and lost control of their shares.
"Do we say you work at IBM or Xerox, so do you make a better copyer or printer, so what?"
They own the stock monopoly, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, so [there are such people] who ultimately lead the companies and the product with which people are forced out of decision-making.
The product genius, which has led to this monopoly position, is necessary by the people who have no concept of good products vs. bad products, exterminated - craftsmanship.
That happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry.
One could have been ten times bigger, Microsoft could have been in the 1990s...
You've caught the defeat of victory.
About innovation as an art form:
"It's a lot of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product... when you develop this great idea, it changes and grows."
You learn a lot about his subtleties.
You have to make votes, certain things you can't do, but electrons, glass, robots, factories.
You have to remember 5,000 things, these concepts, and bring them all together...
In the end, it turns out to be the taste, the result is that you try to work out the best stuff that people have created, and then try to bring these things together to what you do.
Picasso said that good artists are copying, claping great artists.
We are always shameless in standing great ideas.
Part of what did Macintosh great was that the people who worked there were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians who were by chance the best computer scientists in the world.
If it hadn't been the computer industry, they would create fantastic things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas diminate with opponents of the health laws, as court accepts case
On the day on which the Supreme Court gathers behind closed doors to discuss the politically divisive question of whether to listen to a challenge to the health laws of President Obama, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, took part in a dinner sponsored by the law firm that the case is represented before court.
The incident took place last Thursday when all nine judges met to discuss the petitions for examination.
One of the cases to be dealt with was a case brought by 26 states against the far-reaching reform of health care, which had been decided by the Congress last year, a law that became a keyword among conservative activists throughout the USA.
The judges agreed to the hearing. In fact, a 5 1/2 hour basic discussion is expected in March, which is likely to stimulate the 2012 presidential battle, which will be in full swing at the time when the court decision is announced.
The lawyer who is in court and who will claim that the law is to be tipped will probably be Paul Clement, once general prosecutor under the government of George W. Bush.
Clement's law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of the nearly two dozen companies supporting the annual dinner of federalist society, an old-fashioned group dedicated to the defense of conservative legal principles.
Another company that sponsors dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the business associations, the National Federation of Independent Business, who challenge the law.
Another sponsor was Pharmacist Pfizer Inc., who is financially involved in the result of the process.
The dinner took place a few hours after the court had consulted on the case, in a Washington hotel.
The service included Mitch McConnell, the leader of the Republicans in the Senate and a declared opponent of the health reform
The guests of the dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is nothing new: the two judges have been visiting events of federalist society for years.
And that does not violate moral rules.
In fact, judges are exempt from the Code of Conduct, which regulates the actions of the lower federal judges.
If they were, they would probably fall under the principle of 4c of the Code, which states: "A judge can participate in benefits events of law closer to and from other organisations, whereby the judge should not be a speaker, guest of honor or, according to the programme, a guest of such events."
Nevertheless, the extreme proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the firms involved in the case as well as to one company with a massive financial interest in this in order to alert moral and government activists.
"This amazing rupture with morality and the opposition to the Code punishes the actions of some judges, the court adheres to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of the Common Cause, a civil rights movement in the USA.
"The judges won and dined during a benefit event with lawyers with floating proceedings at the court."
Their appearance and support of a donation campaign for this event undermine any right to impartiality and are unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas show little consideration for critics who say they would easily mix court matters with groups that can be guided by the agenda, such as federalist society.
And Thomas's wife Ginni is a well-known conservative activist.
On the other hand, the Conservatives claim that it is Judge Elena Kagan who has a moral problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was a general prosecutor under the Obama government when the first legal disputes were brought before the Court of First Instance.
Their critics urged Kagan to withdraw from the hearing of the case for bias, as she was too committed to defending the law in order to be unbiased.
Kagan doesn't make any institutions to do this.
Boeing attracts record order of 18 trillion dollars on land
Airlines Emirates shall order 50 two-way aircraft of type Boeing 777 with an option to 20 more aircraft.
Also, Boeing sells six Boeing Dreamliners to Oman Air, a business worth more than $1 trillion.
It is really a rare news that a company gets an order over 50 pieces of its products.
But it's a big business if the company of aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. is and the list price for these 50 aircraft is a record total of 18 trillion dollars.
Similarly unusual is the client of Boeing: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In a forecast published on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that airlines from the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth 450 trillion dollars in the next 20 years.
Boeing announced on the weekend his biggest order of all times for commercial aircraft, measured by the value of the order: 50 two-course Boeing 777 Jets.
The Hammer order came from the airline Emirates from Dubai.
The airline also has, according to Boeing, announced at the Dubai aviation show in 2011, an option to purchase 20 more aircraft that increases the entire list price to 26 trillion dollars.
On Monday, according to Boeing Oman Air, six Boeing 787-8, the so-called Dreamliner, ordered enormous improvements in the fuel consumption and comfort of passengers.
The list price for six of these planes is more than $1 trillion.
"This is absolutely positive for Boeing," said Neal Dihora, stock exchange expert of Morningstar.
"The quality of these special customers is very high."
Many Middle East airlines are owned by oil producing countries.
So they don't just have the money to pay for the aircraft. Rather, an increase in oil prices, which usually harm airlines, because this is one of their biggest cost points, is not so harmful as the country deserves at a higher oil price.
This is important because they tend to cancel or delay aircraft orders less than other airlines when oil prices rise, said Dihora.
"They have a natural protection," he said.
The order of Emirates confirms Boeing's leadership position on the market for large-scale aircraft and helps to keep Airbus competitors SAS in chess, which attacks the pre-representation with the A350.
Boeing's victory on the aviation show comes four months after Airbus announced that it would delay the introduction of the largest A350, which competes directly with the 777-300ER.
One shifted the introduction to gain more confidence after customers had demanded a higher payload and reach.
The Boeing shares rose by 1.5% to $67.94.
Sister of the Mexican president apparently loses choice in Michoacan
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that the drug dealer has supported the opponent Fausto Vallejo of the PRI in the race for the governor's post.
The sister of President Felipe Calderon apparently lost her application for the office of Governor of Muchoacan during the violent state elections. She claimed on Monday that drug dealers had influenced the race in favor of one of their opponents.
According to the preliminary results, Fausto Vallejo won the race for the governor's post in the Western State from the Institutional Party of the Revolution, the PRI.
"The intervention of organized crime throughout the election process and especially on yesterday's day is alarming, not only for Michoacan, but for the whole country," said Luisa Maria Calderon in a radio interview one day after the Sunday election.
"They threatened our candidates, our employees in the surveys ... They have occupied election cabins, built roadblocks ... and commissioned people to vote [for the PRI]."
The PRI reigned in Mexico for seven decades until it lost the presidency in 2000.
But they are striving for a return and victory in Michoacan is an important step in these efforts.
The PRI hopes for a victory in the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have just beaten Claderon, who had been conducting the pre-election polls.
Calderon, a candidate for her brother's conservative Partido Acción Nacional PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as her winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate of the left Democratic Revolution Party PRD, the current governor, came to third place, a severe defeat for the split and unfortunate left leadership for the presidential election 2012.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the preliminary results.
Vallejo, former mayor of the capital of Morelia, denys links to drug dealers and urges the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacan has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and amphetamines.
It is the home country of President Calderon and he has chosen Michoacan to launch a militaryly led offensive against drug dealers in December 2006.
Violence is still continuing.
A PAN mayor was killed one week before the election for Luisa Maria Calderon and numerous candidates have left for fear of local elections.
For the PRI, a victory strengthens the party, no matter how repugnant the elections in Michoacan appear.
The man who will probably represent the PRI in the race for the presidential office is Enrique Pena Nito, who congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said, "I think this victory will make us look bravely into the next year."
ADB urges Asia to help save the Eurozone
Asia's development bank (Asian Development Bank, ADB) calls on India and China to support the Eurozone's rescue in its severe debt crisis in order to prevent a long-term downward trend that will slow down the growth of Asia's economy.
Rajat Nag, managing director of the ADB based in Manila, said that the two world's fastest growing economies must do "everything in your power" to speed up the recovery of the monetary block either through the International Monetary Fund or through direct mutual agreements.
He warned the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China), who were "unleverly" looking at the difficulties in Europe, and said that the financial support of the European leadership and European resources through Asia helps to prevent a long-term collapse of the global economy.
"We're all in the same boat."
"Thus everyone is helpful to help Europe out of this crisis," he told the Financial Times in an interview at the edge of the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be protected to a certain degree, but it's not immune."
"So if China and India can help, then with all the means."
Europe's monetary union has been in a serious debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy's interest rates have increased dangerously and the Prime Minister has resigned from both Italy and Greece.
The emerging serious debt crisis in Europe is a source of fear that the global economy could fall into recession and led to calls for leading emerging economies to join forces to support the euro area.
Mr Nag predicted that all Asia's support would be channelled by the IMF, but said that mutual agreements – such as the purchase of bonds from the EU Rescue Fund, the European Financial Stabilisation Facility (EFSF) – offered greater negotiating power to the European partners in Asia.
And Sharma, the Indian Minister of Commerce, said that "India will do everything in its power" to help the Eurozone, as its own economy is now suffering from declining exports and the drying out of foreign capital flows.
"No one wants the Eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent," he said.
"We face major challenges and we need to maintain a high level of growth."
"It's not an option, it's an assignment, because where else we find work for our millions of young men and women."
Others argue that developing economies like India have no incentive to help the rich Europeans if they themselves face major economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, professor at Brown University, said that it would be politically very difficult to sell 1.2 trillion people in India to help Europe, of which more than 800 million of them live 2 dollars or less a day.
"Sometimes they'll find out that the Greeks retire at 50 and spend vacations on the beach. Then you have a problem," he said.
Lee Howell, Managing Director of the World Economic Forum, asked similarly why India's reserves should be used to keep the numerous and well paid employees in the public service in Greece, with jobs in poorly managed, loss-making facilities such as the railway.
Mr Nag said that the crises in the Eurozone will have "significant domino effects" across Asia.
The forecast of ADB with an economic growth of 7.5 percent in Asia for the years 2011/throats now "the risk of graduation" due to the threat of Europe.
He said that vulnerable emerging markets would have to create "crisis plans" in order to protect themselves from a downward trend and a significant demise of capital in their speech.
Urgent warnings from the Pentagon before possible incisions in defense
Minister of Defense Leon Panetta named the Congress on Monday when he warned that automatic budget cuts would weaken national security, thus triggering a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon halls to the war locations in Afghanistan and the civilian flow bands.
The Pentagon is already imagining cuts in the amount of 450 trillion dollars over the coming decade, but is afraid that further cuts will be necessary by 600 trillion dollars or more if the Congress cannot reach a conclusion in the expenditure.
"The effects of these cuts would be devastating for the ministry," wrote Panetta in a letter to Republican Senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that the failure of the Congress to reach a budget agreement, which will lead to a so-called confiscation, would lead to 23% general cuts and a halt of many new projects.
"Such a high reduction, carried out in such a thoughtless way, would make most of our ship and construction projects impossible - you can't buy three quarters of a ship or a building - and seriously damage other modernization efforts," Panetta wrote to the Senators.
"We would also be forced to involuntarily separate ourselves from most of our civilian staff and, as the reduction would be implemented so quickly, we would certainly have to leave civilians in order to reach the goal."
"These changes would destroy the faith of those who maintain our military and seriously damage our alert."
The cuts were finally hit by the fighting forces," said Panetta.
"While the war-time quotas in the anti-terrorism struggle are not directly affected by the confiscation, the serious intervention in the Grundbudget would adversely affect the efforts of war," warned Panetta.
"Personal settings have been shortened, which would lead to delays in the attitudes and recruitment that support the war."
"The salaries of staff would be reduced, leading to late payments to war time dealers and the legal and political support would be disrupted."
The two senators answered Panetta 10 days ago and asked for further details regarding the potential influence of automatic cuts on the Ministry of Defense.
"The consequences of a seizure by the Ministry of Defense would lead to a rapid decline in the United States as the world's leading military force."
"We are vehemently against this dramonic act," said the Senators in a joint statement on Monday afternoon when they published Panetta's letter.
"This is a result with which we cannot live, and there is certainly no need to force us to."
"The confiscation is a threat to and the entry of the United States' national security interests."
Whether Panetta's letter and the new warnings of the senators will increase the pressure on a compromise in the budget or strengthen demands to avoid the Pentagon of cuts remains to be seen.
Panetta has increasingly blaringly expressed the possible cuts, although he has been able to gain many years of experience with the budget in Congress and in the White House before coming to the top of the Pentagon, and knows he is facing serious decisions.
At a press conference last week, the Minister of Defense painted a gloomy picture of what might stand ahead - a military with bowl, but without core.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a brigade without ammunition."
"It's an airarmer without sufficiently trained pilots."
"It's a paperworker, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without sufficiently trained soldiers capable of fulfilling the mission," said Panetta in his opening speech in the Pentagon.
"It is a power of struggle that lacks morality and alertness and is unable to take it with potential opponents."
"She's making a really angry one."
In an annex to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta introduced new details of how reductions "creating significant operational risks: delays in times of crisis, conflicts and disasters, serious restrictions on our worldwide employability and intervention, leading to unacceptable risk in future war operations."
And Panetta said that some of the biggest defense projects could fall to the victim, including those that have already been tested and are already in the early planning phase.
This list also includes the F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a planned new bomb aircraft, the next generation of ballistic submarines, the new Littoral Combat Ship and the new ground fighting vehicle, which Army and Navy need to replace the Humvee.
If one stopped the further development and testing of the F35, this would save up to 80 trillion dollars in the next 10 years, but the advocates say that it is an important next step to upgrade, so that potential dangers can be banned by China and other opponents.
How to Prostrate a Lie
A look at the current headlines shows how anxious and widespread deception and lying are in everyday life.
The Republican presidential candidate, Herman Cain, is working to overcome the accusations of sexual harassment on the part of several women.
The management of Penn State is accused of mine, since it is said that one has held back reports that a retired football trainer has sexually abused boys.
Last week an open microphone was heard when French President Nikolas Sarkozy told American President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
Lies destroy careers and shake countries.
The New York Congressman and Internet Exhibitionist Anthony Weidner made a fool when he made denials that were quickly contradicted by inconsistencies.
The former presidential candidate, John Edwards, is accused of the infractions in campaign financing that are related to the hiding of an extramarital affair.
And then, of course, nobody who experienced it forgets the media circus that President Bill Clinton triggered when he lied during his second term in the Oval Office regarding his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
Stories about cheating in school and college exams are widespread.
There were incidents in which teachers submitted the examination replies to their students so that they could do well in their performance checks.
Mentors who should teach the opposite send a message that lies and cheating are okay.
How much deception do we experience?
As studies prove, we lie between 10 and 200 times a day.
Many of these lies, however, are regarded as an emergency lie.
Another study shows that strangers lie to each other three times during the first 10 minutes of a meeting.
Recognizing lies or "discovering lies" is an important thing to learn for every person, and this is for both personal and professional reasons.
Far from a game of society, for example, in which the goal is to call "Hab!", detangling a deception is a serious field of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades from respected universities, which carried out far-reaching research projects, especially in the fields of psychology and physiology.
One result of research is that most old myths have been detached about lying.
Lies look in your eyes.
They don't always stutter, stem, roast and bake.
However, it must not be concluded that these liars are difficult to detect and detarrate.
A trained liar of lies can penetrate into truth by learning something about the structure of the claim, the fine facial expressions, about questioning and timing.
I have spent several years investigating the scientific results of the comprehensive and ever growing area of detarnation. And it is clear that detachment of deception is a modern ability that is easy to learn and helps us to be able to find in our complex world, especially when the setting up or questioning of persons or negotiations or administration is one of our own professional responsibilities.
Good liars are very good at appreciating other people, their interest to awaken and their own emotions, and they feel intuitively as they are perceived by others.
Thanks to research, we know that the extroverted people are more often lying than introverted people, that men of more "self-oriented" lies were optical than women whose lies are more "orientated to others" - usually they want to protect the feelings of others - that married people lie to their partners less frequently than unmarried people (but the lies they tell are usually "fatty lies").
We also know that when a person has been defrauded as a offender, others feel less guilty to have lied to that person.
How do you know if someone's lying?
First by observing the normal behavior of that person.
This is called "baselining", the starting position.
It indicates a point of reference for subsequent evaluation of changes.
Watch the attitude, the laughter, the voice quality of your test person.
You should know better when someone usually stumbles with the foot, so that they do not accuse him of being wrong when he stumbles with his foot during a meeting.
Then pay attention to accumulations of conspicuous verbal and non-verbal behaviors.
Consider these accumulations as alarm bells, the shrill, not as evidence of detarnation.
People who cheat, perhaps stare when they try to remember their story. Perhaps their feet turn towards the door or they lean toward the exit, change their position in a significant way or show a "relax after the interview", that deep, relaxing exhalation and the change in attitude when all the hard questions are over.
Asking often falsely signal that an interview is over just to keep an eye out after this relaxation after the interview.
Also pay attention to the language of your test person.
Scott Peterson's slipper is famous when he used the past form when he claimed that his killed wife was still alive and triggered a national search for her.
Deceptive people can also use a dissociating language: "I had no sexual relationship with this woman... Miss Lewinsky" or if you repeat a tricky question in total.
The most common verbal signs are subtle.
Some people use "qualified language" when they answer a tricky question: "Well... to tell you the truth ... as far as I am known ... to the best of my knowledge and conscience."
This makes the answer more perceptive than actual, which often causes the alarm bells to scream.
There is no magic agent to detort lies, but one can learn skills that make it possible to detarrate.
Thanks to these skills, anyone can become a victim of fraud, both in private and in work.
Controversy plan of an oil pipeline is revised after threat by delayed US approval
A few days after the Obama government has threatened to delay the approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada in the Gulf of Mexico, thereby discouraging trade unions and at the same time calming environmentalists, the pipeline building companies are trying to replan the project so that one can return to normality.
TransCanada said on Monday evening that the planned pipeline will be diverted from the ecologically sensitive area of the sandhills in Nebraska.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the Nebraska Parliament building.
Alex Pourbax of TransCanada said that the company continued to be confident that the pipeline was finally approved, though with a different course.
This was followed by a announcement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs last week, after which a decision on a federal permit for the project would be postponed until the new possible course had been reviewed which prevented the area of the sandhills in Nebraska and the Ogallala aquifer, a large underwater supply.
"This is a real step forward," said Republican Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, across from Fox News.
The new environmental review, which the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has arranged, may delay a decision until 2013, after the elections next year, even if officials deny that politicians were involved in the decision.
Obama stated last week in a written statement that the decision was a task of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and agreed to its support.
The 1700 miles pipeline was linked to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would pump 700,000 barrels of oil a day from Alberta Province to the refineries in Texas.
To this end, the pipeline would have to cross six states.
Environmentalists hate them, but labour markets love them because they appreciate that the pipeline creates 20,000 jobs.
But the legislators Nebraskas, who are against the plan, weigh the laws to force a departure from the region of the sandhills and the Ogallala aquifer, a main source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current study on the impact on the environment of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs found that the project had little impact on the environment, but the source of the energy economy states that the Ministry's main auditor requested a separate probe of the review procedure, focusing on two issues.
One is whether a lobbyist who was recruited by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was a consultant to Hillary Clinton in 2008, is in a conflict of interest.
The other is whether a company commissioned to carry out the original study was an inappropriate choice, since it is related to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle accused of allegedly forcing an infant for fear of vomiting
A New York family claims that the disco Diva Patti LaBelle in the lobby of her Manhattan building would have had a magic attack that would have scared her little daughter in such a fear that she had surrendered from fear.
The Tirade of the "Lady Marmalade" singer made the 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so afraid that she was suffering from "personal change, sleep disorder" and "encreased fear of strangers," said her family in front of the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
It was on November 10 last year when stage worker Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, a kindergarten nurse, and Genevieve wanted to break up on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk got the car, Roseanna Monk went to the lobby with the luggage and genevieve on her arm in her building on Riverside Boulevard.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped near the door and stopped her daughter for a moment.
"Someone appeared behind me and said, "Do you know what your daughter is doing right now?" I said, "Yes," and went to take her back on her arm," she said.
LaBelle counseled the pregnant woman angry.
"She said in an aggressive tone, "You shouldn't put your daughter near the door," said Roseanna Monk.
"I told her, "I don't care what you say or think."
She became angry and started to scramble - she used the F-word and the A-word and became very loud...
She had a bottle of water in her hand and began to kick water from the bottle at me.
She said Genevieve would have become hysterical.
"I said to this woman, "See what you did to my daughter," said the child's mother.
LaBelle fell upon the mother, who was still wearing Genevieve on her arm, and had to be stopped by her accompaniment and pulled to a waiting car, said Roseanna Monk.
The baby screamed so much that it had to pass over, she said.
Later, the LaBelle family asked for an apology in writing, but did not receive an answer.
LaBelle's lawyer and representative did not respond to calls asking for an opinion.
The claim is based on a compensation that is not specified, but the family lawyer, Sam Davis, said that he will not charge a fee and the family plan, the money they get, will donate the child cancer aid.
"We want Patti LaBelle to take responsibility for her behavior," said Davis.
"This kind of behavior is absolutely unacceptable, especially if it is shown to a kindergarten nurse who wears an 18-month-old baby on his arm."
Climate change has slowed the economy down
In the first year in which Mario López Valdez is at the government, Sinaloa saw unemployment and unemployment rise, while foreign investment declined and the economy stagnated.
It is the first year Mario López Valdez, who describes himself as the initiator of change and has created great hopes about economic growth, to the government. However, as a result of the climatic contradictions, growth cannot be the cause of growth, but on the contrary, the main economic indicators deteriorated.
The low temperatures in February not only caused millions of losses in agriculture, but also narrowed the growth of the state economy and caused a general decline in economic activity in the first quarter of the year by 3.6 percent. This is mainly due to the historical decline in agricultural development by 3116 percent, which affected further economic sectors.
According to a report published by Consejo Mexicano para el Desarrollo Rural Sustentable (Mexican Council for Sustainable Agricultural Development), 582,000 hectares of agricultural land were damaged, of which 78.03 percent were completely destroyed and the remaining 21.07 percent were partially destroyed.
The decline in economic activity by November has continued to increase unemployment in the Mexican state. Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía observed a rapid increase in unemployment in the first quarter, as from January to March 55,053 inhabitants had no employment, which corresponds to 4.53 percent of the working population. In the second quarter, unemployment has risen to 5.28 percent and from July to September to 6,19 percent, resulting in 74,000 unemployed in Sinaloa, which is 18 969 people more than in the first quarter.
Less liquidity
The unemployment in Sinaloa this year dates back to several factors. Economist Gerardo López Cervantes, Dean of the Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences of the University of Autónoma (UAS), commented that the policies of the public institutions indirectly explain the growing unemployment.
"What we are watching at present is an increase in unemployment, which has to do with several factors. Among other things, there are market liquidity losses due to the legislation adopted to combat money laundering in Congress, because for those who are forbidden to accumulate dollars, it is not easy to let them work for themselves, invest them or use them for anything else," he said.
Migration stopped
López Cervantes pointed out that growing unemployment also has a demographic factor.
"The number of people leaving the country in search of work abroad, especially in the United States, has fallen, which is due on the one hand to the problems of entry and on the other hand, because it is difficult to find work there. These people stay here and are looking for work here, which makes unemployment rise," he says.
Black-worked
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa is even more serious when taking into account the high proportion of unskilled work, which, according to INEGI, covers 60.38 percent of the workers employed in the country without paying into social security funds.
The low wages, the lowest in Mexico, are reported in accordance with the statistics of the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (Mexican Social Insurance Institute) and the Secretaria del Trabajo y Previsión Social (Government for Labour and Social Care in Mexico).
The average monthly income of workers in Sinaloa was 5352 pesos until September; this is much less than the general average, which is 7375 pesos.
Decrease in ADI
In addition to reducing economic activity and increasing unemployment, the strongest decline in foreign direct investment (ADI) in the last ten years is recorded in 2011. According to Secretaria de Economía (State Economic Authority), the ADI amounted to 630 597 dollars from January to June, which is 87.74 percent compared to the 5 143 312 dollars in the same period last year.
On the other hand, the Secretariá de Desarrollo Económico del Gobierno (Government for Economic Development) recorded a total investment of 17,280 000 Pesos in 2011, which is mainly from the tertiary sector companies.
The Debts
In view of the economic crisis, the national government requested a loan of 3 000 000 000 Pesos at the National Congress in July, which should be invested to reactivate the economy in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities.
Reactions
For the entrepreneurship representatives, Mario López Valdé's first year of government made clear.
Miguel Loredo López, Chairman of the Cámara Nacional de la Industria de la Transformación (the State Chamber of Manufacturing Industry in Mexico), represented that in 2011 no efforts were made to harmonise the views of the various sectors, including the state government.
"The economic activity in Sinaloa was really very poor this year. It has to be worked hard to regain the area lost this year and in 2012 we have to work at a double level. The efforts of all and in particular the progress of the government team already well-connected have not been sufficiently coordinated," he said.
Slow economic development
Loredo López said that events such as the frost made the economic development of the country difficult and slowed down at the beginning of the year.
"The low economic flow is the result of several events, including the frost. One of the main effects is a slowing economy that is not sufficiently moving to create a dynamic economy that could produce an acceptable flow of processes, products and services. Therefore, we will complete the year well below our expectations," he said.
Redefined appeal
Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, Chairman of the Confederación Patronal de la República Mexicana (Entrepreneur's Association of Mexico) in Sinaloa, said that it was necessary to lead the state to more dynamic productive activities.
"In general, we have observed that work has been done. We believe it is necessary to develop a long-term programme to redefine the country's economic vocation and line, because it is important to activate all material and human resources Sinaloas," he said.
There's a lot to do
The president of Coparmex stressed the importance of developing a future perspective that would improve the government's efforts.
"In general, I would say that the government has achieved good results in various areas, and economic development has progressed, but it is important to develop a long-term programme," he said.
He stressed that the current state power had made progress with the government.
"There are areas where one can say that the government has acted more fully. What I can say is that has been worked and that the government is aware that there is still a lot of work ahead of it," he said.
Arrest for 8 kg marijuana
To five years of prison and 100 daily rates, a resident of Navolato was sentenced for the possession of eight kilos of marijuana.
The Republic prosecutor announced that the drug dealer was Omar Alexis Valezuela Sandoval, who was punished for a crime against public health - here the possession of marijuana intended for trade.
According to Act AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested on 7 June 2010 by Mexican military in monitoring the road Cipriano Valdez in relation to the security post No. 80 in the village of El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug dealer drove in a white van where he kept a black bag in a box in the car and on the passenger seat a small backpack in which the military found eight kilos and 23 grams of marijuana.
For this reason, the seized goods were handed over to the judge of the district and the punished person is still in the execution centre.
Debt for construction work
The social buildings for migrants provided for in the Hábitat, Rescate de Espacios Públicos and 3x1 programmes are in danger of being completed because of lack of means or only with a long delay, said Miguel Ángel López Miranda.
The head of the urban social development authority stated that although the construction programmes are already advanced, they are now in danger, as the state government has not paid its resources exceeding 11 million peso for the three programmes.
He said that the total investment in these three programmes amounted to almost 50 million peso, of which 25 percent fell to the State. So far, only the Federación and the municipality had contributed to the construction work, and therefore a delay of construction was expected.
"12 million have to contribute, and although the year is already ending, they have not given us a penny, and that, although they had to pay us some in July," he said. "To be not too late, we have already started building work, and they are already far advanced, but we need the money."
He pointed out that under the government of Jesús Aguilar Padilla the state had failed to fulfil its obligations, which is why the community had to borrow 7 million at the beginning of its reign, corresponding to the amount that the central government would have had to impose.
"This has already happened to us in the last legislative period, because the State did not have sufficient economic resources. The programmes continued and this year we had to obtain the funds that the State had not spent to participate in these programmes," he said.
Although the government authorities are obliged to disburs these funds, he commented that the Minister of Administration and Finance requested that administrative work be accelerated and that the outstanding share should be paid as soon as possible.
"As many as 12 million have to contribute, and even though the year is coming to an end, they have not given us a penny."
The Court of First Instance approves the transition to digital television in Mexico for 2015
The switchover of analogues to digital signals has been one of the most important changes in the world in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) rejected the constitutional complaints filed by the Senate and the House of Deputies against the President's Office and, in accordance with which the switch from analog to digital signals must be submitted from 2021 to 2015, due to the lack of eight votes required for the legal challenge.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Supreme Court, Juan Silva Meza, felt that President Felipe Calderón had not exceeded his responsibilities when he issued the decree with the details of switching to terrestrial digital television.
This decision rejected the constitutional dispute launched by the Senate, since it did not receive the qualified majority of eight votes required to enable the court to decide on the constitutionality or non-constitutionality. Thus, the law remains in force.
The project for the action, prepared by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed that the Decree of Constitutions be declared unconstitutional, as the Comisión Federal de Telecomunicaciones (Cofetel) (Federal Commission for Telecommunications in Mexico) is responsible for the regulation relating to radio and television, and therefore the Decree would contradict the hierarchical principles and the enforcement of laws.
The Zugunst of the project only voted Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero himself.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies filed constitutional complaints against the decree of law. Following the adoption of the complaints, Minister Sánchez Cordero no longer applied the decree and started all activities to establish the digital transmission.
The Council of Ministers also rejected the action filed by the Chamber of Deputies without taking part in the debate on the project for which Minister Sánchez Cordero was also responsible.
In its contribution, the Prime Minister stated that he did not agree with the project's arguments, in the sense that the national government should not regulate the measures to be taken by the public administration by general rules.
"I also do not believe that, if we did, the independence of the regulatory body would be adversely affected", she recalled that the central government is responsible for planning strategic policies, such as the telecommunications sector, for constitutional reasons, because it is the central government, which is the head of state affairs.
Replacement of analogue signals with digital is one of the most important changes that has taken place around the world in recent years, and it improves the use of the radioelectric spectrum, increased quality of the signal, and more channels.
The postponement of the conversion, she said, was a delay in the use of digitalization, which was a decision in the public interest which not only had technical considerations, "because it has economic, social, political and security aspects."
These matters, she stressed, "made the whole system necessary, in accordance with the principle of state economic governance, they included a group of features that put the Constitution into the hands of the central government."
She recalled that many countries around the world had already carried out the digital changeover, namely the government, although it had highly specialised institutions.
It was not possible to conclude that with the issue of the contested decree, the government would be encroached into the competences of the Congress, for the laws adopted by the legislative system would be complied with," she assured.
Consideration is given to the possibility to list the votes in Michoacán individually
According to PREP, the difference between first and second place in the election of the governor is almost 27 percent, with 879 votes of a total of 6074 not yet counted.
The possibility of single-score votes this year is a reality in the elections in Michoacán, because according to the data issued by the programmea de Resultados Electorales Preliminares (PREP), the difference between first and second place in the Governorial elections is almost 27 percent, with 879 votes of a total of 6074 not yet counted.
In this sense, the president of the Consejo General del Instituto Electoral de Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that just last 9 November, the electoral centre had just adopted a series of rules on the harmonisation of local rules with the reforms of the states in terms of elections.
It should be recalled that Michoacán had not adapted his political constitution, nor his electoral law, nor his electoral justice law to the reforms adopted by the Congress, so that they had not entered into force at this round of elections. Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel avoided their publication in the public display within the time limits provided for with the argument or objections.
On 9 November, the Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) decided on the constitutional action filed by the local legislative system and judged the decision of the State representative to the constitutional reforms as "ineffective and unlawful", since it does not have the right to "confirm or oppose a veto".
María de los Ángeles Llanderal, in an interview on the possibility of individual enumeration of the votes, stated that the adoption of the guidelines by the Consejo General del IEM would now allow the local electoral authority to partially or completely enumerate the votes.
The results in the minutes do not agree; the minutes do not contain the minutes or are not held by the chairperson of the electoral committee or there are obvious errors or changes in the minutes, under the following conditions:
In addition, if there is a difference between the presumed winner and that who is in second place, the total counting of the fully completed elections may be equal to or less than one percent, provided that at the beginning of the meeting there is an explicit request from the party or coalition president, which is the second of those candidates.
The list of votes may also take place in its entirety if, after completion of the ordinary calculation, it is established that the difference between the alleged winner and the candidate in second place is equal or less than one percent, provided that an explicit request is made by a party representative whose candidate has become second. In this case, the selection packages which have been suspended from partial counting would be excluded.
It is worth mentioning that the elections in Morelia are in the same situation, where, according to PREP, the difference between first and second place is almost 0.16 percent, although the votes of 129 have not yet been counted from a total of 923 voting protocols.
His last will
His ashes will be scattered over the Zapalinamé mountains, confirming the family.
This Sunday evening, the remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés came down on Saltillo, his birthplace. On Monday the death watch and a death fair took place.
According to family members, the last will of the Supreme Lieutenant was that his ashes would be scattered over the Zapalinamé mountain range.
After an honor the family of Bacio Cortés, together with the others, returned to the capital of Coahuila in an airplane of the Mexican Air Force, where the chief was the next person to participate in the ceremony in Campo Marte.
At twelve o'clock in the afternoon, the ashes of the colonnade landed at the funeral hall, which is located on the Boulevard Nazario Ortiz Garza, and where the family members and friends came.
At 5.30 p.m., his remains were examined at the Technical Institute of Saltillo. This body show was initiated by his former fellow students from the technical Abitur and his American football team, Felipe Bacio, during his preparation for the Abitur.
"He wanted to return to Saltillo and that his ashes would be scattered over the Zapalinamé mountains. He had always said that to his family and his friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, the pilot's sister.
From her point of view, the Supreme Lieutenant had fulfilled all his dreams and she felt that he had been in the fullness of his life. "He was a successful man, exceptional as a father and as a son, a loving brother and he always stood up for his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left Saltillo very young to enter the school of the Luftwaffe of Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some could not grasp it because they thought it would make him dizzy even on a truck. Nevertheless, he always sought to realize his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembered him as a good person. "He had hardly arrived in Saltillo, and already the whole family wanted to welcome him, as on the occasion when he brought Martha Shahgún to Saltillo."
The young man remembers that even at the age of seven he had gone to Zapopán for the graduation of his family member. Therefore, he knows that his uncle died when he did what he liked best: to fly a plane.
A Last Farewell
The chief executive of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Bacio Cortés, was approved by the governor, Jorge Torres López, with all honors. Their honors were given to him by the people and the government, the Mexican army of the sixth military area, the Mexican Air Force, the head of the school and students of the technical educational institution of Saltillo, where he studied in 1985, both in studies and sports as excellent.
Bacio Cortés died a few days ago, when the helicopter flown by him, in which the Secretary of State José Francisco Blake Mora and six others were sitting from the same authority, crashed.
At 18.05 a.m., the remains of Bacio Cortés, citizens of Saltillo, met to be handed over to members of the Mexican Air Force, led by Major Jaime Martinez, in front of the barracks of the funeral company. There, his family members, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, his mother, siblings and other relatives, students and teachers, were already waiting for him.
The abandoned body was found on a plot on the Cadereyta NL
A few hours before the discovery, military members presented the media with eleven persons who had been arrested in the same village in connection with organized crime.
Three men were found by shots in different parts of the body and a mercy shot in an abandoned finca in the town of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The event had taken place at the point of km from Cadreyta to Santiago at the height of the municipality of El Castillo.
Several passersby saw that the door of the country house surrounded by a beige-brown wall stood up all the way up.
As they looked into the house, they found the bodies of three persons about three meters further inside, which they immediately informed the competent authorities.
One wore a yellow t-shirt and dark pants, without shoes; next to it was another one dressed in a white top.
Nearly one metre away was the body of another person with red T-shirt and blue pants.
All three were on the belly.
According to the information obtained locally, the three persons must have been murdered in another place as no cartridge shells have been found.
On the wall of the country house there are inscriptions that write an organized gang of criminals to another, and also several attacks were found in the wall and door.
11 persons arrested in Cadereyta
The Secretariat de la Defensa Nacional (Secretary of State for Defense) introduced 11 people, including a minor who was part of a crime in the town of Cadereyta, and who are associated with kidnappings, murders, halconeo (human hunting) and secret funerals.
According to the public information, eight people were arrested at Los Alveros on November 11th and a prisoner was released.
Three properties and a mobile phone were secured. The arrested confirmed to be members of the criminal group "Los Zetas".
On November 12th at 6:00 p.m., soldiers found a car with no number plates with two passengers on their round of guard in the village of Rancho Viejo in Cadereyta.
During the inspection of the car, the military found a long weapon, a charger and 18 cartridges.
Later, on November 13 at 14.00 p.m., one of their compliments was arrested in the municipality of La Frauda, who tried to flee at the presence of the military.
Secret memberships are charged to them in the places of General Terán, China and Cadreyta.
On Wednesday Education of the new Italian government
The Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to introduce this new government to the crisis that Italy has led at the brink of economic collapse.
The Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to introduce this new government to the crisis that Italy has led at the brink of economic collapse.
A communication from the Presidential Palace announced that the Monti appointed on Sunday would meet with the President-in-Office, Giorgio Napolitano, on Wednesday to confirm the formation of government.
It is expected that he will present a cabinet composed of technocrats, although it is not yet clear when the new Prime Minister will take office.
Monti said that he would present to the president the results of the talks with the political parties on the formation of government.
"I would like to reaffirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to deal with these difficult times," said the former Commissioner to the journalist.
Monti did not expressly confirm the formation of government, but his comments show that the obstacles have been overcome.
The "frame is now well placed", he added.
Monti has managed to form a government in less than three days, that is much less time than normal. Meanwhile, Italy fights a political and financial crisis that has put the cost of debt to an unbearable level.
The new government led by former EU Commissioner Monti must adopt a strong package of savings called for by the Europolitics in order to regain confidence in Italy.
The pressure on the hurry, which is on Monti, was reinforced by the changing market situation, which caused the Italian government bonds to be charged with 7 per cent interest for 10 years, which corresponds to the situation where Greece and Ireland were forced to apply for the European rescue shield.
Emma Marcegaglia, president of the Italian Industrial Association Confindustria, told the press after a meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government by all means."
We believe that this government is the last chance for Italy to get out of this emergency situation.
Montis' chances of success were greatly increased by the support of the PDL party of Silvio Berlusconi, who had to withdraw from the crisis on Saturday.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts are intended to produce good results," said Angelino Alfano, secretary of the centre-right party.
The support of the PDL, Italy's largest party, is essential, because so far many of its members have expressed themselves against a majority of Technocrats-based government, which is now Monti.
Parliamentary support
The new Monti government needs strong parliamentary support to implement the probably unpopular austerity measures.
Resistance to his efforts or delaying the reforms could again lead to a devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian Federation of Foreign Banks, with its statement that Montis is a disaster, also pressure.
Monti started on Monday with debates with political parties, trade unions and business associations as well as youth and women's organisations.
Tuesday evening the session should be completed.
This Sunday, Monti was appointed by Napolitano, who started an extremely rapid change of government in response to the crisis.
After a recent respiration towards the end of last week, when it became known that Berlusconi would withdraw, as a result of the uncertainty over the success of the new Prime Minister, the costs for Italian government bonds have again reached critical limits.
Saving Italy with a government debt of 1.8 trillion euros would be too much for the current EU rescue screen.
Monti said that his government would have to last until the next elections that are expected to take place in 2013, despite the predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement the reforms, instead of preferning the elections.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the major parties insist that this should consist only of technicians, an indication of their concerns in view of the process imposed by the pressure of financial markets.
Political sources point out that the mutual distrust and disunity between the parties make the involvement of individuals from political life complicated.
Spaniards have more play areas than the ticos
Of the 22 players called from Spain, ten have more than 50 international games on the bump.
From Costa Ricas side, only one of the 22 convoys has 50 games behind them.
A huge difference for Costa Rica, if the 22 for the friendship game that takes place today at 15.05 in the National Stadium of San José, players from both countries are compared.
While world and European champions, the number one in FIFA’s monthly ranking, can look back on a considerable number of class A selection games, the three-colored team has only Michael Umana as the only one with over 50 international games.
He reached this number on the last Friday with the game against Panama (0-2) in the Rommel Fernández.
The Spanish players who play in the League de las Estrellas (Starliga) and influential clubs of the Premier League of England each year have the opportunity to participate in numerous home games (lyga and Cup championships) as well as high-ranking European cups such as the Champions League.
In addition, the Spanish Fury's experience with complicated excretion games at the Eurocup and the World Cups.
The tico football players, on the other hand, have few international encounters in the Concaf, which is on the FIFA track list at the bottom.
We will see how the Spanish team pulls their last register: the goalkeeper Iker Casillas, who reached a level with the former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta on the last Saturday against England (low 0-1 in London) with 126 games abroad.
Today, Casillas will play against the three-colored team and Spain will have a new record of 127 foreign matches.
Xavi Hernández, player of the Barcelona football club, owns 106.
The last week, Casillas and Xavi even received recognition from the UEFA, along with others of the Iberian team who had reached the magical number 100: the quoted Zubizarreta with 126 and the middle tower of Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
The number of hundreds also approaches Carles Puyol with 97 games.
He followed Xabi Alonso with 91, Fernando Torres with 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos both with 81, Andrés Iniesta with 62, Cesc Fábregas with 61 and David Silva with 53.
From the Ticos and close to Michael Umana are the left side tower Júnior Díaz with 48 games and the striker Bryan Ruiz with 45.
From there came only five on over 30 matches: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofiefa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The ones with the least of the games.
Less than 30 games feature in the Spanish team Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
From side of the national team come on less than 30 games Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest don't even get closer to the 20s border.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba has two, in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar only one and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson did not have their debut yet.
The historic gatekeeper of Spain is David Villa with 50 hits, followed by Fernando Torres at 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz has shot the most gates with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
The Quintett included Costa Rica in its tour to celebrate its 20th anniversary
"Playing in Costa Rica is a dream that is realized"
In the exclusive conversation with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament from Pearl Jam says that the band is prepared to give one of their best concerts at the national stadium next Sunday.
They were expected for more than 20 years, but the band assures that a dream is realized for them when they play in Costa Rica.
This assured the bass player and co-founder of the group, Jeff Ament, who last week gave Viva an exclusive interview from Brazil.
The band is located in the South American part of its tour to celebrate its 20th anniversary and on Sunday, the 20th, they make their only stop in Central America.
This day, they will perform at the National Stadium from 7.30 p.m. with the band The X from Los Angeles and Las Robertas from Costa Rica.
You will read an extract from the conversation whose full copy can be found in the online edition of La Nación.
For your Costa Rican fans, a dream comes true when Pearl Jam plays in Costa Rica: Are you aware of what that means to your fans?
Playing in Costa Rica is a dream that is also realized for us.
This is just the second time we've been playing in South and Central America, and so far it's been great.
I've only been to Costa Rica once for a vacation. It's such a beautiful country that we'll definitely stay there for a few more days.
It is exciting for us to bring our music there.
I'm asking you this because the fans of the band have been completely released. You'll experience the days before the concert intensively.
What do you guys say to your most enthusiastic fans?
Thank you for standing by our side all these years.
We spent almost 21 years coming to Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting so long and we're sorry to have needed so long until we've come here.
Some people even believe that your concert will be the biggest show of the year.
Don't you put a little pressure on this from your visit?
Some of the greatest shows we've put in over the last 21 years have been held in the last two weeks.
We played on a couple of giant shows in São Paulo and we hope that they made us fit for this concert in Costa Rica.
Really, we have a desire to play there.
We love this country, we like surfing and are thrilled by the jungle. Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you get to know Costa Rica and its waves for surfing?
Many of our friends are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo, where the waves are simply unimaginable.
My friends have always been driving to Costa Rica and Nicaragua for surfing. Together with Mexico, the excellent areas are for surfing. In this way, we have learned about people who love surfing.
With a view of the tour you have offered giant shows with many songs.
What plans do you have for the event in Costa Rica?
Since we've never played there, we don't have any limits.
We will try to give the best possible show with many different songs. We want to play a few songs from each album and offer our fans a good and versatile repertoire.
You never repeat your repertoire.
Why?
I think that's partly because we have nine records and can play over 120 songs. Each one likes another song, so the decision we're going to play is not easy.
If we record two or three songs that we have not played any longer, we can better maintain our concentration and they surprise us because they remind us of the reasons why we liked these songs. Otherwise they might be forgotten.
This makes the show more interesting for us and I believe, therefore also for the audience.
With this tour you celebrate your 20 years of history.
Looking back, is it hard for you to believe in your success?
Yeah, totally.
First of all, I believe that no one of us has imagined playing once in a great rock band for over 20 years. It looks like a dream.
We also continue to focus on this blessing and find it great to be able to make music together even now.
We like and are enthusiastic about producing music.
We are lucky to be able to go to the places of the world that we have always wanted to visit.
Things couldn't be better.
What did it mean for you to have actively participated in the birth hour of the grunge?
It has always been an honor to belong to this group of big bands.
We're good friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising and abundantly unusual when a movement emerges from a group of friends.
From time to time, a band emerges from a city, but it is already unusual when five or ten groups come from the same city at the same time.
We are proud of it and feel honored to be part of the Seattle group.
Sometimes we still play together.
Last year we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and in Canada with Mudhoney and we saw Soundgarden on their tour. We are happy to be still friends with them all and it honors us to be part of this emerging Seattle sound.
It is also very unusual that a band like yours has stayed together for so long with the same musicians.
Yes, four of us have been playing together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago. This alone is much more time than many bands have survived.
First of all, I believe that we all appreciate being still alive and that we take care of each other.
We are all close friends, which is why musical ways have opened up that give everyone the freedom to experiment.
One trusts the other and his music. It could not be better for us.
Your relationship with fame has not always been easy. On the other hand, thanks to your success, you could always do what you wanted.
How do you find a balance?
The way we grew made it easier for us to find a balance.
We make sure not to be on tour too often, because it is too easy to lose this game with huge masses of people who love your music.
As long as you think that the people have come because of the music, it reminds you that you have to pay attention to the music and what she has created, without forgetting to be a famous rock star.
What memories do you have of your other project Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote very good songs and at the beginning it was great.
We were a band for three years, which had never released a record until the death of Andry (Andrew Woods).
We were disappointed to have needed so long. We are still good with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who built the band with us. When I hear a song or see photos, I think about what an incredible person Andy was and how he made me laugh. It was always a pleasure to go to work, laugh together and talk about music and football and many other topics.
He was an extraordinary person and we missed him.
The domestic band Las Robertas is responsible for the opening of the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know their works, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why the band chose the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos from several groups and this band liked us best. That’s why we’re curious to see what Las Robertas can offer live. That’s definitely going to be exciting.
Why do you always change Yellow Ledbetter's text when you play live?
This is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), I have no idea.
He sings him, and I think he sings the first thing that comes to mind.
Who influenced you as a bassist?
From so many+
One of the first to come to mind is Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
It's so many that I could talk all afternoon about the bassists I like.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep the grunge alive, even though it was no longer a fashion appearance?
I don't think we all feel very connected to the word Grunge.
When I think about it, the bands that I mentioned earlier come to mind, such as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the others that came up at the same time. If they are still important today, I find this great, because it is worth listening to this music and bands like Mudhoney are making better music now than ever before.
At first her music was darker, now she is more positive.
Why?
This is interesting, because I think there are a few songs on the new album that might seem a bit easy to do. But there are also other songs like The End or Just Breathe, which are classified as very dark songs, although they have something positive on themselves.
The tears came to me when I heard Ed playing them. They're very dark songs.
I think when you get older and something traumatic happened in your life - e.g. when you lose a family member or a friend - it influences your artistic work and your music and these two songs clearly embodying it for me.
But I also believe that you can be a happy person and still make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori returned to hospital for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was sent to a public hospital on Tuesday to investigate the muscle loss of his legs, informed his family doctor.
The 72-year-old Fujimori, who is 25 years of imprisonment for human rights violations during his reign (1990-2000), has several diseases, including tongue cancer, which operates and is under control four times.
Alejandro Aguinaga, congressman and his personal doctor, told television that Fujimori would be examined for three days in the Peruvian hospital Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Neoplásicas to determine the reason for his pain and loss of muscle in the lower body members.
Aguinaga commented that, in his opinion, Fujimori could be excused for humanitarian reasons. Nevertheless, he did not wish for this because he considered him innocent.
He has been operated four times on tongue cancer and he has lost 18 kilograms of weight. Further diseases such as severe erosive gastritis, a cyst in the pancreas, kidney stones, high blood pressure and problems with blood circulation in the legs, were included by the doctor.
Fujimori has been located in the Dirección Nacional de Operaciones Especiales de la policía prison since September 2007.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the murder of 25 people by the death squadron of the Peruvian army, which was secretly active during his reign.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political relations
An official ordination led by the Uruguay President José Mujica and consisting of several ministers and entrepreneurs will start their visit to Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between two countries and discuss political issues in the region
The next Wednesday, Mujica meets his Mexican counterpart Felipe Calderón. According to the Uruguay President, this will be the highlight of his booked schedule with politicians, businessmen and a meeting with the collective of Uruguayers living in Mexico.
The meeting of both presidents in the city of Guadalajara "is suitable for the exchange of information on all policy areas between the two countries," announced the presidentate of the South American country on his website.
According to local media, Mujica is looking for support from Calderón regarding the incident with France, when French head of government Nicolas Sarkozy put the South American country on a list of tax paradises at the G20 summit in the French city of Cannes.
In his discourse, Sarkozy threatened to exclude those countries that still appear as tax havens from the international community, which was rejected by Uruguay and made a request to his ambassador in the European country.
Mexico has been chair of the G20 since November, a group of the most powerful emerging and industrialised countries in the world. Since January this year, an agreement has been signed on the exchange of tax information to avoid double taxation with the South American country.
In recent years, the Government of Uruguay has tried to speed up the concreteisation of agreements for the exchange of tax information to be removed from the "grey list" of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which includes countries that have not introduced all international standards of cooperation in tax matters.
At business level, a free trade agreement between Mexico and Uruguay has been in place since 2004, which has contributed to a growing exchange of goods between the two countries.
The cordless installer enters the third dimension with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has struggled tirelessly for the rescue of Princess Peach for 25 years from the claws of the evil Bowser, but never in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he fights for the love of the girl in stereo technology.
The game, which comes on the shop counters of all the world this month, has been tailored from the beginning to the properties of the portable console Ninde 3DS, with which without a special glasses can be played three-dimensional.
"Mario is the figure that has to say how stereoscopy works without glasses," said Omar Álvarez, the person responsible for Nintendo's press in Spain at the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Álvarez stated that "Super Mario 3D Land" was "the first video game of Nintendo, which has been developed from the beginning for this console", because so far, successful items such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Oscar of time 3D" have been adjustments of existing titles.
Nintendo's spokesman underlined that, although it was three-dimensional, "Super Mario 3D Land" was a "exhaustible" video game that allows for a fast, liquid game.
Álvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contained two games in one: The first part is "light" in order to catch the less shocked users.
After that, the experts can "turn a second round" over the different levels of games, which are becoming more and more difficult.
In addition, users can choose in real time between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action. However, to overcome the obstacles, without being victims of the "optical effects", three-dimensionalally must always be played.
This trip of Super Marios to the three-dimensional world also means the return of the figure to a portable console, which has not been the case since 2005.
With this video game, Nintendo twinkles the fans of the Saga and repeats the success recipe of the last editions: The cordless installer has to overcome risky platforms to free Princess Peach.
However, the player meets with news in the movements, the environment, the disguises and the enemies - and a "playable" Luigi.
Colom guarantees the delivery of Portillos to the United States
The president of Guatemala, Álvaro Colom, announced this Tuesday that he would give up the extradition of former Governor Alfonso Portillo, so that he would be responsible in the United States for the conspiracy for money laundering of $70 million.
For example, the U.S. application for Portillo's extradition ends so that it can be brought to court there.
In a press conference, Colom confirmed that his decision was based on the independence of justice and government, taking into account that a court of decision had already ordered extradition.
He stressed that he did not interfere during his government in court decisions and that he had accepted all extradition requests he had been informed of.
Except for Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín is being delivered for murder and severe physical injury, Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
Coloms is a government act which takes place when all judicial and constitutional bodies are used to condemn the former President of the State (2000-2004).
According to the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court of Guatemala, Portillo must be delivered when its legal situation in Guatemala is clarified and its human rights guaranteed.
Portillo was acquitted for the suppression of 120 million Quetzales in the Ministry of Defense during his reign. This trial preceded extradition, but the minister protested and revived the case.
Trinijove has helped 6000 young people threatened by social exclusion
The organization was set up to prevent the marginalisation of young people without vocational training.
The first 25 years of the Trinijove social assistance organisation have led to important results: in this quarter century, 6000 young people threatened by social exclusion were supported to find a way out of their difficult situation.
In addition, more than one hundred jobs created for this social group.
On the anniversary yesterday at an event in the former factory buildings of Fabra i Coats, where more than 300 people attended, was taken stock.
Trinijove was established in 1986 in the Trinitat Vella district with the aim of helping young people with low levels of training, without work, with drug problems threatened by the risk of marginality.
At yesterday's celebration in Sant Andreu, many of those responsible for the institutions and institutions that cooperated with the association during these 25 years.
The participation of political representatives in different directions at election times demonstrated the impartiality of the work undertaken by Trinijove.
Apart from the President of the Generalitat (Parliament of the Autonomous Region of Catalonia), Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol participated in the celebrations of former socialist Education Minister Ernest Maragall and former mayor and currently left-green city councillor Ricard Goma.
The large Fabra i Coats hall also visited the current Catalan Minister for Social Affairs and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the Director-General of the Social Fund of the Sparkasse La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas stressed that Trinijove was set up in very difficult times and that today’s times are no less complicated, but he added that so far the work is “a good foundation”.
For the President of the Generalitat, Trinijove is a model that knows how to fight difficult circumstances and gives people hope in trouble.
"The economic crisis is nothing new for the association and the work he does," he said.
The occupied house where giant parties were organized was cleared
The houseowners had 11 of the 13 apartments in the building on Balmes No. 51 street (Barcelona).
The twelve landlords left the building yesterday afternoon without any resistance.
Everything points out that the nightmares of the neighbors of house No. 51 have found an end to the street Balmes.
Twelve persons voluntarily left the building, which they had illegally occupied last afternoon and in which they had organized huge festivals that had driven the neighborhood to despair. The room took place on judicial orders without police intervention.
After the room the door lock was replaced to avoid a similar situation.
"From now on, access will be controlled," the house manager confirmed.
The landlords who had occupied 11 of the 13 dwellings of the building - the rest were inhabited - took the entire electrical plant and part of the water supply. Moreover, they had painted the walls and left behind all kinds of waste, especially cans with alcoholic beverages.
In the three lower floors huge parties were celebrated, which lasted up to two days and drove the tenants to despair.
Next to the building is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which also carried damage to it.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat, told Europe Press that her business had fallen by 80% since the start of the house occupation.
The owner of the discotheque pointed out that the landlords made her unfair competition, because they sold the drinks to three euros, while they cost 10 euros in the discotheque.
In addition, the owner of the leisure home had been shown by the neighbors for a lack of rest, while, according to her statement, noise did not come from the visitors of the disco, but from the landlords, and especially from the guests of the festivals organized there, and who, according to statements of the angry neighbors, became more and more angry in recent weeks.
The discotheque officer explained that the harassment had been so great that it was agreed with the owner of the building that no rent had been paid for the last nine months.
Guardia Urbana (urban police) also confirmed that she had received more complaints from the neighbors in the last few weeks.
Last week, the chairman of the PP (Partido Popular Party) in Barcelona City Council, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had called for the building to be cleared immediately and to address the problems of civil cohabitation as well as the decline of the district.
He explained that before the summer only one floor of the building had been occupied, but that in the last few months, the landlords had been forced into all floors of the building and almost all the apartments. In some even thefts had come.
In this sense, he added that "it is necessary to put an end to impunity and to combat the a social actions in the building."
Yesterday, another building in the Nou Barris district was cleared by the Catalan police.
At 3:30 p.m., the police approached the road Monument No. 35 after she had received a call from a neighbor who had observed four people trying to get into the building.
The four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
The architects, apart from the disputes over the fees, agree to tender.
The urban tender for the 16 gates opens up the debate on the importance of Collserola in Barcelona.
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the now disappeared Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this administration published its abuse about the promotion of Collserola.
The brochure described the mountain as a huge park in Barcelona city.
He was even compared in numbers with the Central Park of New York.
With the fall of the CMB in 1987, the park became the uppermost of Barcelona in the eyes of many, because the capital of Catalonia is one of the few, which is not spread in North-South direction, but up (mountains) and down (sea).
The classification Collserolas as a nature park plays with this idea.
As a model now no longer served as the Central Park, but Yellowstone with wild boars in the role of the yogibar.
So far, when the city was issued in September a giant invitation, consisting of 16 competitions, for further access store to Collserola.
Undoubtedly, a gate refers to the concept of a park.
Either it is, or someone's planning to put gates on the ground.
The question arises by itself: Collserola, Park or Mountain?
The invitation to tender is not only from an organizational point of view, but also from a reflection on the city, the topic of conversation in the mouth of all architects from Barcelona.
It's almost a profitable theme that two members of this old caste, who meet in the elevator, can use.
And this very fact offers the material for one of the rare similarities between what three architects from Barcelona think about, and some university professors who applied for the project.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: The tender is appropriate.
For Roldán, after the attack on the coast, it is necessary to talk about the "Front on the Mountain", as far as the discourse of Ildefons Cerda, which has not been carried out over the green apples.
"You should assume from the principle that Barcelona's largest park is the beach.
Among other things, because it is easily accessible.
Collserola is more complex," says the architect, for whom the title "Tore of Collserola" contains a "lexical trap": It is not allowed to be "as accesses to a park, but as a limitation of areas on which it has to be traded."
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with urban experience, sees the proposal as an "intellectual challenge", which involves "some dangers".
Risks due to the "insecurity that brings about the design of a public space today" following the experience of the 1980s, which had their "swan singing" in the field of the forum.
The first fear is one’s own limitation to what can be built.
"To limit something always means to determine the next step", i.e. to exceed it.
"You have to think about new urban planning instruments, because the current [referring to the General Metropolitano (PGM) plan] can lead to a real disaster."
Modol, who takes a closer look at the question, says simplified, the side of Collserola, which goes towards Vallesana, "can be understood as a park that is not in the direction of Barcelona", for purely topographic reasons.
Modol recalls that there is already a study of the Patronat de Collserola, which should not "beat on deaf ears", although he is grateful to the city administration that she has given his body the opportunity to participate in this project "from the first moment".
He also notes that the proximity of the mountain to the city of the guide letter, which allows architects to take part in the debate, although he expresses his "obstacles" on whether this technical profile should lead the multidisciplinary teams ("exactly the right thing", he says, "we architects should only be a tool."
Bayona indicates that the answer to the question in the heading of this article is complex, as in the terms of the tender a global view of Collserola fails: "There have been 16 competitions in the cross-section," he says, "on the axis of the mountains lake. But there is no longitudinal perspective that views the area in its entirety."
This has led at least in his case to his participation in the 16 competitions.
Otherwise, the program and the definition of a project for a gate would collide with that of the architect of the gate.
In his opinion, the city should guarantee that the stripe directly above the Ronda de Dalt is equipped in the entire length, resulting in a smooth transition between the city and green areas.
Casino forgives Jonás Larrazábal, who comes free
After 72 days of silence, the representative of the Casino Red liberated the mayor of Monterrey from the process that is being waged against him for alleged extortion.
After 72 days of imprisonment, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal is released after the representative of the Casino Red has awarded him to the Second Criminal Court of the District, which runs the trial against the mayor of Monterrey for extortion.
After the attack on Casino Royale, Sergio Gil García, the owner of the Casino Red, published a series of photos and videos on which Manuel Jonás is supposed to force him to pay a sum of money, allowing the city administration to approve the secret operation of the bethouse.
After the trial, the prosecutor opened a criminal proceedings against the brother of the Panist mayor, who was arrested for 30 days on 2 September.
After four hours with the ministerio Público 3 en Delitos Patrimoniales he was taken to Casa de Arraigo 1 in the barrio Antiguo of the capital.
In that place he stayed 49 days after a second arrest warrant after the ministerio Público had rejected the crimes for bribery and organized crimes.
On October 19th, he was transferred to the Cadereyta Detention Centre because he had probably besieged Casino Red's owners with one and a half million Pesos. On the other hand, he stayed only a few hours in the middle security tract, as he was threatened with murder against him.
The authorities allowed him to participate in the court proceedings as inmate of the municipal prison of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On 25 October, a warrant was issued to him by the secretary of the Second Criminal Court of the District, Jorge Yánez, who found that, after the almost two months of investigations, there were sufficient evidence to blame Jonás for the payment of 1.5 million pesos to the representatives of the competition hall in order to be able to open it in return.
This Monday, the representative of Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez asked Judge José Luis Pecina, the mayor's brother, to pay the penalty, which is why he will be released in the next few hours.
During the hearing, Ramiro Arias, the official of the Ministerio Público, assigned to the court, asked García Gómez if he had done the damage and which of the owners of the Betthaus had given his forgiveness.
According to the 197/2011, Jonás Larrazábal is freely spoken and there is no opposition to the trial, nor is any compensation required.
After hearing the representative of the Retirement House at 3:50 p.m., Larrazabal Bretón was immediately set on free foot.
The Secretary of Justice, Jorge Yánez, went to the City Prison of San Nicolás de los Garza to tell Jonás that he had been acquitted and his case would be put to the files.
He also informed him of the judicial order for immediate release.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome announces details of the plane accident in which government secretary Francisco Blake and seven more people were killed.
The Secretariat de Comunicaciones y Transportes - SCT (Secretariat für Kommunikation und Transport in Mexico) informed that the results of the investigation on the accident, which killed government secretary Francisco Blake Mora and another seven people, indicated that the helicopter was directly against the ground with its entire unspoilt structure without the pilot being able to launch an emergency landing.
At a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary for Communications and Transport, mentioned that the pilot had confirmed before the start that the weather conditions were suitable for the flight.
"The fact that the propeller wings were in contact with trees at a height of 25 meters, with the helicopter losing the hull seems to indicate that the helicopter had several ground contacts."
He also explained that the helicopter was built for 19 passengers, so he fulfilled all the conditions for the transport of the staff.
In addition, he said that no helicopter parts were found in the studies in the area where the machine had come down.
"In the search no aircraft parts were found at other places, the impact concerned the entire structure.
The helicopter was built for 19 passengers, so he fulfilled all the requirements for passenger transport.
The area has a slope of 7 to 30 degrees.
At present, it is important to get the results of the investigation as soon as possible, but this could take several months, perhaps even one year.
On the other hand, Gilberto López Meyer, Director-General of Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares (Secretariat for aircraft and auxiliary services in Mexico), assured that the helicopter from Estado Mayor Presidencial had flown on a flight-speed flight and had fallen to a soft slope.
"This information strengthens the assumption that, at the time of impact, it was a normal flight operation."
At a press conference, the head of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, included six relevant points that should be considered in the investigation:
Find flight:
In line with the flight standards, this was a flight according to the rules of the visual flight. This means that the team would have had sufficient visibility during the flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions:
The AICM recorded appropriate weather conditions at the start. During the continuing flight towards the border area between Mexico City and the Mexico State, a few deep-hanging clouds were raised.
Selected flight routes:
It is possible that because of the clouds the team had chosen a lower area with a better view towards the Cuernavaca valley.
Shocking point:
The impact coordinates and the last radar recording of the helicopter agree. Perhaps there was no loss of control over the aircraft before the impact or a deviation from the flight route.
Dispersal of the remains of the aircraft in a limited area:
The information available to date indicates that the helicopter was in a straight and side direction.
The pattern of the scattered aircraft remains suggests that the helicopter had hit the ground with its unsaturated structure.
No signs of fire or explosion:
The remains of the aircraft at the site of the accident do not allow to close either on fire or on explosion.
The latest results indicate multiple ground contact.
In the on-site investigations, aircraft parts were found at an altitude of 9200 feet above sea level. The terrain is wasteful and has a slope of seven to thirty degrees.
The photos show the sequence in which the helicopter probably broke.
Some information suggests that the helicopter might have had several ground contacts.
Following a minor search in an area that went beyond the restricted area at the site of the accident, no scattered aircraft parts could be found, which reinforced the assumption that the unsaturated aircraft structure had been hit against the ground.
MSS announces a research protocol for the detection of obesity gene
She runs a research project on finding the obese gene in children and adolescents supported by IPN specialists.
The Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social - IMSS (Social Insurance Institute of Mexico) announced that it is launching a research project on the discovery of the obese gene in children and adolescents under the title "Genetics of Obesity in Childhood and Youth", with which genetic markers are to be found in conjunction with overweight.
Miguel Cruz López, Head of the Unidad de Investigación Médica en Bioquímica (Department of Medical Research, Focus on Biochemistry) at the Hospital de Especialidades del Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI stated that an interdisciplinary team consisting of doctors, nurses, nutrition specialists and social workers was built.
This team is supported by specialists and students of the postgraduate course at the Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública (INSP) and the Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados (Cinvestav) del Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN).
The population is invited to participate in the study. Interested parties can come to the sports sites of the IMS in the valley of Mexico, where every Saturday from 8.00 p.m. tests with children and adolescents are conducted.
He stressed that the investigation began at the sports field of Cuauhtémoc (in the west of the state of México) and was continued since 8 October at the sports field of Nezahualcóyolt (in the east of the state of México).
If the target is reached from 500 to 600 researchers, the study will continue at the sports field of Independencia (in the south of the capital district) and will be completed on the site of Morelos (in the north of the capital district).
He explained that the objective of the study was to identify the factors and role of genetics in conjunction with the development of obesity and the identification of risk factors of mexican children and adolescents to prevent chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of the worldwide day of diabetes, he stated that three thousand children and young people aged between six and 14 should be asked to fill with consent and under the supervision of their parents' food-related questionnaires.
They are also asked questions about their physical activity and family disease history in order to control risk factors that may result in diabetes or renal insufficiency.
He further stated that on those Saturdays the subjects were measured (weight, size, waist size), their blood pressure, and determined blood levels such as glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors (such as the identification of genes associated with childhood obesity).
Cruz López stressed that this investigation would be carried out on the occasion of health personnel’ concerns about the alarming increase in the weight of young people.
"Health surveys from the years 1999 and 2006 showed that in almost six years the proportion of obese boys increased by 77 percent and the girl with obesity by 47 percent.
He stated that the search for genetic markers was justified because the genetic history of the population of Mexico differed from that of other peoples.
He stated that a (e) Mexican (in) averages 65 percent Indian, 30% European, and 5% African origin, which is reflected in the genes related to diabetes and overweight.
In general, he explained that the genetics of obesity are expressed in the inability to burn the excess of the energy (calories) taken to us, so that it is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for the participants was in a comprehensive study of the children in which it was found to have a degree of obesity or obesity.
It would even examine the occurrence of dark skin folds in the neck and the inner arm (Akanthosis), which indicate the likelihood of metabolic disorders and diabetes in the pre-stage.
All information would be treated confidentially and communicated to parents in writing by the doctors. The doctors explain to the parents all the measurement results and suggest to them changes in the lifestyle appropriate to prevent disease.
Cruz López stated that there would be three basic factors responsible for overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: lack of movement, that is, a lack of movement in everyday life, spending most of the time in front of the television and using means of transport instead of walking short distances.
The high calorie intake, that is, increased consumption of sugary beverages and carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) together with high fat and protein intake and the genetics to be analysed in this research project.
Asphalt by UNAM prevents strikeholes
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry at the University of Mexico, UNAM develops asphalt modified with polymers to make the mixture more resistant to weather conditions and temperature fluctuations
If the signs that come out of the road, it would not be necessary to fix almost 200,000 pitfalls if the rainy season broke out in the Zona Metropolitana del Valle de México (city area of the valley of Mexico), said Rafael Herrera Nájera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) at the University of UNAM, warning and assured that if the laying and maintenance of the asphalt layer were properly sloped, the number of blowholes would be significantly reduced or even completely avoided.
In his lecture "Storages From a Technical View", which he held on the occasion of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory he is responsible for was developing with polymer modified asphalt in order to produce a mixture similar to the asphalt, but which, however, has greater mechanical resistance at both high and low temperatures.
Mr. Nájera said that this type of modified asphalt should be used in areas with extremely hot climate, such as in some cities in the north of the country, in order to improve the behaviour of road flooring and thus avoid the occurrence of impact holes.
He explained that the asphalt - the most severe part of the oil - is a hydrocarbon compound of which one part has a high molecular weight - the so-called asphalt - and the other part a low - the so-called malthene. Together they give the street covering its characteristic tenacious behavior.
Asphalt's tough behaviour means that it behaves like a liquid at high temperatures of almost 180°C, at 120°C it is very tenacious and almost solid at 50°C, while at very low temperatures it becomes fragile.
"This means that the resistance of the asphalt on the roads is not uniform, but changes on one day depending on the weather conditions and temperature fluctuations," said the chemical engineer.
The research of the FQ noted that the streets of Mexico City had a majority of a flexible street floor, composed of six layers of materials, the last of which contained the three asphalt.
Between the top layers lies a layer of asphalt, which consists of small stones bathed in asphalt and then solidified.
Every single stone of this layer of wear has been bathed in asphalt.
If the vehicles move forward and the forces are generated, this layer enables a good distribution of forces in the road floor.
"If it were modified asphalt, the forces would spread even better," said the chemical engineer.
"On the wear layer," he said, "is designed a last layer, the so-called support layer, which consists of tiny stones, i.e. sand, which was also bathed in asphalt.
Since these layers are in contact with the vehicle tyres, they require a greater mechanical force than the wear layer and they must produce friction.
The majority of the forces received and distributed by this road covering also requires an adequate thickness and the material it consists of must be maintained.
The weather conditions, in particular humidity and temperature fluctuations, are further important factors to be considered, above all the water," he said, "because it significantly affects the behaviour of the wear layer.
When the terrain becomes wet, water penetrates into the layer and is only difficult to get out of it. This causes a evaporation of all layers of the road floor and, as a result, the occurrence of knockholes.
When a punch is created," he said, "the cover layer will first be removed, while the wear layer will not be affected until after that. But the damage does not occur immediately, but it is a process that would have to be maintained by adequate maintenance programs during the first signs."
The member of the Sisthema Nacional de Investigadores (National Research System of Mexico) stated that the vehicle load is another important cause for the occurrence of impact holes. Therefore, the thickness of each layer of road covering must always be in relation to the vehicle load and it must be ensured that this regulation is complied with in order to avoid frequent shock holes.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that a lot of research work had been carried out, for example, via asphalt emulsions that are already on the market in other countries, and with which the hitholes could be easily and without applying high temperatures.
What did the candidate del Valle lack to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors affecting the fact that Melina Ramírez Serna did not get the crown of Miss Colombia.
El Valle gets his 14th Miss Title.
Once again Valle del Cauca went out empty in the awarding of the crown for Miss Colombia.
This time, Melina Ramírez Serna had to be content with standing on the winning stage, showing a silver crown and the band that she is calling new Miss Colombia.
With the result obtained this night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico took the crown and the cedar, the department already comes to 14 mistitles and Melina is joined by the legion of women from Valle del Cauca who had almost held the crown. Among the proclaimed misses are Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Monica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Cataldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
The big question that many ask today is: What was missing?
The result is the decline of a great favorite who had shown at every show that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia. Not for nothing she had been elected the Queen of Police and the Mejor Rostro Jolie of Vogue, titles that had also received the beauty queens of Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro, and who took home the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first factor that counts as decisive for the jury's decision to appoint it for the first Miss is that she had not convinced the answer to the question of "What book has influenced you the strongest and why?", which was put to her by Martín Murillo Gómez by the Carreta Literaria Leamos.
The young woman from Valle del Cauca replied to the questioner:
"I read a lot, I believe quite in literature, I think it's a way to civilize, in the end I believe that the book, which was most powerful for my childhood, 'The Little Prince', is a rather profound book.
It is a book of universal culture that we should all read. I’m just reading a book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a beautiful book called `Leidenschaften'.
An answer that came up with little love, first of all because of the concept of 'civilizing' and second, because it had not specifically explained how each of its books had influenced it.
But after the ceremony ended, Melina explained to feel calm and happy with the result: "The universe is wise, it happens what must happen.
And for all people, please read a little `The Little Prince'. It's a great book.
Among other things, it is said that El Valle's favorite is burned up.
A journalist from Bogota indicated that the fact that she was the preferred one, who had all the coincidences in mind and who had received all the prizes in advance (Gastronomy Competition Easter, public vote on the best hand-crafted costume and Reina Madre), "the other female candidates had been jealous, which the Queen could not shine on stage."
And this was noted during their first performance in the bathing suit on the beach of the Hilton Hotel and during their two elevators at the coronation celebration.
Although she was safe in both cases, she lacked the strength and momentum that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico showed.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the program "Como en casa" at channel RCN, said that the fact that Melina was crowned to miss "shows that the candidate who wins the most prizes during the competition will eventually not become queen".
Valle also went out of the way to the conclusion of the press - an error.
Another hypothesis is that Valle could not convince the legal authority about their interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the national beauty competition.
It will have its reason already that two days before the assembly of the international jury Lucy Doughty said they were looking for a woman who was committed to the social affairs of her country.
"Beautifulness alone is not enough for a Miss Colombia. One has to look beyond the physical body and focus on the social feeling, insisting that she had already cooperated in projects before participating in the competition," she said.
It is also speculated that Valle had sinned with her defects of the derriers and the fibrosis that one noted in the stomach area. But that is contradictory, because the jury chose her as a candidate for 'natural beauty' with a healthy body, good nutrition habits and responsible physical work.
The trainer of the queens, Jorge Hernán Orozco, admits that Melina did not have the best body, that it would be better, "but her problem with the fibrosis on the belly, which I honestly could hardly notice, pressed her score on the last day."
Meanwhile, the journalist Guido Hoyos from Cromos magazine considers that the faults of the woman from Valle del Cauca were the surgical interventions she had undergone.
"The operations are ok, but Valle did not know how to make them do right.
Her body has never been her strong side, and this place she had to pay."
Because of this prize, which is awarded for the first time by the National Beauty Competition, after the appearance in the swim suit a cruel prediction was made that should come true at night. It was decided that Raymundo Melina had given a consolation prize in order not to let it come to the pleasure of the crown.
Whether that's true or not, the fact is that Melina starts her reigning year from today, not as a queen, but as a princess, a position that allows her to represent at one of the international competitions on appointment of the National Beauty Competition Colombia.
However, as one of the queens, who had escaped the crown in spite of her overwhelming appearance for Cartagena, she will go into history.
So was the work of the doctor who identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A cali Lophoscopist went into history as the man who identified "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials plays a key role.
Last November, a Lophoscopist from Cali, who confirmed the identity of the leader of the FARC (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - Revolutionary Forces of Colombia), entered as the man who confirmed the identity of the leader of the FARC (FARC) (Fuerzas Armadas Revolutionary Forces of Colombia): "Alfonso Cano" by comparing fingerprints.
This week, Eliazar González, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been involved in criminal investigation for 21 years, had been among the seven lophoscopists in the CTI department.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in communities of Chocó, where he often had to go five days in the jungle to reach the place where the bodies he was supposed to identify were located.
In 2000, he moved to Valle over and after completing the necessary courses he specialized in lophoscopy, which is the examination of the skin exposed to friction, i.e. the palms and feet.
In the week of use against the so-called Alfonso Cano, Eliazar was advised to pack clothes for at least three days.
Something big was expecting him.
He flew from Palmira to Cauca on Friday night.
He knew that he should identify two bodies, and that the suspicion was that one of the man who had led the oldest guerilla in the world could be, so he should take with him the ten-finger printed sheet of Guillermo León Sáenz (his actual name).
However, when he reached the place where the body was located with the investigation, he could not identify it because of his physical appearance, for this did not resemble the images he had seen in the mass media.
He had no beard, was dressed like a farmer in the area, had no glasses, and was much thinner.
But fingerprints don't lie.
Armed with a magnifier, ink, a plant cell and a flashlight, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the body to those on the printed sheet.
He had seen it right: it was Alfonso Cano.
The same night, this man from Puerto Tejada was responsible for telling the Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzón, that it was actually the head of the FARC.
Search for tracks
For a Sijín Daktyloscope in Cali, the tribute given to President Juan Manuel Santos Eliazar González at a press conference on "Cano" was very important.
Many people don't know our work.
Daktyloscopy is an exact science without error rate, which can be a key factor in the resolution of a crime.
Lophoscopists not only identify bodies, they also support investigations into murder and robbery and confirm the identity of the arrested.
When they are arrested, many offenders present false identity documents or they have none.
We'll take the fingerprints and find them in the database.
The researcher told us that he had to tear a piece of wall out of a house during a theft, because the thief had gotten himself up with his hand right at this point when he pulled out a safe full of jewelry and money.
"Wades are difficult because their surfaces are unsuitable for the removal of fingerprints. But in this case, we were able to take the impression of the whole hand and identify the offender who had participated in several thefts," he remembered.
With the help of fingerprints, murder suspects can also be relieved or taxed.
Recently, a dead man was found surrounded by schnapps bottles.
In the investigation, it was suspected that a family member might be suspicious and actually agreed to print a fingerprint on the bottle.
Although this does not guarantee that it is the murderer, it is linked to the place where the crime was committed.
A CTI Dactyloscopeist stated that "the fingerprints with chemical or physical reactions would be taken from the object."
When they appear, a plant cell or a band is used to take them.
After that, the prints are sent to the Asif, which is the criminal database, or to the staff station.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians without ID papers," said CTI expert.
He said not everything was the way it was depicted in the SCI TV series.
Just as not all gold is what shines, not all you touch is a fingerprint.
But it can still be used if you make a corresponding comparison.
The "enraged" challenge the authorities in New York
Hundreds of demonstrators gathered in tents on the Zuccotti square.
Most of them followed the space order and changed their location to a nearby park.
On this Tuesday, the members of the Ocupy Wall Street movement challenged the New York authorities when they again tried to enter the Manhattan Square after they had been cleared from the square in the morning grey and had tried to occupy another place on Big Apple.
Hundreds of demonstrators gathered in front of the Zuccotti square, on which they wanted to enter the new tent with a court order that allowed the "indulgent" to allow the re-establishment at this place. Meanwhile, another part of the movement remained at the command of the court and occupied a park further north in the city, where there were nine arrests.
"Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp in the square, we find ourselves together in another place and continue the battle with legal means to return to Zuccotti, with sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations," said Mark Bray, one of the spokespersons of the movement "Ocupy Wall Street".
Bray stated that the answer of the "impressed" to the site of her tent camp, which had been ordered directly by Michael Bloomberg, mayor of New York, came to court, where the judge Lucy Billings issued an order that banned the violent movement of the place and approved the demonstrators of the tent.
In addition, the "Empported" occupied a new park, located at the intersection of central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, near the entrance to the Holland tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and is owned by Trinity Church.
They could occupy the place for at least an hour, but after that the police met and arrested some of the demonstrators, although Bray cannot give precise figures. He assured Efe, the news agency, that he had seen several journalists with handcuffs.
The organization assures that hundreds of people had arrived at this point, where there was also a ordination of religious leaders as a sign of their support for the members of the movement and for mediation with the police.
In the meantime, the Zucotti Square (a private property site) remains closed in expectation of a judicial hearing, which is still open for this Tuesday, and in which the legality of the room held in the morning grey is to be analysed.
Some of the demonstrations driven by the square carried with them a photocopy of this judicial order and distributed it. They even gave it to some police officers who guarded the place, resulting in "some small collisions", as Bray reported, who had indicated that some police had beaten demonstrators.
The court order prohibits the authorities from withdrawing members of Occupy Wall Street from the square as well as the application of "laws adopted after the occupation and prohibiting the demonstrators from returning to the park with their tents and other things they had previously used."
Mayor Bloomberg pointed out to the press that, due to this judicial arrangement, the new opening of the square for public traffic and the demonstrators had been lifted. He pointed out that the city laws did not allow them to re-establish themselves with tents and sleeping bags in that place.
The mayor personally defended the site of the Zuccotti Square, which was held in dawn gray, where almost 200 people were arrested, and which was decided because the demonstrators "disposed from the law."
Bloomberg stated that he had given the arrangement to stop the place because it had "turned into a place where people did not come to demonstrate, but to break the laws and in some cases to harm other people", for "some businesses had received threats" and the locals were "feared about their quality of life".
"The room in the morning grey was disgusting and shows that Bloomberg is basically interested in protecting the financial interests and not in protecting the interests of North American workers," added the spokesman of the movement, who accused the mayor "not to respect the freedom of the press".
The officers of "Occupy Wall Street" informed them that they thought about organizing "great actions" for Thursday, along with community organizations and trade unions, to commemorate the two months that the protests have already lasted since September 17.
Pamela Anderson is the Virgin Mary in the TV Christmas Show
Together with Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities, she will perform on December 1st in the TV programme "It's a Russell Peters Christmas"
The Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Alle's assistant in "Home Improvement", rescue swimmer in "Baywatch", rabbit at "Playboy", the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee, and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary on a Christmas broadcast of Canadian television.
Today, the CTV's private television channel announced that Anderson, together with the "crooner" (balade singer) Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities, will appear on December 1st in the TV programme "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" and will have a very special Virgin Mary.
Today, CTV spread pictures of the TV program, in which Anderson - also for the distribution on the Internet of a self-turned porn in which she appears together with her former husband, the drummer of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee - as a virgin Mary with a doll in the lap to represent Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a famous Canadian comedian of Indian origin, recently appeared as a moderator on the broadcast "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" by Charlie Sheen as a Jesus child.
The Christmas program of CTV not only focuses on Anderson and Peters, but also on the Canadian singer Bublé, who at the end of March married the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato, which is not far from this controversy.
Recently, at one of his concerts in New York, Bublé called North American Kim Kardashian "Hure".
Japan Reborn After Earthquake
GDP is growing by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and the spiral of the free fall ends from the beginning of March
Since last March, the Japanese economy has been paralysed, which is still in recovery after the destructive earthquake that resulted in a nuclear crisis, and the worst catastrophe that Japan had experienced in World War II.
The government's initial estimates in Tokyo assessed the damage to property at $300 000, a blow that appears to weaken despite the difficult world economic situation.
After three quarters of permanent cases, gross domestic product figures from July to September were intended to finally conclude this chapter: GDP grew by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% to the year-highed quota.
The value measured in the second quarter - in Japan beginning the fiscal year in March 2012 - also means the fastest growth since the period from January to March 2010.
The recovery can be partly explained by the sale of machinery for the reconstruction of the areas destroyed by the earthquake and the next tsunami.
In fact, the companies increased their investments by 1.1% compared to the decrease of 0.9% for investments recorded from January to March, the first decline after six months of unsustainable increases.
Nevertheless, the real change in the Japanese economy is not based solely on keynsiaan attacks that use the crisis to build or rebuild infrastructures.
Japan is awake, in particular, thanks to the trend in domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japan's GDP.
This variable rose by 1%, driven by growing expenditure on vehicles, travel and leisure.
The Stigma of the Yen
Tokyo has entrusted itself to the domestic market after the Yen - the Japanese currency - flees to one of the "citizen currencies" of investors fleeing from the debt crisis of the eurozone and the dire forecasts for the U.S.A., a privilege that is like a gravestone on the accounts of the export companies.
With a tougher currency, products abroad are more expensive, a serious problem for a country whose economy is based on the health of the large technology producers.
Toyota and Sony, for example, brought back their weak business results from July to September to the notation of the Yen.
While the markets continue to besiege peripheral EU countries, the Yoshihiko Noda government remains vigilant.
"One has to pay attention to the continued risks, for example the deterioration of some foreign economies, the effects of floods in Thailand and the rapid recovery of Yen," said Motohisa Furukawa, State Secretary for Economic Policy.
The perspectives are really not very exciting.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) stated that most Member States had shown clearer signs of a slowing down of economic development in September.
The indicator presupposing the turning points of the world economy revealed that the greatest economic potential would have hit the brake.
Because it sank by four tenths to 100.4 points compared to the 100.8 in August.
The eurozone is even below this average, which is 100, after it has fallen by eight tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens Re-emphasizes Doubt
Papadimos says the austerity measures would be adopted, but the Conservatives will not sign a written agreement
With the high risk premiums of peripheral countries and widespread uncertainty, Greece is also continuing to get lost in the labyrinth that leads to the great European debt crisis.
The impression that the "consensus" of the new Greek transitional government is a response to pressure from Brussels rather than a genuine conviction of the political forces is slowly demonstrated by facts.
During the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, yesterday pointed out that there would be no alternatives to structural reforms and that the hundred days agreed upon during his appointment might be too short for their implementation, the leader of the conservative party Nueva Democracia, Antonis Samaras, assured that he would support the new austerity measures and in no way take back his request for new elections to the scheduled date, February 19th.
"The most important task of this government is to implement the decisions taken at the summit on 26 October," Papadimos assured yesterday to open a parliamentary debate that will culminate tomorrow with the vote of confidence for the new government.
The first initiatives are a package of 24 employment promotion programmes, the reform of the disciplinary law for officials and new measures to combat tax evasion.
Even so, Samara's communication does not raise doubts about his attitude: "We have committed ourselves to supporting the transitional government, but to nothing else."
The conservative leader took a step too far with his challenge of the EU and the IMF, the organism that must unlock the 8000 million Athens urgently needed, and made it clear that he would not approve a declaration of commitment on the fulfilment of the savings measures.
But yesterday the European Commission, which is still annoyed because of the effects of the poker game with Papandreu referendum, reaffirmed that its demand is not to be overturned: economic aid would not be signed if the new government and leaders of the main Greek parties were not to sign a clear written agreement as soon as possible.
The spokesperson of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, said that the inspectors of the Troika would come back to Athens "very soon" to discuss with the new government "what for the payment of the sixth section" of 8,000 million euros is "needed", although there is not yet a final date.
The Greek kid still has threads for a while.
Queen Sofía: "These are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen stressed the 'dominant' position of Spain in relation to this type of financing.
Spain "has achieved a dominant position in the role of micro-financing worldwide".
Yesterday, Queen Sofía of Spain reminded us that Spain has become the second donor for this means of international cooperation in the last two decades. His "wise" rests on the fact that it is a "instrument for social progress, justice and the hope of a better future for all humanity based on trust in men".
The Queen weaned the fifth world summit on microcredits in Valladolid yesterday. She was convinced that it would be "no doubt" that this kind of business would be "absolutely essential" to achieve the millennium goals set by the United Nations by 2015 and "in particular the goal of living with incomes of less than one dollar per day", i.e. below the limit of poverty".
Spain "remains" on the extension of the beneficiary network "to the last corner of the world and carries out this task responsibly," said Queen Sofia, hoping that the initiatives and contributions that will be taken from the summit that lasts until Thursday are "the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest and, in particular, for women" as the main beneficiaries of these loans.
"We have achieved many successes" and "there are many challenges."
The summit on microcredits is not only a forum for debates, but also a platform for "two fundamental objectives".
The Queen stated that by the end of 2015, the aim would be to provide 175 million poor families with access to these financial services and that ten million of these households would exceed the poverty line.
In Spain and the rest of the world, the concept of microcredit goes back to Muhammad Yunus' "prior to years ago-initiated way", which Queen Sofia considers to be an "act of justice and recognition".
The father of this financial instrument described her as a "admirable idealist who had committed herself to the struggle against poverty" and whose work she has known for 15 years when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to get to know the local loan strategy.
A year later, this experience followed the first World Summit in Washington and further meetings on the Ivory Coast in 1999 and Canada in 2006. "We have been able to observe a continuous development," explained the Queen, whose commitment to this project brought her yesterday's assessment as "head of the family" in Valladolid and as "presidant of the poor".
Finally, Queen Sofia finished her lecture by animated the participants to participate in the debate and in the search for solutions in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical Commandment"
Spanish Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez pointed out that solidarity is "an ethical bid" for the entire democratic state.
In this sense, she stressed that it was a mistake to commit development aid to times of economic booms, because it was a "permanent commitment".
Jiménez was of the opinion that micro-credit was a "serious and rigid policy for the eradication of poverty", and that the governments of the industrialized states now had to work "more than ever" according to solidarity criteria, and should not allow the solidarity of the crisis to fall to the victim.
For Spain, micro-credit is one of the "most important forms of development aid".
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, lamented "the success", "marginized" people, "who are always standing in front of closed doors" to give "Hoffnung" and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed those present in a city that opens "their gates, attached to the spirit of solidarity".
The CDU proposes to elect EU Presidents on the basis of a general vote
The first day of the Congress of Christian Democrats (CDU on Monday, November 14 in Leipzig, for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and Chairman of the Christian-Democrat Party, without any real difficulties.
The future of Europe was originally not planned in the programme, but it has continued in autumn, in particular in order to satisfy those activists who regard government policy as too lax today and possibly Italy's tomorrow.
The European Commission's proposal for a Presidency proposed by the Bureau was almost unanimously adopted.
Of 1001 delegates, only nine had voted against, ten had abstained.
The standing ovation, which was initially granted by Angela Merkel and Wolfgang Schäuble a few hours later, due to their intervention delays, was not open to any doubt by the three European-calibre finance ministers.
The main idea of the chancellor, as well as the following slogans, is that the answer to the crisis is "not less, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe means peace, but also because "nine million jobs are directly dependent on the euro".
For the chancellor, "the time has come for a breakthrough in Europe".
This could be reflected by a revision of the Lisbon Treaty which strengthens the control of the European Union with regard to the budgetary policies of the euro area countries, but could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of a general vote" to give Europe a face".
However, this is in any case one of the proposals adopted by the Congress, which clearly stood Wolfgang Schäuble Pate.
It is certainly not likely that the 47 will quickly agree on this revolution: Great Britain is opposed to the matter, and the leaders of the CDU believe Nicolas Sarkozy is of the same opinion.
The milestone, however, is laid.
Similarly, the delegates in an overwhelming majority rejected the proposal to weigh each country in the Governing Board according to the weighting of the individual economies, which apparently gave rise to an initialisation in Germany's position.
The chancellor, who is concerned with calming the climate within her party, has therefore strengthened the references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. However, she has no longer tried to win her congress at the expense of the "small" or of the European countries in difficulty, which would immediately criticize the arrogant Germany.
As far as the European request for the significance of "German-French friendship" is concerned, Angela Merkel France does not call on the plan.
At least not directly.
This reminds us that Leipzig was at the heart of a bloody battle two centuries ago.
Factically one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What does the fraud represent in health reports?
Following family aid, UMP and the government are now attacking the disease reports.
Nicolas Sarkozy will arrive in Bordeaux on Tuesday, 15 November to visit a family grant fund and to present a speech on the issue of the fight against social fraud and economic dependence on the state - which has been recurring since 2007.
In order to accompany this attack, which assumes that the economy is being subjected to a hard test, but on the other hand, it is no less a premise of an axis of the right presidential campaign, the majority of the effort is to focus on workers' health reports.
First of all, with budgetary objectives: the government intends to introduce a fourth day of career before taking into account a health report from private workers.
In good German, this means that a sick worker would lose the wages of four days without the approval of the specific company, thus at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure which, according to the daily newspaper "Les Echo" threatens to stir up anger, but would help bring in 280 million euros.
And with a different measure there was a more symbolic character: to give officials an unforgivable day of career in the event of illness (up until now, unlike the three days in the private sector, there is no term of care).
While these questions are in the discussion, the majority of the issues are again the subject of fraud, with the aim of this time of abuse associated with the absence of work.
"Controversies will be much more important, and in addition, they will be remunerated if this is demanded," warned Xavier Betrand on Sunday, November 13 in front of the rTL transmitter's microphone.
As in other cases, the effects of this notification on the reality of fraudulent actions in the area of disease reports seem to be somewhat unproportional.
In fact, this has been the subject of permanent observation since 2002 as well as political offensives that have borne the most fruit.
The French are no longer more ill than people elsewhere in Europe.
However, let us first dwell on the national figures.
According to the Landeskrankenkase CNAM, more than 237 million euros of daily payments were paid in 2006.
According to the Institute for Economic Research and Documentation of Health, day-to-day payments in 2008 accounted for 5% of health expenditure of 11.3 billion euros.
This amount included 46% on maternity leave and occupational accidents and 54% on sick leave, which is EUR 6.2 billion.
After that, 2.5% health expenditure.
In 2010, according to a study by the Alma Consulting Group, the French averaged 14.5 days in comparison to the 17.8 days in 2009.
A mean, which conceals certain differences: another one, published by Monster.com, Career Planning website in 2007, showed that 75% of the 40,000 surveyed said French workers did not take a single day of illness.
Another study, this time covered by health insurance, makes it clear that 37% of the disease reports in 2010 were of shorter duration than 8 days; 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and one month, 15% between one and three months and 11% above.
In other words, the French workers are no longer incapacity for work, compared with their European neighbours.
A long-term study conducted in 2010 by two researchers from the French State Center for Science (CNRS) showed that between 1994 and 2001 the global absence rate (disease- or otherwise justified) was oscillated, between 10% and 11% in France and 20% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
The fraud in the case of disease reports is a far-reaching small proportion of unskilled work.
With regard to fraud, there is only a weak outcome here.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 means that there are systematic controls in the case of disease reports that exceed 45 days.
In 2008, the CNAM (public university for the education of technicians and engineers) recorded under 1.5 million controls that 13% of the 285,000 realized short-term disease reports, which were not justified or too long in 37,050 cases".
In the systematically controlled disease cases of more than 45 days of duration, 11% were "unappropriate or unjustified" cases, i.e. 132,000.
In total, this makes 169.000"unjustified" cases to several million workers who have filed a health report.
A point which represents only a weak dimension to, for example, that of unskilled work.
According to UMP member Dominique Tian, author of a factual report on this issue published in July, this represents between 9 and 15 billion euros tax profit loss per year, i.e. more than the total cost of daily payments, and thus much more than the defraudation of the latter.
Papademos: Greece should introduce a new adaptation plan
Greece needs a new adjustment programme to capture its economy.
On Monday, 14 November, Prime Minister Lucas Papademos announced before Parliament, adding that the one hundred days that had been granted to his government by the Union were not enough to accomplish this task.
"In order to continue efforts to strengthen the economy, we need support from our European partners and a new budget adjustment programme," said the Head of Government in his first public speech in opening the debate on Parliament's vote of confidence on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the European Summit on 27 October was the "main task" of the new government, as the country's participation in the Eurozone "is at stake" as it added.
Accordingly, M. Papademos has planned to reduce the state deficit of the country"to the 9%" of gross domestic product from today to the end of the year, after it was 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
Rights reject the new austerity measures
On Monday, Antonis Samaras, head of the right wing, had given his consent to the measures already approved in respect of an attempt to escape from the debt crisis, but predicted that his party would not be ready for an additional savings measure.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said at a plenary meeting of his party's New Democracy.
He had declared himself prepared to reduce budget deficits and debt, as well as to fight against waste, but he was hostile to any policy that would prevent the economic upturn.
Olli Rehn, EU Commissioner responsible for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who had prevented IMF and EU from releasing the necessary loan of EUR 8 billion without a written guarantee of all parties on the support of the planned measures, had replied to Antonio Samaras that his word was sufficient and he would not sign under pressure from electorate.
Euthanasia and accompanied free death must be legalized, according to an expert body
The Canadians live in refusal of death, as a report from the Royal Society of Canada shows.
The panel stated that governments, health care institutions and doctors cooperated with regard to painful treatment in order to provide the best painsinking agents, and this goes beyond the cancer cases.
Canadian society lives in a refusal to die.
Only 9% of Canadians actually agree to talk to their doctor about the conditions under which they want to die and make discrepancies for this purpose.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, in which six experts involved in various fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
This body recommends that the government amend the criminal law in such a way as to allow accompanied suicide and euthanasia, where this choice takes place, in patients who are considered able to make such a decision.
The experts cite a recently published independent survey of EIU, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the globe.
Although Canada has placed itself in the 10th place, the study notes that "medical death care in Canada has produced a culture in which people are afraid to cut the issue of death".
Medical care or not: 77% of Canadians have no access to agonizing drugs, so tell us the experts appointed by the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite the Canadian majority wish to die at home, however, 68.6% of these eventually die in the hospital.
From the country as a whole, the rate is highest in Quebec with 86% of deaths occurring in the hospital.
In the sensitive question of euthania and accompanied suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions that are contrary to the position of the federal government which has already committed itself to not making any changes to the criminal law on euthania and accompanied suicide.
But now, according to experts who have inspected all those countries whose approach has legalized or decriminized euthania and accompanied suicide, there is no evidence that such decriminalisation would entail abuses in their application, i.e. the practice of euthanasia or accompanied suicide of uncompetent or not consenting persons.
On the contrary, much more cases of such violations are dealt with especially in countries where euthania and accompanied suicide are not legalised, as was confirmed yesterday by Jocelyn Downie, co-signatory of the report, in a teleconferencing conference.
"Euthania is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
"A accompanied suicide is also practiced in Canada, although this is clearly illegal," explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians support the euthanasia
Let us remember that, according to an Angus-Reid survey carried out in 2010, 85% of Canadians had already spent their time in favour of euthanasia, as they believe that this allows persons at the end of their life course to alleviate their sufferings.
And 66% believe that the fact that euthanism is legalized does not result in conveying the message that the lives of older or disabled people are of less value.
With regard to the persons who have already practised a accompanied suicide, 41% of the respondents consider that they should not be prosecuted.
In terms of maintaining or stopping the drug in patients, the author of the report is less clear.
Similarly, in its list of recommendations, these suggest that the criminal law should specify that the withdrawal of the funds for which there was a valid rejection should not be considered criminal.
The Committee also calls for health professionals to be trained to respect a loss of resources at the end of life and to fear this without criminal persecution.
The panel stated that governments, health care institutions and doctors cooperated with regard to painful treatment in order to provide the best painful means, and this goes beyond the cancers.
Finally, the Committee calls for pain relief or loss of life to be taken into consideration in respect of the already widely used means of health care in Canadian institutions, as they did not serve to reduce physical pain and to delay the same procedures.
Other experts
Some experts in the field of health have already made reservations regarding the conclusions of the expert report of the Royal Society of Canada.
RA Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, has referred to the attitude of the reporting experts as "extreme", as it did not set any limits on euthanasia in the final phase in the hospital.
"This opens the doors for a situation in which anyone who is tired of life and older than 18 years is asking another person to help him with his suicide," said RA Deschamps, who had seen a summary of the report yesterday.
RA Deschamps also stressed that the authors of the report seemed to put individual responsibility over all the other values involved in the social activities of society.
But, he says, "there would be guidelines and obligations in a society".
Margaret Somerville, a specialist in health law, has also expressed "a strong resistance" to the conclusions of the report, which she titulated as "Pro-Euthanasia-Manifest".
Margaret Somerville, who is himself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, doubts in particular the reports on the non-imposition of abuses in certain countries where euthanasia and accompanied suicide are legalized, such as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
The king of Jordan calls on President Assad to withdraw from power
Damascus Proclaims a "Completed"
Syria is obviously insulated
The partisans Bashar al-Assads demonstrated yesterday before the authorities of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The diplomatic pressure on Syria Bashar al-Assads, which, however, is opposed by Russia's support and which has a "combat" directed against the country, has become stronger yesterday.
Two days before Syria's extradition by the Arab League, the European Union tightened its sanctions against Damascus, although Turkey and Jordan, the neighbouring countries of Syria, had taken a position in favour of the resignation of President Assad.
King Abdullah II of Jordan was yesterday the current Arab Prime Minister, who had asked President Bashar al-Assad to "set up his authority in Syria", in which the forty civilians and members of the government were already killed.
"Law Baschar's interest in his country, he would retire, but in addition he should also create the necessary conditions for a new era of political Syrian life," said King of Jordan, neighboring country of Syria, in an interview with the BBC.
On the other hand, Turkish diplomat chief Ahmet Davutoglu complained that the Turkish mediation attempts aimed at the Syrian regime since the beginning of the year had not been successful.
"Those in the Middle East who are not at peace with their peoples and cannot satisfy this need to go," he said, alluding to Syria, the neighbouring country, to which Turkey is taking a constantly roughing attitude.
The United States, in turn, welcomed the "strengthening of the Consensus against Assad and the work of the Syrian regime" as a result of the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"International community, United States, EU, Arab League and countries like Turkey have hit an ever-increasing tone due to the repression in Syria," said Mark Toner, a spokesperson of the State Department.
During this time, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the government in the region of Dar'a in southern Syria have died, so the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights OSDH announced.
According to this NGO, two other civilians were killed in the besieged city of Hom's in "shoe changes and heavy bombings around Jobar".
At a press conference, however, the Syrian Foreign Trade Minister Walid al-Muallim felt that the country was "taxing towards the end of the crisis".
By the way, he has responded emphatically to the decision of the Arab League to suspend Damascus from his duties, which is his assessment of a "hazardous step".
Syria "will not give up," he added, under the remark that "the plots forged against Syria would fail".
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is now examining a "protection mechanism for civilians" and wishes to send 500 members of Arab human rights organisations, the media and military observers to the country.
The French Foreign Trade Minister Alain Juppé also spoke in favour of sending UN observers to protect civilians from repressions of the regime that after encapsulating in his "Paranoia" he would be on his side.
An extra-planned re-meeting of the League is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabat to discuss the implementation of the plan for the rise of the crisis on 2 November, in particular the controversial and anticipated withdrawal of the military troops from the camped cities and the liberation of detained demonstrators.
Russian Minister of State Sergei Lawrow classified the Arab League's decision yesterday as "uncorrected" in order to protect himself from the support of any sanctions against Damascus, although China had already warned Syria to implement the crisis exit plan.
Italy
Monti calls on the markets to be patient and Italy to offer sacrifice
Mario Monti, future Italian head of government, has required a little more time from the markets to form his staff and implement a program that "sacrifice" requires to regain the creditworthiness lost during the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former Commissioner of the EU yesterday had held negotiations with the political parties before the meeting of trade unions and employers.
It was his job to convene a cabinet in Parliament, which is relatively strictly composed of external technocrats.
"Monti spoke of an important programme with a number of victims," said Francesco Nucara, Member of Parliament of one of the many smaller parliamentary groups participating in the talks after having met with the President-in-Office of the Council.
Gianfranco Fini, President of the Chamber of Deputies, had, on the other hand, been waiting for Mario Monti to give Parliament a vote of confidence by Friday in order to ensure that the new government had sufficient support.
The agreements will be drawn up in the presentation by M. Monti of a list of deletions, which will undoubtedly range from a dozen ministers to the head of state Giorgio Napolitano.
M. Monti commented that yesterday's nervousness of stock exchange and bond markets took their time.
"There are certain deadlines in a democracy" to prepare a government and a government programme, he stressed by saying that it was "certain that the markets will show themselves dubious and understanding".
His appointment by the President was initially welcomed by the markets, but the unrest had increased again, especially after an unexpected industrial production decline in the Eurozone in September.
The Prime Minister is expected to set up a staff consisting of mainly technical stations, although he had stressed that he would like to include "politics".
The new government should exist only until 2013, the date of the next parliamentary elections, he estimated.
According to Gianfranco Fini, the President of the Chamber of Deputies, the new government should receive Parliament's evidence of confidence by Friday.
Since taking up his role, M. Monti has committed himself to working in all urgency within the meaning of the objective to make Italy a "new protagonist" in Europe.
A spokesperson of Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that "it does not change our diagnosis of the Italian economy even in the light of the new government".
The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its target of fiscal compensation in 2013 despite the savings plans that have been taken over in recent months, has in particular requested new toughing measures.
Emma Marcegaglia "Chefin of the heads of Italy, which will meet on Monti on Tuesday, also insists on the need for economic recovery" since a country that has no growth to show cannot respect the deficit figures".
M. Monti, known for his competence and independence as an EU Commissioner (1994-2004), stands for a "time change" of Italy after 17 years "berlusconism"; the "Professor" symbolizes the "demand of trustworthiness" as well as a "other Italy", says the editorial authors.
The great unknown here was the durability of his staff.
President Napolitano would like to prevent favoured elections, as Italy will now have to pay for 200 billion euros of government bonds by April 2012.
Russian scientist helps the Iranian nuclear energy program
A Russian scientist, Wjacheslaw Danilenko, helped Iran to develop an explosive capsule that can be used with a nuclear weapon, confirmed an American NGO specializing in nuclear risks on Monday.
The Institute for Science and International Security ISIS is based on the recent report by the International Atomic Safety Agency AIEA and other documents based on this UN agency to identify this scientist.
The AIEA announced last week its "serious concern" on the occasion of a "as far as possible military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear programme.
According to the in-depth study of the AIEA documents from ISIS, the Danilenko, born in 1934, apparently had worked for over three decades in a Soviet military nuclear center in Chelyabinsk (Ural) since the beginning of the 60s and was involved in the production of synthetic diamonds produced by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he is expected to leave the centre to set up a company in Kiev that produces "Nano-Diamants".
The economic difficulties of his company led him in 1995 to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine.
Before returning to Russia, he then participated in an Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002.
In its last report, the AIEA's strong evidence that Iranian development has been supported by the work of a foreign expert, who has not only moved beyond this technique, but also, as one member of the Agency announced, has worked his entire career directly on this technology on the military nuclear energy programme of his country of origin."
Anti-Islamic Crimes and Crimes have increased by 50%
The crimes and crimes against Muslims increased by 50% from 2009 to 2010, whereas other racist or religiously motivated violent crimes have either decreased slightly or increased slightly in the same period, according to the FBI statistics published on Monday.
According to this data, the total number of violent crimes committed against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. 49%, while a 13% increase in violent acts against Catholics, a 4% reduction in crimes directed against Jews, and a global increase of 14% of anti-religious crimes and crimes.
The total number of "hassed crimes" has risen to 6,628 cases in very weak terms, including 47.3% by racial differences and 20% by religious differences of motivated crimes, according to the FBI.
"After a weakening in 2009, it is alarming to see these crimes and crimes grow again," stressed the human rights organization Human Rights First."The increase in anti-Islamic violence is particularly significant," the organization added.
"Human Rights First has long stressed that the violence directed against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, should be regarded as a serious violation of human rights," added Paul Legendre, a responsible organization.
"The American government can and should do more to combat these attacks," he said, adding that this could be done by improving the police attitude towards "hate crimes".
The "hate crimes" is a legacy of the era of the struggle for civil rights.
This legislation had been passed after the death of Martin Luther Kings to punish acts of violence directed against race, skin color, religion or descent and now includes crimes of sexual belonging.
Twitter transforms the platform and resembles more and more Facebook
On Monday, the Microblogging website Twitter introduced changes in the presentation of its platform in order to enable its users in particular to observe the activities of those who follow their entries, which makes the service similar to Facebook once more.
The new tab "activity" and another "name" allow better readable live understanding of other "Twitter", the Internet user whose messages are pursued and who follow your messages.
This makes it possible to find out if they allow them to track their messages, whether they subscribe to new posts, favor certain messages, etc.
This new Twitter menu offer had been tested with a low percentage of users prior to its general Internet dissemination on Monday" in August," said Twitter spokesman Carolyn Penner to the French press agency AFP.
Twitter was known for its little instinctive functioning, equipped with somewhat aesthetically supposed text (RT for the referenced repetition of the contribution of another person). followfriday pour recommander de suivre un autre utilizer) fascinate le bonheur des initiales, s'uvre ainsi a un public plus large avec un maniement plus compatible a cellui des réseaux grand public Facebook et Google+.
In the network, users debated this innovation with the help of certain "Tweets" via the Internet.
"This is useless, urgent and like too much Facebook," writes @jemb123.
"The function"activity" will help me track certain elements of my Flux twitter better," announced @danykronstrom.
Austria
Entry of a "Golden household rule" into the Constitution
The government of the largest Social-Democrat/Christian-Democrat coalition in Austria decided on Tuesday to include a "Golden Budget Rule" in the Constitution in order to reduce public deficits and also to avoid any possible degradation from rating agencies in the top-bonity of Austria (AAA).
It was the S & D Chancellor Werner Faymann very personally who announced this decision of the Council of Ministers, although the public Austrian government debt is 74.6%, that is far above the 60 % criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty, but significantly below the debt level of the countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's ability to pay did not fall on a stroke from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay an additional three billion euros each year," argued Michael Spindelegger, Vice Chancellor and Christian Minister of Foreign Affairs.
Austria is also calling for the Brussels Summit of Eurozone Member States to be held on 26 October: Heads of State or Government would then have called for the inclusion of the reduction of public deficits by the end of 2012 as well as a return to the balance of public accounts in the Constitution or by the adoption of an equivalent law.
The measure taken by the Austrian Government is similar to the "German model" because Germany was the first European country to have incorporated such a "rule" into the constitution.
By 2017, the structural deficit should be reduced by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year, while the government's structural deficit should not exceed the 0.35% of GDP from 2017 onwards, whereas regional states and municipalities should also have balanced households.
In the 2020/21 horizon, the objective is to eliminate budget debt under the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Agreement.
Stronger yen
Noda threatens with a new intervention in the monetary markets
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that the Japanese government would intervene again on the currency markets if the yen continued to rise.
"If we should establish excessive volatility in the Yen's exchange rate, we will intervene just as we did the last time," said M. Noda in the Senate.
On Tuesday, the Yen was again speeded up close to the historical levels that the Japanese authorities had forced to intervene on October 31.
On that day Tokyo sold massive yen against dollars to reduce the Japanese foreign exchange value, which is in charge of a new record value since 1945 compared to the dollar.
However, the yen has risen regularly over it, baptised by purchases of investors who regard Yen as "accommodation value" in these uncertain times of global economic downturn and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar fell on Tuesday under 77 yen, the euro slipped below the symbolic latte of 105 yen near the levels that had caused the last intervention.
Prior to the financial crisis 2008-2009, the dollar recorded around 120 yen, the euro more than 160 yen.
This strawfire of the Japanese foreign currency harms the exports of the archipelago, as it consumes the cost of "Made in Japan" products and reduces the income value drawn by Japanese companies from abroad, as they exchange them into national currency.
"Japan fights after the earthquake and the tsunami on 11 March, which destroyed the region of Tohoku (Nordosten), for its reconstruction," emphasizes Mr. Noda, who fears that this famine of the Yen could already kill the weak upsurge in the germ.
The third world economic power has for the first time gained, with growth in the third quarter-1.5% compared to the previous quarter- this year, thanks to the significant export growth and the consumption of the "plombed" households again in the field of tensile power.
The Prime Minister estimates, however, that the restructuring of the Yen does not reflect"the economic foundations of Japan".
Mr Jun Azumi, Minister for Finance, invited the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its Monetary Committee on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to disarm the Yen.
However, Hirohid Yamaguchi, deputy governor of the Institute, informed us that the BoJ had already initiated "appropriate measures", which he stated would mean that no additional currency relief would be expected on Wednesday.
At the last meeting at the end of October, the central bank had increased its government bond purchases by 5,000 billion yen (EUR 47 billion) in order to remove the 55,000 billion yen (EUR 519 billion), which it had spent on various purchases of financial instruments in order to flood the liquidity market.
Eurozone:
Fast interest feet in the height, stock exchanges make withdrawals
The risk of infection of the debt crisis constantly undermines the European indicators.
Despite the new heads of government in Greece and Italy and the best growth rates in France and Germany, the Councils of the weakened countries are constantly increasing.
The stock exchanges, which are still concerned about the stability of the euro area, also drifted a little more in negative terms this Tuesday, November 15.
In Paris, the CAC lost 1.4% at 10 a.m. and fell to 3,064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt dropped by 0.4%, London by 0.1%.
"Because of the new tensions with regard to government bond returns in the euro area in difficulty, the global stock markets continue to issue some of their recent profits.
"The investors are nervous and only too well aware of the risk of infection," explains Terry Pratt, institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by the Reuters press agency.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange, which, in turn, has suffered from the renewed fear of market participants in terms of capacity in Europe that the debt crisis continues to continue, had closed with a Baisse of 0.7%.
""Japan has turned his eyes on Europe as well as the rest of the world, and trade is moving on a limited variation corridor, as long as investors have no evidence that the situation has stabilised," estimates Mushy Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This resurgence of concern about the future of the euro area damages the single currency which continues its Baiss on Tuesday.
The euro has been moving at its lowest level for one and a half months.
At 10 a.m., the European Currency was worth 1.3570 Dollars, which means it was down 0.4%.
According to the stock exchange brokers, after the CDU, the chancellor's party, Angela Merkel, who had gathered in Congress on Monday, had accepted a request which, in particular, provided the possibility for themselves to leave the euro area without simultaneously leaving the European Union.
The Italian and Spanish rates are well below the 6% limit.
The loan interest rates of Italy and Spain remain at a very alarming level.
This Tuesday morning, the return on the Italian bonds reached 6,85%, which of the Spanish titles matured to 6.2%.
These tensions of interest rates in the southern countries, but also in France, continue to sustain the fears of investors.
The future Italian head of government Mario Monti took more time from the markets to restore the situation threatened by paralysis by the debt burden in Italy.
On the other hand, the new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone summit on 27 October would be "the main task" of his government.
Spain is in the sight of the markets, as on Sunday the parliamentary elections take place in the country.
The spread between the German and Spanish 10-year bonds has once again reached a new historical high.
Expected growth rates of the eurozone
Statistically speaking, France recorded an economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter driven by household consumption, a little better than the expected 0.3%.
However, the Federal Statistical Office INSEE had revised the Baisse for the second quarter, with a minus 0.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
In fact, it is the fourth quarter that is most disturbing to economic experts.
Germany had a 0.5% growth over the same period.
A first high-level calculation of the entire euro area is expected at 11 a.m. and the EU Commission warns against the risk of a renewed recession.
Energy policy:
Facts should prevail over dogmas
If a topic is not to be dealt with on the basis of short-term considerations or emotions, it is certainly energy policy.
The availability and costs of electricity directly affect the purchasing power and the competitiveness of enterprises.
It is reasonable to take an election meeting to reflect on this issue and on the position of nuclear energy.
The debate will only bear fruit if it probes the overall economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French should find their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
Although 7 billion people are on this planet, demographic evolution is driving forward a doubling of electricity demand by 2050, it is not necessary to give up an enormous proportion of the world’s population on a vital element.
At the same time, it is necessary to reduce the shortage of fossil resources in order to continue to produce electricity continuously, without forgetting the compelling need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, a topic that has disappeared from the ecological debate, in order to combat climate change irregularities.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
Therefore, Germany continues to remain isolated in its decision to refrain from nuclear power.
This is not the case in Belgium, which is subject to its decision to find a substitute source capable of substitution, nor in Switzerland, which just intends to build only or nuclear power plants of the last generation.
Great Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name only a few countries, continue to pursue their projects with determination.
The United States, in turn, decided to join their park in another unit by re-establishing the Three Mile Island plant shut down after the nuclear accident.
Although the German model, based on renewable energy sources, is sometimes used as an example, reality contradicts the discourse.
The Berlin election will result in an increase in the price of electricity, an increased energy dependence on Russia due to the increased use of import gas, particularly of gas and coal power plants, an increase in CO2 emissions caused by gas and coal power plants.
The totality of these inconvenient effects will already be evident within a few months.
The case of Denmark gives rise to reflection.
Denmark, on the one hand, is a European leader in the field of wind energy, which accounts for 30% of its electricity, on the other hand, the country is one of the strongest users of coal and gas, alternately used with wind energy; on the other hand, its CO2 emissions and electricity prices are 65% and 50% higher than the corresponding European average.
Thanks to the permanence of our energy policy, our neighbours pay a 40% higher electricity bill compared to our French households.
As the energy price in the globalised economy is a key factor in competitiveness and in the stability of industry on national soil, French companies have an advantage because of the most favourable electricity in Europe.
Any significant reduction in nuclear power would therefore result in a strong increase in the energy price, which would allow the noble statements about the reindustrialization of our country and the defense of purchasing power to an illusion.
Surveys showed that this was a price that the vast majority of Frenchmen were just as willing to pay, as it showed resistance to the principle of this source of energy.
Let us remember that our country's energy policy has enabled us to build an industry with 125.00 direct and 410,000 induced jobs.
Due to its strong export character, it brings a large number of specialised small and medium-sized enterprises to the international markets and makes them creators of countless jobs.
If France decided to get out of nuclear power, the majority of these SMEs would fall victim to this, and the annual EUR 6 billion in capital goods and nuclear energy exports would be more and more reduced.
What electrician would order an ESP designed to function for sixty years if the decline of its producer is pre-programmed?
In order to solve the energetic equation, one must admit that there is just as little one as a devil’s work as there is a miracle to produce electricity.
The low CO2 solutions developed by Areva for the use of nuclear power and renewable energy testify to the complementarity of energy sources.
Maintaining the highest level of safety is an absolute imperative for nuclear power.
In France, we have a security authority that conducts uncompromising and transparent controls in existing works such as construction in Flamanville.
Their teams, who have made a name for themselves because of their professionalism, must be possessed of the safety idea.
Within 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious disturbances.
Only one, in Three Mile Island, has entered under normal operating conditions, so he went without consequences for humans and the environment.
In Chernobyl, the drama was challenged by reactor construction as well as indebted human failure.
In Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident of two natural disasters has never been caused by mass that caused the death of several ten thousand people.
The nuclear industry will draw its lessons from this accident just as it had done after the two previous ones.
As a result of this approach, as well as a cooperation between the safety authorities of the French and German operators and constructors of nuclear power plants, the EPR is a draft that will enable it to withstand such phenomena.
Since it is considered desirable among the electrical technicians to build a nuclear power plant, a construction stop in Flamanville would be a fabulous gift to the competition of Areva and EDF by allowing them to travel freely to the management position in the inevitable nuclear power development.
It is essential and legitimate to look for the best energy bouquet for our country, but it would be irrational to let emotions, dogmas and party maneuvers dominate a debate that will also determine our country's economic, social and financial situation.
Is immigration a burden or a chance for the economy?
The immigration policy led under Nicolas Sarkozy was criticised from many angles - overload of police, judicial and administrative bodies due to a policy subject to figures, compatibility of this policy with the status of a "land of human rights" as France itself had claimed.
Recently, the harassment of the official side against foreign students had marked the weekly views, the Minister of the Interior had occasionally announced (see Libération of 23 May) that France "does not need talents, masons or waiters from abroad".
But this policy was rarely analysed from an economic point of view.
There is a broad consensus on this issue between the right and the left.
On the right hand, Jacques Chirac's tone was struck, which had declared in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed people, including more than 2 million immigrated workers, would not be a problem for a country", from the left by Michel Rocard, who had set out in 1990, "cannot absorb the entire poverty of the world".
The only difference exists in the degree of flexibility.
The fear of the invasion of the national soil by the hoards of Polish plumbers was divided in 2005 from both right and left.
The immigrants were seen by both camps as a burden for the economy and the French society.
The only difference exists in the degree of generosity to which immigrants are to be opposed.
In his programme Francois Hollande is limited to banalities, which indicate that partnership development allows us to solve our "migration problems".
This idea of immigration as a burden, as a problem, may affect the elections; however, it is economically costly.
How economic experts Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron present us in a recently published work that summarizes the latest findings regarding immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 S.), exists among the specialists a broad consensus regarding the positive impact of the immigration flood on economic growth, wages and jobs in the immigration countries.
Reducing immigration would reduce growth and damage the labour market situation.
The fears about the influence of migrants are based on the notion that they threaten to substitute local workers, in particular the less skilled, by exerting pressure on their wages.
Experience shows, however, that immigrants are, in fact, far more complementary than domestic wage workers, as they focus on occupations in sectors which are unburdened by workplaces.
The low-skilled immigrants work in sectors where domestic wage workers are less attractive, the more qualified among immigrants work in dynamic sectors where training is not geared to the job offer.
Positive wage effect
Just as a surgeon would have difficulty working in a country where there is a lack of anaesthetics, so this complementarity also creates a positive effect between local and migrant immigrants on wages and national labour market situation.
Giovanni Peri has calculated this way that a 1% increase in immigration flood results in a co-related, long-term increase in real wages between 0.6% and 0.9%.
And this without regard to the fact that the diversity of ideas and economic growth introduced by immigrants (higher proportion of immigrants among American Nobel laureates; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants also contribute net to social systems, on average in the European countries at about 1% of the total budget.
For example, the World Labour Organisation estimates that a person immigrating to Germany at the age of 30 will, on average, make a net contribution to the public budget over his lifetime (income minus expenditure) of around 150,000 euros.
Nicolas Sarkozy wished to introduce the missing intersections "with the teeth" at the beginning of his mandate.
However, these said teeth, which the immigrants should deter, achieved exactly the opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, it remains to think through European democracy
Democracy is a valuable asset; it is also a sensitive asset.
The European continent should be able to remember for itself who, after its invention in Athens more than two thousand years ago, had caused the tragedy of the First World War, totalitarianism, Holocaust, gulag, but also Francos in Spain, Salazars in Portugal and the leader in Greece to pass.
Some would have believed that it was rich in exercising the right to vote, in the most direct way possible, to see democracy once and for all over their enemies overcome.
Since Napoleon, "the little one" has been known that it was a characteristic of mind control.
The right of universal suffrage, which is the necessary condition of democracy, is not sufficient and can just as well become the "repressive instrument" as expressed by the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot.
No, democracy requires far more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, separation and control of forces, a training, education, economic and social community spirit, a case law.
The crisis in Europe that we are in is an economic crisis, but it is equally a political and democratic crisis.
The change of attitude of the Greek True-Falsch referendum would in this respect have had a double revealing character: the need for a powerful return to politics, on the other hand, but also that of the disturbing feeling of their impossibility, their impotence.
This ambivalence should be considered obsolete.
Truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle have shifted today, and that Republican soldiers, or at least most of them, no longer aim in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain in order to insist on a success of the national referendum, which was organized in accordance with the needs and in the wrong order.
An excuse for the European sole ruler or a jump with a connected eye into the void of the nationalist withdrawal: a great choice for the citizen!
No, we want Hackebeil, but a collective task, completely justified and constantly, a election and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - there is no longer any knowledge of where to end the list - as there is only one crisis, and it is in Europe.
It is Europe as a whole, which bears witness to the dictatorship of markets and credit rating agencies, which suffers from its lack of power and its lack of solidarity.
It is all Europe that has been humiliated at international level.
There are concerns about the transfer of sovereignty towards Europe - it is all Europe that is gradually losing its sovereignty, and thus every one of the nations attached to it.
The urgency is to return the leadership of the European project to popular sovereignty.
For it is up to the Europeans to reduce the burden of their debt, to free themselves from markets and to start a future through investment.
The exit from the crisis has decisions at European level on the condition that can't be liked without total democratic legitimacy, without any doubt leading us to ruin.
After this proposal has been fought over for a long time by Jacques Delors and the Socialists, each of us today urges European economic governance to do so.
Agreed.
But without political integration and a stronger democracy - as it suggests to citizens - this would be a further folly and a further deadlock.
We need to take on a new stage of European construction.
In order to create the Republic in France, Republicans had to be "created".
The revolution of interests alone could not afford to do so.
This instruction remains valid.
We must form an economically better integrated Europe.
This can only be achieved by creating a more politically democratic Europe, a truly European sovereignty.
We need Europeans to create Europe.
"Contactless" chip cards become the general good
On Tuesday in Villepinte near Paris, the world trade fair for chip cards opens its doors in an optimistic attitude.
According to Eurosmart, 2011 should actually end with a 11% increase in worldwide sales of microprocessor chips (EC cards, SIM card phone), with more than 6 billion units sold.
The most important segment is the contactless technology, which enables payments on public transport or the settlement of purchases by simply holding the card to a reader.
Compared to the 320 million sold a year earlier, this year 460 million contactless chip cards were to be sold worldwide!
Its market share should continue to increase in 2012 (580 million expected units) and represent more than 10% of the global chip card market (6,925 million cards).
Europe is gaining contact-free payment to the ground after it has been behind the Asia-Pacific region for a long time.
Some 26 million Visa cards are already equipped with this functionality, and 75,000 payment terminals accept them.
In France, the beginnings are rather modest: only 400,000 contactless visa cards have been distributed.
However, consumer markets are making steam.
Carrefour has therefore issued 2.5 million contactless passport MasterCards this year.
In order to speed up, it is now necessary that banks equip their customers with these cards.
"Two major French financial institutions have committed themselves to systematically handing their customers bank cards fitted with contactless chip in the future," announces Gérard Nébouy, Director General of Visa Europe France.
Banks are testing payment by mobile phone
However, this is only a first step towards the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
The NFC (Near Field Communication) technology required for the execution of these transactions has so far been equipped with a drop in the percentage of devices.
"They're in default."
"But they should have a real upward development at least next year."
"We expect to sell 80 to 120 million units worldwide in 2012," explains Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks take initiative.
The Crédit Agricole announced yesterday the launch of a test run in Caen, which will run from December to next June.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and employees are to be equipped with a capsule that allows contactless payment.
The BPCE operates a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the Société Générale had also announced yesterday to prepare the market launch of an offer that allows their customers to pay contactless payment via mobile phone.
Terrorist Front understands itself, from Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the relations between al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb and the sect Boko Haram.
The long suspected relations between the terrorist group al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram seem to confirm themselves.
On Sunday, the Algerian Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs Abdelkoand Messahel himself confirmed that Algiers had now "acquired certainty".
"The way in which both organizations act and the relations of the intelligence services point to a clear cooperation," he explained without further detail.
Paris seems to be making a similar analysis.
The investigation of the kidnapping of two French people in the Niger last January has promoted interfaces on a daily basis.
The Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory, who were kidnapped in a restaurant in Niamey by supporters of the Aqmi, will have been killed at the same time as several of their kidnappers on the occasion of an operation carried out by the French special units.
French and Nigerian investigators want to find in the ruins at the site several phone chips that belonged to the terrorists.
Terrorist axis
The analysis of the controlled telephone calls leads to several interlocutors stationed in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France International (RFI), the investigators are particularly interested in the numbers of two interlocutors: a number leads to a Nigerian who had held himself for a long time in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram; the other leads to a man close to the Aqmi and the sect.
"This is progress, but one must undoubtedly wait for more clear evidence before one can speak of an operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Harem".
"But it's imaginable."
"For years now it has been known that the sect is referring to financial and intellectual support from institutions and that it is becoming increasingly active," says Nigerian researcher Kunle Amubo.
In recent months, these "support services" have become more and more apparent, as have the speeches and operational modes of Boko Harem, which now indicate the withdrawal of suicide agents and the use of ever more complex explosives carrying the same manuscript as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, to start with Washington, has since exerted pressure on Abuja to take account of the problems caused by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have in fact considered the grouping to be a community of Illuminates for a long time, which should not be given special attention.
Quick success
The Boko Haram, founded in 2002 in Maiduguri in the vicinity of a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist Iman Mohammed Yusuf - which means so much in Haoussa as "Western education is a shame" - is pursuing the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this mediocre region, the merger is rapidly experiencing successes.
It politicalizes itself and demands strict compliance with Sharia, while the activists attached to it are engaged in the fight against the godless central government.
The activists initially have churches, bars and authorities in the visor.
In 2009, Boko Haram’s activists were particularly active with their increased attacks against the Commissioners.
However, Abuja’s reaction is indifferent as usual.
The army surrounds the city, it counts 800 dead.
Muhammad Yusuf, imprisoned, is killed in prison.
As a result, the sect becomes more radical and leaves its castles in the north.
Last Christmas she became known for an attack in Jos, who demanded 80 lives, then another in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram is assigned the blame of a suicide crime that occurred in the secured police headquarters in Abuja - the first of its kind.
In August, the United Nations local seat will become a priority international target.
The formation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which should lead from Mauritania through Nigeria to Somalia, has been alarming all security experts since then.
While the Aqmi Mali and the Niger have operated on the Somalis of al-Shabaab in Kenya, Boko Harem seems to be a new threat in the center of the continent.
Last week, on a discussion with President Goodluck Jonathan in Nigeria, Alain Juppé warned Boko Harem and showed himself ready to do so."
The world by the Republican presidential candidates
Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry rival in simplification and ignorance of China, Iraq and the aid to Israel.
Can a crisis - weakened America lead a complex world with simple, not to say: simple ideas?
If you listen to the Republican presidential candidates like this, the voters could almost get this impression.
For a few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and their associates have repeatedly made their thundering statements and their statements on Außenpolitik, traditional republican focus.
About China, Iran and Israel's aid - often in no way supported - slogans.
With regard to the appointment of the "Grand Old Party", Mitt Romney threatened to quote the Chinese in front of the WTO and to present it to the leading topic in an America, which is the most attractive of all branches of industry to Asia.
Dumb walked when this was supposed to imply the initiation of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former ambassador to China under Obama and only candidate who seems to have a mature vision of Außenpolitik, has almost suffocated off the air with regard to his emotions of flattering gestures.
He had called for a hand-resistant but constructive exchange of talks with Beijing (also with Obama's current attitude).
But Huntsman will not be heard as he stagnates in the depths of the polls.
Reagan's Ebony
Romney had also praised military beatings against Iran if sanctions were to fail to stop the nuclear programme.
"If I'm elected, I'll stop Iran," he had tooned.
"If Obama is re-elected, they get the bomb."
He also promised Israel increased military aid and accused Obama of remaining guilty of this partner's obligations.
Entrepreneur Herman Cain, second highest-ranking candidate, has a shameful record ignorance.
Recently, he called on the Chinese military threat to counter, as Beijing "try to develop a nuclear force" - and seemed to be paying attention to the fact that China has been in possession of nuclear weapons since 1964!
Texan governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and calls for military beatings against Iran, is ready to take up the American army in Mexico against drug cartels.
The attack on torture against muttonous terrorists by Obama in 2009 was also supported by Cain, Perry and the candidate Michele Bachmann.
One is far from John McCain, the Republican candidate in 2008, an extra-political weight.
The current President-in-Office of the Council opposed that Reagan also had simple ideas and, despite all this, won the Cold War.
They call to mind that Obama himself was an amateur and had to give water in his wine, which concerned the topic of antiterror.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naïve dialogue with Iran, the premature withdrawal of his "boys" from Iraq, his inconsistency in Libya, which also gave him the reputation of weakness.
However, this opposition is not quite so inconvenient.
The population is more estimated to be the positive balance of national security under Obama, which bin Laden has turned off.
Since Iraq, it has been guarding against military interventions that lead to paralysis.
And Obama surprised more appropriately by arguing that America had to be rebuilt economically in order to revitalize its leadership position.
Nord Stream, new gate to Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipeline, which runs on the seabed of the Baltic Sea and connects the Western Europe directly with Russia, has been put into operation.
It is said to provide gas for an equivalent of 30 million households.
The Russian gas giant Gazprom wanted to commit this event with shine and gloria.
More than 500 invited guests, including four heads of state and government, attended the initiation of the new Nord Stream gas pipeline, which connects Russia and Germany directly under the sea level last Tuesday under orchestral sounding and with Feinschmeckerbuffet.
The German chancellor Angelika Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his counterpart Mark Rutte from the Netherlands have symbolically turned together the tax of the valve which transports the Russian gas into the western European network.
The new gas pipeline is intended to deliver 27.5 billion cubic metres of additional Russian gas per year through the first 1.224 km of pipeline that connects the Sankt Petersburg region with Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, to Western Europe.
A second pipeline allowing a total supply of 55 billion cubic metres of gas – the equivalent of French total consumption – will be completed by the end of 2012.
And you already have the possibility of building a third line on your own track.
For Gazprom, the timely and point-specific completion of this huge structure looks like a victory.
The project was highly controversial in Poland and the Baltic States.
The Nord-Stream pipeline will allow direct supply of gas to Germany, while avoiding any route through third countries (Poland or Ukraine) on land.
For this reason, these two countries lose little power: for them, it is now more difficult to put pressure on Russia by threatening to close access to Western European markets.
Warsaw, most engaged in the debate, had not returned to compare the Nord-Stream pipeline with a "new German-Sowietic Pact" in connection with the alliance between Hitler and Stalin for the purpose of the occupation of Poland in 1939.
This means that the issue is extremely sensitive politically.
Western Europe has gained even greater security of supply through its support for this Russian project.
However, this at the expense of decommissioning European energy, as the project broke between Western and Eastern Europeans.
Russia has completed its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich, Western countries that have strong gas consumption and have a low gas supply in just five years.
"This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new arteries that connects us in an organic way," said François Fillon during the initiation of the gas pipeline, pointing out the degree to which major gas contracts are also important by political and economic sides.
All of this explains the wide smile of the Gazprom managers represented in Lubmin in terms of gas supply.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also an excellent technology.
The underwater line consists of steel with concrete coating to protect it from ship anchors.
It rests on the sea floor, at about 200 m deep.
During its construction, mine fields dating from World War II had to be diverted.
"Some hundreds of mines had to be removed or destroyed cautiously," said Jens Müller, spokesperson of the Nord Stream company.
In addition, increased measures had to be taken to protect the fauna and flora.
The line is a long loop of metal, heavy as 242 Eiffel Towers, which has been interrupted by nothing over the entire length: neither by valves, nor maintenance stations.
A control platform was planned off the coast of Sweden, but the project managers did not, since the Sweden did not want to see a Russian state-owned society settled in a permanent manner at the level of its coasts.
"In the case of a havary, we close the gas transmission in less than a minute," explained Jens Müller.
In the case of a leak, the gas contained in the gas pipeline escapes into the air.
However, this case is considered to be little probable by the constructors, as the silences were estimated to be a resistance of one leak per 100,000 years.
The state control of the gas pipeline is ensured by both an underwater robot controlled for external observation purposes from a seagoing vessel and a device circulated inside the gas pipeline.
It has the shape of a cigar, measuring a meter in diameter, is introduced into the inner pipe and moved by the gas pressure.
After three full days of the forwarding by the line at a speed of 3 meters per second, the device provides the most accurate information on any deformations of the metal upon its arrival.
The gas pipeline has been designed to work for fifty years without having to undergo even the slightest repair.
The gas circulation is simply guaranteed by pressure.
This is 200 bar at the entrance, 100 bar at the exit point.
Five companies have united their forces to achieve this project.
However, the management remains in the hands of Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares.
In addition, the German companies E. ON and BASF (15.5%), as well as the Dutch Gas Union and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies have formed a group of companies called Nord Stream, which is responsible for the construction and operation of the gas pipeline.
It is based in Zug in Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom has then rented the entire capacity of its gas transport, on renewable twenty-years contract.
"Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, no matter how large the real transporter gas volume falls," explained Jens Müller.
The financing of gas pipeline construction was secured to 30% of shareholders as well as 70% by bank loans.
Total labour costs should amount to EUR 7.4 billion for both pipelines.
For example, for GDF Suez, the total investment amounted to 240 million.
The minority shareholders, however, are prepared to recover their expenses, as Gazprom alone carries the risk of liability.
The gas pipeline occurs on a sandy, forested coastline near Lubmin from the Baltic Sea.
The 4.5-metre high valves form the gas outlets.
Sensors measure the pressure, temperature and other metrics of the incoming gas before it is passed on to the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal has been supplied with a million cubic meters of Russian gas per sweeping hour.
With full capacity, this would be 3 million cubic metres per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine, a brand notebook.
About fifteen years ago, Moleskine was set up by an Italian company, and now wants to give Moleskine a new style to the letter.
It has a flair of adventure, at candlelight with writing hours.
The notebook of Moleskine is easily recognizable, with its black rectangular cover, its rubber band, the egg-colored sides, as it was over time old.
However, the Moleskine notebook, as one knows today, was created in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, which has its headquarters in Milan, decided at that time to bring a distinguished design notebook to the market.
Maria Sebregondi, then expert consultant of the company, is responsible for introducing the new product.
The notebook was inspired by an ancient production technique called Mole Skin, which is called a cotton bag, which is used, for example, for the cover of upholstery.
This kind of notebook was very popular among writers and travelers.
"Moleskine has revived an old and almost forgotten object, which was considered an icon of avant-garde artists until the 20th century," explains Maria Sebregondi, now brand-responsible at Modo Modo.
Success occurs.
Between 2006 and 2010 sales increased by 26% and with a sales volume of 12.7 million units established.
This is far from the usual production of the first years, in which only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine passes the Italian border and is exported in 70 countries, ranging from France to the United States.
It is difficult to make a phantom image of buyers, as the notebook also inspires businessmen as well as students and professionals.
Moleskine has the image of cosmopolitan, cultivated and open-minded customers.
The small Italian company, which had 12 employees in its beginnings, now employs over 100 employees and has two offices since 2008, one in Milan, the other in New York.
The company distributes its notebooks in bookstores, on Internet portals such as Fnac, in small boutiques of the city centers and understands how to enforce its identity.
"We have followed the Zeitgeist and his new writing needs, which, despite the upsurge of e-mails, exists," said Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural trait is accompanied by the development of Moleskine: Recently, the brand launched an exhibition called "Detour (Umweg)" in which architects and artists presented their own notebooks.
In August, on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival, the company also launched a cover with a Leopard pattern.
Moleskine benefited from his success and this cultural spirit of time and was able to diversify his products: bags, calendar, fillers, computer shells... The brand has the entire range of articles.
A success that makes the plan: In autumn 2006, Modo Modo was bought up by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, which today's Syntegra Capital, and thus opened up a new chapter in the history of Moleskine.
Why is the unemployment rate of disabled people at such a high level?
About 19% of disabled people are looking for a job.
Today the "15th week of work for the disabled" begins.
Despite a targeted public policy introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate in disabled people is always twice as high as the average mean: 19% against 9% unemployment of the total population.
Discouraging?
"No, says Éric Blanchet, Director-General of the Adaptive Association, who conducts the "week of work for the disabled."
"The progress made within fifteen years is significant."
"At that time, the unemployment rate was not double, but three times as high."
"However, there is still a great deal to be done."
However, it must be said that many obstacles remain for the disabled before they get a job.
It is more common for the elderly: 37% are over 50 years of age (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% of them do not have a Abitur and there are only 10,000 disabled people among the 2.3 million students with higher education.
In the end, long-term unemployment is also very widespread: 53% of the disabled compared to 38% of the total.
In short, there are so many criteria that make it difficult to re-enter work and which form the "core of the problem", says Christian Grapin, Director-General of Tremplin, a association founded in 1992, which helps companies to recruit disabled workers.
So much for the physical brakes.
Stay the unspeaked, the mental attitudes that, while certain, yet slow to develop.
A study conducted in April by the Association of IMS Entreprendre for the journal La Cité stated that the surveyed managers have "a weak level of knowledge regarding the disabled", which "is overrepresented" is "by persons in wheelchairs, psychologically or intellectually disadvantaged".
The result is that private companies with more than 20 employees still have a long way ahead of them to achieve the employment target of 6% disabled workers, which was set in a 1987 law.
These figures, which date back to 2008, refer to a quota of 2.6%.
"We are now at the 3% level," reports Pierre Blanc, Director General of Agefiph, the organization responsible for bringing in contributions from companies that do not comply with this law.
The proof: The number of "paying" establishments has been reduced as well as the sum of payments between 2007 and 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 Act, which provides for increases in contributions, created a strong pressure on companies, explained Pierre Blanc."
"But this improvement also brings true knowledge to the large groups of companies."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of firms between 20 and 49 employ disabled workers, while companies with 100 to 199 employees employ 82%.
Hazard: "What a happiness"
Before they offered the "Blue Tuesday evenings (20:45) the forehead, Eden Hazard and George's Leekens did not have their pleasure, which brought them the game of friendship.
It would be too far off to claim that there has been a secret understanding between them, but the image speaks symbolic volumes.
Side by side on the audience stage of the Stade de France sitting George Leekens and Eden Hazard could have well and gladly closed peace.
Five months after his spirited gesture against Turkey, the Belgian national trainer had harvested nothing but praise for his person.
"I am very pleased with Eden, his progress and the fact that he is Belgian."
"I want to look forward," assures the native Liller.
As for the contrast between his representation in club and nationalel"It is a unity that justifies everything."
"In Lille I am all year round, which is not the case in Belgium."
"It's time for me to start."
Hazard will come to Saint-Denis, led Friday evening against Romania in relation to the match against France, to finally "shine".
However, without neglecting the note of "consuming".
The French national team he has fired since the age of 7 years, and he led his victorious campaigns between 1998 and 2000.
"I was always supported," he confirmed.
This necessarily contributes to even more strengthening the "unique" character of this encounter.
So much in advance: "Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) will be there," he says.
"We just walked on the way."
"To be allowed to play means great happiness!"
On the other hand, it was possible to sound kind"Stolz".
"The pride of carrying a Galamatch."
"Stolz" also to confirm - in his capacity as "neighbors" - that France" has again become a team at a very high level", and that little more than a year after the trauma of Knysna.
"Laurent Blanc did a damn good job," he said enthusiastically.
Although Belgium will be missing in the next European Championship, the technician is very likely to see the plane sharing the blue (the French national) ... and towards Brazil in 2014.
"Our little Belgians are coming out, he stressed.
"We are planning one thing, the players are ambitious, they are hungry".
"They will notice this at the upcoming games".The game against France involved.
Portugal is very confident
The Portuguese team of Paulo Bento, with great optimism, opposes the replay against Bosnia (22:00) this Tuesday in Lisbon.
Both teams had missed the reality at the time of the play.
"At the end of these 90 minutes we will be a happy team and above all a happy country."
Paulo Bento already sees itself in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is not the slightest approach to doubt that "La Selecçao", his national team, for which he has been responsible since September 2010, will qualify for the 2012 European Championship.
For Portugal, this means only 90 minutes of happiness.
But there is a match to play and to protect an opponent, namely Bosnia.
In view of the play (0-0) on Friday in hell of Zenica, it seems obvious that the dice have not yet fallen.
Portugal clearly dominated the game for more than one hour, but the team was unable to print the thing out of the so important stamp that had taken the pressure from it.
"This is a good result, which, however, poses a certain risk, as we have not achieved an outpost door."
At home, however, in its brightly illustrious stadium de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced to strike themselves in front of an audience, which may also be at play, even if the game was, of course, announced as "very close", said the optimistic but clear Bento.
"We expect a very tight match, but are absolutely convinced that we can win the upper hand," said the 42-year-old Portuguese trainer.
"We still have a 50% chance to participate in the 2012 European Championship," however, the successor of Carlos Queiroz relativized.
The undecided on Friday in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to gain and win a goal.
A dispute can already satisfy the Bosnians, who also need a gate.
"This is a good result, but it is a certain risk, because we have not achieved an outdoor door," says Bento.
"We will compete against a team that has high technical qualities and has players with many individual qualities," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese would have preferred to exert maximum pressure on the Bosnians at the beginning, so as not to give them time to think."
A good idea, provided that it is actually implemented this time.
