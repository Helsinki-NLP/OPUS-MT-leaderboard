A Republican strategy to counter Obama's re-election
The leaders of Republicans justify their policies with the need to combat electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Center considers the latter to be a myth by confirming that the U.S. electoral fraud is rarer than the number of people killed by lightning.
Republican lawyers recorded only 300 cases of fraud in the US in 10 years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on turnout.
In this sense, these measures partially undermine the democratic system of the USA.
Unlike Canada, the U.S. states are responsible for the conduct of the elections in each country.
In this sense, since 2009, the majority of American governments have announced new laws that make it difficult for the registration or urn movement procedure.
According to the November 2010 elections, this phenomenon gained importance, in which 675 new Republican representatives could be registered in 26 states.
As a result, 180 draft laws were introduced in 2011 alone, restricting the exercise of electoral rights in 41 states.
The new electoral laws require voters to present a photo identification and proof of US citizenship.
In addition, these laws also reduce the time limits for early voting, the right to register as voters on the day of the election, and the right of citizens to vote for which there is a court act.
Before the 2006 elections, no U.S. state required the voters to show a photo identification.
Indiana was the first state to claim such a claim.
In 2008, the Supreme Court of the United States confirmed the constitutionality of the Act of Indiana.
The Republican authorities hastened to extend this practice to other countries.
Over the past two years, they have promoted draft laws in 34 states, forcing voters to present a photo identification.
It is important to note that, unlike Quebec, US citizens do not have a universal ID card such as the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of US citizens, that is 21 million persons entitled to vote do not have a photo ID issued by a government authority in their State.
In addition, five million new voters do not have such a ID in 2012.
However, often more than a hundred dollars are to be paid to get the required ID.
The new restrictions affect young people, minorities and people with low incomes disproportionately.
In fact, 25% of African Americans, 15% of people with incomes of less than $35,000, 18% of citizens over 65 years and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 years of age do not have the necessary photo identification.
This is enough.
Students who are regarded as voters who vote more and more for democratic candidates are not allowed to use their photo identification issued by their establishment in several countries.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of fishing or hunting associations to choose more strongly for the Republican side to use the map for elections issued by these associations.
Before 2004 no state for election requested proof of citizenship.
Arizona was the first state to make such a claim.
Since 2011, a dozen States have passed laws requiring voters to prove their US citizenship.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting hispanic votes.
For it is obvious that two of three Hispanic voters who prefer the democratic party.
In addition, Republican legislators promoted laws in eight states in 2011 that abolished the registration of voters on the election day.
In addition, you have limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to those voters who wish to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, the campaign to register voters in the general elections in 2004 helped to register about 10 million citizens.
Because the measures adopted since 2009 have reduced the share of registration of new voters by 17% compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican legislators have passed laws in five other states aimed at shortening the period for early voting.
For example, during the 2008 general elections in Florida, 33% of voters elected in advance were African Americans, although they represent only 13% of the voters of the state.
The same applies to the Hispanic population.
The latter accounted for only 11% of the voters, but 24% of the citizens who had elected in advance.
In contrast, the whites, which represented 76% of voters, accounted for only 46% of the voters who chose in advance.
Of course, democratic legislators and their followers have strongly opposed the adoption of laws restricting the registration of voters.
Several draft laws were blocked by the vetos of democratic governors.
The U.S. Advocate General has intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They could partially limit the damage.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states have passed laws requiring the presentation of a photo identification.
However, the newly introduced rules will undoubtedly make the exercise of the right of vote difficult in 2012.
The democratic critics advocate the party-political nature of the passed laws and see in them as a clear objective the influence of the results in the countries that are meeting for 2012.
A report from the Brennan Center of 2011 shows that those States that have passed these laws make up 171 out of the 270 votes required in the electoral panel to win the Presidency.
It is too early to confirm with certainty that these amendments to the electoral legislation will have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential elections in 2012.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on turnout.
In this sense, these measures partially undermine the democratic system of the USA.
Prostate cancer early detection: should the test be done or not?
In fact, the PSA test sometimes shows incorrect results, with false negative or false positive results that lead to unnecessary medical interventions.
This leads to greater hesitation of the men who have already been undecided for early detection tests.
Should the test be done or not?
We have obtained the opinion of two specialists.
The studies carried out in the USA have had numerous interference factors between the control groups, making it difficult to interpret these data and to make clear recommendations.
Another study, this time from Europe, concluded that there is a difference in the mortality of patients with and without early detection.
This study has also shown that the probability of metastasis formation after 12 years is 30 to 40% higher if no early detection has been performed.
Therefore, I recommend the test from the age of 50 years or 40 years, if you have a direct relative who has already had prostate cancer.
Men of African-American origin are also at higher risk.
The most important thing is to make the right decision as soon as a cancer is detected.
There are cancers that are aggressive and others that are indolent.
The patient must be truly made to understand the level of risk of his cancer by showing him the possible options in which prostate cancers can be left untreated if they do not affect the quality of life in the long term, and in these cases, one chooses to actively monitor the disease.
Today there is no treatment for many men who have recognized cancer, as their cancer is not aggressive and is no threat to their lives.
It is proposed that active monitoring be performed and that treatment be offered to them as the disease progresses.
With increasing accuracy, one determines the criteria for deciding who should be treated and who should not.
That's why I recommend doing the test anyway.
However, it is most important to talk to his doctor to determine if he should be performed or not.
In cooperation with the international society of urology, Movember has developed an instrument that enables the assessment of the advantages and disadvantages of the PSA test.

Prevention of disease
Unfortunately, there is no cure for preventing cancer.
Despite the progress made in research, the adoption of a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of suffering from it.
It is estimated that 30% of cancers may be prevented if everyone eats well and moves sufficiently.
"If there were no more smokers, this value would rise to at least 50%," says André Beaulieu, spokesperson of the Canadian Cancer Society.
However, it is assumed that about 10% of cancers are caused by inheritance.
Several are also completely unexplained.
For Canadian cancer society, the fight against tobacco dependence remains a priority, despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Smoking is responsible for 85% of cases of lung cancer.
It is also a risk factor for several other cancers.
It greatly harms people's health.
"Today there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec", regrets the speaker André Beaulieu.
Encouragement data: 10 years after the absence of the cigarette, the risk of dying cancer is reduced by half.
The weight
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, overweight and obesity also promote the outbreak of the disease.
They seem to increase the risk of breast, pygmy, pygmy, esophagus, pancreas and uterine cancer.
"Research shows that regular physical activity protects against cancer of the influenza throughout the life," he adds.
Diet
The organization also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In too large a quantity, it increases the risk of suffering from influenza or measles cancer.
Wrests should also be avoided.
Conservation of meat by smoking, drying or salts may lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"The latter can damage the body cells and lead to the development of cancer," he explains.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the relationship between vitamin additives and cancer.
However, your investigations are not complete at present.
According to the Canadian cancer society, the studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
While one study has found the reduction of the risk of prostate cancer, another has shown an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has also not been clearly demonstrated.
In addition, Mr Beaulieu stressed the importance of talking to his doctor about his concerns and family prejudice.
"The conduct of an early detection test does not lead to cancer."
The Higgs Boson analyzes
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs boson has caused a certain appearance last summer, and this for good reason.
In fact, it is believed that this boson is involved in nothing less than the mechanism responsible for the mass of all objects in the universe.
And finally, it is the last particle, whose existence is predicted by the standard model - our best or "most false" explanation of nature and the behaviour of matter - but has not yet been observed empirically.
But for the physicists it is not yet completely certain that it really is the Higgs.
We know without the shadow of doubt that we have a real new particle, and that it is very similar to the Higgs boson predicted by the standard model.
In addition, this seems to be confirmed by new data presented this week at a major Kyoto physics congress, but there is still no data to be completely secure about it.
Let's still assume that this is really the Higgs, as there seems to be only a small risk of being deceived, and let's look at what it is about.
There is a necessarily inevitable law in this world that causes two objects to not be present in the same place at the same time.
It's not possible to violate this rule - and don't try it too strong as you get hurt.
For even if particle physics is a really strange world, it turns out that it also has such a law: the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time when they are in the same "quantity state", with this "state" largely consisting of some of their characteristics.
From this point of view, the physicists divide the particles into two categories.
In a corner are the good citizens, who are called Fermione and likely obey the Pauli principle.
And in the other, the Bosons, an evil band of anarchists who are not holy - certainly not this principle, which means that they can in fact be in the same place at the same time.
These bosons, according to the website The Particle Adventure of the Berkeley laboratories (which by the way is absolutely amazing) are divided into two groups: the mesons we are not being treated here and the "power particles" by which the great forces of nature spread and with which the Higgs boson would somehow be related.
But it must be stressed here that these bonons are not all such exotic creatures as one might think.
If you are able to read this chronicle, then only thanks to a boson of extraordinary banality: the photon or the "light particle", which is the "bottom" of the electromagnetic force.
In fact, if a particle accelerates with an electric charge or changes the direction, the electromagnetic field is "distorted" at this location, in about a pebble that was thrown into a pond.
This "disruption" creates an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon and thus one of the bosons "carriers of power".
Stable Field
The same applies to the Higgs boson, with the difference that another field, the Higgs field, must be "distorted" so that this boson shows itself.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the pathogen has to achieve very high energies, a little comparable to a frozen pond, whose surface could be shattered only by a very large rock.
Therefore, a huge particle accelerator such as the CERN is required - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring with a size of 27 km! - to achieve such energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again helpful to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
In fact, they are not all particles and not all materials interacting with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do this, but others don't - for example, a sheet of paper would never hold on to the refrigerator by itself.
And likewise, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those who do it have a mass, while the others (like the photon) have no mass.
For what can all these research now be "good", asks Ms. Plamondon?
For science, they are used to review the standard model (SM), and they also enable physicists to investigate in detail all the deviations between the observations and the predictions of the SM.
By the way, there are numerous physicists who hope that such deviations will be found, as the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physics" and stop some holes of the model.
One has to say that the latter still has great defects, as it does not explain the gravity (ups!) and the dark matter that forms about 80% of the matter of the universe (renewed ups!).
However, such deviations have not yet been found in CERN.
Impact
The impact of these research on the general population is more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there is no such thing.
By the way: in the early 1960s, the pioneers of the laser in the Bell labs did not suspect that their work would trigger such a revolution.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle - who worked in the Bell Labs, in which the laser was invented in the 1960s, and who in 1962 himself developed the first continuous stroke laser (the first one was pulsated) - has already said that at the beginning the laser was considered a "laboratory".
Imagine...
In addition, applications can also arise from all the instruments surrounding research.
For example, Willard Boyle developed a small light sensor in 1969 during his work in the optics.
Although it was not the original purpose, today this sensor serves as an "eye" for all digital cameras worldwide and brought it the 2009 Nobel Prize for Physics.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will inevitably change our lives, but it means that you can never really know it...
Palliative care - the best way to die
Quebec has recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life with its "Deathing in Dignity" committee.
The debate must be resumed shortly, although a draft law is being prepared.
However, much remains to be done in this important subject area.
Le Devoir has tried to take a closer look at this.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his apartment in the Montérégie.
The prostate cancer, which devoured him, had left him a period of two years.
"They gave me five years to live, I made seven years," he said half-heartedly, lying in his bed in the house for palliative care Victor Gadbois in Beloeil, where he arrived the day before.
"However, it's always a shock, you can't be prepared for it," he says.
The illness is doing its job: an immeasurable weakness prevents him from going to the toilet alone and even eating himself.
Sitting at the table in front of a delicious lunch, he agrees to be able to help with the food.
He can even smile and talk to the strangers who are busy around him, bring him his medications, and offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is to heal my diarrhea, since this is humiliating," he tells me.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this evil.
"In the course of our life, we learn that a man pees on the stand," says Pierre Brodeur, psychologist in Victor-Gadbois's home.
Returning to childhood is unacceptable humiliation for certain persons.
"This depends on the person's ability", he says, taking a step backwards.
For, according to several people working in the palliative care, major events take place in the midst of these retreats.
The patients who are sent to the palliative care home Victor Gadbois, all suffer from cancer.
You have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage, doctors and nurses who take care of them no longer have so-called "healing" care.
For Mrs. A., 89 years, the worst fear of dying is "consciously and by suffocation".
But through the illness, I really got to know my children.
"I have good children," she adds.
"I have no more desires in life," she says before she accepts that she is put on a mask that helps her to breathe.
In the next few days, she is still expecting a last visit from her son, who is coming from Italy.
In the home Victor Gadbois, you can offer a group of volunteer body care and food intake assistance.
The palliative care is then used if there are no other possibilities.
To make dying more pleasant.
In Quebec, there is a bed for palliative care for 11,700 people.
That's very little if you take into account that one day we'll all die.
Here life will continue under the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the physicians of the home.
Both on the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
A mouth care with Brandy or Pepsi is granted to the dying as desired.
Diabetics should no longer control their blood sugar levels.
And death is part of everyday life.
Last night we served Mr. X a beer that died during the night.
This morning his son will drink the beer at the feet of the deceased.
"We help relatives and patients alike," reports Nathalie Savard.
In the home Victor Gadbois is not a day like the other.
In addition to an old 93-year-old man who enjoys the last family meeting in the yard and is well supported by his pillows, while invoking his honor, a 36-year-old young man dies, surrounded by his parents, his wife, and his two little children, tragically after trying to survive everything.
"For six months three to five beds have always been occupied with cancer patients less than 45 years of age," says Dr. Christiane Martel alarmedly.
53% of the patients assigned to Victor Gadbois's home come from their home, 47% come from the hospital.
The problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians have no access to palliative care, i.e. care to relieve the suffering of patients when the latter have reached the final stage of their life, both at home, in the hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as Victor Gadbois's home and the Society for Local Palliative Care in Montreal, are more or less specialized in caring for cancer patients.
Just this great inadequacy in Quebec's health care ensures that several doctors specializing in palliative care face the adoption of a law to regulate death aid and assisted suicide with concerns.
Since October, a manifesto has been in circulation signed by prominent personalities of palliative care such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe in order to demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec's health system is not capable enough to ensure that all the right to high-quality palliative care is guaranteed before you accept going to death aid.
Just a short time ago, she says, I saw a patient who had been in the emergency for 14 days without taking measures to relieve her.
I fear that the patients will only want to die because they do not receive adequate health care.
At the same time, several oncologists treat their patients in spite of severe predictions until the last day.
The chances of survival of Hélène Richard were already minimal when she stopped a difficult chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was going to stop the treatment, she answered to me that she was sorry I gave up the fight, she told me.
However, she told me that I was in the end!
No omnipotent care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who have asked to die thank the care staff that it has not allowed this wish after their pain has been eased by a team of palliative care.
However, it must be clearly stated that palliative care is not omnipotent in pain treatment.
According to Elsie Monereau, Head of Palliative Care of the Society of Domestic Palliative Care of Greater Montreal, 8% of patients do not address pain treatment.
At the end of life, the doctors often resort to the terminal sedation that results in either sporadically or permanently inflicting the patient until the time of his death.
We can no longer do as if we do not perceive this side of suffering.
Patients without pain relief will increasingly have the opportunity to access this terminal sedation.
Patients whose pain is not eased all say the same sentence: "I want to die."
But that doesn't necessarily mean, "I want you to put me to sleep," but "I want my pain to be eased."
The implementation of this report was possible due to a journalism scholarship from Canadian health research institutes.
Real estate scandals in Quebec
Officials of the road construction office, companies of the main construction industry, money creators of political parties and specialists of the Italian Mafia tell each day what they know about a great "system" in which construction industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and mafioso are wrapped.
An "industry" which was very expensive for Quebec taxpayers, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It's strange how the system has broken down ever since you took drastic action," says Jacques Duchesneau, MP in Quebec, and former head of Montreal Police.
The scandal was detected by him on the basis of an in-depth investigation of the misdemeanours related to the road construction contracts in Quebec, which the Prime Minister had only reluctantly agreed to.
The "Duchesneau Report" established a direct link between industry, secret financing of parties and bribery of officials.
"Since the start of the investigation in 2010," he stressed, "the Ministry of Transport alone had saved a billion dollars in the contracts," for some had their instincts to get their share!
The Charbonneau Commission "has already fallen down two mayors," he adds, hoping that she will "show the tactics behind the individuals".
A permanent anti-corruption unit launched in 2011
The permanent anti-corruption unit launched in 2011 also makes great efforts with its troops on accountants, investigations and analysts of the government.
In addition, the police officers of the "Marteau-Truppe" that since 2009 has caused Montreal's "channelization cartel" to proceed in the artificial inflatation of the contracts with arrearsing...
In the last few weeks, she has conducted a series of house searches and has charged with fraud and corruption against local mandates such as Frank Tampino and Richard Marcotte, the mayor of a suburb.
The next one on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his office as mayor of Laval, the third largest city in Quebec.
He is suspected of having repeatedly received lubricating fees in exchange for public contracts.
By the way, engineers of the Montreal Road Construction Office, as well as entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito, were specifically accused.
The latter encouraged the Commission to explain the functioning of the "system" for the receipt of public contracts.
For several years, he himself paid 3% of the value of the contracts received in Montreal to an intermediary associated with the Mafia, who transferred the money to the Union Montreal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
In the 2000s, Mr. Zambito played his hand everywhere by giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially the liberals who were then in power.
He also managed to organize an illegal fund for the former liberal vice-president Nathalie Normandeau.
Channeling contracts, the costs of which were artificially inflated
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked smoothly.
The former construction engineer Gilles Surprenant described this in detail before the Commission: in ten years he received gifts from the construction company, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants and ice hockey games, as well as bribery money of $736,000 as a contribution to channelling contracts which he artificially inflated.
Other road construction officials have admitted that they have been lubricated by artificially inflating the invoices with false additional benefits by 30-40%.
In addition, an organizer of the mayor's party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay that he had deliberately missed a shadow budget that filled his checkouts with black money.
As a result of these revelations, Mr Tremblay resigned at the beginning of November, which plunged Montreal into a serious crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of Montreal's first delegates who hit the alarm.
As mayor of the Rivière-des-Prairies district, in the east of the island, she was opposed to selling a municipal property from 2010 onwards, which was bought for 5 million dollars and sold for 1.6 million in the booming real estate market.
70% Black money in the election campaigns
The investigation, which is finally carried out, says that it "stirs on a thread that allows it to understand the functioning of the system of ants that is underimmigrated in order to stop the evil and incite the debtors".
She says that the procedure is "painful, but positive".
However, we are in the process of cleaning up the wound, but we need a unit of investigation only for Montreal, as well as a supervision to prevent the return of questionable practices.
How to clean.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau, on the other hand, notes that "officers have stolen several hundred million dollars," but above all, is thinking about the role of "mandate bearers who are in the picture about the tactics" if they were not involved in fraud!
Based on a 70% black money share in financing the election campaigns in Quebec, he jokes: "I was told that this was only a weak ban on reality."
The Quebec government proposes limiting donations to parties to $100, which would not change the situation: "As long as election spending is not strictly limited, black money in politics will be in circulation."
He recommends a complete revision of the public procurement system and the funding of the parties: "We can't fall deeper; by working on things with courage, we can rebuild the house on a more solid basis with more controls and laws."
If this story damages Quebec's international reputation and Montreal's, Mr. Dukesneau invites those who laugh at taking a look at their own backyard...
"PSG is not Barcelona FC!"
In this season you have adopted a new measure with PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
It can be explained by a personal insight, but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Great players have come.
Every day I make progress on their side.
The technical staff gave me a lot too.
These elements encourage me to improve my level on a daily basis.
And in a game this is even easier.
In football everything goes very fast.
But I don't break out in enthusiasm.
Since my beginnings in the centre of preparatory training of INF Clairefontaine up to my season at Saint-Etienne, I have always made gradual progress.
They thus take advantage of Carlo Ancelotti's competition...
The new entrances of this summer are used to wearing games very high levels.
You also know that each training unit is crucial.
This means that a player like me who has to offer forehead and wants to give his best.
By the way, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot about my position.
He is supported by co-trainers like Claude Makele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the right person for the task?
Of course.
Ancelotti inspires respect for all technicians.
In the Ligue 1 there is currently no comparable person, and he is one of the best trainers in Europe.
He looks back on a rich experience and has won many titles with respected clubs.
He was in contact with big players.
I think he'll win more titles in Paris.
In January, I had an encouraging conversation with him.
At that time I had just recovered from a series of injuries.
The confidence he has placed in me is also an explanation of my achievements.
What do you think about the first part of the PSG season?
In the Ligue 1 Lyon took the place of the top rider.
But we're in a state of mind.
One of our most important goals is the Champions League: in this way we qualified for the eighth finale.
What is the aim of the association in this competition?
We'll try to get as far as we can.
Everything is possible from now on.
However, we will have to speak our word against very good European teams.
First of all, we want to become first of our group in front of Porto, so that we can play the replay of the eighth finale as a home game.
Can the PSG become a major European association in the short term?
He already has the budget for it...
In order to become a major European association, Paris must win titles and make a name for itself in the long term.
This is not the case today.
In financial terms, the PSG gives itself the means to take concrete forms of this project.
Would it be a great failure not to win the title in the Ligue 1 as it was in the last season?
Of course, this would be a great disappointment.
This year we are really at the heart of singing this title.
We were close in the last season.
In May we were disappointed because we were strong enough to take the victory.
We finished the season with a very strong performance.
We finished with 79 points.
Normally you should be master with 79 points...
But another team, Montpellier's, scored an even better season.
I think this year is the right thing to do.
Although the big teams like Marseilles, Lyons or Bordeaux ring around the title, I believe we have the stuff to win it.
Do you think the media expect too much from the PSG?
In view of what has been invested and the players we have, it is normal for much of us to be expected.
We accept this completely.
However, if we win at a home game against Troyes 4-0, and you still find something that can be blamed on us, it is certainly a bit frustrating.
You wonder what people are still expecting.
We could never win every weekend with 4-0.
We're not Barcelona FC!
We're trying to draw up a game concept.
A team builds up with time.
We have proven strength in the Champions League.
Look at Manchester City, a club that has not been able to qualify for the eighth finale for two seasons, and which has also made huge expenditures!
With regard to the invested sums, you were believed to have a 15-point break!
This meant that our opponents and the French Championship would be disregarded.
Lyon and Marseille, which were not good in the last season, were "boosted" by this new PSG.
This shows that the Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope in May we will be the smiling winner and tell us that despite all the difficulties we have finally won.
The PSG seems to be entirely dependent on the services of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
So much the better you talk about a Zlatan dependency.
That means that Ibrahimovic is powerful and shoots many goals.
That's why he came and he proves he's the star of Ligue 1.
All the way he played, he has shown himself to be a great player and a world star.
Within the team we respect both the player and the person.
He also respects the people who surround him.
What he did is really extraordinary.
This encourages the others to improve their level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders worldwide, also enables all others to make progress.
How did you experience the 2012 EM with the French national team?
It's a disappointment.
It was my heart to participate in this EM.
Unfortunately, my injury has prevented me from beating out some game time.
I've seen things there that I've been strengthened.
Today I manage to make good games in the national team.
This has been my hope since my baptism with the "bleus".
From what has happened in Ukraine, we have drawn our teaching, and today we must display exemplary behavior.
What opinion do you have about the first months of Didier Deschamps at the top of the "Bleus"?
He has achieved promising results.
We have a good position in the qualification group for the World Cup.
The National Trainer is strict, is close to the players and encourages them to win.
Like Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to make a comparison.
Blanc had achieved his goal by qualifying us for the EM.
I hope Didier Deschamps will lead the "Bleus" to Brazil.
Is that an incitement game forced on 16 October in Spain (1:1)?
This game gave us confidence.
Everyone's been working for everyone else.
Before this meeting in Spain, I have never experienced a similar game in my career.
With Bitcoin you can pay and sell without a bank
The opposite of the current monetary exchange on the basis of central banks, identified transactions and handling fees between the parties involved.
Moreover, as is so often the case in these technologies, a political vision is tangible: the conviction that the current monetary system designed by bank monopolys leads to financial crises.
In fact, the bitcoin invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) is both a virtual currency (but in dollars, euro, etc.) and a protocol for secure exchange such as BitTorrent, which allows for the direct exchange of files.
About 200,000 transactions have already been recorded with 15,000 computers in the network.
Some thousand websites accept Bitcoin as a donation or as a means of payment.
After Bitcoin's course reached a peak of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, it fell to 2 dollars five months later before he recovered today at around ten dollars (the courses are listed on the Bitcoincharts.com website).
Nothing particularly impressive in comparison to world trade in real currencies or financial products.
Nevertheless, the European Central Bank (ECB) has shown interest in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
It describes Bitcoin as "the virtual currency with the greatest success", "in competition with the dollar or euro" and "like the traditional currencies".
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies such as the "Credits" used to advance in a video game that you can win or buy through games (and sometimes also exchange back).
The social network Facebook has also developed such a system.
However, each time trade is controlled and processed by a central authority.
With Bitcoin, all network nodes are simultaneously depositors of the invoice book, auditors, money issuers as well as buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users actually takes place between two e-mail addresses in the form of an e-mail.
With the difference that the user can choose a different address for each payment, which ensures anonymity.
A number of related data are electronically signed by a double encryption system.
In this way, the network can verify the authenticity of the transaction.
With the help of the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the traded bitcoins are present in the accounts of the public accounts distributed throughout the network.
The crucial step is to include this new transaction in this book.
This happens via a mathematical task that is started on the computers, with the winner who is a kind of temporary central banker having the privilege of adding this additional line.
This is a partitioning of the file, i.e. the conversion of a large file into a shorter and unique electronic fingerprint.
The computers "take" the new transaction and add a number to it before the whole thing is "cracked".
The aim is to find the number that gives a special fingerprint (many zeros at the beginning).
When this number is found, the other nodes can check effortlessly if it is the right one.
The transaction is therefore permanently linked to the chain of all other transactions, and any modification would change the fingerprint.
If a user wants to pay with the same money twice very quickly (less than 10 minutes) for fraud, only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network and the other will remain unplugged, since both have different fingerprints.
The computer that solved the task receives 50 bitcoins.
In order to prevent inflation, this reward is halved regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
The bitcoins in circulation are therefore limited to 21 million, but can be shared up to a hundred millionths, leaving a certain amount of room...
In addition, the difficulty of the task will be increased with any improvement of the calculation performance.
The life of the network has already had heights and depths.
The websites that provide services for bitcoin were attacked and the bitcoin deposits were stolen.
"The vulnerability used does not concern the actual protocol," assures Pierre Noizat, who has just introduced Paymium, which is a company for payment with real money and uses the network Bitcoin.
The ECB also reports on the possibilities of money laundering through this anonymous service.
However, cash also has these shortcomings.
Important actors such as Wikipedia refuse this kind of donation.
They are accepted by others like the blog platform WordPress.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron from the Weizmann Institute in Israel analyzed the invoice book and showed that almost 80% of bitcoins are not in circulation.
In November, a "mega lock sale" was launched.
"Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged," says Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, who converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of a book on this currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
His system Paytunia corresponds to a credit card (with real money) or contactless payment with a mobile phone, but uses Bitcoin to validate the transactions that are cheaper by doing so.
In addition, the holder manages his identity and can therefore remain anonymous.
The system can easily be implemented at dealers, and the latter does not need to install new terminals or computer programs.
You just have to provide an address that can be "photographed and recognized" by a phone, says Pierre Noizat, who assures that he has thousands of users.
There is a general trend in which hierarchical systems are covered in favour of more horizontal systems.
"It will take some time for Bitcoin to get through, but 2013 could be a turning point," he predicts.
The ECB, by the way, provides in its report for the re-evaluation of the various risks that are considered to be high today in the event of a success of this currency.
We moved from Afghanistan.
And after that?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapsa and Surabi).
NATO and the US are expected to follow by the end of 2014.
It is time that the Afghan army again seized the possession of its territory, and that the Afghan people decide their future without expecting everything from us.
In particular, we have punished Afghan peasants by considering them as terrorists.
And ourselves with our 88 soldiers killed, as well as those who were injured and hated.
The Taliban consists of foreign extremists, former leaders who have fled to Pakistan, but often also of farmers who refuse an armed foreign presence, such as at the time of the Soviets.
They want to defend their centuries-old and archaic traditions, even though jihadists, Pakistani, Arabs, Uzbeks and Tajiks have joined them.
Tolerated, sometimes supported by the local insurgents, the latter will no longer be there when the Western countries become more discreet.
The deduction of the French troops from the base in Nijrab, which I observed from a hill planted with almond trees, financed with French loans, was done properly.
The truck and tanker convoys flown over by helicopters have reached Kabul without being attacked.
As of the end of 2014, there will no longer be a flow of Taliban into Kabul.
Since its irresistible advance from 1994 to 1996, the conditions have changed.
At that time Kabul was empty and the country was overlaid by the war due to the struggles of the various insurgent groups.
Her takeover of power was then regarded as a sort of liberation and return to security.
Afghan women have paid the prize for the obscurantism of farmers overwhelmed by the organization Al-Qaida, but their situation has not improved to this day.
Former Mujahedin, the Afghan government and current Taliban have the common desire to keep women in a subordinate position.
The most important personalities of the anti-Soviet war came back into power in 2001.
They have turned into business makers by confiscating government land to sell it as a building land to refugees from Iran and Pakistan, thus benefiting from the massive American award of subcontracts.
They were in disrepute, and most of them were not themselves involved in the struggles.
As I have heard in the campaigns, people want a government that is not composed of thieves.
Many young people want to leave the country, just like those who have been able to make use of American benefits: capital escape is considerable.
The young people are filled with the war and its ideologies.
During their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they have had contact with the modern world and have enjoyed its benefits.
About 65% of the population is under 25 years of age; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, which is one fifth of the total population.
In the cities the state schools are full of girls like boys.
These young people, who do not want to return to the obscurantism of the former parties or to the corruption of certain managers, will have to be provided with jobs.
All, including the armed parties, are possessed by mobile phones; television with its Turkish series representing a modern world is watched everywhere.
An army is now available.
Are the authorities under whose command they are to be regarded as legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already trying to restore the militias in the province that will escape the power of central government.
Afghanistan, the country of the mountains with strong local identities should have benefited from a certain decentralisation of the example of Western nations, but by abolishing the office of the Prime Minister, which had existed since the Constitution of 1964, the US wanted to make it a centralized state with a strong presidential force.
President Karzaï does not want foreign controls, especially on the occasion of the April 2014 elections.
However, his country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and long before.
Industries have not been rebuilt, functional dams are not present and important irrigation systems have not been repaired.
Everything is imported; except fruit and vegetables, nothing is produced.
The private initiative will be given priority.
In a country based on war for 30 years, state control of infrastructures would have been necessary.
The rumor was spread that Afghanistan had immense land resources.
This further increases the impression that the Western countries were only on site to empower themselves of this.
Without energy to process the iron or copper ore on site, or without means of transport for an export via the mountains, no mining is possible.
The Chinese have almost left the copper mine of Mes Aynak, let the international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) make their excavations on the huge Buddhist site and remain the most important employers of the province.
One day it will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan to restore normal relations, largely dependent on imports and exports.
The French Battle Forces' withdrawal was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the continuation of traditional assistance: the Girl and Boyrymnasia, the Institute of French at the universities, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, a service "civil-military actions" of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), which was discontinued in 2012, has carried out numerous non-profit works and measures for the restoration of agriculture in dozens of mountain villages and has been carried out by a small French non-governmental organisation to try to "gain hearts and spirits" and to achieve the impossible task of reconciling aid and offensive actions.
This work, for which a large number of local workers were needed, has helped to suppress the uprising: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increase agricultural areas.
After military spending, what souvenir do we leave behind of two billion euros?
A much more modest budget will help to improve local living conditions, which are often very hard in these valleys at an altitude of more than 2,000 metres.
The Embassy has received dozens of written requests for small agricultural projects from municipalities of the Province of Kapisa.
In order to free farmers from the uprising led by foreign groups, which according to their own statements is their desire, it would be necessary to continue to achieve lower, well-controlled and direct civilian assistance for their benefit.
A Constitution with the Brestang in Egypt
It's a new poker game by President Mohammed Mursi.
While Egypt has decided to put everything on a map in relation to the constitutional declaration that temporarily grants it the unlimited power to remain more than ever divided.
To the surprise of all, he announced on Wednesday that the constitutional assembly would adopt its final version the next day.
Just a week ago, the head of state had granted this plenary two additional months for the completion of his work.
Egypt has now been based for almost two years on a provisional, multiple amended text, which weakens institutional stability and leads to legal confusion.
This new initiative has only provided for an even greater division of the country.
For his opponents, the president persists in his "autocratic delirium" by continuing to "break his word" and "step right with feet".
On the part of its supporters, it is assured that it is a way to end the institutional and political crisis as soon as possible and to speed up the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 14 days.
A very short period of time, which forces the brothers to refrain from their project to explain the text for section to the Egyptians.
For the President, it is also a way of reinventing his public and democratic legitimacy while protesting throughout the country.
After confirming in an interview with the American Week Show Time, Muhammad Mursi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote in favour.
In particular, the Egyptian people, with this reluctance to an over-voicing vote, will be put to an ultimatum: "Either vote for my draft or I hold the unlimited authority", the latter, after the adoption of the Constitution, is supposed to end.
85 mostly Islamist members of this constitutional assembly adopted the text yesterday in a strange atmosphere.
The majority of the Liberals have failed to comply with the call.
Shortly before the Constitutional Declaration in mid-November, they turned away because they felt that they were unable to apply their views.
Representatives of human rights organizations, religious minorities or civil society have acted equally.
In order to achieve the decision-making capacity, 11 persons were added in every hurry yesterday morning, deputy members.
Some are very close to the Muslim brothers.
It is not surprising that the articles were mostly adopted unanimously.
The commentators found it entertaining, by the way, that the only difference of opinion of the day... came to the fore during the time of prayer, as some members of the body believed that the pendulum clock of the constitutional assembly was not accurate.
The text, which was adopted last night, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, which drew all attention to itself, remains the same with that of the 1971 Constitution and states that "the principles of Sharia are the main source of law".
The Salafist parties, for which the establishment of Islamic law is an important demand, had the hope of replacing "the principles" with "the rules", which would have made more stringent application possible.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been changed is proof of their good will and respect for the other members of the Egyptian society.
"Sacredness" returns the liberals, who only regard this as propaganda strike.
According to them, Islamisation of the Constitution is done through other articles.
They are particularly aware of Article 220, which gives the University of Al-Azhar an advisory function, in particular with regard to the verification of conformity with the laws of Sharia.
According to Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier, this is alarming because "the people who are invited to an opinion have not been elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
Here you can see the first signs of theocracy".
The fears of the liberals are also fed by the fact that the next rector of this university should be far less moderate than the current one.
"There is no concrete religious commitment at present.
With this Constitution, we remain within the framework of the bourgeois state.
Most lawyers who have worked on this text are not Ulema, but academics who have partly been trained in the French system," says Alexis Blouet, who writes a doctoral thesis on Egyptian constitutional transition.
He acknowledges, however, that "there may be an ambiguity with regard to Article 220, since the terms used are contrary to the religious vocabulary.
One refers here in particular to the "Fiqh" [Islamic case law, Ant. d. Red.].
And in the future, the question could be raised as to the extent to which civil judges are competent to decide."
In addition to its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday is strongly criticised by the far-reaching powers it grants to the President of the Republic.
The Muslims argue that they are significantly reduced compared to the former regime.
Another point of dispute: the powers of the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the examination of the defence budget is presented not to Parliament but to a national defence council.
Similarly, there will be no ban on civil proceedings in military courts, as the associations have called for the defence of human rights.
The latter also share their fears as to the text which they consider to be a threat to freedom.
The blasphemy is being maintained, and insults are now forbidden, which could have serious consequences for the right to freedom of expression, especially for the press.
In addition, no more articles refer to the protection of women, stresses Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
In your opinion, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by Article 36.
This word was not included in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian President had to express himself on television last night, demonstrations are planned for this afternoon.
The supporters of the Head of State will march on Saturday.
In Israel Ukrainian tourists await holy places, the navel of the world and a sea of Sole
The praised land combines in itself the glory of Bible truths, modern comforts and unspoiled nature.
AIF calls you the five most important reasons for a visit to Israel.
Contradict the Holy Places
Visit the river Jordan where Jesus was baptized.
It means that all who bathe in this river receive God’s blessing.
Galilee is the place where Jesus accomplished his miracles: the conversion of water into wine on a wedding celebration, the going on the water, the stopping of the sea storm and the fishing.
Here, too, Jesus appeared to his disciples after the resurrection.
Most sanctuaries, however, are found in Jerusalem.
Believers are taking the path of suffering or the crossroads of Jesus Christ (on Latin: Via Dolorosa).
The path begins at the Roman fortress of Antonia, Pretorium, where the court was, and leads through the streets of the old town to the tomb church on Mount Golgotha, where the crucifixion site, the anointing stone and the grave of Jesus are located.
Here, according to Christian opinion, is the navel of the world, symbolizing the salvation of mankind.
The monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem stands at the place where, according to a Christian legend, the tree from which the cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus grew.
In Jerusalem there is also the most holy place of the Jews - the wall of complaint, the remains of a temple that was destroyed by the Romans in the year 70 AD.
Traditionally, there, people of different faiths leave papers with wishes that will then be fulfilled.
A journey into height
The ruins of the fortress of Massada form the remains of the secret hideout from enemies that Herod the Great had built for his family in the year 25 A.D.
They are located on a rock wall in the mountains at 450 meters above sea level.
Only climbers can reach the ruins of their own strength.
Everyone else brings an airway to this historic summit.
In the north of the country at 1600 to 2040 meters altitude is the famous ski area Hermon, where it attracts countless tourists in the winter months.
From the foot of the mountain you can reach it by shuttle bus.
The ski slopes have a total length of 45 kilometers.
According to an ancient legend, pagan gods were said to live on the mountaintop.
Visit Unique Museums
There are almost 300 museums in this country.
On just one trip, not all of them can be visited.
But at least the five most interesting of them should be paid a visit.
Among them is the Israel Museum not far from the Knesset (Parliament).
There, old quamran manuscripts or scrolls of the Dead Sea found in Felshöhlen in the Judean desert are kept, as well as about 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
The Museum of Art in Tel Aviv is also worth a visit.
There, the collection of works by the impressionists and expressionists Monet, Pissaro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso is exhibited.
In Akko you can visit the museum at Bad Al Basha, which houses several rooms of old Turkish baths with sculptures of the time visitors and bathing servants.
In Caesarea you should visit the unique private Ralli Museum, where you can admire sculptures by Dali and Rodin.
There are neither museum leaders nor souvenir shops.
Admission is free and donations are generally rejected.
The fifth museum, namely the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, tells of one of the most shocking chapters of history.
The most poignant department is the memorial for the children built to commemorate the 1.5 million children who were destroyed in the concentration camps and gas chambers.
When the room enters, there is complete darkness.
Star sparkles.
And the names of the Jewish children and the countries in which they died were heard.
Ukraine is also mentioned there.
Doing something for health
The three main recreation areas of Israel are located on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
In each of the three places there are swimming pools, water parks, dolphins and oceanaries.
Amazingly, in the Red Sea, the water temperature is also bathed in the winter months, as the water temperature is not below 21 °C and the air warms up to 23 °C.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and bathed all year round.
By the way, this unusual sea with a location of 417 meters below sea level is the deepest sea in the world.
Its turquoise blue water has a high salt content and thus even non-swimper can carry easily on the surface.
The surrounding landscape is indescribably beautiful.
Visitors come here for treatments using salt water (natural salt soles) and healing mud, as well as for the treatment of skin inflammation, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, sugar disease and for the calming of damaged nerves.
The Secrets of Age Touch
These secrets hold the old town of Tel Aviv, the city of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
Through this city the famous sea road, which interconnected Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legends.
According to tradition, Noah built his ark here, and Perseus saved here the beautiful Andromeda with which he lived a long and happy life.
Tourists like to stroll through the narrow streets named after constellations.
Fortuna is supposed to be the legend after all who touch the walls in the alley with their constellation.
In Jaffa you can find newlywed couples from all over Israel and even other countries at photo dates.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can walk through the Roman theatre and conquer the fortress of the crusaders.
In the Roman period, Caesarea was the most important city of Judea and residence of the Roman governors, including Pontius Pilate.
In the carefully restored theatre today evening concerts and operas are performed.
Bookmark for tourists
If you drive to Israel, don't worry about your bad English skills: about 30% of Israelis speak Russian.
The money in the trip you prefer not to take in euros, but in dollars that can simply be changed into shekel (current exchange rate: 1 dollar to 3.8 shekel).
In the city you are mostly on the bus, but in Jerusalem there is also a highway and in Haifa the only underground line of the country with six stations that connect the lower town with the upper city.
In fact, it's a underground cable car.
A journey within the city costs 6 shekels regardless of transportation, which includes conversion for a journey of up to 1.5 hours.
According to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated in Israel on Saturdays.
Markets and shops are closed from Friday evening to sunset on Saturday, and public transport is quiet.
And on Sunday morning the week begins.
In many cafes, restaurants and restaurants only koscher food is served, excluding pork, marine products, fish without sheds and food containing both dairy and meat products.
Instead, you have the choice between various dishes with hammuff and beef, soups and desserts (prepared with coconut milk), traditional Jewish humus paste, various sauces, fried balls made of curd bean and peas (falafel) as well as fruits and vegetables.
In the streets of Israeli cities there are no striking dogs.
For this, there are many well-fed cats that stroll comfortably and unlitly through the streets.
In the evening you can even see them sleeping on the roofs parking cars.
The cats like lively places and don't say no to treats.
A rental car costs between 37 dollars per day (Hyundai Getz) to 188 dollars (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
The insurance costs an additional $15 per day.
And bike rental costs 15 shekels a day.
Tickets for museums are on average 30 Shekels.
Figures
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
Most adventurers and people seeking recreation came from Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England, the USA and Ukraine.
From January to October 2012, 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists came to the praised country, which corresponds to an increase of 51% compared to the same period in 2010, before the visa requirement was abolished on 9 February 2011.
"The great and powerful" leads to Moscow: Migrants save money for language
While MEPs and citizens discuss the benefits of the law on mandatory language testing for migrants, criminals are already dealing with counterfeit certificates
Every year 13 million guest workers come to Moscow, St Petersburg and other cities of Russia.
Most of them are Central Asian citizens: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Its only goal is to earn money for the maintenance of the families remaining in the home country.
On 1 December, a law came into force requiring each worker to carry out a test certifying knowledge of the Russian language.
To date, this scheme applies only to migrants wishing to work in the service sector, in the municipal housing sector and in the retail sector.
However, in the future, the tests will become mandatory for all guest workers, according to the Federal Migration Authority.
Not only do we have to carry out language tests, but also tests into Russian history and the basics of legislation.
Language skills must be demonstrated for both the preservation and the extension of work permit.
Derogations apply only to citizens of countries in which Russian is an official language.
This law also excludes persons who have received their certificates and diplomas before the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
Purpose, problem and protection of rights
The whole of the examining bodies will be located under the aegis of the Puschkin Institute for Russian, Russian University of People's Friendship, Moscow State University, St Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
Migrants can take tests in all cities; already more than 160 corresponding centres have been opened in Russia.
The initiative for the introduction of the tests was supported by the representatives of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Authority.
However, before the law came into force in the press, civil rights activists asked several times the following question: What does the whole matter?
What changes does the requirement to have language skills to show, both for the Russians and for the host workers?
Above all, denied spokesperson of the Migration Authority, it is about reducing the number of forced workers.
"Many are now talking about the protection of the rights of migrant workers," says the head of the Federal Migration Office's representation in Tajikistan, Viktor Sebelew.
However, their rights must be protected before their departure.
Only an organized recruitment will solve 90% of the problems of foreign workers.
Migrants face problems without work, education, language skills and medical advice.
Sebelew is convinced that a future migrant without language skills will necessarily encounter people with evil intentions who put him into a dark, narrow barracks under the pretext of help, where he will endure with dozens of his equal months without food and documents and swung 12 to 14 hours a day.
We have many complaints from our migrants.
"In the home country the One is promised to you, and on arrival you will be deceived, receive their passports removed and do not receive the promised reward," confirms the head of the main labor migration administration of the Tajik Migration Authority, Tolib Swaripow.
Don't yell, boss!
Nevertheless, many citizens of the Central Asian republics who want to earn their money in Russia admit that they are not only able to control the language of the target country, but can hardly express themselves in writing in their own language.
Of course, this is not so much their fault, but rather the evil: only a few Turkmen, Uzbeks and Tajiks can afford a reasonable basic education.
For in their families there is not even money to feed the children, let alone buy them decent clothing, shoes and school things.
As a teenager, these children immediately take the first opportunity to earn money.
"It is difficult without language skills," they admit.
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
Citizensrechtler emphasizes the following important aspect with regard to the law.
Only migrants with legal status must take the test.
If you do not have this status, there is no examination and therefore no official work.
In the meantime, most of the guest workers continue to stay illegally in Russia.
"Welcome welcome" or "admission for unauthorised"
Many migrants confirm that it is not easy to get an official status in Russia.
The reason is bureaucratic obstacles and, of course, the linguistic difficulties.
In addition, the legalization costs money: 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
You can make a fake registration fast and only for one and a half thousand.
The staff of the Russian police know that our documents are largely fake and we are not registered, and from this comes cases of extortion.
"They want one or two hundred rubles for cigarettes and tea," says the Tadkrie Umed Huschkadamov to journalists.
"Don't put any costs for false papers"
Already on the day the law came into force, it turned out that not only the registration documents of migrants can be faked.
Some fake certificates confirming the completion of the language test have already been confiscated by staff of the Federal Migration Authority.
The fake papers were printed with an ordinary color printer.
Of course, the new owners didn't get it for free: Every migrant who hoped to save himself the tests paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
This is more than twice as much as the cost of the official test: this costs a migrant worker three thousand rubles.
As regards the fact that the most important immediate task is to protect the system from corruption so that the certificates cannot be purchased easily, both officials and civil rights activists agree.
For the moment, the authorities can only promise guest workers who will fall through the test the first time that they will be given time for a language course.
In addition, new arrivals without language skills are offered jobs in areas where active communication with people is not necessary.
Ministry of the Interior ignores illegal arms market
Part of legal weapons in crimes extremely small
The Russian Interior Ministry is planning to tighten up the arms law for private weapons owners.
The authorities react to the recent events: In shootings at weddings as well as seven deaths in the apocalypse of Moscow lawyer Dmitri Winogradov.
The police want to ban the carrying of non-death weapons in the public and raise the age for possession of firearms from 18 to 21 years.
The proposal supported the chairman of the Duma Security and Corruption Committee, Irina Jarrowaja, and promised that the changes to the Waffengesetz will be presented shortly to the Duma.
Not all are satisfied with the fact that the Russian authorities want to fight the problems by "attracting the screws".
On the Internet, an open letter was published, whose authors - representatives of various arms associations - asked the authorities to distance themselves from "insistible tightenings".
The percentage of crimes with registered weapons is very low, said the criminal lawyer, Wasilij Lesnikov, the Russian service of the BBC.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of Interior, 142 crimes were committed with the use of registered weapons over the course of six months in 2012, while a total of 1,168 thousand offences were recorded for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that a strengthening of the law for private weapons owners will not prevent criminals from serving on the black market.
According to the authors in Moscow, we can currently find any weapon for little money.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of the Interior stresses that the spread of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from factories to officers
Weapons reach the black market via several channels.
There are five main channels of this kind, a former Deputy Viktor Baranez, who worked for ten years in the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot of a website accepting weapons orders
The first canal is the army or the military, i.e. weapons stolen during the fights in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were stolen by both the Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves," Baranez says.
On the second channel illegal weapons are stolen from criminals.
Baranez explains that this includes weapons stolen from the police's arms chambers as well as directly from law enforcement staff.
Other illegally sold weapons come from military weapons camps.
In many military camps, explosions often occurred.
"There is evidence that it was a number of cases of arson to cover up the lack of weapons," says the former military member.
According to Baranez, the arms manufacturers also contribute to the black market.
"Today, there are countless private arms factories that do not stand up to international competition, and that is why the weapons are being shaken by hand on the black market, for example in Moscow," says the expert.
Another channel of the black market is the smuggling.
Especially many guns and guns come from poor countries such as Kyrgyz.
"There is an own, sometimes craft production and a mafia that organizes the smuggling," explains the former military member.
Where did the guns come from?
Experts calculated the proportion of each of the five channels in the supply of the black market with illegal weapons.
In 2011, a report was prepared by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Government Administration.
The experts analysed reports from the Ministry of Interior and the Federal Service for State Statistics, Criminological Literature and publicly available data on portals on arms.
According to the investigators, most of the illegal weapons are from the army and the legal authorities.
Half of all the weapons on the black market are there due to the "debt of those responsible who have come to deal with weapons in their work," says the report.
According to the researchers, 17% of the weapons are from conflict areas, 14% are thefts in the production of weapons, and 5% are from illegal excavations.
A sales advisor to a arms store, who does not want to be called, assures that weapons found in illegal excavations have not been buying anyone for a long time since they are obsolete.
According to him, it is more common for dealers to get the resuscitation in a weapons camp.
A weapon, for example a TT type gun, is purchased via a flag.
The weapon is issued and handed over by the fence.
"The dealer brings the weapon to the city and sells it there for 900 euros per piece with two magazines," he says.
"The police, of course, know everything, and therefore if they cannot comply with the crime detection plan, carry out periodic controls on traders offering illegal weapons," the sales consultant adds.
"As in the luxury shop"
Buyers and sellers find the most common knowledge about each other.
I looked at websites and blogs when someone became aware of me and asked me to come to the station "Begowaja" where a person would wait for me who would break me to some place where we could negotiate the price.
The price of the gun I only found out there
Military commentator Viktor Baranez
"To get a gun, I need a friend who has contacts," says the sales advisor. "I have such a acquaintance, but I don't trust him."
There are traders on the markets, but there is a need to go and date on a code such as "by Ivan Ivanovich, who lets the daughter lose a tooth".
At the moment, I even come across a few drums about a friend I trust.
He's just giving me the drums, too, because he knows I'm not gonna kill him.
Neulings are looking for weapons in different ways.
The former military member Viktor Baranez tried to be a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he wrote an article on this subject.
According to him, the schemes have not changed.
He got a photo album showing "everything possible."
"I felt like in the luxury shop," recalls the military member.
According to Baranez, the buyer does not get the cat in the bag, but can try everything out.
As a potential customer, I'm not just buying, but going to the woods with the seller, and there we're setting a target.
"I can then shoot there, and if I am convinced that the weapon has a good shot, we negotiate with each other," the expert describes the approach.
Shopping from the sofa
Internet search engines show search results for websites and groups in "Vkontakte", where weapons are offered "for various purposes".
No papers are needed or there are personal meetings.
"You only need the appropriate sum of money," says in the advertisement on the website "buying gun or gun".
There users place your orders and make requests.
Is it sold to minors?
Of course without a license, users ask "Iwan" (literally quote).
"Buy a TT. Moscow" is the laconic request of "Fedorenkow".
The Federal Security Service recently turned on countless web pages, and buyers who want to acquire weapons go up to the service.
People come like hungry fish in feeding and then land in Siberia and are allowed to fish coal
Military commentator and former military member Viktor Baranez
I have heard of the following scheme: The website is usually registered abroad, and Russian laws do not apply.
The controllers accept the orders.
The buyer transfers the money via a bank machine.
"In response, he receives a photo and a description of the hiding of the weapon," reports the press speaker of the non-profit organization "Pravo na oryzhie" Dmitry Kislow.
Viktor Baranez emphasizes that at the end you can also go out empty and come behind lattices if you place an inquiry on a website.
The Federal Security Service recently turned on countless web pages, and buyers who want to acquire weapons go up to the service.
"The people come like hungry fish in feeding and then land in the Siberian labour camp and are allowed to rock coal," he says.
A Makarov for 100 US dollars
According to experts, when buying illegal firearms, prices of between 100 and 900 US dollars can be expected.
According to Dmitry Kislow of the organization "Pravo na oryzhie", you can buy a Macarov gun for 100 to 300 dollars.
You have to wait for one and a half months.
The weapon is issued in military weapons camps by inspectors of mid-ranges.
According to the Ministry of Interior's official statistics, the number of illegal weapons offences in Russia fell by 7% from January to October 2011 to 22.9 thousand, while the number of detected cases of theft and extortion related to weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosives decreased by 7.8%.
In the USA, fast-food and supermarket workers are strangling
Each fourth American youth sits behind the checkout of Mc Donald's
In recent days there have been massive protests against low wages in stores of Walmart and restaurants of popular fast food chains such as Mc Donald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
No one can predict whether the protests will go on and on or whether they will soon go out again.
The protests are supported by trade unions and several left-wing non-profit organisations.
In addition to increasing the modest wages of simple Walmart and fast-food workers, the organizers of the protests pursue the goal of setting up trade unions.
So far, this sector of the economy has hardly been organized by trade unions.
46 cents a year?
The protests started last week after Thanksgiving, on the so-called Black Friday, on which sales in the United States took place that attracted millions of customers, which sometimes led to handfuls of hands.
On that day, some Walmart employees, of whom 2.2 million are worldwide, lowered their work and worked together with trade unions and left activists in the chain, whose target group is people of low and medium incomes.
Walmart sells all products, from diapers to hunting guns and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The product in the Walmart branches is on average between 8 and 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That is why many of the slightly paid Walmart employees buy only at their own workplace.
The prices and product range made Walmart one of the largest companies in the USA.
According to critics, Walmart can only sell the goods as cheaply as possible because the employees are poorly paid.
The latter also complain about difficult working conditions, such as missing forklifters or hand scanners.
The participants of the protests on Black Friday demanded wage increases and expressed their anger that the contribution to occupational health insurance had increased from $30 to $100 a month.
A typical Walmart employee who earns $9.5 an hour could not afford this increase, they said.
Researchers from the California University at Berkeley prove that if the company increased the average wage to 12 dollars the hour it would cost Walmart 3.2 billion dollars.
That's about 1.1% more than they donate for wages now.
If Walmart were to fully convert the wage increases to the customers, each purchase would cost them only 46 cents more in the future.
This would be for them per year compared to today's additional expenditure of only 12,39 dollars.
Supporters of Walmart are pleased to note that there were protests in nine states and that they did not cause any losses to the company.
The Black Friday lasted the next day in its store from 8 a.m. on Thursday to midnight, and during this period Walmart sold around 5000 items per second.
Altogether, the Walmart boxes performed almost 100 million transactions on the "Black Friday".
The company spokesperson Dan Fogelman, in an interview on the website of the left-wing Huffington Post, claimed that a total of "less than five" Walmart employees laid down the work and that the protest campaign was merely "a further PR trick" of the union that organized the protests.
Free cash!
The protests continued this week in New York, where their goal was not Walmart branches (which are not wanted in this advanced city and are therefore inexistent so far), but McDonald's and other affordable restaurants.
McDonald's says the company sells billions of portions, and yet they don't give you days of sickness, and you won't be paid for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, member of the New York City Councillor
At present, the minimum wage, according to federal and New York legislation, is $7.25 an hour.
In fast-food restaurants, the minimum wage is gradually raised, however not too strong, and on average their simple employees in New York get $8.90 an hour.
Less than she deserves no one in this expensive city.
As it is possible to get out of New York with so little money, I am inconceivable.
There was once a time when almost a quarter of all U.S. youths stood behind the counter-theque after school at McDonald's, but the young people still lived with their parents.
Hardly one saw there the main source of income or planned to stay there longer.
Now, with interviews with McDonald's employees, I am constantly meeting people who complain that they have to get out of this wage and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, there is a comment in the Forum of the newspaper Wall Street Journal, whose author notes that it is without responsibility to get children if you do not know how to feed them.
The protest participants who started on Thursday at 6.30 a.m. before McDonald's on 40th Street and Madison Avenue demanded that the cashiers and cooks of fast food restaurants receive a minimum wage of $15 an hour, which is more than a doubling of the current minimum wage.
They continued to call for the formation of trade unions in the fast-food sector.
The U.S. law forbids corporate governance to stand in the way of this goal and to warn or dismiss union members.
On the other hand, corporate governance does not make them easy.
The creation of trade unions in the fast-food sector is also difficult for objective reasons.
The most important reason is the high personnel fluctuations.
Unsatisfied
This day there were loud protests also before many other fast-food restaurants in Manhattan.
The highlight of the protests was a meeting at noon before McDonald's at Times Square, where some local democrats spoke, including councillor Jumaane Williams, who said, "McDonald's say it sells billions of portions, and yet you don't pay for sick days, and you won't pay for your honest work!"
The demonstrators were also supported by other prominent New York Democrats, for example, mayor Bill De Blasio, who said that "we should jointly support the fast-food workers so that they can obtain a fair wage and achieve the economic prosperity that any New Yorker deserves!".
According to New York Times, this was the largest action of its kind in the history of the American fast-food industry.
However, only a few hundred people were on site, of whom weitem are not all employed in the fast-food industry, in which tens of thousands work in New York.
It is not yet clear whether the spark of these protests will mobilize entire masses.
"To date, the brain can only be overlisted moderately"
The topic of enlarged reality, popular with modern technologies, has been usually seen by the lens of a special eyeglasses lately.
First, Google presented a working model at its annual conference in summer, and in November it became known that Microsoft had also registered a corresponding patent.
In conversation with the head of the group for interactive 3D technologies in the Microsoft laboratory in Cambridge Shahram Izadi, however, it becomes clear that the glasses were only a transit station for the scientists of the company.
It stimulates the ability to manipulate virtual objects in the air with mere hands and create virtual open spaces.
- Please describe briefly what research your group is doing.
- We are dealing with the interaction between man and machine, but we want to extend the boundaries of this interaction.
So far, mankind has largely remained stuck in the phase, in which pixels are worked on flat screens, which are sometimes also touched.
However, we want to look ahead for 5-10 years and predict the radical changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors are progressing, and nowadays no Xbox is sold without Kinect, since everyone is interested in motion control.
- What else awaits us in the future?
- Although Kinect has brought the interaction to a physical level, many things still play on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information (the system receives more data) could be improved, the output not yet decisive.
We try to change this, work on real three-dimensional display systems based on various technologies, including projections.
We need to release the computer world into our physical world and make it more imaginable.
However, it is necessary that not only the user, but also his/her environment be recognized.
Then we could complement the real world much easier by virtual objects.
And first of all, we should get rid of these stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think about voice control?
She's popular, but she's not overrated?
- It is certainly not the ultimate solution because it raises questions about privacy, because you do not always want to inform all the surrounding about its actions and intentions.
Actually, any kind of interaction with computers is good, but every one in their particular niches.
For example, in the area of controlling objects in public places, we worked on a project in which we experimented with short and scarce gestures instead of loading them.
The gestures were recorded not by the object camera but by a bracelet that recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is still relatively large, but could theoretically be reduced to the size of a watch.
But overall, the future belongs to mixed control types, such as gestures and language.
- How's that?
- For example, would you ask me to give you this spray box?
They say it and indicate it at the same time.
- I'm just saying it.
- Oh, that would be very difficult to recognize.
- Does that mean that you want the user to adapt to what a machine can do and what is not?
- Not necessarily, but this is about mutual approximation.
I think that we need to work in the near future primarily on the development of new sensor types, which will enable us to take a closer look at people's reactions.
This can, for example, be laser sensors, as they offer good resolution in depth, which is very important.
- What are your requirements based on your work with the Xbox Kinect sensors on modern cameras?
Is there a lack of resolution, depth or anything else?
- The present generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the field of three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, 8 megapixel at a speed of 1000 fps would not be bad.
But the main thing is not the megapixel itself, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
Thus, all current technologies are not good enough for us, as the developers of algorithms have more work.
It must not only be taken into account the resolution along the X- and Y-, but also along the Z-axis.
Also important are the speed and number of images per second.
The movements of man are extremely dynamic and openly said, the present 30 fps are especially for gestures too little.
Stephen Betishes developed a contact sensor in our Redmond laboratory with a adjustable processing delay between 1 and 100 milliseconds, with today's commercial sensors being closer to the second value (60 to 100).
Not all understand how much that affects the interaction between man and machine.
For my work I needed a device like this, only without touch control and with more images per second.
- Wouldn't the number of cameras have to be increased?
- Kinect currently works with three "cameras", one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the second is a receiver for the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually an ordinary RGB camera.
It does not serve to calculate the depth of the object.
More cameras may be able to solve the problem...
Or strengthen the problem as more calculations would be necessary.
It would be nice to have a flexible Kinect-like system where we could play with different camera inclinations to determine how this helps us to identify a position in three dimensions.
- If I remember correctly, unlike Google, Microsoft did not present his glasses to the public.
Do you not think that in terms of the application of the technology of expanded reality in everyday life the glasses have the best prospects?
- Of course, it's not pleasant to keep a smartphone on the go in the raised hand, but I think the most amazing variant would be a "changing" expanded reality where we could switch glasses to the smartphone via a cloud,
The glasses are a personal gadget and it contains its strength (privates can only see you), but at the same time its weakness, because an extended reality by glasses prevents you from working on virtual objects together with others.
- Let's imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holograms in the air is accessible not only to Tony Stark from Iron Man, but also to normal mortals.
There is a problem to which critics of this idea often point: there is no tangible reaction!
The hands don't feel anything at all!
What answers does your group want to give to this objection?
- In my lectures I often speak of the expanded reality as the seventh breakthrough in interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth breakthrough could certainly be the integration of tactile perception.
An interesting method is currently the use of the second hand as a slightly unusual projection document.
She is perfectly aware of pressure!
But there are also technologies that are actually aimed at giving the "images in the air" something hand-resistant, for example, the interference of some directed ultrasound rays creates at a certain point where the finger is located, a feeling that is at present as weak as someone was pussing over the handballs.
There are also straps for the wrist that affect the nerve endings in the fingers, which is also a potential direction.
- Have you tried overcoming the brain?
It makes you think it feels what it should feel when it sees something?
- That's a good idea, so we haven't tried.
Here is another task that we will have to struggle with for a long time, namely to let a person physically in a closed space believe, he is instead in an open, practically infinite space; here we work on concepts with treadmills (other than in gyms), moving platforms and large balls.
So far, the brain can only be overlisted moderately, and we still have many busy years ahead.
This is exactly what makes work in the field of virtual reality so appealing to a researcher: We are only at the beginning of many topics.
Own taste instead of culture - rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt continues the project "Petersburg avant-garde" dedicated to the city dwellers who form the avant-garde of art and culture.
On the exquisite list, high-ranking representatives of the Petersburg art scene, whose successes go beyond the boundaries of the city and who often find recognition in Europe without being known in the rest of Russia.
The new hero of Rosbalt is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole town knows Kirill Miller, the beards dressed in red, which you can find at the Russian Museum, at the summer garden, at scene meetings, or at varnishes.
Wherever the pictures of Kirill Miller are displayed, they attract large masses of people.
Kirill Miller is one of the typical Petersburgn socio-philosophical artists who create new myths.
Kirill Miller is a shining personality of the Petersburg avant-garde at the end of the 80s and the beginning of the 90s.
He is also a man of the city and, by his presence on the street, enchants his fellow citizens a smile in the face and gives them a good mood.
A short time ago, he grabbed a film organ and became a Petersburg film organ player, as he finally felt ready for this difficult role in view of his artist's existence, philosophy and image.
- Kirill, why are you always in red and not, for example, in yellow or turquoise in the city?
I chose the colour red as a fashion designer, which deals with the visuals and the image.
In this world red is the compromise between artists, image consultants and society.
In society, everything that deviates from the horror, causes aggressions and bad behavior.
But I want to get into conversation with people through my provocations.
Each of my previous provocations was an invitation to talk.
- When did you know you had to be a painter?
- At an exhibition at the Kulturpalast Newskij, where my works were exhibited.
I understood I had to go this way.
Then the time of the old free, but not officially recognized painters ended, and new and free painters like me were incomprehensible.
I was friends with the painters of the new generation, that is, with the representatives of the "Gazonewschina", from which "Puschkinskaja 10" was born, and then it was only once ended.
It attracts me to the theatre, to fashion, to music, actually to everything, except literature.
- And all this was united in your art clinic... - It was important for me to be at the heart of Petersburg's culture, where the best-creating artists should gather.
In 1995, I occupied a room in the Puschkinskaja 10, where there was a musical and artistic club for the Bohemia, the house of the Petersburg Bohemia, up to the renovation work.
Many were born there: N.O.M., Tequilajazzz, and I also remember Schnur coming there with his project "Ucho Van Goga".
Schnur and his friends sang simple songs to the playback back, wore tight jerseys and among them also belonged to today's popular composer Igor Wdowin.
When the group started playing live, it was her "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg moderated many programs before the time of "Halli-Galli".
We gave them Trachtenberg, and it began his great career, but the basics he learned from us.
The gallery "D 137" or the club "Gribudov" also originates in the art clinic.
Our employees and regular guests went there.
I'm a hero of the last century when culture meant something.
In 2000, the press conducted a survey dealing with the award of "Our City's Personalities".
I won in the category "Artists of the Year", and with that I was at the height.
It is not easy to work in new times according to old rules; I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
In modern times it is easy to become famous, but culture and popularity are not the same: one can be famous without making a cultural contribution.
- Your work has an unmistakable style.
- Many of my pictures are real pearls and express the topicality and sharpness of thought.
I will have an exhibition on "The Russian Museum as a Clowns".
Clowns are timeless.
I used to be social, but now it hurts and is afraid to be like that.
In a clown, it's all blurring and losing its tragedy.
I love the Groteske, and I have grotesque ideas.
For example, let's save the world by prescribing that everyone has to dress completely.
Now everyone pays attention to the clothes and is oriented on the outside and not on the inside of man.
But perhaps you shouldn't give a man your hand, but you should spit him in the face.
The deception disappears by dressing.
Just a short time ago, we saw you in the role of the urban film actor.
Who, if not me?
- Can commercial art be beautiful?
- Nowadays, commercial art must be careful, considerate and flattering.
We see the decay of cultures.
In the past people formed large groups: the Bohemians loved one another and the simple people loved the other.
Now there are microcommunities, and it is difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred-dollar note that everyone likes.
Now you have to think about who you're gonna like.
Now every cult star has about 100 trailers.
- The performances of Stas Michailow come to several thousand!
- The sexual social sphere plays a role in him as abandoned women.
For cultural reasons 300 people and not 10 thousand come, so there is less management, money, and everything is going to be done.
I have followers, and the most important thing is not to cheat on them and not destroy the reached one.
In my youth I painted such pictures that hung in a collector even in a series with the works of Falk and Larionow.
I started with pictures that usually only come at the end of my career.
Today, there are often misunderstandings.
It means spiritual culture and consumer culture.
Consumers have no culture at all, that is something else.
I am a person of past culture and grew up with artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty and refused money to paint.
This is the culture I support.
- Kirill, what's Petersburg missing?
- Good cultural experts.
They say, "Services of culture."
But not everyone can deal with culture.
In the real tsars it was different, because the tsars may not understand much of culture, but they understood that right experts are necessary.
There are currently good consultants in Moscow.
In Petersburg we have those who might be experts, but they will be blocked by the way, as it requires higher-ranking experts who correctly assess the former and make their way free.
Now only one's own taste counts.
The same is true of the Erarta, but with the difference that they honestly say they don't accept all contemporary art and therefore some painters have to look for other museums.
- What's Petersburg for you?
- Petersburg is not the capital of culture; in Moscow there is much more culture and a corresponding breeding ground.
On our stones art can only grow hard.
We need a cultural breeding ground, for example, we now have more writers than readers, and that is not right.
In Europe there are many curious people who visit exhibitions or concerts.
That's much less with us.
Art must be modern again, as at the beginning of the last century.
The project is financed by grants from the city of St Petersburg
Birth in the world
Earth in danger.
Warming or collision with killer asteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with earth dwellers on board are looking for a replacement planet.
To save mankind, is the important question of how we can reproduce in weightlessness or on the replacement planet?
In my opinion, there are not many choices.
De facto there are only two real planets that we could at least inhabit hypotheticalally.
"Along Mars and Venus", says the scientific assistant of the Astronomical Sternberg Institute Vladimir Surdin.
While the conditions on Mars are comparatively life-friendly, Venus has a temperature of 500 degrees on its surface.
Life would only be at high altitude or in the orbit of Venus, i.e. in space.
The research first dealt with the question of reproduction in all with regard to the flora.
Already half a century before that, experiments were carried out with plants.
The fourth generation of arches bred in orbit did not differ in the least from the earthly species.
It followed the breeding of insects, more precisely of tiny fruit flies (Drosophila), in orbit.
In 1979, watchmen were sent to space to explore the impact of gravity on the development of embryos.
It develops a normal chick.
But then the problem begins.
"The problem is that the chick needs to be stopped; it must be able to stand on its legs and start to move," explains Vladimir Sychew, laboratory director of the Institute for Medical-Biological Problems RAN.
Without solid ground, the chicks overflow wildly.
Ten hours later, the instincts of the newborns completely stumbled.
The chicks did not react to light and sounds.
Four days later, they just died.
"Two times we let chicks slip and then put the whole thing in place, because it is simply impossible to work with them," adds Vladimir Sychew to the failed experiment with the chicks in the All.
The last breeding cage with animals flew into the orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in the spring of 2013.
However, on the biosatellite "Bion" there will be only the same sex species.
There was an experiment with rats that had already been fertilized into space.
In principle, nothing special was found.
"That was just with the biosatellites, but again it was just a single experiment, and the research needs to be continued," says Vladimir Sychew.
After the landing, the space rats were given young ones.
The problem of reproduction directly in space has not yet been solved.
The task is difficult.
Animals that are torn out of their natural habitat simply cannot follow their reproductive drive.
Unlike animals, man could do that in principle.
The homo sapiens is capable of abstract thinking and can create a similar emotional background.
Ethical considerations do not allow such experiments to be carried out.
But women have been flying into space for 50 years.
There was the greatest risk at Tereshkova.
The most valuable thing mankind has is the female organism.
Our mole flew away, and no one on earth could have answered the following question: Does it survive the flight of space?
Will she be able to bring a child to the world after that flight?
"Finally no one answered this question," says Raumveteran Wachtang Watschnadse.
In June 1964, only one year after her space flight, the first female cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, bore a daughter.
The father of the child, Andrijan Nikolajew, was also cosmonaut.
In 1988 the second woman in the All, Svetlana Sawizkaja, who was twice in orbit and even worked outside the spacecraft, bore a son.
Nevertheless, a risk remains.
We have very few cosmonauts, where after long flights everything went well and they got healthy young people.
"The more, the more dangerous it is even for flights to the Orbit," concludes Kosmonaut Waleri Poljakov, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of the Russian Federation.
Yet, mankind must look for new ways in biotechnology, radiation protection and the generation of artificial gravity.
The hydrolabor in the cosmonaut preparation centre is a mandatory station during flight preparation.
Here in a floating state the cosmonaut routine wins for work in open space.
The water represents gravity.
Even if adults feel water to be pleasant, it is a strange environment; yet infants feel water as a natural element.
It is as if the little Iktyanders bear witness that life on the land escaped the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that a child is located in the belly of the mother for about 9 months in the fruit water and that it can then be used more easily to water.
In principle, this is logical, since from birth to first swimming just two weeks pass.
"That's too little time to forget something," says Baby swimming teacher Marina Aksenowa.
Thus, while weightlessness is much more natural for a newborn child, the woman does not come out without gravity.
In the state of weightlessness, the abdominal and pelvic muscles decline very quickly and thus the ability to push the child out also decreases.
All right, let's take care of this through the hard-induced tool.
For example, the birth could also take place in a special chamber to push out the child.
"But what happens then?" is Waleri Poljakov's non-important question.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without feeling the education, the organism cannot train the skeleton and the muscles.
In orbit, a newborn child cannot be put into a stress suit like an adult for training.
He will simply miss what is of fundamental importance to his life.
"This experiment, which we undertake together, namely the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead to us bringing into the world a disabled person, a completely inappropriate person," says Igor Pestow, head of the Bioethics Commission of the Institute for Medical-Biological Problems RAN.
So far, the birth of children in space is mere theory.
At some point, however, it becomes reality when the earth's inhabitants enter their spaceships into a distant planet, which will become the home for their offspring born in all.
NKÚ Chief: Control of the Black System Failures by Indebtedness of Politics
The Czech Republic has good control authorities and adequate laws in connection with public procurement, but falls back in its application.
In conversation with Aktuálně.cz, the Vice-President of the Supreme Control Office (Eevyšší Kontrolní úřad, NKÚ) says this.
"A law is never perfect, but it must be applied correctly - and this is not the case with us," Kala comments.
A similar result appears to be common control by Czech and German auditors.
As a negative practical example, he leads the recruitment of Prime Minister Petr Nečas to the so-called Black System.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS would not harass entrepreneurs with controls - is the system now prohibited or permitted?
"A law must have its validity, and if something is prohibited by law, then the chairman of the government cannot simply come, and the control office, whose duty is now to control compliance with the law, cannot be prevented in its work," Kala states.
At the meeting of the Chamber of Deputies' Monitoring Committee, you discussed a joint Czech-German project in which the laws of both countries on public procurement were compared.
What exactly was that about?
This is a parallel examination which we started about two years ago.
It is simply a matter of establishing the European legislative framework for public procurement, and of building up national legislation, and finally there is the actual practical application.
We have compared all of this with each other, and although the examination has not yet been completed, we have been able to identify extremely interesting differences. In general, the laws are perhaps even a little more "harder and perfecter", but the actual application is better in Germany in some parameters.
This confirms that it is not enough to set up new and more precise rules over and over again. It is also necessary to deal with the actual application of the law.
How can the project help you? What results from this project?
Such a joint control could help us to stop constantly trying to perfect laws and reduce and depress thresholds if this does not seem to have a particularly positive effect.
Economics means buying a thing at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price) and excluding illegal enrichment or even criminal acts.
But the reduction of thresholds for contracts does not guarantee that we also achieve this objective.
It may even be the case that in this way we are only burdening the system with excessive "paperwork" and those who are looking for gaps in the system are much easier to exploit the system than if the thresholds remained higher.
They are talking about the problems in the practical implementation of the Czech Procurement Act.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there a similar authority here like our NKÚ, or does the system work differently?
As far as the authorities are concerned, the German counterpart to the NKÚ is the Federal Audit Court, which is built up in the same way as with us and also has a college that is formed a little different.
The competences are also comparable to some extent, but Germany is a state, i.e. that these accounting authorities exist in the individual Länder - in this the German system differs from ours.
The BRH may only control federal funds, which corresponds to our state resources.
Public funds managed by the districts and municipalities are subject to the control of the national accounting authorities.
As far as German legislation is concerned, is it easier than ours?
In general, I would hardly compare this without specific information. Nevertheless, Germany is often referred to as a model in some respects, but it is certainly not possible to say that Germany is better in everything.
Is that perhaps because the examiners are better there?
I don't think so, but as I said, I don't like such comparisons.
It should also be noted that those countries that are a model for us also face problems.
Otherwise they wouldn't have any of a cooperation with our authority, would they?
As far as Czech legislation is concerned, what significance did your authority have for the renewal of the award law, do you already feel any effects?
In view of the fact that this novel is only in force for a short time, it does not yet affect our tests.
As our controls are carried out in a retroactive manner, we have to expect a certain delay here.
So far, we have felt more in the preparatory phase of future controls - so we have introduced the new control instrument "Identifying the risks of ineffectiveness" and examined and analysed with these nearly 14,000 public contracts - the changes will naturally have an impact, as the thresholds change, the conditions for certain types of tenders have been modified, among other things.
Do you see the adoption of this law rather positive, or is the system burdened with further bureaucracy?
I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction and I hope that this adoption is confirmed.
The problem may arise, however, that the rules will become "severe" and can no longer be respected.
Already under the previous rules, the persons subject to examination are accountable to the institution (for example, in the case of an operational programme of regional policy, the Regional Council) that any failure to comply with the contract law would be equivalent to a violation of budgetary discipline.
But does it make sense to make the law even more stringent?
I do not think so.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse the system, and not punish those who have committed a formal mistake that does not affect the actual decision-making.
Such a system only puts bureaucracy under even greater pressure.
Where's the way out?
Let's start by saying which path is not targeting.
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS would not lighten entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called "black system" - what exactly does that mean?
Is the black system banned or allowed?
A law must have its validity, and if something is prohibited by law, then the chairman of the government cannot simply come, and the control office, whose duty is now to control compliance with the law, cannot hinder it in its work.
He can say, "We change the law and allow the matter," but he cannot say that we do as if nothing were.
The contract law contains relatively strict rules on the formal implementation of certain operations - and that is correct for protecting public competition.
On the other hand, it is also tragic if the bidder is excluded with the best offer only due to form defects.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly - and that is what I think is lacking.
On the streets there are isolated ice sheets, but mostly they are dry.
On the streets of the Czech Republic there are partly snow and ice sheets.
However, the roads are mostly easy to drive, sometimes increased caution is recommended.
KaribaKarlsbad
In the district of Karlovy, the streets were easy to drive this morning, and there were isolated snow and ice sheets.
Temperatures fell to -5 to -10 °C, during the day it should become somewhat warmer.
In the region it is now no longer snow-covering, and in the lower elevations, only a thin snow-cover remains.
On the combs of the Erzgebirge, however, about 30 cm of snow lies.
According to the District Street Guard, Nebel's view was limited.
The R6 motorway and the first road-class routes in the region are currently fully accessible.
However, attention should be paid, for example, to bridges where the roads are sometimes required and smooth.
Similarly, all traffic routes of the second and third road class, including mountain roads, can be accessed.
However, snow remains partially required or eliminated on these roads.
In particular, increased attention should therefore be paid to the higher locations.
Districts Pardubice and Hradec Králové
On some roads East Bohemia there is a danger because of ice sheets, in higher locations and in the mountains there is sometimes an outcast snow layer, the road and motorway management informs on its website.
The road championships warn riders of ice sheets, which can occur especially in higher locations in the district of Pardubice.
Ice smooths can be found in the districts of Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy and Vysoké Mýto, in particular on routes of the second and third class of roads.
The streets I/43 and I/34 at Svitavy are chemically treated.
Snow is located especially on the streets in the Giant Mountains and in the mountains Orlické hory.
A run-out snow layer is located on the streets of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov districts.
In East Bohemia it is mostly sunny or cheerful today, and it remains largely lowland.
Temperatures vary between -3 and +1 °C, with a weak wind blowing.
Pilsen District
The streets in the Pilsen district are today well-passed, but local attention is needed, and the way of driving is adapted to the weather.
This is frozen in the morning, with temperatures between 3 and 9 degrees below the freezing point.
Since it has snowed before and the temperatures have fallen afterwards, ice sheets may occur on the streets.
It is also important to expect fog, but the view will improve during the day.
These data are from the District Road Championships.
The D5 motorway is virtually fully mobile, but increased attention recommends road championships between 80 and 131 km.
The roadways of the first class are mainly dry, but frozen.
In the south of Pilsen and Tachov circles, however, ice sheets may occur in part.
The roads of the second and third class are damp and therefore the reference to possible required sections applies here too.
The drivers should be particularly careful on the less frequented roads in the Bohemian Forest.
Olomouc District
Today, snow-match has to count on riders heading toward the elevations in the Olomouc district.
After the use of scattering vehicles, snowmats remain on the pass Červenohorské sedlo as well as on the road towards Videlský kříž.
Night snow driving forced the street championships to be used, in the district of Šumpere about 3 cm of new snow fell, according to the street administration.
In the other areas of the district, most of the trains are fully accessible.
"In the district of Šumperk, snow remains in the elevations.
On the Červenohorské sedlo pass, the riders have to expect snow-match towards Jeseník," said a staff member of the Šumperk street management today towards the ČTK agency.
Their colleagues in the district of Jeseník also had to get out at night, according to their figures, the streets are free and wet to the altitudes after chemical treatment.
In Olomouc the roads are fully accessible, but in Šternberk the riders must be careful in forest sections, as the carriages are still wet here.
Ústí County nad Labem District Liberec
In North Bohemia, the road championships report several badly mobile sections of the road.
In addition to several places with snow or ice sheets, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice is closed in the district of Ústí n.K., according to the traffic police.
Temperatures remain below zero in deeper locations, so snow and ice will hold on the streets. However, no problems have been reported from the low plains, especially southeast of the Bohemian Middle Mountains, and the roads are usually dry there.
No traffic disturbances have been reported so far.
Iron smooths are reported in particular from the surrounding area of Štětí.
According to meteorologists, during the night there were ideal conditions for this - during the day rain and melting snow, during the night cloudless sky and frost.
Bad traffic conditions are reported of the main routes and road I/13 at the border of the Ústí districts and Liberec.
The road was blocked between Telnice and Knínice due to branches that were pushed from snowload to the roadway.
Šimon Ornest: At our concerts we want to collect positive energy
What do you think about taking place in less than a month of the world's downfall?
This is one of those disaster reports that we people so much like to jump to.
With our band The Tap Tap, we make fun of it and say that we are the only band in the world that can collect enough positive energy to stop or prevent the decline of the world.
In December, you will also realize a unique project with three concerts against the world's downfall.
Can you introduce the project to our readers?
This is a national benefit event that we have been planning for two years.
For this purpose, we want to use the marketing potential of the Maya calendar, which is forecasted at 11:10 a.m. by the end of December 21.
On the day before that, i.e. December 20, three concerts will take place at the same time as 21:00 in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
The end of the concerts is expected to be about at the time that ends on the Pacific Island of Kiribati, which is in a time zone around 12 hours ahead of us, the Maya calendar ends.
Who made this idea?
Originally from me, we developed the idea together with our graphic designer Honza Augusta.
Not only do we want to collect enough positive energy to prevent the decline of the world, but we also want to reflect together with the public on the state in which we hand over this world to our children once.
At the end of the Maya calendar, we have also developed a unique collection of shoes, T-shirts, bags and key pendants against the world's downfall, with which people can also support us through www.e-tap.cz.
Together with other performers, the band The Tap Tap has also recorded the so-called anthem against the world's downfall with the title "World Falls Out".
Already today the anthem on YouTube is very popular. Will it also sound on the benefit concerts?
Of course, quite the end, provided that everything works and does not take place at the end of the world...
The anthem is to be sung at the same time by all performers at all three concerts.
In addition, the anthems are transmitted live in a direct circuit from Czech television.
The text of the hymn comes from Tomáš Hanák, who also plays the main character of Jesus in the video clip, also sings Xindl X with...
How did you get to the cooperation with both of them?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, which is related to the fact that we realize many benefit events and concerts...
We are trying to involve these people intensively in our projects.
It has been shown that most of them are interested in working with us and have fun at it.
What is the purpose of the proceeds of the concerts against the decline in the world?
For the establishment of the accessibility education centre Studeo, which we have been working with the association Tap at the Jedlička Institute for six years.
The students of the Jedlička Institute are regularly cared for by teachers who help them with different leisure activities.
Since the students themselves do not have the means to visit the teachers, we would like to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the Jedlička Institute, an own building is to be created in which we then move into this project.
Several groups and performers perform at each concert.
Which criteria did you choose?
We wanted to create a program that addresses all generations, including children.
In Prague, for example, Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý perform.
You can find everything else on the website www.kpks.cz.
Are similar "large events" planned for the future?
In May we will perform for the first time in the Prague Spring, and also for this concert we will prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to perform at the Czech House in New York, and I personally - if we are in the USA already - would also like to associate this with performances in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not very small, so far you have already occurred in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap, however, is a group composed of people with disabilities.
How do you handle these travels logistically and organizationally?
It's not as bad as it appears at first glance.
Five of our members are wheelchair drivers, i.e. the wheelchairs must be transported in the luggage room. Furthermore, we need to carry a lot of instrument cases and other luggage...
Nevertheless, it has always worked without problems so far, ČSA and British Airways have always been very well prepared for us, that sometimes I have already wondered in part.
Even in Moscow, where we were recently, there were no problems.
Through your travel abroad you have a comparison of what it looks like in each country with accessibility, how to deal with disabled people, etc.
How have you experienced these things so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities where everything works better than with us, we were just witnessing in Russia that everything in the East is still in its beginnings.
Toward Prague, Moscow is absolutely not accessible to disabled people. There it is still unusual when someone is traveling in the wheelchair alone in the city centre.
It is not even obvious that you leave a wheelchair driver in the elevator, for example.
Fortunately, associations also arise there, trying to point to the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what ways do we need to catch up with the developed countries?
There's a lot of things we're hanging back in...
However, it should also be noted that improvement of the situation is always dependent on the efforts of those concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is absolutely common for people with severe disabilities to move independently in public space, go to the museum, use toilets etc.
But it is not common that a larger group of disabled people participate actively in social events, in which we are a little ahead of the West with the band The Tap Tap!
Respect for the public and accessibility is one thing, but only when from our ranks important athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers will things really start to change.
So far, these are only individual cases of particularly willful personalities.
The Tap Tap is currently very popular, but if we go back a few years, what motivated you to start a band in 1998?
At that time I began as a supervisor at the Jedlička Institute, where I met many young people who were interested in working with something intensive.
And since I am a musician myself and play saxofon among others, I have founded a music-AG along with a colleague.
Well, in time, as our moderator, Láňa Angelovič, used to say, this is something out of control (laughs).
But the band became known only in the last few years, or am I wrong?
It is true that the collaboration with well-known singers has helped us, and we have also started to actively advertise for ourselves.
We have become aware that if you do something and you can't see it outwardly, your own performance does not exist in a certain sense.
Thanks to the EU funding funds, we can also afford good readers, high-quality equipment and others.
Was it your goal to get it so far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I have felt the potential to be able to do things differently.
Today, the show business often copies one another.
This makes sense in its own way, since everything is viewed with caution and only after a long time is accepted.
There are only a few really unique things, and I dare to claim that Tap Tap belongs to them.
Of course, the first impression that the viewer usually has is pity; this is only natural...
But this pity is absolutely unnecessary because people with disabilities are not lonely and abandoned beings that we should regret.
It is people who are able to live and develop a full life if they have the necessary means.
I always say that if people with disabilities succeed in something, this is not only progress for them themselves, but for the whole society.
Was it also helpful for this success that you are a strict boss, how to hear from many people?
If you want to do something right, you can't compromise in many things, and you must also demand a certain amount of discipline.
In my opinion, however, this is quite normal.
Some come to us with romantic ideas, and when they find that they have twice a week to try, to complete preparatory phases and spend a lot of time on concert tours, then the enthusiasm fails with many quickly.
But that's how it works everywhere, in every band that really wants to work and achieve something.
Currently, The Tap Tap has twenty members.
How many of them have been there since the beginning, i.e. since 1998?
Only one: Láňa Angelovič.
We're an open group, people come and go, you can't stop that.
Whoever has the will and the desire to join in is always welcome to us.
Take place on the day before the forecasted World Fall, Thursday, 12/20/2012 at 9 p.m.
Locations include: Incheba-Arena/Prag, Fléda/Brno and Plynojem/Ostrava; 12 Czech bands and other musicians
All three venues are connected to each other at the end of the live circuit and a common interpretation of the anthem "World Falls Out" of the band The Tap Tap.
The aim of the concert is to raise the funding for the provision of a multifunctional training centre for disabled persons, which is to be created under the name STUDEO at the Jedlička Institute in Prague. Cost: CZK 25 million
Admission costs 400 CZK, children up to 12 years free of charge, tickets are available on pre-sale at Bohemiaticket.
Poland and space.
Poland was admitted last week at a ministerial council meeting of the member countries of the European Space Agency ESA as the twentieth member of this Space Authority. Poland is thus the second member country from the former Eastern Bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became ESA member on 12 November 2008).
Poland began close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and participated in several ESA projects in the following years.
The path of Poland into space, of course, began much earlier.
Before World War II, Polish cosmosic enthusiasts were engaged in space, and they did not always come to terms with it.
For example, I recall the lecture by A. Šternfeld of 6 December 1933 at the Warsaw Observatory, in which the author presented thoughts from his pioneering work "Entry to Cosmoautics".
However, the ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) left the audience cold, and after years Šternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski had shown interest in his work.
Šternfeld won the Prix REP-Hirsch, founded by Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch in 1934 for "Entry to the Cosmoautics".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became an important champion of astronomy and space.
In Polish journals he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski's worldwide recognized contribution to the development of space was honoured, among other things, by the fact that one of the craters on the side of the moon was named after him.
Already in 1925 a railway-draisine was built in Poland, for which a rocket-powered engine was planned.
Unfortunately, the author of the draft and the details of the project remained unknown.
It is not even clear whether the rocket should be used to launch or to brake the draisine.
The information for this comes exclusively from the contemporary press.
In 1933 the Polish infantry began to deal with rocket-powered shots.
The research was conducted by the Institut Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in cooperation with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi.
From the documents that have been handed down, it is clear that the research had been carried out to the stage of practical tests.
The research was, of course, interrupted by the invasion of the German Wehrmacht.
In 1937, the design of a photoelectric hunting rocket came up in the specialist press by Ing. Rohoziński, and in the following year the work "Rakieta - torpeda powietzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" by the author Leliva-Krzywoblocky appeared.
Both projects were concerned with the military use of rockets.
Shortly before the war, all the projects on the military use of rocket technology were coordinated by the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Committee Doradczo-Naukowy).
The Committee was set up in 1937, but after two years of work it was completed from the start of the war.
Further articles on space appeared after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Space Society (Poskie Towarzystwo Astronautczne) in the Polish press.
The first mention of this society was made in 1954 in the November issue of the magazine Problemy, in which four extensive articles of space are dedicated.
The article by Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal for the creation of a space company.
At the time there were already the first projects on satellite technology, and it was to be seen that the exploration of space would have the future.
As early as 1956, the Polish Space Society PTA tried to join the International Federation of Space, founded in 1951, and in fact the PTA became a regular member in autumn 1956.
The following year the first PTA president, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), was appointed Chairman of the International Federation of Space.
He held this post until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA has been involved in the development of the highly successful meteorological missile (Raketa Meteorologicsna), the first Polish rocket for scientific research.
The first type, the RM-1, was completed in 1957, the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
The rocket with a maximum flight height of 1800 m was about 80 cm long and was not quite 5 kg.
Later an improved version, the RM-1A, was built, and 1959 began flight tests with the two-step RM-2 in the Błówdów desert.
The rocket was 1.4 m long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
Another stage of development should already be able to do real scientific work - the RM-34 rocket should reach a flight height of up to 14.5 km and be used for the observation of altitude winds.
In 1962, however, further development was discontinued.
He was the successor to RM's first rockets, which was developed between 1962 and 1965.
The rocket was designed as a two-stage rocket, its total length was 510 cm and the starting weight was 32,5 kg.
Three types (meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed from this rocket, which differed in the size of the transport space for scientific instruments.
The Meteor-1A rocket has a transport room with 0.4 litres capacity, Meteor-1B over 0.34 litres and Meteor-1C above 0.62 litres.
The maximum flight height for all three types was 37 km.
In 1965 to 1968 the Meteor 2 rocket was developed in the aviation institute, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.
Meteor-2 had a starting weight of 380 kg and was able to transport a load of 10 kg at a height of approximately 60 km.
The versions Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 were built afterwards.
It is also worth mentioning Poland's accession to the COPPAR (Commission for Space Research) in 1960, followed by the establishment of a national COPPAR Committee two years later.
Poland also participated in space research with Soviet satellites in the framework of the Intercosmos programme, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became second intercosmonaut after the Czech Republic of Vladimír Remek.
The repeal of the Law on Non-profit Works is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court lifted the Law on Non-profit Works.
This decision brought out a lively discussion in the public.
It is certainly interesting to consider the problem from a broader perspective.
Liberalised economic systems in the EU and in the globalised world are based on the principle of unregulated economic competition.
In the final effect, this means that individual economies are in constant conflict.
The reason for this is the principle of free trade and the free, full movement of private capital, which goes hand in hand with unbridled financial speculations.
Due to the large differences in the value of work (early wages) there are price tensions.
This term means that a condition in which the manufacturer tries to exist in economic competition through imports of cheap goods by "interfering" the competition in order to gain a greater market share and increase its profit.
On a large scale, this means that most companies can move their production abroad or buy it cheaply, or give up their business. The result is high unemployment in countries with comparable high labour costs.
Since private capital has no social responsibility and therefore no responsibility for the unemployment it causes, it is essential that public expenditure increases.
This situation is reinforced by the absolute unwillingness of Mr Entrepreneur to pay their taxes and thereby to replace the overall social and social damage caused by them.
This situation is generally known, so that concrete statistics are unnecessary at this point.
The careless practice of private capital creates in the individual economies a situation in which governments are forced to compete in order to artificially reduce the social level of their own population and thus attract foreign capital into the country.
In other words, governments are delivering private capital to their own people without regard to the social consequences.
This is particularly evident in amendments to existing laws.
The aim of these measures is to force their own population to accept the private capital dictatorship, particularly in the wage sector.
This is due, on the one hand, to economic compulsion with long-term unemployment, on the other, to the circumcision of workers' rights.
The result is growing poverty, as well as increasing differences between the poor and the rich.
In Germany, there have been public food charging centres for poor people for a number of years, who are no longer able to feed themselves through their own work.
The number of persons affected is already in the millions.
As a result of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy, there are frequent cases where workers receive such low wages that the state has to increase its income up to the minimum of existence.
Such scandal has also been revealed in the case of assistants employed in the German Bundestag.
The austerity measures will undoubtedly go beyond the same state of all EU countries, where people are forced to emigrate under the pressure of a catastrophic fall in their social level (as was the case in the 19th century), or to pay a hunger wage at the edge of society, hoping that sometime private investment capital will flow to the country.
Here, of course, the question arises where this capital comes from?
When it comes from another EU country, only poverty migrates from one country to another; or capital remains the same, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco, Egypt or Africa at all, employees work for a fraction of European wages.
This concerns all of Latin America.
Liberal theories and media claim that the state must not participate with capital in its own economy and that the planning economy leads to economic disaster.
Private capital insists closely on its view that the state must not intervene in the economy.
But then we have to ask ourselves whether private capital does not influence politics and thus even govern the entire state in its own selfish sense.
Here is the clear answer: Yes.
The proof of this is the existence of a practically almighty and omnipresent lobby in all states.
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, mutual prejudice, legislation, in which practically everything is rigid, but nothing is punishable.
In Germany, the situation is such that a State Ministry of Finance, in the absence of finance, is in charge of preparing draft laws in a private, closely connected legal entity with industry.
These draft laws will then be adopted in the Bundestag.
All violence then ceases from the people, as the Western constitutions proclaim it, but from strong financial groups that prefer their own interests.
Obviously, liberal democracys are rapidly entering a situation as Appian describes in his work on the crisis of the Roman Republic at the time of Caesars and Pompey: "The state has long been in decline, and the offices have been occupied with violence.
Against lubricating money, by unlawful release of advantages or with stone and sword.
The corruption grew incorruptible, and the people went with previously bought voices to vote" ... "People with character did not apply for offices, so that the state had no consul for eight months as a result of this decline" ... "One really started to talk about that the only medicine in this difficult situation was an sole domination, and that a strong man must be elected"... Appian thought of Pompeius, but the strong man was finally Caesar, who permanently replaced democracy by the sole rule.
As can be seen, today's society, as well as in ancient times, is based on the reckless preference of its own advantage, without paying attention to the interests of society as a whole.
Private capital is not yet able to recognise and enforce the advantage for the entire society.
The result, today as at that time, is an unprecedented decadence of elites, who do not in the least strive for deeper reforms.
We must therefore look for the cause of the rise of fascism and communism in the reckless liberalisation of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
From today's state, the collapse of these regimes in favour of liberal democracy can be seen as a certain break in which the next round is already taking place.
Especially catastrophic is the fact that today's elites face the potential losses of hundreds of thousands of lives in the future, humanitarian and social disasters, which we are witnessing today, as well as crimes against humanity as we know them from the older and newer history.
The repeal of the Law on Non-profit Works is not a solution here, at least not a permanent one.
Under the pressure of global and European economic competition, the Czech Republic will continue to seek ways to push down the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore a system condition.
The only solution is targeted political-social reforms, which increase the State's capital participation in the economy, increase the influence of citizens on government and weaken the monopoly of private capital in society in favour of the state.
Israel: Laboratory of chaos.
"...that nothing arises from violence, or ever could arise," sings Sting in Fragile's song, whose most important verse is in the chorus: "...so that we do not forget how fragile we are".
"If my sons didn't want war, there would be none," says the dying good man, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in 1849
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, there were, as always, a number of reactions.
One is behind Israel and argues with its right to self-defense, while the Palestinians call them terrorists; the other, in turn, support the Palestinians, argue with the racism of the Israeli state, with the genocide committed to the Palestinian Arabs, and call the State of Israel terrorist.
At this point, I do not want to write about who is in this ever-returning wave of the culprit and who is the victim; in the end, today's inhabitants, including the self-government territories, were born into the current political situation and did not experience the beginning of violence itself.
I am concerned to open my eyes to the readers behind the scenes, to look at who the 95 years of tension (as from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in the small spots of land in the Middle East are especially useful.
My thoughts are partly based on accessible historical facts, others are derived from them and I understand who or what group of people has a significant influence on the events of modern history.
The history of humanity is primarily a history of the struggle for power.
In each era, we can make up an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
That which is less apparent is the question whether it was really always these personalities themselves who autonomously determined their steps, or whether behind their throne there was someone who directed their actions to a predetermined goal.
We must acknowledge that we are living in a time when the wealth of the world is concentrated in the hands of fewer individuals, and that this concentration of money and the resulting power has not developed within the life span of a generation.
Among these astronomically rich families is a particularly prominent one that could be described as the head of the crack (I don't know if there is anyone over them, but I don't exclude this) - the Rothschilds.
Much is not written about them.
Understandably.
The first press agency (Reuters) was bought by the Rothschilds as early as the 1990s in order to prevent the connection of its name with criminal acts, in whose background always stood the strengthening of its power, the propagation of its assets or both.
The Rothschilds are involved in almost all the central banks of the world, and against the countries in which they are not involved in the central banks, they are fighting or preparing for wars (before the attack on Afghanistan there were 7 countries, after the attack on Iraq there were 5 countries, after the fall of Ghaddafis only four remained, with Russia in the meantime substituting its central bank to the Russian government).
Whoever tried to oppose this family had to pay for it with life.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew Rothschild's Bank of America's status as a central bank, began during the civil war to issue his own (state) banknotes and was murdered in a theater in 1865.
J.F. Kennedy began to issue his own banknotes and wanted to abolish the FED - he was murdered in 1963; Member of the House Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after he tried to sue the FED for triggering the global economic crisis in 1929.
In the years 1859 - 1871, the Rothschild's global ouster of power led to the formulation of a plan for the detachment of three world wars by Albert Pik, a Freemason of the 33rd and thus the highest degree of knowledge.
The first war was intended to eliminate the great monarchistic states of Europe, to break the Second War, in particular the colonial rule of Great Britain, and the third war should reduce the world population to about 0.5 - 1 billion people (a number of these would provide their amenities and their luxury and would not consume so much resources), create a universal religion (ecumenicalism is nothing more than the forerunner here) and ultimately lead to the takeover of absolute power.
The method by which the group of the richest families works with Rothschild's is the trigger of a crisis and the subsequent offer of a solution (order from chao - order from chaos).
However, these solutions are wrong and always lead to the deterioration of the situation (see founding of the FED so that crises such as the ones caused by them in 1907 do not repeat themselves).
After they succeeded in triggering the First World War by the murder of the Habsburg Throne Successor Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed the Russian Tsar Empire by the Bolshevik Revolution.
The First World War ended with the sudden, military and economically unfounded capitulation of Germany (for the destruction of the Russian tsar empire the war was no longer necessary), then the disbanding of the Central European Great Power of Austria-Hungary took place.
In order to facilitate World War II, the banks created a latent conflict situation through politics, in which they occupied Germany with massive war repairs, creating the prerequisite of impoverished masses, so that they only had to cheer down on the Germans a sufficiently strong leader, who offered the debtors named and simple solutions; another factor was the creation of the multi-national state of Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority that was supposed to assume the function of a fifth column, and also in order to lighten the fire of war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds initiated the establishment of the Zionist movement, in which a branch sought the establishment of a Jewish state, possibly in the historical territory of Judea with Jerusalem as capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour declaration mentioned earlier created the prerequisite for mass immigration from Jews to Palestine; there were first conflicts with the resident Arab population.
Terrorist attacks were on both sides.
The Second World War broke out, and whether Hitler loosed himself from the chain on which the international bankers had initially held him, or whether everything was running according to plan, it is only difficult to estimate, in any case, the suffering of the European Jews in the concentration camps created the prerequisite for the recognition of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was founded in 1948, and just as the war repairs against Germany prepared the ground for the Second World War, the calling of the State of Israel represents the focus for the Third World War.
If the international bankers succeed in igniting this war, the Jewish people will become victims in the front line, this time together with the Arab and Muslim populations of the Middle East, in the same way as in the Second World War.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of strife and chaos, not only in the country itself, but also internationally (you just think about how strongly people are subdivided into followers and opponents of Israel).
Who is the guilty person and who is the victim in the conflict between Palestinians and Israelites, where injustice only causes injustice in an endless spiral of violence, with the greed of individuals and their striving for global power at the beginning?
There is a need to distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and their leadership, but the international banks in Israel, as well as with us, the people, are only their own candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel, the Falke Netanyahu, is a typical example of a fascism-inspiring politician, loyal to the international bankers, who does everything to facilitate a war with Iran, who, in view of Iran's membership in the Shanghai Organization for Cooperation (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), could quickly extend to a global conflict, and in which, due to Iran's control over the only 2 miles wide road of Hormus, over 20% of world oil supplies, could come to an destruction of the world economy.
David Rockefeller's words from 1994 appear in what light: "The only thing we need is an all-encompassing crisis, and people will welcome the new world order."
In its imagination, the new world order is a world of lords and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the human population serves a small group of financial aristocratics.
A world in which every newborn at birth is implanted a chip to subdue this being of total control.
"And it makes the little ones and the greats, the rich and the poor, the free and the servants all give a mark to their right hand or to their foreheads, that no one can buy or sell, for he has the mark, the name of the beast or the number of his name.
Here is wisdom, and whoever has understanding, let him consider the number of the beast.
For it is a man's number, and his number is six hundred and sixty-six."
The movie Argo: If it's the worst, call Hollywood
In November 1979 a mob of demonstrating Islamist students occupied the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats as hostages.
For their release, they demanded the extradition of the fallen Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who had fled to the United States after the revolution, who had kept the cartridge over his regime for decades.
There was no positive way out of this situation for the American government - it could not afford to throw the Shah overboard because this would have seriously damaged the trust of their allies in other countries.
At the same time, it was not able to enforce the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of a theocratic regime.
It was a severe blow to the call of the united states, and the subsequent fiasco in the violent attempt to release the hostage made everything worse.
The diplomats captured were finally released after 444 days after negotiations had been given by the Algerian government.
The fate of the hostages provoked at home a wave of solidarity as well as anti-Iranian moods.
The debacle in Iran contributed significantly to the defeat of Jimmy Carter against Ronald Reagan during the 1980 presidential elections.
The film Argo by director and actor Ben Affleck describes an episode of this story that won a small part of the US.
Immediately before the occupation of the Embassy, six embassies succeeded in fleeing.
It ended after numerous complications in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
In cooperation with the Canadian authorities, the CIA succeeded in bringing refugees out of Iran, helping them with an extravagant story to cover their true identity - they traveled with Canadian passports tarred as members of a film bar, which supposedly visited film locations in the country for a science fiction film.
Combination of the genres
The plan developed by the expert for "Exfiltration", Tony Mendez, also required the collaboration of Hollywood.
To make the tarnung credible, articles on this film project were published in technical journals, press conferences were held, and the fictitious production company had a real office.
The details of this operation were kept secret for a long time.The film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck's film is a special combination of several film genres.
On the one hand, he is a realistic political thriller, but at the same time a so-called "Caper Movie", i.e. the story of a successful Husar's piece, such as the movie Ocean's Eleven.
This changes the mood levels in the film - on the one hand the documentary scenes from Tehran (in the title sequence, iconic contemporary photographs are shown, and even in the film version of the same situations there are no big differences).
On the other hand, the loose passages from Hollywood, which therefore come ironically and slightly overstretched.
And then there are still the scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions - men in suits at the meeting table, on the official corridor, on the phone...
Ben Affleck has succeeded in a remarkable reboot of his career with this film.
From a smiled actor a respectable director has become, and as an actor he is no longer the goal of ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film after the crime No children's game (Gone Baby Gone, 2007) and the Thriller City without mercy (2010).
At the same time, it is Affleck's first film that doesn't play in the director's home Boston.
The feeling for the atmosphere of the place was one of the features that removed the previous films of this director from the Hollywood standard.
Affleck, however, proves this feeling also in Argo, where Tehran is "played" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film play in the streets and show the reconstruction of events that have really taken place - the entrance sequence of the initial arrogance of the message is very impressive in its clarity, yet conveys the feeling of confusion and unpredictability that occurs when history moves somewhere.
Affleck has a similar effect with his team on fictional scenes (the wrong film staff on a bazaar in Tehran).
Too much action in too many places
The director also had to deal with the fact that history does not really offer many exciting scenes in the cinematic sense.
But with the few he works quite successfully, sometimes helping reality - which does not always work so elegantly (the scenes in which the threatening crisis at the airport in Tehran is turned away from a telephone call in America, or the chase on the runway, have something artificial).
The weakness of Argo is its overly widespread spread, which is due to the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in their roles as Hollywood employees, but their figures deserve more space, and thus they are by far not alone in the film.
Affleck's film thus loses a bit of pull force. It is a film that can be followed with a certain interest and the design and the retro style that reminds of a thriller from the 70th years.
However, he arouses enthusiasm.
However, as a reminder of a piece of history, still alive in a certain way today, and as proof of it, as the ideas of the almighty and omniscient intelligence are, it is sufficient.
Guidelines for the inflatation of balloons, bananas and circuses
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which issues an annual survey on the most absurd bank charges, has decided this year to organise the competition "Absurancest regulation or idea from the EU workshop".
"This idea brought us to the EU's recent plan to introduce a 40% female rate in the management of large European companies," said Patrik Nacher, who is working to organise this survey, to Právo newspaper.
Among the nominated absurdities is, for example, the judgment of the European Court of Justice on the harmonisation of the insurance tariffs for men and women.
Until then, women in life insurance have had an advantage because they are objectively less risky for insurance companies.
"More incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The actual vote will be taken by the end of February 2013", said Nacher.
Controversy EU regulations include the binding addition of bioethanol to fuels which, as a result, are harmful to nature, the prohibition of reliable mercury thermometers, only because they contain a relatively small amount of these pollutants, or also the directive on the size of chicken cages, which has become much more expensive this year.
In the past, criticism also earned the actual prohibition of the use of the term "butter spread" or of the sale ban for conventional light bulbs.
Bananas must be 14 cm long
The EU apparat often decides under the pressure of this or that lobby from trade and industry, whose demands are usually represented by one or more member countries in Brussels (the Czech Republic, for example, is currently trying to enforce the demands of Czech banks with Veto threat).
Lobby interests were also behind the fact that bananas of the highest trading class in the EU must be at least 14 cm long and should not have "circumstance anomaly".
The European Commission defended the argument that it would only harmonise the uneven national standards that would hinder trade.
The standards on fruit and vegetables have already been avoided by the EU against the resistance of some countries to the fact that the previous directives would lead to a waste of food.
A candidate for victory in this survey may be the EU regulation of last year, which, in accordance with balloons, must be notified when selling that children under eight years of age are not allowed to blow up the balloon without adult supervision.
The EU called for an American study, which, according to balloons, is the leading cause of child suffocation.
A similar restriction is already applicable to children up to 14 years of age when using market straws.
Curiosity also exists at home
Relatively absurd is also a directive concerning European officials themselves - anyone who takes an official role in the EU cannot use the name Macedonia because of the sensitivity of the issue for Greece and must instead say FYROM (Former Yugoslavia Republic of Macedonia).
The server Bankovnípoplatky.com, in cooperation with the association of liberal economists Laissez Faire, also nominated the EU regulation on the scope of food supplies in the field of a member country in addition to the above-mentioned absurdities.
The EU therefore set the maximum amount of food stocks allowed to be in the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the EU.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the fixed volume of mushroom canned, for which a high fine threatened us.
The organizers of the survey were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive money to ensure that they do not have a sea, or by the idea of providing funding for applications for funding.
These ideas were of course not from Brussels, but from Prague.
"We are disadvantaged by having no sea.
We will apply for reimbursement at the EU," declared the then Minister for Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) in autumn 2004.
As an argument he argued that the grain harvest was very high and the state camps were overcrowded as a result of the so-called intervention purchases.
As the Czech Republic has another way to seaports, the EU, according to Palas, should pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
The European Commission finally opposed the Czech Republic so far as to organise a tender for the purchase of cereals from countries which do not have access to the sea.
Funding for applications for grants offered the municipalities the Ministry of Regional Development under the direction of Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), which should specifically cover funding for the establishment of grant applications to Brussels.
EU: Bizarre regulations are the exception
Although regulations in the Member States are easily becoming the target of criticism, the EU's efforts to regulate and thus also the effectiveness and development of the European Union as a whole, some experts consider that they are more worthy of recognition.
In the opinion of these experts, a more serious problem is the EU funding for projects which have nothing to do with the deepening of European integration, but which have been forced into the budgetary negotiations of individual Member States.
Emotions in this country also point to the fact that the Czech Republic, like other member countries in Brussels, must fight for the right to use specific designations of traditional products and not always win this battle.
After a six-year struggle with Germany and Austria, the Czech Republic was able to defend the name "Olomoucké tvarůžky", the domestic (Tuzemský rum), whose tradition dates back to the 19th century, however, our manufacturers had to rename "Tuzemák".
The name Rum may only be used for sugar cane distillate products, not sugar beet products.
In the official list of products registered in the EU, the company of the world-famous cheese varieties Feta and Gorgonzola, the Lübeck Marzipan or the Parmaschink now also appears the Karlsbader Zwieback, Karpfen from Pohořelice and Třebo, or also the Saaz hops.
The Pardubicer Lebkuchen or the Hořic rollers can be used to fry with an EU brand.
"People want me to save the Republic, but I'm just an amateur," says Okamura.
Mr Senator, how do you get the idea to run for President's office?
It's not a question of being Senator or President.
If everything worked in our country without problems, I wouldn't be able to go anywhere.
But I can no longer see how the Republic has been looted for 20 years, how thieves are free to walk, while people are increased taxes and pensions.
I had no ambitions to become politicians.
But if I see something that I don't like, I'm trying to propose a solution to change it.
And since I am over 40 years old, and independent and partyless, I have no other way to influence things than to enlist the office of a senator or president.
In the Senate you did it and then immediately set off on the way to the castle.
Don't you get your voters back by that?
I've been telling myself all the time that I'm going to take up the fight for the castle after the Senate elections.
Later on, I specified this and said that I would vote for the President's office if I were elected Senator.
My goal is not to function. The function is an instrument that I can implement my visions.
I need as much influence and as strong a mandate as possible.
However, the difficulty is not only that we, as a people in the pub and in front of the television, make everyone down who wants to change something.
In addition, the media who want to rob one of honor and who confuse the freedom of the word with freedom come.
About me, for example, it was said that I would bribe journalists or that I was a consultant to Jiří Paroubek.
Let's talk about your visions.
The fight for the castle has taken on you with the thesis of the material and criminal liability of politicians as well as with retroactive statements of wealth over 20 million crowns.
You need to change laws to do so.
As President, you have no competence in this regard, and only the Senate as a whole can bring in legislative proposals.
How do you want to solve this problem?
As a simple citizen, I have been committed to ensuring that the guide remains a free trade, and this could be enforced.
The problem is small-minded policy - when someone comes from the right or from the left with a good proposal, it is deliberately rejected, and that only stops the population.
As an independent partyless person, I have a far greater potential to gain support from all the parties represented in Parliament.
My advantage is that without drawer thinking and party dogmas, I can take from every party what is best for our country.
Do you see yourself as a human being in politics to the right or to the left?
From the Czech point of view, it seems that people see me more on the left.
For me, however, this right-left thinking is completely irrelevant.
For me, it's important that we move on.
I don't care if anyone belongs to the left or to the right camp; I want to connect people.
Always, I publicly support any good solution, even if it comes from the KSČM or the ODS, and also I will turn against bad ideas.
You miss it when someone calls you populists.
But don't you confirm this by what you just said?
If you are setting up a business plan in a company, you will also have an ideal destination and a vision.
And you want to approach this one.
In my opinion, this can be called populism, but all the proposals I have spoken about already work in the world, or they have been discussed by important experts.
But without support in Parliament, only the keywords remain to you.
And in the long term, you will not be able to do so in politics.
Or do you think that if you talk to the people for a long time, will you succeed, for example, in exercising the liability of material and criminal law?
I have no other option.
To convince politicians, journalists and the public and to try to get them to our side to enforce these goals.
As President, it would be no problem for me to ask the chairman of the parliamentary parties live on television to lay down the substantive and criminal liability of politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
And the adversaries would have to say, if necessary, why they reject this.
A strong personality that points to abuse can exert pressure on the political scene.
Only once take the direct election of the president who was a merit of public pressure.
I am quite clear that I am an amateur; I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
I'm trying to find allies for my views and visions.
With politics I have just begun and tried to find the support of the majority for my programme.
I always try to judge things myself; and if it does not work, I will return to the private sector in six years.
That sounds a bit like Okamura was supposed to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know I can't reach anything on my own; that's why I talked to several well-known personalities about whether they don't want to candidate for the Senate.
For example, I spoke to Radim Jančura, who refused to do so because of overwork.
I also supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorenzocová, who found the fraud in the trade of light fuel oil.
My candidacy I started with the condition that people are deeply dissatisfied, but now I am no longer sure.
Sixty per cent of the electorate did not go to the elections at all, and those who went were mostly elected representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate, we are only two independents.
People have chosen such a Senate composition that changes will be very difficult to enforce.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my visions, e.g. for the direct election of the mayors and district chiefs.
Do you think about setting up your own party?
I have not yet thought about this because I have no time to review the past of any potential party member, nor have I the money for it.
I don't even have money for the presidential campaign; on my transparent account there are only 20,000 CZK.
You don't have money?
You're talking about wealth declarations, what do you look like?
I estimate my private assets to be about 60 million CZK.
In Prague I have a property with a value of 25 million, an apartment for about 10 million, another for 8 million, an art collection worth about 10 million, as well as an Aston Martin for 3.5 million and a Škodu Superb that is worth about one million. And then I have a few million on the account.
By the way, the Aston Martin was a child's dream - James Bond always liked me how he drove in the car, was gallant with women, and at the same time fought against evil.
You're driving an Aston Martin, you have a fortune of 60 million and you don't have money for your campaign?
You say you want to change the Republic, but you don't want to invest your own money in it.
That's not exactly convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
You want me to make debts?
I've put 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don't have sponsors shows that my program doesn't get too much interest.
And I am not obliged to challenge the campaign from my own resources.
The cost of the campaign is basically covered by my salary as a senator.
But I couldn't live on the senator's salary alone; for example, I couldn't finance my son's English school, which costs 30,000 a month.
If I just wanted to make money, I wouldn't run for anything.
So you keep working as an entrepreneur to have your income?
Didn't you say you're going to go back to these activities?
But that doesn't depend on the amount of the salary.
As promised, I have partially dropped my activities.
For example, in spring, my deputy manager will become the travel agency's managing director.
People want to see me as Samaritans saving the Republic.
But I have to live on something.
Which monthly income were you used to as an entrepreneur?
About 200,000 to 400,000, and that remains the case.
As President, I would, however, completely cease my business.
The full conversation can be found in the Saturday edition of Právo.
MVRDV architects prove that the real adventures are not only in mind - by example of coffinisms and the recently built Buchenberg - 2 photos
"I find the building funny, it looks futuristic, and finally there's something interesting to see again," says Lisette Verhaig, a passantin on the edge of the street.
And Stefan Spermon, IT technician in a nearby big business, says, "But, it's beautiful already, the house."
But I wonder what we need a library for today.
Everyone has internet, iPad and e-books.
No human is going voluntarily to one of these old-style libraries today, right?
Cuneiforms, an unobtrusive sleeping town in front of the gates of Rotterdam, is a distinctive record holder.
The 80,000 local authorities have the lowest level of education in the whole Netherlands.
A few years ago, in order to counter this stupid circumstance, it was decided to contribute to general education and to reconstruct the seven fictitious bridges, which are shown on the euro notes, as attractively brushed steel concrete minimities.
The success of the educational offensive was limited.
And so the city fathers realized that there was only one way to master statistics: a library must come here!
Winy Maas from the Rotterdam Architecture Office MVRDV, master of the great bar graphs and producers of funny, yes often cynical buildings, took the matter with usual serenity and appeared to the competition hearing anno 2003 with five books under the arm and a grin in the face.
And while the jury was still stunned and looked with the axles, the naughty Maas stacked his exquisite contribution of the greatness to a pyramid and ended his protesting speech with the words: "Dear City Community!"
So this is him, my proposal for the Booklet of Spijkenisse, for the so-called Buchenberg!
Nine years later, the 30 million Euro mountain has been broken up.
It is part of a revitalisation project, including underground garage, supermarket, post office and a few adjacent residential and rowing houses with a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, the Buchenberg was awarded the second Best Library of NL 2012.
The project is also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
Thus is the sightless small town resorts, which until now had no more to offer than a postmodern pedestrian zone and an undisputed ugly town hall, behind its white facades one would be inclined to suspect a dairy factory to make a piece of contemporary architecture richer.
But above all, cuneiformism now has the first public cultural building in the history of its existence.
The Long Way to the Book
The first impression: Bookeldorado under cheese bell.
There is a lift that leads through the mountain massif, but the true space and reading delights open up in the foot-and-mouth climb of topography.
The all-glazed interior is bright and clear, the burned clinker floor and the elegant street lanterns clearly speak the language of a public city square.
The urban ambience is perfect.
You're already looking out for Parkbank, dog and football boys and girls.
And books, books, books everywhere.
"The bookcases normally stand along the facade, and in the middle lies a large, dark space, which is mostly uncomfortable and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
We've put the classic room configuration on the head and worked the reading area from the inside to the outside.
The inside of the Buchenberg is skillfully used: in the middle there are offices, Internet libraries, chess club, environmental center and home technology center.
A special pleasure are the black bookshelfs, which are sometimes wall paneling, sometimes scaffolding, sometimes stairwells.
Optics, haptics and smells are strange.
Even incarcerated architects and construction engineers shake the head of the unknown building material.
"We wanted to work with recycling materials here," explains Joop Trouborst, project manager at the municipality of Spijkenisse, on request of the standard.
One day, in a French farm, we encountered an appropriate waste product from agriculture.
For many years in the Netherlands, a millimeter thin plastic fleece has been used in greenhouses and fields as a root cover.
This is cheap and time-efficient.
The thin textile holds one, two seasons, after which it is ripe for the bulk.
For the library, the nonwoven - in these quantities for the first time - was pressed to four centimeters thick plates.
Under heat and pressure, the so-called agricultural plastic (KLP) is dyed into a dark, homogeneous, loadable material that smells a bit like new cars and a bit of sports shoe.
After 105 steps you have reached the summit.
At the end of the nearly 500-metre hiking trip, you will be rewarded not only with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch crocodiles and potted ficus trees.
They provide an atmosphere, especially for the right humidity in the literature mountains.
Donations for the New Soul
"You wouldn't believe it, but this house, despite the many glass surfaces, is a demonstration project in greenery," says Troubrst.
It is heated and cooled with global heat.
Although the book mountain is under a glass crash, even on sunny days the sun appears only briefly inside.
The wide wooden leash binders, which stand across the glass facade, serve as a shade and catch much of the solar radiation.
The indoor climate is very pleasant.
Completely automatic rollouts for the rest.
Stefan Spermon, the initial skeptics from the IT industry, already dared to enter the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was there too.
And also the TCM teacher Cynthia Bogarde, who calls the Buchenberg even as a cuneiform "last-overdue soul".
The reason: At the opening a few weeks ago, every resident was invited to donate a book from his personal inventory.
This is the first time that the optical gaps in the library - currently 70,000 pieces - are to be filled.
The concept has come to an end.
The shelves are filled up to the top.
"Nothing is worse than a half-empty library," says architect Winy Maas.
"I think, thanks to our invitation, now every resident has a certain relationship to this new house.
Everyone knows his book is part of this building.
And if it's only for a decoration.
MVRDV has thus succeeded in the king's discipline, which is called identity foundation in the technical jargon.
Cuneiformisms has written literary history.
As young and uneducated as she may be.
This is finally a starting point for identity.
Szabo: "Germans have to play a bigger role"
Germany has abstained in the vote on the inclusion of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, expert in US-European relations, Berlin thus balances at a narrow diplomatic level.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany had initially signaled that it would vote against the request for an observer status of the Palestinians to the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what Israelis did in Gaza.
Now Germany must be careful due to its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I don't think it supports the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it was about setting up a flight ban zone.
This was finally enforced by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to obtain a clear position on important international issues?
Yeah, that's right.
This is because it is turning its foreign policy away from a policy, which was, so to speak, managed by the US, towards a German foreign policy.
Complicatedly, Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy.
The Germans are thus opposed between the fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they are still touching their role, but they are on their way to a more "normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy, such as France or Great Britain.
What exactly does a "normal" foreign policy mean from a German point of view?
It shows the willingness to refer to national interests as well as positions independent of those of the US or European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, i.e. exports and relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are to a certain extent different from those of the other major powers and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests affected the position in the Middle East conflict and the vote in the UN?
On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf States.
That is why it must be careful not to put an end to the public, but also to the elites, in the Arab countries.
That definitely plays a role.
But I wouldn't want to add too much weight to that either, that's not a totally one-sided relationship.
But it certainly plays an important role in German reflections.
Has Germany damaged its relations with the United States by including itself in important decisions of the vote, for example in the vote on Palestine?
I believe that there is great understanding of the German position in Europe and even in the USA.
That's why I don't think this was such a dramatic break, as in the Libyan question.
Perhaps Germany will even have a certain degree of respect for this.
Because it does signal that it is being taken seriously as international players and that its interests need to be considered.
There are different opinions in Europe about the Palestinian initiative.
The US, on the other hand, has clearly advocated a veto.
Are there differences between the US and many European nations?
These differences have always existed because of the American internal policy.
I believe that the government under Obama may secretly have quite a lot of understanding of the European position.
But because of the political situation here, the government cannot, of course, publicly represent this position.
I believe that the real differences of opinion are not as great as they always appear.
If you look at the relations between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is not so brightly enthusiastic about Netanjah's politics.
Is it difficult for Germany to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the USA on the one hand and the position of the main partners in the EU on the other?
I think that's exactly what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
It would, of course, be a little easier for the Germans if there were a coherent and uniform European policy, which is not the case at present.
So they can't be part of a wider line and instead have to push things out of their own position.
That's what they're doing with the euro.
I believe that in the future Germany will play a leading role in pushing Europe into a European position.
Of course, this is not easy for Germany, even because of the relationship with Israel.
That was always a sensitive theme.
But I believe that the Germans are clear that they have to play a more independent role.
Does Germany itself see itself in the role of important international players - does Germany even want to play a leading role?
Or does Germany still have difficulty taking the lead?
Germany is not yet used to it, it is still unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult for the country to play a greater role.
If, for example, we look at the euro crisis, there are a wide range of anti-German feelings every time Germany takes a greater role.
It doesn't make the Germans easy.
That's actually the old problem: you don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
Germany is thus in a much more difficult position than the USA.
It must be susceptible to various neighbors and opinions, and that is not easy.
Now, the influence of the US in European politics is constantly decreasing, but the EU is filling at the moment of this vacuum, who else remains?
The Germans will simply have to play a greater role.
Even if they don't like it, they're uncomfortable and they make it much more unloving - c'est la vie!

"Market Protection" in China: When Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is a well-known brand, Polo Ralph Lauren as well.
But what is Armani Polo?
A name registered in China, which, however, has nothing to do with the original companies, is hidden behind it.
Nevertheless, it enjoys protection as long as the real namesmen do not complain.
And even then, it's not clear if they get right.
"It is becoming more and more difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Pattloch, lawyer at Taylor Wessing's law firm, who specialises in protecting rights in Fernost.
There's a new case on my desk every week.
The imitators already reach a few additional letters to allow them to register their brands.
This is how Gucci simply makes Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada you have Prada-Kny inserted.
German companies are also legally copied in this way, for example, the sports goods manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens a folder with registrations of the trademark office in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company had the trademark Zegna DF Puma protected, an art name that also served at the Ermenegildo Zegna fashion house.
It is known that the Chinese world champions are in copying and in the injured intellectual property.
In the large cities there are multi-storey department stores that sell almost exclusively forgery.
But Pattloch's cases are different: On behalf of his clients, he argues that Chinese companies are officially entitled to use a name that is already protected elsewhere from the brand office.
The Chinese call it "Bang Mingpai", a passenger brand.
The word is based on "Bang Dakuan".
That means women who go fishing with rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt
"This is damaging business, you have to fight it," Pattloch demands.
"The brand is watered down, the unique position disappears, the image damage is enormous."
The financial outages and the costs of the sectors concerned are in the millions, especially in the case of expensive show products.
According to the market research company CLSA, China with a volume of 15 billion euros per year is the third largest market in luxury goods and the fastest growing.
However, deletions of duplicate entries in the trademark register are difficult to achieve and go into money.
Up to nine years, the procedure can move, with an uncertain outcome.
Pattloch reports cases in which the court dismissed actions because after the long duration of the contested name had become a "marketability".
If the defendant has evil, he even has to pay the Plagiator money because he violated its brand in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes the law of the jungle reigns here.
Famous cases also affect graphic elements.
In 2009 Daimler lost a dispute with the construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the company that recently took over the German concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
The Chinese are therefore allowed to use an emblem similar to the Mercedes Star until today.
The Volvo buyer Geely originally used a blue-white logo that reminded BMW; the dispute was solved, Geely had to change it.
The fashion manufacturer Lacoste lost in China against imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore who had the famous crocodile looked in the other direction.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
Although the CTMO brand office in Beijing admits that there were bottlenecks there in 2010 due to too little personnel and space equipment.
In the past year, however, one had returned to normality from the "necessary situation in the course of work".
Thus, the stock of unprocessed opposition proceedings fell by 22 percent.
Almost 57,000 such cases were completed, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
However, 81,500 oppositions are still waiting for completion at the office.
Dealing against it costs a lot
As so often in China, the figures are impressive.
Last year, more than 1.4 million applications for trademark protection were received at CTMO, almost a third more than 2010.
This is a record and means that for the tenth time in a row, China will introduce the list of new applications around the world, the Authority announces.
This also applied to the stock of all valid trademarks, a total of 5.5 million pieces.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan were charged.
This means that each application costs an average of 1280 yuan or 160 euros.
On the other hand, it costs a multiple, as the case of the German family business Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the Group has been fighting against a Chinese plagiator.
Although the Germans were able to achieve that his illegal manufacturing of imitated automotive parts was removed.
However, the imitator continued to secure Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand.
One has failed because family names could not be protected in Germany, says Hanno Wentzler, Chairman of the Executive Board of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CTMO brand office rejected the Munich opposition.
In the next two instances, Freudenberg got right, but the opponent continues to fight.
You have to look out for yourself.
Now the case is pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident to bring the matter to a good conclusion, and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says, "The procedure is extremely complex and costs us a lot of time, money and nerves."
The internal costs could hardly be estimated, the company archive had even had to look through a hundred-year-old file in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg offered the opposite in vain a 'high six-digit euro amount' for settlement.
"You can see how much that is worth us," says Wentzler.
The dangers in Fernost even threaten to drift back to Europe.
That is, if imitators secure unprotected marks there.
For example, a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather.
The Group has long since abandoned this business field, but it was still able to refuse registration.
"You have to take care of yourself," says Wentzler.
Both he and lawyer Pattloch advise German companies to be very careful in business with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark rights, but the foreigners should "register everything that is somehow worth protecting, even in China", as Wentzler says.
Otherwise this can become much more expensive than the registration.
In fact, if Freudenberg was left in the last act of his brand drama, then one would probably have to pay the opposite license fee for his own name, Wentzler explains.
Or we will be driven out of the market in the segment in question.
World Day: Stamping, singing, helping
In Heidelberg the choir Imbongi - and in Swaziland AIDS are happy about it.
The story of a connection that overcomes far more than 8733 kilometers.
First of all, there is the stamping: Cowboys boots, basketball shoes, ladies' pumps and men's slippers are looking for the tact on the parquet floor, find it quickly.
One-two-three-four.
Then the voices of the singers slowly soar - old, bass, tenor and soprano - intimidating, embarrassing and persecuting themselves.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor, almost lifts it out of his fabric shoes when he brings them together with his smooth wild gestures.
It is Monday evening, in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the choir Imbongi tries a new song.
The fifty singers came, between the ages of 23 and 69, from the human geneticist to the houseman.
"Om'Obani" is not a simple piece, each choir voice has a different text and it is also spoken in a very foreign language: Zulu, spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Aid for self-help
There are around 34 million HIV-infected people worldwide, estimated by Unaids, the United Nations Programme to Fight AIDS.
23.5 million of these live in South Africa.
==References====External links==
More than 40 percent of the population are now HIV-positive.
For 180 orphans in the village of Esitjeni, the association Voices for Africa has found paten in Germany.
70 of them attend a secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros a month you can take over a sponsorship.
It guarantees the child school allowance, school uniform and a warm meal daily in the Gogo Center.
Imbongi means storytellers or praisers on Zulu.
The Bantu language fluently cannot speak in this room, but can sing.
For almost ten years, the choir has been practicing songs in this strange soft language and occasionally bringing them back where they originally came from: to the South of Africa.
After 8 733 kilometers of airline from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is the village of Esitjeni, which depends on the power of the German choir.
Forty percent Are Infected
About 2000 people live there, some still in simple clay and straw huts, most of them children.
More than 300 of them no longer have parents because they are in the HI virus.
In Esitjeni, there is little evidence of what is ill with all of Swaziland: highest HIV infection rate, lowest life expectancy worldwide, according to Unicef.
Circumcisions of the male foreskin, which have been shown to reduce the risk of infection by half, are hardly accepted by the population.
More than forty percent of the people in Swaziland carry the immunodeficiency virus within themselves, dying with the middle thirty is no rarity.
On a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir discovered the village, but above all the imbongis saw many children on the streets where there was not only a lack of parental care, but simply everything: food, clothing, education.
You can't have a chance in a poor country unless you're out of school.
At first it was the private commitment of individuals to send a child to school for a few euros a year and to allow him a warm meal a day.
A year later, however, the choir founded the association "Voices for Africa", which has almost professionally taken care of the AIDS-waisen in Esitjeni.
Facts on sexually transmitted infections
What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases?
The bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlamydia and tripper (gonorrhea).
Common viral STIs are HIV, human papilomaviruses, herpes genitalis or hepatitis.
The parasitic STI is part of the filter tube and scratches.
Who are the main affected groups?
Syphilis and tripper are particularly common in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute assumes that at least four out of five of all syphilis cases reported in Germany are transmitted by sexual contacts between men.
In heterosexual adults, chlamydia infections, trichomonades, candiosis (pilz), tripper and human papilomaviruses are common sexually transmitted diseases.
The spread of HIV among heterosexual adults in this country is comparatively low - however: about 20 percent of HIV new infections occur from this group.
In adolescents, chlamydia infections are much more common than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections affect young people between 15 and 25 years of age.
Human papilomaviruses are also common in adolescents.
How has the number of infections developed?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to reporting.
According to the Robert Koch Institute of 1697, the number of syphilis infections has more than doubled to 3698 diseases in 2011.
The number of HIV new infections has declined since 2007.
There were some 2700 cases in 2011.
That's about a tenth less than the year before.
What symptoms indicate a sexual illness?
Infectious diseases may cause ulcers in the general area, symptoms of urination, outflow, lower abdominal pain, and bladders or warts.
Often, however, they do not cause pain or other symptoms and therefore remain unnoticed.
How can you protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but do not provide a hundred percent protection.
For in part, pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be passed on through lubricating infections and close contact with the body.
Therefore, experts especially in frequently changing sex partners recommend regular examinations.
Early diagnosed most STI can be cured and later avoided.
Through sponsorships, donations and last but not least the gagen, which the choir sings throughout Germany, a lot comes together.
"In total, we have already sent around 200 000 euros to Esitjeni," says Annette Lennartz, the president of the association.
In the village itself Zodwa Dlamini, a self-confident and strong woman, manages the money from Germany.
She also takes care that the orphans are well accommodated, for example, in one of the grandmothers.
The Gogos, as the old women on Zulu are called, are the supports of the village.
Some of them have taken up up to 14 orphans, give them a roof over their heads and ensure that the children appear in their uniforms on time for school lessons every day.
Those who don't have anyone come to the shelter house to Khanyisile, a single woman who is paid just as much by the club as the two chefs who cook for more than 200 hungry children every day.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" has established a sewing school, built two chicken houses, and organized together with the American health organisation PSI, that many in the village have made an HIV test.
This is not a matter of course, because as obvious as the disease in the whole country is, one prefers to keep it dead.
A King With 14 Wifes
"Aids is an absolute taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality."
Actually strange in a country in which the king officially holds 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
Among other things, it is also due to this stately sanctioned form of life that the HI virus has spread so rapidly over the past decades.
But also the many migrant workers who carry the virus through the country.
While free condoms would exist at every corner, Annette Lennartz says, "but they are hardly used.
The culture is another - flesh to flesh."
To promote cultural exchange, the Imbongi Choir travels through the South of Africa every two, three years and sing songs full of wehmut, martial spirit, confidence and black self-confidence, which many at the southern tip of the black continent still know from times of apartheid.
A bus full of whites singing songs in a black language - so much recognition not only brings mood and joy, but also some gruesome border soldiers have already worn off a few tears.
The journey always leads to Esitjeni, where the singers visit their godfathers.
Even if you hardly find the small village on maps, in the valley of the Ezulweni river it is more than known.
"Go to Esitjeni, there is the light" people say there.
And if you return the 8733 kilometers of airline to Heidelberg, to the stamping singers in the sample room on Bergheimer Straße, then you can see it there too.
Messenger: NASA discovers ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice cap may be up to 20 meters thick.
NASA has demonstrated the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is closest to the sun, there is also frozen water, as shown by three studies published on Thursday in the specialist magazine "Science".
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is an ice cap in the planet’s shadowy region.
It is said to be at least 30 cm and possibly up to 20 meters thick.
The water probably came from comets or possibly asteroids that hit the Mercury.
No one has connected the discovery of ice with the existence of life on the planet, said the chief scientist of the Messenger Sun, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on the Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help to clarify how water and other building blocks of life have arrived in other areas of the solar system.
Unnoticed by the earth's citizens, probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix are in the process of exploring the depths of space.
From time to time, they send pictures to the earth: Small cuckoos in infinite widths.
The picture comes from a camera developed by German researchers from the Max Planck Institute.

Like Pluto, who circles behind Neptune around the Sun, Ceres is not a "planet" after the new definition of the International Astronomics Union of 2006.
This section of an infrared image of the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of uncounted star generations: The oldest stars can be seen as blue points, harder to identify are the pink "newborn" in the star circle hall.
This star-forming region - known by scientists as unromantic W5 - has discovered the telescope tipper in the constellation Cassiopeia, at a distance of 6500 light years.

One of the biggest and sharpest recordings of the Hubble telescope: The Hot tub galaxy
Depending on colouring, images of spiral galaxies become true works of art.
The recording published by the European Southern Observatory shows the trifid nebula, which has been removed for several thousand light years, in the constellation Sagittarius.
The name Trifid is derived from the Latin word trifidus (three-part, three-parts), as dark dust strips tripart the glowing heart of the Star birth site.
In the constellation of snake carriers, astronomers have photographed the precursors of cosmic carambolage: 400 million light years away from the earth, the cores of two merging galaxies are rising together and will inevitably collide with each other.
This star birth recorded the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
To whom technical abbreviations are not, they may be called Southern Fire Wheel by their nickname.
The photograph of the space telescope Hubble shows a section of the Iris Nebula in the constellation Kepheus.
The 1400 light years away is made up of dust grains, which are ten to one hundred times smaller than ordinary house dust.
This picture was composed of optical and X-ray recordings of different telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes, 430 million light years away from the earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, recorded the space telescope Hubble for the Nasa.
The larger spiral galaxy calls scientists UGC 1810.
The brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way is located in this starry nebula.
The Sternenwiege always produces new Youngsters.
Also this star cloud, associated with the rosette nebula, is constantly producing new baby stars - 5,000 light years away from the earth.
In this brightly radiating galaxy with a small black hole there is no dust yet, but only gas.
Researchers suspect that he was only born shortly after the Big Bang, when he was mainly found hydrogen in the universe.
Our insights into space: The main telescopes
The telescope is said to have been invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608 - even before Galileo Galilei used it for star observation a year later.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have become ever greater - and the insights they provide have become deeper and deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope in the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror, here in the picture, had an average of five meters.
In Arizona, USA, the Large Binocular Telescope stands.
It allows eyes into space over two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior life of Gran Telescopio Canaria on the Canary Island of La Palma is huge - the mirror alone comes at 10.4 meters in diameter.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented - to save costs.
Nevertheless, it reaches a diameter of about 11 meters.
Disadvantage of the favourable design: The telescope is fixed in its height angle - and thus limited in its mobility.
The hobby Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed in the height angle.
Its special feature: the high light collection force.
In fact, despite comparatively low mirror diameter, this is sufficient to those of the world’s largest mirror telescopes.
With the help of a radio telescope in Arecibo (Puerto Rico), researchers listen to the all about alien signals.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
With the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI), any computer owner can help by providing computing power.
View of the Observatory of the European Observatory (ESO) in the Chilen Andes.
Here stands the Very Large Telescope - which gives his name all honor.
With a total of four mirrors, the telescope can also light the medium infrared spectrum.
The European Extremely Large Telescope is also planned at the Chilean ESO Observatory.
Its main mirror should include solid 42 meters - and be composed of nearly 1000 mirror elements.
But pictures can be expected at the earliest 2018.
Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
They offer two mirrors each with an average of ten meters.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which looks in the sky next to them with the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF.
Also on the Mauna Kea a new, huge telescope is to be created - with a mirror average of thirty meters.
Here it is to marvel at an illustration.
However, the most important impressions from space telescope Hubble.
Since April 24, 1990, it has already provided images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, space telescope Kepler has been searching for extra-sollar planets - mainly for those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011, the Nasa announced that 1235 planetary candidates had been established since the start of the mission.
In the picture, the latest startup preparations on the Space Telescope Kepler are documented.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be shot into space at the earliest of 2018 on board an Ariane5 rocket.
The primary mirror of the space infrared telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope: It should look for light from the first stars and galaxies for the Big Bang.
Scientists assume that there is also the south-east of Mercury ice cream.
However, there is no reliable data for this, as the messenger circles far closer to the North Pole around the planet.
Radar measurements have indicated for decades that there is ice on Mercury.
Through the Messenger-Sande launched in 2004 - the first one to circle around the Mercury - the scientists now have certainty.
Drink butter daily - and become 168 years old
In the south of Azerbaijan many people reach a Biblically high age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A search in the country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
In the south of Azerbaijan many people reach a Biblically high age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A search in the country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
The journey through the Talysch Mountains is to be called wild-dromantic.
The small bus rumbles over the winding road, past densely forested hills, tearing rivers and simple farmhouses.
Everything is green and juicy, you might think you're in the Black Forest.
But this is the deepest south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
Here lives the Caucasian folk group of the Talysians, which is not very well known, except that it speaks perfectly Persian as well as Azerbaijani and is very durable.
The station is Lerik.
The small town protrudes with overly entrenched architecture from Soviet times, which doesn't even want to fit into the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe hardly come here, too difficult is the approach of Azerbaijan's capital Baku.
For the 323 kilometers you need eight hours because the road is just one-track.
The magnificent wealth that the land owes to its oil in the Caspian Sea has not yet arrived here in the province.
But Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has the stuff for tourist attraction.
"Baku became famous in May with the Eurovision song festival - and next year we will have a festival of the oldest people in the world," says Fatulayeva.
She is the director of the Museum of Latitude, probably the only one in the world.
Here the Vita of about eight dozen Talyschen from the area is documented, the older than 100. Fatulayeva shows on a black and white photo.
This is my grandfather. He was 120 years old.
A child born at the age of 136
However, controversial star of the museum is the shepherd of the sheep, who is supposed to have been 168 years old.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And given the oldest documented person who became 122 years old, Müslümov's age appears extremely doubtful.
"1805 he was born here in the region, in 1973 he died," says Fatulayeva.
The man was three times married and had 23 children, and at the age of 136 he was still to be a daughter.
So, when he was a child, did he pay off for a few decades?
But Rembrandt Scholz, age researcher at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, also heard of the high-aged people in Central Asia.
"A striking number of high-end people are also present in some areas of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "even in Sardinia live extremely many very old men".
However, due to the lack of documents, there was no scientific evidence of age, especially since there were no registers of status.
Every day, melted butter
The fact is, however, that the people of the region around Lerik are strikingly often reaching a Bible age.
There are currently 20 people over 100 years of age.
So why do so many pronouns live here in the south?
The Assyrian travel guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this with the special genes of the Talyschen.
Museum director Fatulayeva, on the other hand, believes it lies in the diet.
But that the calorie-rich food of the tallys should be so healthy, love the meat, bread and, above all, dairy products and many of them drink a glass of melted butter every day, does not appear plausible from the point of view of nutrition.
Or is it the original way of life that keeps people young? Rubaba Mirzayeva lives in Cengemiran, a tiny settlement near the city of Lerik.
With its 97 years, it is still relatively young for these widths.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house, which is typical of the entire Caucasus region.
She sits on the ground with a butter barrel that untiringly rolls her back and forth.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of Mirzayeva's sons and one daughter, both of whom have long been grandparents.
Two toddlers also jump around.
In the kitchen you prepare the guests tea served in the typical tubular Armadu glasses.
Mirzayeva's white teeth stand perfectly in a row and a ledge, under her head cloth she hides long, dark-blozed pots that proudly reveal her son to us.
I always washed my hair with milk, so they never went out and kept their color.
"I've never used shampoo either," says Mirzayeva.
Monthly pension is enough for life
She always ate only what came from her own farm, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
All my life, I didn't buy food once in the supermarket.
Then she tells of her husband who was in the army.
It was the worst in the post-war period.
But everything got better than the "loved father" Heydar Aliyew took over the rower.
The propaganda sounds strange from the mouth of an old woman.
But the cult that is driven around the father figure of the nation, who ruled his country like a dictator, hardly knows borders in Azerbaijan.
Until 2003 he was in power, and later his son Ilham took over the rowing.
After all, there is no need among Azerbaijan's old.
230 Manat (e.g. the same sum in euro), Mirzayeva receives a monthly pension, an amount for these conditions, from which you can live well.
And perhaps Mirzayeva's son is also quite right for a long time: "The old enjoy high esteem in our culture."
They live in the midst of the large family, are loved, cared for and are happy.
If this is not a reason to live as long as possible
The word "human rights" is missing in the Constitution
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Rival rallies in Cairo revealed the deep division of the country.
The future constitution with Sharia as the basis is fiercely controversial.
The Egyptian president did not spare with Pathos.
We have to make the transition.
"And that he succeeds is in my responsibility, in front of the people and in front of God," he said in state television.
His speech was addressed to all the people, but above all to the Christian cops, the liberals, enlightened Muslims and seculars.
Because they all, so far hopelessly disunited in a confuscious opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a divine state on the Nile of graces of the mighty Muslim Brotherhood.
He, Muhammad Mursi said, almost apologising, temporarily curtailed the competences of the Constitutional Court and expanded his competences to "save the revolution".
But what the 61-year-old engineer who holds a doctorate from the American University of Southern California really wants to save, over which the Egyptians are themselves, the world is not quite clear.
Whether the judicial action should be taken.
In fact, the 234 articles, which were whipped through by the Islamist-dominated 100-member constitutional assembly, are partly worrying in a nocturnal 15-hour Parforceritt.
As in previous constitutions, it says in the draft that the case law is based on the "principles of Islamic law".
But what does "principle" mean?
This was and is a matter of interpretation, and it is to be feared that Islamists will use the sulphurous formulation and the associated legal scope for a more stringent interpretation of Sharia.
This suggests, at least, a newly added article: In all the issues of Sharia, Al-Alkar University had to be consulted, the country's most important Islamic institution with great radiance throughout Sunni Islam.
This does not have to, but it may mean that the clergy oversees the legislation, which would de facto result in the demise of the judicious.
Much in the draft draft draft is a matter of interpretation.
Also problematic: Civil military jurisdiction should continue to be maintained.
These courts served during Mubarak's reign to suppress opposition.
After the dictator's fall, up to 11,000 civilians were in military custody.
The state should also, it is in the draft, protect "the true essence of the Egyptian family" and promote its morality and values.
This is legally so unsharpened that state institutions could even control the content of film art and literature with the help of this article.
In plain text, that means nothing but censorship.
No article, by the way, expressly defines equality between men and women.
For this, another forbids insulting or slandering the Prophet Muhammad and his messengers.
But what is an insult and how it should be tried remains unclear.
Similarly, dubios assumes that the "injuring of men" is forbidden.
Is there already a caricature of the president or a joke at the expense of a lawyer?
The question of interpretation, as so much in the draft, which Mursi has for signature, will be presented "very soon" to the Egyptians for the referendum.
"The revolution has returned"
The opposition has been against Islamist supremacy for weeks.
Tens of thousands gathered in uninhabited opposition on Friday evening on the Tahrir Square in Cairo and praised to bring the Charter down even before it could enter into force.
"The revolution has returned and we will be victorious," said Hamdin Sabbahi, third-placer of the presidential elections.
Nobel Peace Prize laureate and ex-Chief of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed El-Baradie stated that the draft constitution belonged to the "Müllberg der Geschichte".
Via Short News Service Twitter, he called on the followers of Mursis to lead a "coach against democracy".
"When he calls out the referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him," said the oppositionel Jasser Said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not yet well-deserved," the Egyptian media quoted the opposition politician Chaled Ali.
And several judges announced that they would not want to monitor the referendum, which would invalidate it.
"The Qur'an is our constitution"
The well organized Muslim Brotherhood, in turn, blew to the area demonstration, but for the sake of caution not on the Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other Nile River in front of Cairo University.
Many veiled women and followers of the Salafists took part and cried, "The people are calling for the application of God's law."
They asked Mursi, "Surve the land!" and said, "The Qur'an is our constitution."
A struggle for the sovereignty over the symbolic Tahrir square, on which everything took off, would probably have challenged civil war-like states.
Mursis followers obviously didn't want to risk that.
The Muslim brothers explained that both the opponents of the draft Constitution and the supporters had spoken out loud and clear.
Now is the time to let the people at the election hall decide in which direction the country should go.
A majority for the Islamist draft is considered safe.
"The word human rights does not even exist"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry with this forced constitutional process, which would actually have gone until February and should involve all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) defended the Muslim brothers when they were in prison or in court under Mubarak.
Not because he would share their view of the world, but because human rights are indivisible to him.
For this, he was beaten, sentenced, arrested.
"And now the word human rights is not even in the new constitution," he laments in conversation with the "world on Sunday".
Mursi's extension of power to all three forces in the state allowed the lawyer to be reselled.
These measures are blatant violations of democratic rules and will lead Egypt into a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the President put it de facto out of force," laments Saeda.
But without civil society organisations, democracy cannot work.
Soeda feels left alone, also from the international community, which looks at the ideological direction struggle on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
That could be revenge.
A demonstrator on the Tahr warns: "You are giving birth to a monster that you can't control."
Rakfisk from Norway: Is that the worst fish in the world?
The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy one of the highest living standards - not only in Europe but all over the world.
Could the country’s secret of success have something to do with local appetite on pretty bad fish?
Take a selection of more mature cheeses.
You place them in the midst of a bunch of dirty, moist sportswear.
And call her there a week.
About this time you have to imagine the soaking smell of Rakfisk, one of Norway's great delicacy.
I am in the small town of Farenes, about three hours away from Oslo.
There are snow, spectacular landscapes here - and this persistent smell in the air that just doesn't want to disappear.
Rakfisk is trout sprinkled with salt, which is fermented in water for up to a year, depending on how you would like to smell your fish.
When the darkness comes across the country in Norway and the weather gets colder, Norway is flocking to a festival here in Farenes, which is dedicated to this, now, really great speciality.
"You eat it raw and then rinse it down with a glass of Aquavit," says Havard Halvarsen, who actually works in the local fire station, but also organises the festival as a so-called "Rakfisk General".
Around us people consume small fish cubes and take up large amounts of alcohol.
"Some people like the Aquavit more than the Rakfisk," says Havard.
Spirituosis can dispel the smell.
I'm gonna take a few bites.
If one avoids bringing the Rakfisk close to the nose, he's not bad, for example, like Sushi, who's got a quite long bus ride behind him.
Rakfisk is the product of a very different, much poor Norwegian epoch, when there were no cooling options and fish were soaked in the autumn in airtight salt water barrels.
In the deepest winter, it was then taken out after a long fermentation and consumed - undoubtedly with the help of alcohol - under the control of the senses.
Even before a generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work and migrated mainly to the United States.
Today the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by a thriving labour market, high wages and a comprehensive health care system.
Even from Sweden, the old rival, who was far richer than Norway before, streamed immigrants.
Rakfisk is regarded as something important - an essential, though strictly smelling part of Norwegian history.
He's one of the more expensive dishes you can buy here.
But actually everything is expensive here - a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs proud 10 euros.
Norway doesn't often get into the world press, and most people don't seem to disturb it.
Here one still hates to call Anders Breivik by name - that racist right-wing extremists who shot 77 men, women and children last year.
Instead, one refers only to the "event of 22 July".
Norwegians are struggling to accept that someone in their peaceful country is capable of such brutal murders.
Since the early 1970s, growth has been one of the largest oil and gas industries in the world.
"But oil is not the only reason why we are so good," says Anna, our waitress, who distributes round tablets with ripe raccosk and embodies the Nordic ideal with her long blond hair and the stinging blue eyes.
We are a people of care, as they say.
Your English is just like most people here are flawless.
We're not very gratifying, we don't like the pretense.
Norway has handled its oil richness very cautiously - a large part of industry yields will be invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
When, in the years leading up to the global economic crisis, everyone threw money around them that they did not at all possess, Norway held its wallet firmly closed.
"As long as we can ski in the winter and walk in the summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"And, of course, eat raccoon," she adds with uncomplicated laughter.
I stand in the snow and stand for another court - from Rakfisk I have enough.
Such an elk burger is definitely something else.
But in the evening the stink fish is back on the menu.
The hotel where I am staying is one of several venues that organize a Rakkisk dinner where guests can vote for the best - or perhaps the sense of smell the most challenging - fish.
There is a live TV circuit to a showmaster dressed with fly, surrounded by plates with raccos.
The spectacle resembles the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What score do you have up there in the mountains for the best fish, Thor-Jürgen?"
"Here are our points, Havard."
You clap and laugh.
A man falls from his chair, possibly overwhelmed by the Aquavit.
But maybe it's the strict thirst of the whole fish.
Mexico's Enrique Pena Nito is facing a difficult start
While Mexico's future president Enrique Pena Nito is preparing for his entry into office, Will Grant from the BBC analyses the challenges ahead and the mixed feelings of his people.
The traffic in Mexico City is currently very bad.
Even on better days this is an always clogged city, but on Monday a ring of steel was built, which locks off several important transport routes to the capital and provides chaos on the streets.
The aim, however, was not to interfere with the way to work, but to prevent demonstrators from reaching Parliament.
On Saturday Mexico's new President Enrique Pena Nito will receive the President's Bond and take over the leadership of the nation.
He's facing a complex task.
Under the ruling Felipe Calderon, Mexico has been able to prove itself economically well, but the country is under the control of a drug war that has cost 60,000 people in the last six years.
"My government is committed to reducing violence," said Pena Nito at the Oval Office at the US President Barack Obama at the beginning of this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this objective.
Before joining the U.S. president, Pena Nito was the governor of his home state of Mexico.
In this densely populated, vast part of the country surrounding the capital, opinions about the new head of state are shared.
A direct man
For example, in the remote small town of Valle del Bravo, you like to remember him.
Residents of the resort attribute to him the development of tourism and the construction of the infrastructure.
To reach the city, one can drive on one of the motorways that made Pena Nito build and which represented a great improvement over the fragile, bumpy streets that once existed here.
Plakets with their name also hang outside a modern sports centre and an impressive interactive museum for climate change.
"We expect from him real and lasting changes," said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, who works as a congressman for the Pena Nitos party, who works PRI.
In particular, as regards security and economics, we hope for an interesting and real change that is so urgently needed by our country.
After 81 years of power, the PRI was replaced by Vicente Fox in 2000.
The Congressman Olvera admits that after 12 years, the party has reached great expectations of Enrique Pena Nito outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos.
The accusations of the opposition, the new president's failure to take substance, he rejects.
He is a very direct man, very committed and has big plans for the country.
He is an outstanding statesman, but above all he is also someone who can listen.
But on the other hand of the state, not many people share this view about their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast to the paved streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
The town is hidden under highway crossings and is in many respects a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the community are of decisive urban nature.
At the beginning of this year, the military was deployed to fight the drug gangs operating in the quarters, and violence against women is a particularly acute problem.
On a spot in Brachland near a large garbage dump, the bodies of violently murdered women have been left alone in the last two years.
During Governor Pena Nito's term of office, more than 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico - a statistics that even exceeds the city of Ciudad Juarez, which is notorious for its violence and murders of innocent women.
Critics Pena Nitos believe that he at least did not address the problem of women's murder during his term of office properly.
But in the worst case, his government closed its eyes to the problem.
Irinea Buendia fights with the tears in a concrete construction, typical of the run-down quarter, when she shows me photos of her deceased daughter Marian Luna.
According to the official version of the events, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
But her family believes that she was murdered by her companions.
"When I arrived at her home, it seemed as if her body had been washed," remembers Senora Buendia.
There were signs that she was beaten, and the body rigids had already used.
While her mother tells her story, a picture of Mariana looks down at us from the wall. It is placed next to a cross bearing a single word: justice.
But this one, according to the family, has been denied so far.
The authorities treated me as if I were a brother-in-law, an insolent, Nörglerin.
They want them to simply accept their judgment and keep their mouth shut.
"But that is not possible if there were so many formal defects and failures," she says.
If President Pena Nito receives the President's binder on Saturday, he will also assume a great responsibility.
Tens of thousands of Mexican families have suffered from violent crimes over the last six years, and the new President has promised to take special care of this problem during his term of office.
"I hope as president he is as he was as governor," says the PRI Congressman Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
But the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza fear the most.
The prosecutor claims: Bradley Manning did not complain about abuse
The prosecutor's office contradicts Bradley Manning's accusations that he's been abused in prison.
The hearing deals with Manning's time in the military prison in Quantico, Virginia
Defense seeks to reject the charge due to severe detention conditions
The freer of the US Army is accused of using thousands of confidential documents
On Friday the prosecutor tried to find that the army-free Bradley Manning - accused of the greatest revelation of confidential information from the U.S. history - failed several occasions to complain about the abuse he was supposed to have suffered in military custody.
In a cross-examination of Manning during a preliminary hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Maj. Ashden Fein explained that documents for weekly visits by prison officials during Manning's nine month imprisonment in Quantico, Virginia, had no complaints about his treatment.
One day before the cross-examination, which was held following a request of defense to reject the charge - Manning had already been adequately punished by the hard term of imprisonment - had Manning declared that he had considered suicide in prison.
The US Army intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents during his service in Iraq.
The material was then published by WikiLeaks on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed Manning as the source of information.
In the hearing on Friday, Fein went through with Manning the forms that officials had completed after their meeting with Manning during his detention at the Quantico Military Prison, where he had sat in custody from July 2010 to April 2011 under increased detention conditions.
The officials asked Manning questions and wrote his answers.
When Fein asked him about the forms on Friday, Manning admitted that he had judged the treatment by his guards as "excellent" and the treatment by the institution as a total "very professional".
The forms, such as fine, did not contain complaints about maltreatment, although officials had asked Manning directly about his treatment.
Manning replied that he had expressed his concerns orally and that the officials had discussed them with him and said they had not been logged.
"They wrote (after discussing the concerns) "No problems," and that did not necessarily mean that I didn't say anything at all," said Manning.
The judge, Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he did not complain about his treatment when he met a committee in January 2011, which was to examine the idea of suicide mentioned by him a few months earlier on a form.
Manning replied that his intention during this meeting was to lower his observation status to the "prevention of injuries".
The military said it had assigned to him this restrictive status, which is one step under the threat of suicide, to his and the protection of others.
"I wanted to convince employees that I was fine, and to get rid of the observation status to prevent injuries (...) in order to achieve a higher quality of life from my point of view," said Manning.
On Thursday, Manning announced that he was arrested and transferred to Kuwait, where he was held for almost two months before being transferred to Quantico Marine Base Prison in Virginia in July 2010.
He said that in Kuwait he had considered the suicide and had become unconscious once because of the heat.
Not to know what is happening to him or to the outside world has been taxing.
"My world fell on Camp Arafjon, on this cage together," said Manning on Thursday.
I thought I was going to die in that cage.
When he was transferred to Quantico, Manning spent most of his days in a small cell - at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours - and without society.
You only allowed him a mattress, a blanket, flip flops, clothes and glasses.
Manning said he tried to keep moving because in the day he was forbidden to sleep or to lay down.
He always had to sleep with light that got into his cell from the outside.
When he turned around at night and couldn't see his face again, he was awakened so that he turned back.
In January 2011, Manning's lawyer formally protested against the treatment of Manning.
In April 2011, Manning was transferred to the military prison of Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
On Friday, Judge Manning also asked for an accusation that he had made in his statement on Thursday - so he had to sleep naked in his cell in Quantico a night and in a morning counting he had to stand naked in front of guards and other prisoners.
Manning had said that during this counting he had never had the opportunity to wrap himself around with his ceiling.
On Friday's questioning, Manning said that he had closed from an order of his guard that he should have dropped the ceiling with which he could have covered himself, but he admitted that no one had asked him to do so.
On Thursday, Manning had declared that he was forced to sleep naked the previous night. He had tried to show an official that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning told the official that he could have used the waistband of his underpants or flip flops to hurt himself, but he could not have done so.
That night, Manning said, his underpants, flip flops and glasses were removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that the judge will at least take his detention experiences into account and dramatically reduce his detention measures, he should be sentenced to the military court during his trial, which is appointed for the beginning of next year.
The defense has indicated that manning will confess lower crimes for guilty, while other charges that are considered to be too extreme are to be challenged.
The continuation of the hearing is scheduled for this weekend. The prosecutor's office is expected to justify the terms of detention.
The Pentagon remains in its position that Manning has been detained in accordance with the provisions applicable to all prisoners held in Quantico under the highest security arrangements.
The charges against Manning include the favor of the enemy, the unlawful publication of intelligence information on the Internet, the transmission of national defence information and the theft of public property or documents.
If he is found guilty in all charges, he is threatened with a life sentence.
My Mexican-American identity crisis.
Many people have been forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to accuse the immigrants - they call them hard times in memory, he says.
Navarrette believes that Mexican Americans are trapped between two worlds
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had just crossed the hall and had arrived at the passport inspection when inconsistency in me widened.
Markers referred to two queues: one for "mexicanos" ("mexicans"), another for "extranjeros" ("for foreigners").
I stood there for a few seconds, insecure, to which I should go.
I grew up in Central California and was known as Mexicans all my life.
An ethnic code - just as my friends in Boston call themselves "Iren" or my friends in New York "Italyer".
Later, I decided to "Mexican-American".
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's home there was no need for accelerator or binding lines.
I was just Americans.
I speak Spanish, at least good enough to claim in this language at both ends of an interview.
But I don't have the vocabulary of a native speaker, and neither do I get rid of my American accent.
So I took my American passport and put myself in the queue for Extranjeros.
I thought about the moment this week when future Mexican President Enrique Pena Nito visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
On the agenda were all the issues expected when the heads of these two countries meet: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nicho was also very interested in talking about the growth of the Mexican economy. She is a reason for Mexicans to stay in Mexico with the same probability today rather than emigrate to the United States.
He wants to allied with the United States and Canada and to create a North American trade block based on the model of the European Union.
And Pena Nito vowed to continue the war of Mexico against the drug cartels, even though he did not mention any details in this regard.
Mexico's relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resentment.
Most Americans probably never waste a single thought that the United States invaded Mexico in 1848 and forced the country's leadership under guard to leave them more than half of their territory.
But for Mexicans who think in centuries and not in minutes, memories of this event are not to be overlooked.
So once a U.S. government official practices only mildest criticism of Mexico, one hears complaints in the Mexican press and among the elites of the country about how Americans are threatening the sovereignty of their neighboring country.
And the children of Montezumas go on the war path.
And yet, the biggest challenge of Mexico is in truth in the relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
Want to talk about resentments?
There's more than enough.
Mexico has winners and losers. People for whom the country offers opportunities, and others for which it does not.
The only reason why so many people live in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that at one point in our family tree a person - perhaps a parent or grandparents - was offered no chance in Mexico and emigrated northwards.
And in most cases this person corresponded to a profile - dark-skinned, uneducated, from a poor village, etc.
We are the descendants of these people, and our faithfulness is for them.
Not Mexico.
And although we may now be living the American dream, visiting good schools and getting good jobs, we must never lose sight of the American dream we live - not the Mexican.
Our identity may sometimes be blurred, but this is not the case as far as our loyalty is concerned.
This is clearly true of the United States.
In addition, we are aware that many members of the Mexican leadership do not like us.
This is based on reciprocity.
They see us as a memorial of a humiliating defeat and look down on us because we are not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our bonds to Mexico will never be strong enough.
In your opinion, our existence is a symbol of failure.
If our families hadn't failed in Mexico, they wouldn't have gone.
And then we would not see ourselves trapped behind the silk curtain - with a pleasant life in the United States, but somehow lost.
My wife, born in Guadalajara and legally immigrated to the United States as a child, reminds me that tensions exist between Mexicans and Mexican Americans because Mexicans have a clearer idea of who they are - and Mexican Americans take this wrong.
While a citizen of the United States, she sees herself as part of two countries.
But many Mexican Americans I know have the feeling that they are neither part of one country nor the other.
We love the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
One enjoys the best of both worlds, but none of them are rooted in them.
In Mexico we are seen as Americans.
And in the United States, we're considered Mexicans.
As I was supposed to learn during my trip, there is something that makes this relationship even more complicated: some Mexican leaders and parts of educational citizenship want to resume their connections with Diaspora.
They want to use Mexican Americans as provisional "messengers" for Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We should tell our American colleagues how great a visit to this country is and press the political leadership to intensify its ties with Mexico.
Well.
That won't happen.
Too many hurt feelings.
And in view of the unfair distribution of income, the unbridled corruption and the violence of drugs, many of us are not so sure whether it really is a great country.
I'm afraid you'll have to go through it alone, Amigos.
That's fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for dealing with Mexico one and a half centuries ago, they must also accept that some Mexican Americans have a grudge about how their family members were not treated so long ago.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more "mexican" than I thought.
Old Battles, New Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could prove to be an unexpected pillar for peace
Can there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The latest bloody events seem to suffocate such hope in the germ.
In the midst of the usual debt allocations, countless buildings were laid in rubble and ashes, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis killed - and for the first time rockets from Gaza near the Israeli metropolis Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But even though Israelis and Palestinians seem trapped in their historical conflict, the Middle East changes around them.
The Arab Spring has created a new, uncertain situation, and whether they want it or not - Palestinians and Israelis have become part of these constituencies.
Perhaps this will only lead to more bloodshed.
But there are reasons to assume that the fatal pathogen situation could finally end.
A war that is neither lost nor won
At first glance, optimism seems to be anything but appropriate in view of the current situation.
Even if the ceasefire agreed on 21 November continues, the fights of this week have strengthened the hard-doing people on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has controlled the Gaza Strip since 2007, will claim to have pushed the Israelis back, even though its group itself had to face huge losses.
Although several Hamas leaders are killed and the 1.7 million inhabitants of the Gaza Strip are impoverished in one of the most disolad and densely populated corners of the planet, Israel has not yet succeeded in destroying Hamas.
In fact, Hamas wins in the West Bank, which is controlled by the rival, moderate Palestinian group Fatah.
And the Hamas leaders could come to the conclusion that they have the time on their side.
As Islamists in the Arab world have gained influence, Hamas has been able to draw powerful and rich friends to their side.
Turkey, a resurgent regional power that once considered Israel's closest Muslim ally, has taken hold for the Hamas Party - just like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf States.
Astonishing Hamas followers believe that Israel is an Islamist half moon - from Lebanon to the north, where the military Hezbollah has power, over Syria, where rebels could stand an increasingly Islamist minting before the fall of Bashar Assads, to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
In particular, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under President Muhammad Mursi in Egypt - the most populous and most important Arab country by far - in the southern flank of Israel has changed the balance of the region sustainably.
Hosni Mubarak, the Lazist Despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had little time left for Hamas.
In contrast, the brotherhood with Hamas is weakened and its leaders are more dependent on popular views.
In future diplomatic negotiations, Hamas could prove to be an actor who can't even be pushed out by Israel and the United States.
The Israeli hardliners, on the other hand, draw an opposite conclusion.
Militaryly, Hamas is no longer a danger.
The Israeli missile defense system, Iron Dome, has been able to prove itself and many of the Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
At least for a while, Israel will be able to sleep calmly.
In diplomatic terms, the United States is unshakably holding to its position. Many European countries have blamed Hamas for the latest violence settlements.
Israel has been doing well in recent years, especially among Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets from the Gaza Strip have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, the country has remained relatively free of suicide terrorists - not least thanks to the lockouts that have been going into the West Bank and thus into the main part of any Palestinian state. However, they protect the Jewish settlements, which have been declared against international law, are being extended ever further.
Netanyahu is standing well. His Likud party has allied itself in the run-up to the elections on January 22nd under Avigdor Lieberman with an even more combatious group.
Why do these insidious Palestinians also stifle and leave them their own state?
If they actually had control over the West Bank, would they not also fire rockets just like their competitors in the Gaza Strip?
No, it's better to keep them in check behind the wall and punish them if they dare to raise their heads.
Perhaps the hardliners will be able to stand by, but the Arab Spring could make a break through the bill.
Even if the Islamists, now in power in Egypt and in other countries, have little left for Israel, they will first focus on the difficulties in their own country.
The defense set of Israel is larger than that of its four Arab neighbors together.
A war with the local superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments to repair their economy.
The fact that pragmatic President Mursi joined Barack Obama in order to achieve a ceasefire could be a promising sign - and perhaps symbolize the beginning of a new era.
Israelis too should think more long-term.
While the rest of the Arab world is taking obvious steps towards democratization, Palestinians are still deprived of their right of self-determination - a powder barrel that will undoubtedly explode some day in the Israeli occupied territories, just as this week a bus exploded in Tel Aviv.
The repression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state, and the growth of the Arab population will only intensify this situation.
Bloody missions to repress Hamas in Gaza will increasingly demand their diplomatic tribute over the years.
Both sides need an external attack
The right answer is that represented by the more reasonable representatives of both sides, the majority of the rest of the world and by this newspaper: two states in which Israel resigns areas for security purposes.
The hope - small for the near future - is that the ceasefire will give out more influence to enforce this solution.
Egypt must now, together with Turkey and Qatar, stop the supply of arms in the Gaza Strips and is better positioned than ever before to convince Hamas of the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, supplemented by territorial exchange and a common Jerusalem.
Outside Arab nations should also move Hamas and Fatah to an agreement.
This would do more for the creation of a Palestinian state than for the forthcoming UN observer status application.
Obama, too, must contribute to moving Israel into negotiations.
During his first term of office, he failed to imagine his own peace plan.
Far away from the White House, it seems as if it were just like a repudiation.
But this is a regrettable, short-sighted perspective.
The United States has a major interest in a stable Middle East.
And this is a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australian laws on uniform cigarette packaging enter into force
Health warnings and diseased body parts on neutral green packs that are the same for all tobacco brands
The world’s first laws on uniform cigarette and tobacco packaging have entered into force in Australia, replacing brand logos and colours with neutral, olive-green lids, which are also printed with drastic pictures showing sick body parts and mammals and children affected by cigarette smoke.
Apart from the different health warnings and pictures once in a while, the only difference between the packs in the brand names printed in identical, small letters will occur next Saturday.
Australia thus introduces the world's most stringent regulations for tobacco packaging.
The Australian Federal Government wants to dissuade young people from smoking by removing the glamorous image of tobacco consumption.
The government expects studies that have shown that people who have not yet started smoking with 26 will not start with 99% chance after that.
"You can already see in children's young age that they understand the message to try to apply the tobacco companies with their brand image," says Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek. She quotes studies that have shown, for example, that children associate the crown of a logo with the idea of a princess.
Although Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and the changes will have a slight impact on the profits of multinational corporations, other countries are already considering similar steps.
The tobacco lobby fought hard against the laws.
The laws would favour the black market trade, which would lead to cheaper and easier-to-access cigarettes.
"The laws will lead to serious, accidental consequences," says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobago Australia.
Chinese and Indonesian counterfeiters will offer far larger quantities of these products on the streets of Australia.
Others, on the other hand, say that the laws have encouraged their business.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, notes that since the British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco companies failed to comply with the laws two months ago to cover the unbearable packaging.
Zico sold up to 6,000 units of wholesale shops and waited for new stocks.
For us, this is a good business.
According to experts, the focus is on the popularity of social media with exactly the population group addressed by the plan.
A number of Australian laws have banished tobacco companies from TV advertising, forbidding them to act as sports sponsors and forced most traders to stop spending cigarettes in stores. Now tobacco advertising has changed to the Internet.
The Australian government has banned Internet advertising by local companies and sites, but has no influence on international sites.
"Whoever markets tobacco and only has a small area to apply for its products does not come around the Internet," says Becky Freeman, researcher in health care at the University of Sydney.
On social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, Freeman identified an increase in experience reports on brands written by "very normal people".
You have to ask yourself the question: Is this just a private person who finds so great a favor with Marlboro cigarettes that she even takes a video for it - or does a marketing agency have to do with it?
British American Tobacco Australia says that instead of focusing on marketing, the industry is focusing on dealing with the new laws.
It has even gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to fight the new rules - those countries complain at the World Trade Organisation about unfair trade restrictions, although none of the countries are trading larger with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected for mid-2013.
According to Plibersek, the government has held talks with other countries considering similar packaging laws.
In 2001, Canada was the first country to provide photographic warnings.
They have now been extended to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Harder laws are being considered in Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many Australian smokers show themselves defiant.
The pictures don't affect me.
I'm just ignoring them.
"You just take a chicken and put away the box," says Victor El Hage when you buy a cigarette box, where a photo with a mouth tumor is printed.
Honestly, there's only one reason I'd stop, and that's my little girl.
James Yu, operator of tobacco trade "King of the Pack" in downtown Sydney, says that the uniform packaging has made filling of its shelves difficult.
"Before, I needed an hour to sort a delivery, now I need four," says Yu.
"The government should have simply banned cigarettes completely - then we would have said okay, that's it, we're closing," he clearly adds.
In a constantly electrified world it is nice to be bored even once
This Thanksgiving I spent unexpectedly five hours at the airport when our plane was down due to mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane.
So I had enough time to make a few thoughts of boredom.
I don't want to lie.
Waiting for a flight at the airport for half a day is quite annoying - even when books, magazines and iPhones (and, of course, tax-free shopping) are available.
But more and more academics and child development experts are starting boredom than something positive.
When it comes to them, it is okay for us and our children to be bored at times.
This forces the brain to lose in interesting thinking, which may promote creativity.
And because most of us are almost constantly staring at one screen or another these days, the benefits of boredom are no longer beneficial to us.
So should we welcome the boredom with open arms?
Yeah.
And no.
I'll come back to that.
Like many people, I always assumed that boredom is a relatively up-to-date phenomenon that has developed with increasing leisure time.
But Peter Tooohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011) does not see that as it is.
"In fact, boredom has a very long history," he says.
The walls of Pompeii adorn a Latin graffiti over boredom that dates back to the first century.
And then there is the question of how we define boredom.
According to John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada, the problem is that boredom has been defined and discussed in many ways.
After a long reading of research literature and the presentation of the idea in front of a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues concluded that boredom can be defined as the experience of "doing a satisfying activity, but not be able to do so".
Boredom differs from apathy, as a result, that the person is not busy but wants to be.
In apathy, on the other hand, there is no urge to do something.
The key experience of boredom, he says, lies in a "disturbing of the attention process, paired with bad mood and the feeling that time is slow".
It can be a bit of a feeling of depression.
But Professor Eastwood, although these two states could be associated, see bored people see the problem in their environment or the world, while depressed people see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we believe that we are boring, even if we have only difficulties focusing.
In her study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention" - to German for example: "The Incessant Mind: The Definition of Boring Under the Aspect of Attention" published in September in the journal "Perspectives on Psychological Science", Professor Eastwood and his colleagues pointed to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a tape on which a person read a magazine article.
Some groups heard a loud television program from the neighboring room that had nothing to do with the content. Others listened to low volume, so it was hardly noticeable, while the third group did not know these sounds at all.
The people who heard the barely audible television said they had more boredom than the two other groups - they had problems focusing on themselves, could not find any reason for this and wrote their difficulties of boredom.
If one tries to focus on a difficult or strenuous task, the disturbance of attention can lead to boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, associate professor of neurosciences at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, if you pursue a monotonous activity - "as well as looking for faulty products on a factory conveyor belt, music can distract and help not to feel bored".
In fact, he says, we now know that herums and critches, often interpreted as signs of boredom, can even fight them by keeping people physically more attentive.
"Studies have shown that children who are allowed to knock around learn more and keep more information than those who are forced to sit still," says Professor Fenske.
At some point we all get bored - my late flight, a dreary speaker, a particularly tiring film.
But some people are more bored than others.
In order to measure these differences, researchers developed a "scale for boredom vulnerability" in the 1980s.
On the scale, statements like "Many things I have to do are repeated and monotonous" and "I have so many interests that I don't have enough time for everything".
With the help of such scales, researchers have found that boys are often more bored than girls, says Stephen Vodovich, professor of psychology at the University of Westflorida - especially in terms of the need for more and a greater variety of external stimuli.
But, in general, teenagers are a pretty tight bunch.
In 1991, Reed Larson, professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted almost 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day with a Pager.
He found that 32% of those who grew up were bored in school and doing homework, while 23% said they were bored if they were not in school.
But only 3% of the parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson says today, 21 years later, he does not know whether the percentages of boredom have increased or decreased.
However, he was sure that "youth is considered to be particularly boring", because children and teenagers do not have a great influence on their everyday life.
So back to my original question: Is boredom healthy?
Sometimes not, because in extreme cases, it causes people to take extreme physical risks and fall into gambling or drugs to relieve them - this has shown studies.
On the other hand, many philosophers and authors examine the relationship between boredom and creativity. This opinion is Professor Vodanovich, who has researched the subject for more than two decades.
"With boredom, the brain wants to tell you that you should do something different," said Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at New York University.
But the brain doesn't always know what to do.
If you're bored and you use this energy to play and cook guitar, you'll be happy.
However, television may in the short term lead to feelings of happiness, but in the long term it will flee again.
So if you have an iPad enough for your bored child, you can take it away from the boredom. However, it has not learned to entertain or control yourself, says Professor Fenske.
And he adds: "Self control is transferred from one situation to another".
The child not only learns to talk but also receives more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we should celebrate boredom.
Nor should we see them too critical.
Instead, our goal should be to make us feel comfortable away from constant activity and technology.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"It sounds like we have to be more boring. But boredom is the tormenting, incessant desire to do something meaningful," he says.
He believes that, in truth, people are only looking for a way, turning off and relaxing.
"In an environment where we are constantly being overstimulated, it is difficult to get involved once the noise is blurred."
In Colorado there is no clear guideline for the new marijuana law
The 19-year-old community college student and football player Anthony Orozco stands in the southeast Colorado for a crime that will soon be legal in this state: the possession of some fewer marijuana brokes and a pipe with which he smoked them.
According to Orozco, he and some friends were traveling on a September day by car in Lamar near the border to Kansas when they were stopped.
After the police officer had found marijuana in the car, Orozco was charged for possession of drugs and drug utensils - cavalier offences, each with a penalty of $100 - and received a court order.
"We are treated like criminals," says Orozco.
But is he also one?
In the uncertain weeks following the decision of the state to legalize small amounts of marijuana for self-use, the answer depends less on the law than on the location for hundreds of smaller drug offences.
Hundreds of infringements of the law that revolve around marijuana have already been dropped here and in the Washington State, which has approved similar measures.
The police authorities no longer track adults for possession to a small extent over 21 years. This is allowed by law as soon as the new laws enter into force in the next weeks.
But prosecutors in the more conservative districts of Colorado have announced that they continue to pursue existing marijuanaides and still quote people in court.
At the same time, several cities, from the suburbs of Denver to the Western Mountains, agree to prevent new, publicly licensed marijuana businesses from opening up to their communities.
"This situation develops so quickly that I don't even know what will happen next," says Daniel J. Oates, chief of police in Aurora, which is located east of Denver.
And regulators in the state of Washington are also guessing.
They are waiting for guidance to set up a licensing system for the production, manufacture, distribution and sale of the drug - with a deadline until 1 December 2013.
In Washington, it is considered that Colorado is in any case ahead of most states as far as the regulation of marijuana is concerned. There, the drug was legalized for medical purposes and then for self-consumption.
"Colorado has a more regulated market. The state is therefore good for orientation," says Brian E. Smith, spokesperson of the Supervisory Authority for Spirits in Washington.
But Smith also admits that no place or system can do more than serve in the sense of a rough guide.
"We don't have a real precedent that we can follow," he adds.
The Washington law, called I-502, enters into force on 6 December, thus also forming the endpoint of a grey zone in which the state licensing system does not exist yet but is legalized.
And unpleasant practical questions need to be clarified at this time - for example, how the state requirement of "appropriate access" to licensed marijuana is to be agreed with the prohibition of cannabis business around 300 meters around schools, parks, playgrounds and child care facilities.
"Nevertheless, it will be harder to find a location for a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the Seattle conurbation area," says Ben Livingston, spokesperson for the "Center for Legal Cannabis", a recently formed research group.
On November 21st, Chief Oates sent his employees in Aurora an e-mail in which he stated that the prosecutor would no longer persecute smaller marijuana law in persons over 21 years of age, and that the police would not "absolute" any criminal charges for these crimes.
Chief Oates added that the police would continue to enforce urban requirements for the regulation of growers of medical marijuana and drug dealers would continue to pursue.
In Weld County in Northern Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck represents a more stringent view.
After the vote, he stated that his authority would continue to follow cases of marijuana ownership, mainly in order to move consumers to withdrawal.
Currently 119 persons must be held responsible for the possession of about 50 grams or less marijuana in court, although many were also charged with other offences.
"Our authority has the duty to prosecute violations that were at the time of the crime," Buck stated in a statement.
The reactions are even swirling in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the county, no longer show adults for the possession of smaller quantities.
District attorney Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, but also decided not to drop all outstanding property procedures.
"I don't think I'm wasting my time trying to enforce the right until it changes," he says.
Although 55% of the voters in Colorado supported the measure, it was clear from the outset that it would not be easy to reconcile the personal consumption of marijuana with the complexity of government and legal system.
And the contradictory reactions of local officials throughout the state promoted a profound point of view of the great green experiment.
In District Prosecutors, it is a "cultural barrier", says Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver, who represents defendants for marijuana law and acts on the ground as spokesperson for the national organisation for the reform of marijuana laws.
"They have spent such a large part of their lives persecuting people in criminal law that they still can't accept the legalisation," he believes.
As the first states to treat smaller quantities of marijuana such as alcohol, Colorado and Washington are traded as national models for the legalisation of drugs.
While advocates and public officials are preparing for an age of legal sales, they are also nervously waiting for instructions from the Federal Government that continue to treat the sale and cultivation of marijuana as a criminal offence at the federal level.
Advocates of the legislative movement hope that the Ministry of Justice will surrender.
Despite several spectacular arrests by consumers and sellers of medical marijuana, the Federal Government has largely allowed the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
Kevin A. Sabet, former drug-political adviser to Obama's government, believes that while criminals are unlikely to enter doors to attack smaller amounts of drugs, they are likely to push themselves to tolerate legal, state-regulated marijuana business under the new legislation.
Several cities in Colorado are not waiting for the federal authorities to act.
Even before the election day, some local authorities approved Moratories for new marijuana business, although they could only open in about a year.
Last week, Montrose, a city in the West, decided a six-month ban, which is likely to be adopted next week.
"We don't want to get into a position where we license someone and then face a big problem at the federal level," said Bob Nicholson, member of the City Council.
Our community has voted against this amendment.
We refer to what the community has decided to do and not to what the State has decided to do.
Still many questions are open.
Petronella Wyatt: I was mobed from Oxford because I'm Tory
Not only university students of today are attacked for their views
Always had it been my greatest dream to get a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had attended that university, which I once thought was the world's largest stamp of knowledge, for a modern Greek symposia that promoted the great pillars of civilization - free thinking and tolerance.
But within two weeks of my move to Worscester College at the end of the eighties - there I had planned to study history - I had again packed my suitcase and brought the first scandal of my life.
My father broke into tears.
My friends were confused.
In the Evening Standard, it was said that I would have gone because I had a problem with having commilitons in the neighboring room having sex.
The author A N Wilson said she had left the university because I was forced to drink from damaged cups.
But the truth was less amusing.
I ran away.
Yeah, ran, because I suffered from systematic mobbing and threats.
Not because of my rather unusual name, or because I came from a private school.
It was only for one reason that I was harassed - a reason that seemed so narrower and more cruel in this supposed cradle of enlightenment: My now deceased father Woodrow Wyatt had been an important consultant Margaret Thatchers and I supported the Conservative Party.
Why do I mention this right now?
Well, current reports say a new generation of students of moderate rights suffers from similar persecution.
The organised and growing hatred of Tory students in Oxford has now developed such dimensions that a group of them called for the same equal rights protection last week to benefit gay, disabled and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Junior Common Room (JCR) of the Corpus Christi College indicate that they are "often actively isolated, personally attacked and declared undesirable" because of their political views.
They call for a place in the equality committee of their college to ensure that their opinions can be expressed freely.
Her situation was worsened by a recently broadcast documentary on political students on BBC Two, "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right", which Tories represented as eccentric and neonazis.
It was shown, among other things, that graduate Joe Cooke, former president of the Conservative Student Association of Oxford University, who drove in a Rolls-Royce and prostrated with silver suit and silver-covered grating.
At other universities conservative students say they are considered to be "sündenböcke für die Einsatzer Studiengele".
The 20-year-old Luke Black, Vice President of the Conservative Student Association of Nottingham University, announced in a Sunday newspaper: "There is a growing left-wing trend at universities.
People think we're like the Bullingdon Club without even getting to know us."
Samuel Roberts, 21 and histories student in Corpus Christi, who initiated the request for greater protection, is of the opinion that such a climate is "unfortunate". 19-year-old Stephanie Cherill, president of the Conservative Student Association of Oxford, said that she had observed a growing rejection of moderate rights students in JCR members.
"This is a danger to the intellectual discourse and the well-being of the members," she says.
In my first weeks in Oxford, I belonged to such a minority.
As an incredibly shy 18-year-old, I had arrived in September 1986.
The hatred for the Conservative Party had reached its height.
In the previous year, the University voted not to grant Margaret Thatcher - a former student - an honorary title due to cuts in higher education.
The atmosphere would even have startled Stalinists.
In the first few days of the First semester week, when new students meet and the tutorials, I was given a foretaste on the future events.
I made the experience that the tutorials did not only tolerate the derision of Tory students, but even took part in it with joys.
Political issues such as the miners' strike, the privatisation and the rejection of sanctions against the apartheid regime of South Africa found their way into the wood-feded rooms of the tutorial.
At my first of these events, I should translate French texts from the 18th century into English. To what would come then I had not been understood.
"Miss Wyatt," said Tutor Harry Pitt (in the middle of the story), "please translate the first paragraph."
I stumbled.
Pitt was a little man with a face like a cake dough, and quite hesitant.
"Do thatcher supporters refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?" he asked me.
The other students were tickling.
Tears opened up in my eyes.
"I suggest that you take a few French hours in your leisure time - so if you are not too busy with your social activities," Pitt told me.
I returned to my room with a hanging head.
That evening, I was sitting at college alone at dinner when someone easily tipped me on my shoulder.
It was an English student from the second year called James, who presented himself as a member of the conservative student association.
"I know who you are," he said kindly.
Unfortunately, it's how it is.
Anyone who is suspected of being Tory will be urged.
It's bad enough for me, but they know your father Margaret Thatcher is close, so it's gonna be worse for you.
Most Tory's first semesters suggest being Labour's followers.
In a local pub, I later tried to adjust.
I insisted that I didn't agree on all the points with Mrs. Thatcher.
This trick should prove unsuccessful.
A study beginner in philosophy, politics, and economy, who ironically attended Eton College, which was a conservative, said to me, "You are the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're dirty.
Other students shared his opinion.
I was perverse and dirty.
"How do Tories have sex?" someone asked me.
They beat each other, don't they?
I felt how homosexuals must have felt before the more liberal legislation of the United States.
Would I ever be able to live a normal life at Oxford University?
Would I be able to meet like-minded people only after the fall of darkness?
Should I turn to the Labour Party and suppress my natural inclinations?
The three years ahead of me extended to a purgatory of awe and isolation in front of my spiritual eye.
The only tutor to be recognized as Tory was Norman Stone, professor of contemporary history, who had his seat in my college.
He was hated not only to be a conservative, but also because he had advised thatcher on foreign policy matters and had written speeches for them.
He was rarely there.
He hated the place, found him provincial and minor and rejected him for his Marxist-Determinist historical perspective.
In 1997, he accepted a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he told me.
I started to commute between Oxford and my parents' home and found refuge with more open friends and family members in the city.
My father told me I hated Oxford, and why I did it.
He seemed disbelief.
During his time in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said.
They would never do anything like this, not in my city of the dreaming towerheads.
Even my communist friends always showed flawless manners.
His moist eyes were sorcerering.
Give the whole thing a chance.
I'm sure they're just nailing you.
It would break my heart if you went.
Exhausted by my frequent travels to London, my emotional resistance became weaker.
One of my male friends, also Tory followers, had given up the pressure and denied his convictions.
During a tutorial the following week, in which another historian seriously claimed that I was "an enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
Although I secretly broke in front of shame, I admitted that my parents had subjected me to a "brainwash", and called them "old fool".
The relief took only a short time.
It was my father who put the last nail in the coffin of my Oxford career.
At that time he wrote two columns a week in the Murdoch press.
My door was locked.
I was hiding in my room, and after five minutes, my deers gave up.
When they went, I took a suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never returned.
I'd like you to call me a whimpery cock.
But no 18-year-old should ever have to suffer from such intimidation and malice in an educational institution.
And even more tragic is that it was Oxford – a university that not only produced 14 Tory Prime Ministers, but is still hidden behind an undeserved reputation of equal rights and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance of fame"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino - Master of Couture", which was opened in London this week, ABC speaks to Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of the Italian fashionmaker.
Somerset House, the former residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital, worthy of hosting an exhibition about Valentino Garavani.
This has been recognized by the designer at the opening of "Valentino - Master of Couture", a magnificent retrospective for which more than 130 clothes of the Haute Couture have been put together, created by his "Maison" in the last 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with his distinctive Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story whose only protagonist is "il signore" Garavani, but which could not have been written without his distinguished clientele.
Valentino has always felt fascination for the embroidered and distant world of the nobility.
In the first hall of this exhibition, which will be seen until March 3, there will be a variety of private letters and photos with the signature of the most outstanding aristocracy, starting from Princess Salimah Aga Khan, across the Princess Marie Chantal of Greece and Margarita from England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino shows these personal memories as the trophies of his social rise from humble fashionists in the city of Voghera in Northern Italy to the idol of the international jet set.
Being in love with the nobility does not have to be detrimental.
"At least, they don't put their chickens on your magnificent carpet, as some beautiful celebrities do from pop music," says Baronin Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 60s and 70s they both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular, generous and elegant host.
"We all rejoiced when we were invited to his house in Gstaad," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, close friends with forgotten beauties such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred the elegance of fame.
And yet he's a star.
Valeria Mazza, in a dress by Valentino
The Argentinian model Valeria Mazza also does not forget the charisma of the fashion maker.
Many years ago, after a fashion show at Piazza di Spagna in Rome, we went home for dinner.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
At every detail of his apartment, decoration, food and music one recognized and felt his influence.
"All invited people felt important and loved," recalls the "Top Model", which started their career at the week of Haute Couture 1995 in Paris.
"He never comes out of fashion because his designs are works of art," she concludes.
Fashion Show of Origin
The life of Garavani is not a story of obscurity, rather of mutual love.
He likes people with good education and the highest titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries in Somerset House has been transformed into a glorious and 60-metre runway that suggests a role replacement: the user takes the place of the model and goes along the runway to admire a fantastic "audy" that carries the masterpieces of Valentino, such as the dress Jackie Kennedy chose for her wedding with Aristoteles Onassis, the costumes that Monica Vitti wore in "La Notte", or a coat of wool and leather that belonged to the empress Farah Diba.
In this audience of fashion dolls, names shine like that of Sibilla de Luxembourgo, Gloria of Thurn and Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sofía of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and fashion maker, 2006
Many of these girls say the first Valentino is like the first love, "unforgettable".
I remember perfectly.
It was a pants, a shirt, a vest type "Gillette" and a jacket from the fall/winter collection 1971-1972.
"It was a gift from him," says Naty Abascal, one of the designers' museums.
"I prefer him to everyone else because of his great love for women and because he highlights our beauty," adds the ex-Herzog of Feria.
I like the colors he uses very much; they have a lot of light and underline the face.
The proportions are perfect.
The princess and opinion leader at the Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg can't forget for the first time when she wore a Valentino.
When I was a teenager in Italy, I dreamt of having the age and the opportunity to wear one of his evening clothes...
At the end of the 90's it finally came to pass.
I bought my first Valentino dress for a festival in my cousin's castle, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress with flying skirt and a draped top with a decolleté that makes its name honour.
"It was a dream that came true," says Rodrigo d'Arenberg's widow.
"Valentino doesn't depend on fashion, his possession is timeless," explains this Italian aristocrat who lives between París, New York and Buenos Aires.
The Princess D'Arenberg preserves her evening clothes of the fashion maker "with absolute care", "because a dress is not only a dress, but also the associated memories".
The "king" of fashion
The grand finale of the exhibition in Somerset House is the wedding dress of Marie-Channel Miller for her wedding with Pablo de Grecia in 1995.
Four months of work and 25 "Ragazze" (as the fashionmaker called his neighbors) were necessary to make this eleven-legged silk dress with pearls, twelve different embroiderys and a four and a half-meter-long tail.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the supreme authority of the specialist press, this dress was a milestone in the Haute Couture at the end of the 20th century, "the return to the customers of the highest society".
For years with the "savoir-être" of the elite, Valentino is now her best copy.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest award in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, awarded with honorary legion, Garavani accumulates as many honors as each of his customers' husbands.
"I have always noticed his refining, his calmness, his well-kept and perfect exterior," says D'Arenberg.
I saw him the last time a month ago at a gala dinner at the Museum de Orsay.
He sat at the table of the Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a very good friend of mine.
"He was flawless; the time left no traces on him."
And this says a princess...
The most difficult occupation in the world: the human working animals of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the carriers of the Indonesian volcano risk their lives and health when they carry 70 kilos of sulfur over the steep, rocky paths.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and others literally work in hell.
This is the case with Anto Weyaya, one of the 400 miners who earn their lives by bringing sulfur out of the volcano Kawah Ijen in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
For this purpose, he must climb down to the ground of his crater every day, where the sulphurous gas flowing out of the earth is solidified in contact with the air.
After breaking out large sulphur stones that can weigh up to 70 kilos in total, he transports them into two bamboo baskets on his shoulders over the wasteful paths of stone.
It is only 250 meters to the top of the volcano, which rises to a height of 2386 meters, but the exhausted carriers need more than 40 minutes to climb the turtle rate, keeping the balance and taking careful steps so that they do not slip out and fall down.
You know that every step can cost her life, as happened to a French tourist who crashed years ago on the steep slopes of the Kawah Ijen.
Kawah Ijen's mine workers earn 5 Eurocents for every kilo of sulphur they decompose.
Arriving at the top, they pave the way between the tourists who photograph them like circus monkeys and walk with the tiredly heavy baskets three kilometers to the scale which a mine company has placed a little further down at an altitude of 1850 meters
The society is PT Candi Ngrimbi, who since 1960 has exploited the occurrence in the volcano and (not better) its workers, to whom she pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 Eurocents) for each kilo of sulfur.
This is then sold to the petrochemical industry for each 10,000 rupees (83 Eurocents) because this mineral is widely used in everyday life and is used for the production of matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even for sugar bleaching.
"As we normally carry 70 kg, we receive approximately 46,000 rupies (3.8 euros) for each way," Anto tells us, who normally makes three routes a day.
He needs three hours for each route, after which he has been fully managed, but at the end of the day he then has 138,000 rupies (11,5 euros) together.
What looks like a miserable wage for such a sheer inhuman effort, but is the triple of what he would earn with field labor.
"The daily wage of the miners here, where 15,000 rupies (1.2 euros) are paid a day at the coffee harvest and the average monthly income is two million rupies (167 euros), is very high," explains the carrier who previously worked as a maurer on the tourist island of Bali.
There he earned 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day, and the work was not so hard, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village nearby, and that for a reason that is as important in Indonesia as the sulfur: "I married a girl from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I brought her to Java to convert her to Islam".
Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, frequently coughs and his eyes are irritated because of the toxic gases.
The 27-year-old Anto has been putting his life on the Kawah Ijen for three years, whose sulfur has already left his first traces, although he covers his face with a mask and special eyeglasses.
Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, often coughs and his eyes are irritated because of the toxic gases from the volcano.
This is the price he must pay for the achievement of his dream.
"I'm going to work here for two more years because I want to open a store or learn Spanish or French," he promises in a more than just acceptable English.
This sympathetic and intelligent young man, who is punished by life, could work as a tourist guide, waitress or at the reception of a hotel, but instead he does the work of a wearing.
It divides a dirty wooden hut with other carriers and stands up every morning at two o'clock, because the sulfur also flows out at night, where its characteristic yellow color shines bluish in the darkness.
Challengeing the shadows, he rises in the crater in the light of a small headlight on his helmet, which he bought from his own money.
About 400 carriers load the baskets with sulphur on their shoulders at the crater floor.
Despite its great profits, the mine company has not mechanized sulphur reduction to save costs, and does not provide any equipment to the carriers that work on their own account and are paid by weight.
They also do not receive a share of the 30,000 rupies (2.5 euros) supplement per camera, which the guards of this nature park, together with the entrance fee of 15,000 rupies (1.2 euros) demand from tourists who come to photograph the volcano and the human carrier.
"This work is for animals and not for man" protests Madrusin, a stamming 42-year-old carrier who has been working for three decades since leaving school at Kawah Ijen.
He is able to carry up to 110 kg and assured that he continues, "as long as it goes", because he needs the money for the education of his three children between the ages of 10 and 18.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano was my whole life.
Even if the sulfur burns the throat and yokes the eyes, when the wind suddenly turns and the miners clamp into the thick columns that rise out of the crater, the men are so hard that no one complains about severe diseases ... of course except the usual breathing problems, arthrosis, pain in the knees and bladders on the shoulders that have deformed themselves from the weight of the basket.
With the basket on its back, Unainik with its 53 years is only able to carry 50 kg.
Every day, he and his companions break 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which are transported from three trucks by a goat path between the bush and the camp in Tamansari at 18 kilometers distance.
"I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano was my whole life," explains Unainik, opening his mouth wide, in which some teeth are missing.
Of its five children, the elder works with his 30 years as a sulfur-carrier.
The time passes, but poverty continues generation in one of the hardest occupations in the world: the one who works as a human burden cell on Kawah Ijen.
Singapore needs babies to save the economy
The Singaporeians blame for having no children, for the career, stress and cost of real estate and child education.
"The population of Singapore must grow."
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife: We fulfill our civil duty and create life!
It seems unbelievable that the verses are part of an advertisement for minz bonus, but still - or precisely so - they became a viral video on YouTube at the beginning of this year in Singapore.
The sentences are part of a rapper song, the local sayings such as "Schiven becomes a "bao" (laib) in the oven to make fun of the low birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising company BBH, who shot the video, holds the hope that the commercial spot will reach in a funny way to draw attention to the problem.
Her creative director Douglas Hamilton says that he wanted to use the power of music to get people to fulfill their "national duty".
This is something for the Internet only, so we had to make it funny and funny.
This is the biggest problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world in the field of reproduction, so we noticed that this is an issue that we had to worry about.
We knew that the government had tried many things, such as marketing perfumes with pheromones or organizing speed dating evenings (fast flirts).
Possible that many of these ideas were creative, but they did not necessarily lead to success.
So we thought, why don't we make something as creative as possible to tackle this problem as a rap, for example?
1.2 Children
Whoever does not take this issue easily is the government of Singapore.
Every year, she spends $1,300 on political measures to stimulate citizens to get more children.
A package of government for couples and parents provides up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax advantages.
But everything has so far had little success.
Singapore is a rich, high-tech city state in the southeast of Asia, which is also known for the conservativeism of its rulers and its strict social controls.
According to its national authority, the birth rate is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time this rate was above 2 - which is also known as the replacement rate - was in 1976.
So why don't the Singaporeians get more children?
Tan Wei Ming, Director of Marriage and Family Policy of the National Population Authority, says that this is due to "better training" and "greater career opportunities".
"This has enabled people, except to marry and form a family, to have much more options in terms of living goals and to set priorities," she explains.
These changes in social conditions have contributed to the higher number of singles and to the delay in marriages and births, the result of which is the reduction of the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, immigration policy aimed at a drastic increase in immigration in order to combat the reduction of the population led to resentments in the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites where the hardly cast Xenophobia blossoms against many new immigrants, especially the Chinese who are criticized for keeping the wages low and not integrating.
The rise in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the government party in Singapore achieved its worst election result since independence last year.
Since the elections, an attempt has been made to correct the problem with higher contributions and charges for foreign workers.
Unexpected Consequences
While the falling birth rate has the well-known impact on the economic growth of a nation with tax revenue, health costs and immigration policy, the example of Singapore also shows unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to achieve that not so many small apartments are built.
It has already had an impact on the housing market.
The urban development authority has begun to control the number of small apartments known as "shoe boxes" and to be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a living area of 46 square meters and show a great sales success.
However, there is a concern that they can promote the lifestyle of the single person, and that they deter the construction companies from building large homes for families.
But Lim Yew Soon, Director General of the property company EL Developers, says that his "shoe boxes" can be sold much faster than larger housing units.
They are so popular, and the units are sold out days and even weeks faster than the larger housing units.
This means that they are much better for our cash flow.
However, he admits that the new standards give the developers clearer orientations, which were previously put in the way of obstacles if they wanted to build too many small housing units within a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a state of the city.
Even if these new rules could pave the way for an increase in the national birth rate, the talks with the Singaporens working in the financial district will show that they will not have a great impact.
"The people are stressed, the apartments and also the education are expensive, which is why it is pushed out by many," says a young manager.
The children can get others.
"For me, it is important to have my own money and time," says another man, about twenty years old.
Men and women lead their careers, stress and the cost of property and education as reasons why they cannot have children.
That is why Singapore has the last word when it comes to having children - the government can still do so much.
The offline Private offline is online private
Privacy
According to the dictionary, it is the property of private or "this area of private life, where one has the right to protection against any kind of interference".
What is private for someone under 16 years of age?
How is this definition applied to its everyday life and social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he faces when he reveals in the Internet situations that he would not share in real life?
El Periódico interviewed five young people between the ages of 10 and 15 who are often on the network.
In four of the cases, they linked the term to "some very own" on a personal level and "on the password and the user" when they applied it to the social networks.
"I wouldn't announce my deepest secrets in a post," says the 10-year-old Jorge trying to explain the meaning of "private" in websites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has accounts for two years.
"These are very confidential secrets, my mother may know them, but not the whole world," he confirms.
On FB I upload beautiful pictures or pictures of games.
I'm sorry, too, about my time with friends.
"I wouldn't share a photo that's not mine, or someone who's making the fool," he says.
The boy is aware that it is wrong to publish obscene photos, of nakedness, of crime, or to write insulting or violent comments.
Jorge assured to know 35 friends he has in FB and nine followers on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
Among them also the mother who has the password to one of the accounts.
I logged in to Twitter to express myself and write interesting Tweets.
"I don't know if someone's answering me, I'm just inviting them up," he adds.
"The social networks are entertaining, I can speak quickly with relatives in the distance or with friends," he says.
He replied that he would never accept an invitation from an unknown person.
Even if someone told him a stranger, he would ignore it.
The case of 14-year-old José is different.
The teenager has user accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask. In Ask he admits that 20 of the people he has added to his list of friends.
"That doesn't scare me because we have something in common, for example music," he says.
According to the boy, no one made any announcements or asked him for his address or telephone number.
"If someone oppresses me or asks them of me, I just remove them from my user account," he admits.
José joined Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
Experience is not unknown to the boy, which is known today as cyberbullying.
A friend's acquaintance was blackmailed on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He never knew who it was," he assures.
According to José, the victim did not close the user account.
"He only made it privately."
He then explains a number of steps to safely configure a user account.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yeah, I'd do that if he's unsympathetic or I want to wipe him out.
"But I know this is cyberbullying," he explains.
Key Questions
Marielos Porras, teacher of English with university degree in education and learning, believes that to orient the children and young people must be understood that it is the purpose of social networks to inform.
"The Internet was created as a medium for searching for information; with the appearance of these pages, however, the rules of the game have changed," she says.
Porras explains that the academic Marc Prensky, owner of a master's title in pedagogy at the University of Yale and author of the work "Digital Natives and Immigrants" formed these terms for the explanation of the phenomenon.
The digital natives are them, the children and young people who have grown up with this technology.
"We are the digital immigrants who are supposed to teach them where we are still learning," he says.
He explains that this is a complex issue, "because we demand them to have a defined criterion on what may be distributed, published or said, and this at an age where maturity is not sufficient."
"They should also be electrified if it is most important for them to be popular with thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," he adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to teach children and young people what privacy is to ask them questions that make them think.
"To tell them not to do it, doesn't work," he says.
Porras then mentions some possibilities: there are things you would not tell a stranger. Then why do you do it on the Internet?
Or: Would you like to publish a photo of you, such as that you published by a friend?
Do you know what the others are publishing about you?
Did you ask the other people for permission before you labeled photos of celebrations?
And another question: Do everyone have to know what you're doing at any moment?
Another point is to give them an understanding that they need to act online as they do offline.
They're the same rules.
"Someone outside the Internet deals with respect, morality and other principles, and the same must apply to social networks," he explains.
Monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, university professor, primary school teacher and educational consultant, commented that it is essential that parents read carefully the guidelines of social networks.
When they understand all sections, they have solid foundations to talk to their children about the importance of opening a user account on the Internet.
"For example, the age, or what you can share or publish," he explains.
According to Guardia, the children must be reminded of the lesson "Do not speak to strangers".
Completion of the Unasur Summit without publication of the Lima Declaration
The 6th summit of the Presidents of the Union of South America (Unasur) ended today in Peru without publication of the Lima Declaration, which was previously announced and should theoretically be signed by the seven rulers present.
Efe repeatedly tried to gain access to the signed document at the VIth Ordinary Meeting of the heads of state and government of the Unasur. Sources in the State and Presidents' Office initially announced that they would hand it over after the clause, but subsequently explained that it would be published at some time on the website of the Peruvian government.
In the case of questions on the text, they stated that the content was presented to the press by the president of Peru, Ollanta Humala.
Journalists' access to information on the summit was limited at any time.
During the day in the press room, only the image of the presidential meeting without sound was transferred with the message "private session, limited audio".
The few information circulated among journalists was received by the press speakers of some of the Unasur’s governments present at the meeting, but not by the Peruvian press speaker.
The only document that was distributed during the day was the list of participating presidents, which raised dissatisfaction among the hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who demanded more information.
Afterwards, the Presidential Office of Peru sent the media an e-mail with the "Declaration" of the Summit, but it was the Declaration of Humala and not the official document to conclude the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the Third Summit of South America - Arab States (ASPA), and the so-called Lima Declaration, which had been announced before, was also not published in spite of a strong press call.
On the official website of the ASPA you can be convinced that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities stressed that the information systems were available to journalists, but to a large extent they restricted access to information.
The summit also ended with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to adopt a judgment of the Court of Justice of The Hague, which contributes to a border conflict between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional meeting and confirmed that they would accept the decision of the IGH, which will begin on Monday in The Hague, in the trial that Lima launched against Santiago to listen to the pleas of both sides.
"We will follow and execute the judgment on the differences we are currently presenting to this international court," said Humala together with his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile was, remains and remains a country that adheres to international laws, seeks peaceful solutions to disputes, concludes agreements and subjects itself to international courts," added Piñera and greeted Humala with a handshake in front of the flags of both countries.
The confirmation by the two presidents that they would submit to the IGH was made after Colombia had, following a decision on the maritime borders with Nicaragua, which it considered a serious mistake to have filed an action against the Bogotá Convention, in which it agreed to subject itself to the judgments of this international court.
At the meeting, the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner were present.
Paraguay, who has been excluded from the Unasur since 2011 following the resignation of his President Fernando Lugo, did not take part in the meeting.
The host President Ollanta Humala opened the talks on the morning and ended the summit shortly after the noon in Lima.
The Head of State abandoned the final document, which reported that 16 decisions were taken and the lines of action for 31 projects between the South American countries were set for a total investment of $17 billion.
On the decisions taken, he said that the states of the Unasur "will take significant steps towards the goal of a South American citizenship, to which we extend the decisions on residence rights."
He announced that measures would be taken to "improve cooperation in the fight against urban insecurity and against organised cross-border crime, as well as measures to improve access to drugs and to the Internet at low prices in all areas of South America and to act jointly and efficiently in the case of natural disasters".
With the crisis in Europe, "economic consolidation (in Latin America) must not take on triumphant traits, but rather should increase our production performance and show our people a better future", added Humala.
"We have decided to give priority to a number of 31 emblematic projects to improve spatial links in South America and especially in rural and border areas... and thus unite our countries and open up new economic forms," said the Peruvian President in a read-only statement.
Among these projects would also include five Peruvians lying on the cross-axles of its territory from the coast to Brazil, and two of which should ensure a better connection with Ecuador, although he did not give further details.
The final document also referred to the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve for its resumption in the Union of South American nations", from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to continue to remain an integrated region for prosperity and peace and for good neighbourly relations was another aspect that was highlighted at the summit.
In this sense, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before his participation in the regional meeting that on Saturday in Mexico he expected a meeting with his counterpart of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, to deal respectfully with the maritime conflict following a judgment of the IGH challenged by Bogotá.
"Maybe I'll meet President Daniel Ortega on tomorrow day (Saturday)," Santos said.
"We will review all these ways - they are not exclusive, and also the agreement with Nicaragua makes talks necessary with Nicaragua," he underlined.
"I hope to tell President Ortega that we will treat this matter as civilised and respectful as possible," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega would meet in Mexico on Saturday, where they intend to be present when taking over the new President Enrique Peña Nito.
As part of the summit, the Minister for Defence of the Block for the adoption of the 2013 Action Plan was also meeting in advance, with the aim of strengthening dialogue and consensus on the defence of the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Surinam and Paraguay are members of the UNASUR, although the latter country is currently excluded.
Peru is presiding over the time of the regional block.
"South America must learn from the integration of its citizens," says Rafael Correa
The president of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, today confirmed that the creation of a common citizenship is an objective, whereby "South America can actually learn something from Europe."
Correa, who attended the 6th summit of the Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which took place in Lima, explained to state television in Peru that the Europeans were "killed in the second world war and in other conflicts" and "now practically a homeland."
In this sense, he defended the project to create a South American citizenship that is driving the member states of the Unasur.
"It is necessary to achieve the free movement of citizens and workers in all South American countries, as is already the case in the Andean community; however, there are still reactionary sectors that seek to return to the past," he warned.
The President of Ecuador also supported the redefinition of the organization of the US (OEA) with the requirement to reduce the influence of the Anglo-Saxon States and to take account of those who have signed the San José Agreement on Human Rights.
Those who teach never undertake to something, and in return, we always sign everything to the South Americans.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights has its headquarters in Washington and is financed by the United States," he declared as an allusion to the political asylum granted by Ecuador to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa assured him that he did not regret this decision because he did not betray his principles, but that he had complied with his "deep democratic values and views on human rights".
He added that at the time there had been "founded suspicions that Assange was being delivered to a third country and that his procedure would not be complied with."
He also criticised Swedish justice, who had asked him to question him on his own territory for a alleged sexual crime, while "Swedes jurisprudence allows this by means of a video conference that could have been carried out through Ecuador's Embassy in London."
Correa explained that the risk of the health and mental condition being affected by assange would arise.
"Since he's been in our message, I haven't talked to him, but the ambassador informed me that he has a slight problem with the lungs, but no serious thing," said Ecuador's head of state.
However, there is a danger that he will nagging physical and psychological damage because he is trapped in a narrow space and cannot perform physical exercises outdoors.
"This would affect the health of every human being," he added.
Correa stated that the solution for asylum granted to Assange in the Ecuador Embassy in London since June was the granting of a free letter to Ecuador and that this was in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe. He stressed that there had been talks with London to find a solution for the imprisoned founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not deal with human rights, we do not address this word in this case, but there have been constant discussions.
"The solution to this problem lies in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe , because the lawyer of Assange, Baltazar Garzón, conducts a series of proceedings at various European institutions," he said.
And "if the UK gives this release tomorrow, I think it will be done."
And if Sweden heard Mr Assange at the Ecuador Embassy in London or about Skype, how the Swedish case law was allowed and in other cases done, the problem would be done.
Correa took the opportunity to confirm himself as a defender of freedom of the press and said that what he does not tolerate, "the mediocre, the evil intention, and the lie that defies freedom of expression."
"The biggest enemies of freedom of the press are not the evil and perverse politicians, but bad journalists who are seeking and extorting profit," he said.
In this sense he congratulated himself that Ecuador will no longer be dominated by such journalists "and not by the bankers or hegemonic and spicy-bourgeois countries", and presupposed that in a re-election he "will deepen the revolution in order to continue the way in this right direction."
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto against Paraguay in the unasur at least until his next elections, arguing that the organism "must remain hard and will not give in to any opportunism and no state banishment as legally disguised", because it "will destroy the legitimacy of democracy in Paraguay."
The President of Ecuador also considers the wish of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, now and after the judgment of the International Court of The Hague, which favoured Nicaragua's maritime State to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime borders between the two countries "absolutely justified."
This judgment is not currently being implemented.
It is a problem between a South and a Central American state.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome in the pursuit of a common path.
They must be fully treated so that they can be overcome and looked forward.
He also relied on a good conclusion of the disputes over the sea borders between Peru and Chile before the same Court of Justice and said that "it is right for Latin America to call international bodies if both countries undertake to accept the judgment, even if it is very hard."
With regard to the possibility that he would present himself as a candidate for the next presidential elections in Ecuador in order to succeed in his third mandate, he stated that he "sees this possibility with much optimism and joy, even though it is sometimes very difficult."
Correa assured that if he lost the elections in February 2013, he would withdraw from political life.
I have never personally been interested in power, but under as wrong circumstances as Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
"My political movement had the belief that it was I who guaranteed this probable victory, so I must live up to this responsibility," he said.
If I were to win, it would be my last period as President, and then I withdraw from public life.
This also applies if we lose.
"That's decided," he explained.
Correa also referred to the treatment of the health problems of the president of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, in Cuba.
I just spoke to the vice-president of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, who told me that he had traveled there for a planned routine treatment, and that he would be expected to be able to return to Cuba after the election campaign.
"In no case does it mean a relapse in the health of President Chávez," he commented.
Today, the Ecuadorian Head of State took part in the 6th Summit of the Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which was completed by calling for greater regional integration in order to ensure sustainable progress, equality and security.
The cause of dying because of AIDS is today a too late recognition
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed to the investigation result: HIV positive.
"It was as if a bomb broke in," he says about the moment when he received the diagnosis that the doctor "was trying to weaken" without recognizable success.
He hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness alone and began to inform himself about it; and this with such a commitment that he was celebrating his 43th birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients of the HIV unit of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG) in which he came after several fighting in 1994.
Fabrizio lives with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, which was difficult to imagine at the beginning of the 1990s when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigmata.
At that time, the director of an IMSS clinic avoids saying good-bye, "because it led to a dead end."
At that time AIDS was synonym for death.
Today it is possible to survive this syndrome with quality of life.
However, many people still come to the hospital who know nothing about their disease and who have already caused damage to the virus and have exhausted their immune system, and who are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the appearance of AIDS in the world, i.e. after the first cases reported, "the great success today means that the survival of a patient who receives treatment in time and the survival of the general population is exactly the same," said HCG head of HIV unit Jaime Andrade Villanueva, saying that this information had been supported in April of this year by a respected scientific publication.
The specialist in infectious diseases and HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS is not a death sentence, but that the years of survival and quality of life depend on the degree of impairment of the immune system of the persons at the start of treatment, and that those greater opportunities that are not drug addicts have: up to 30 years with a count of 200 CD4 and 50 years with a count of 500 CD4.
Simply put, the above statements mean that whoever receives HIV positive diagnosis at the age of 25 can, in this sense, "getting 75 years of age, as long as he is under control," said this specialist.
In order to properly arrange this progress, it must be recalled that the life expectancy of Mexicans is now an average of 76 years.
Even if mortality has decreased significantly in recent years (in Mexico, the number of people who die from AIDS has decreased from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (ONUSIDA’s annual report), it is nevertheless correct that 60 percent of patients included in the national database have died since the appearance of AIDS.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and by May of this year there are already 187 deaths; however, it is assured that there has been universal access to antiretroviral medicines since 2005.
So why do people still die from it?
- In my opinion, the problem is not access to treatment.
This is my opinion, and so is in our hospital.
At least in the past 12 years, we have had no problems with the medications. The problem is that people come in a very advanced state because they do not know their state of infection, i.e. in very late stages of the disease.
He makes a striking statement: "Nine out of ten patients come to us if they already have a accompanying infection. In order to be able to influence global mortality, more early diagnosis is required, which is why all those who require this need to be offered massive detection tests."
This proposal was accepted by the experts and officials of the Consejo Estate de Prevención del Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) (State Committee on AIDS prevention in Jalisco) and also by the patients such as Fabrizio who had his test carried out at a private laboratory, for the only reason that it had made a friend of him who was already in the AIDS phase despite his young age and had even the Kaposi sarcoma (a cancer-like tumor) which is one of the usual complications.
Everything's different if you know you have AIDS.
Some think they're going to die and don't want to hear anything.
"If I have to die already, I'd rather burst three times," you say in my case.
The change was to improve, I feed well, take sports and take the medications.
Today, his parents only know he had cancer.
I live a normal life, like everyone else.
"I work, do a lot, have an active but responsible sex life, I pay attention to my health and that of the other person," added Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimate details with MILENIO JALISCO in order to animated with his testimony those who are afraid today within the framework of the worldwide AIDS day.
They should test if they belong to the risk group. The earlier they know whether they are HIV-positive, the better, and if they already know the diagnosis, they should learn how to live responsibly like all people.
His message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condome behind the loading table
There are big holes between health programs and the simple citizen, explains Ricardo Salazar, journalist from Guadalajara, who has accepted the cause of HIV.
And the most important thing is prevention.
In the places defined "the distribution of condoms was actually increased; in the past they were given individually, now they give us packages with a hundred pieces, which is already good, but there are still people who have no access to a condom," he said.
Risks for new infections include adolescents.
"What do you need to do?" is a widespread mockery of social workers, guidance staff in schools, pharmacists and health care systems that do not wish to put up with young people, the correspondents assured.
He suggested reorientation of this inefficient distribution; the condoms should be located not only behind the shop table but in public toilets of facilities often visited by young people.
Promiscuity should not be promoted.
They should not be paid the beer and motel, as Governor Emilio González replied to the question whether it would be distributed in his administration.
"Sexuality doesn't look like this; it's best to bring the condoms closer to those who already have sexual activity," he put it to the point.
Key Data of Jalisco
There are 13.435 cumulative cases (12.158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The state is located nationally in 4th place of new and accumulated AIDS cases, and in 13th place in relation to HIV.
92% of the infections are from sexual intercourse, 6% from blood and 2% from perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV because for any registered case there are 4 or 5 people who do not know.
After the United States Appeal Court has confirmed a judgment that does not recognise the restructuring of the Vitro Group's liabilities achieved through a trade transaction in Mexico, a fatal precedent will be created for each national company with branches in the neighbouring country, which has payment problems.
So it could be said that the procedures for the survival of the companies that allow Mexican laws do not apply in the country of stars and stripes contrary to international agreements.
In practice, the recognition of the judgment given on 15 June by Judge Harlin Hale at the Bancarrotas court for the northern district in Texas leads to the fact that the Mexican companies are helplessly exposed to the seizure of their property beyond the river Bravo.
However, the decision opens the door to the largest glass manufacturer in Mexico to call on the United States Supreme Court for three inconsistencies.
While the judge points out that the creditors must be subject to United States bankruptcy law, the Court of Appeal of the Fifth Circuit, based in New Orleans, first states that the main proceedings are the commercial bankruptcy in Mexico.
The first point would mean that international cooperation is not known in the event of default of companies with cross-border profiles.
In fact, the model law of the United Nations for the unification of international trade law has been established for this purpose, with the American Law Institute being used as a plainter.
Secondly, the judgment states that, without the vote of the companies, after the recognition of the liabilities in the bankruptcy mass which Vitro’s branches had with their parent company, the necessary majority would not have been achieved for the restructuring of the liabilities.
However, this possibility is recognised by the Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro is not the first case in which this scheme has been approved.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose liabilities have been confirmed by the Instituto Federal de Concursos Mercantiles (Federal Institute for Trade Concurrencies) among companies of the group.
It is also right that after the vote of the branches the creditors of Vitro, the creditors who complained against Vitro at the courts of the United States, i.e. the vulture funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, had not reached a majority.
The vote would have been 45% against 37%.
This is not taken into account by the appeal court.
On the other hand, there is Vitro's fault for his difficult situation from 2008 onwards in the context of the major economic crisis in the United States, which gave the country a blow.
For this reason, the González Sada family objected to the same appeal court so that the vote in plenary took place, that is, by all judges, because only three of them voted.
If this is not accepted, the Cerciorare opposition, which calls for the review of the proceedings by a higher instance, shall be filed by the Supreme Court of the United States.
The most serious thing in this case is that the court left aside a document sent by the Government of Mexico under the figure amicus curiae (friend of the court), which describes the proceedings carried out by Vitro in the framework of the Law on Trade Conflicts, and which indicates that it has strictly complied with the agreements signed by both countries in order to comply with Chapter 15 of the United States’ Law on bankruptcy.
It is also pointed out that the country has complied with the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the established rules on the cases of cross-border insolvency, which guarantee the equality of debtors and creditors.
Double-banded carbule: a blow for Vitro and for the country.
General balance sheet
After the advertisements by the Mexican Air Transport Trade Unions against the former owner Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, who is accused of a fraudulent administration, did not advance for several months, the Asociación Sindical de Pilotos Aviadores (Communication of Pilots) finally made progress.
The request made by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau has now filed a criminal proceedings against the National Banking and Securities Commission, which is accused of disability of justice.
After that, the supervisory authority systematically refused to inform the Republic's main administration of a transaction carried out by the entrepreneur to withdraw from Bank IXE's trust account F/589 on the name of Mexicana de Aviación 198 million Pesos.
These funds were used for the acquisition of shares of the Administrativeadora Profesional de Hotels (the professional hotel administration).
As you know, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
Dragon Mart is surrounded
At a weekend meeting at a forum of the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, academics, entrepreneurs and general members of the bourgeois society decided to create a broad front to resist the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancún.
As you know, we speak of a huge sales and sales center in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean with products from the country beyond the wall, supplemented by a residential area for the employees of 150 companies.
In the run-up to this, the Canacintra (the national Chamber of Manufacturing Industry) has achieved the unification of the governors in the south-east in order to resist the monumental establishment, which has, in part, destroyed protected areas and is the mother of all the threats of the industry.
ACTA is dead
Because the government of a Senate request has failed to explain under what conditions and circumstances the Mexican ambassador in Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement known under the English abbreviation ACTA, the matter has already been archived according to the Mexican Institute of Intellectual Property.
As you know, these measures took place, even though the Senate had disregarded the possibility because it considered them to be a violation of the freedom of expression in the social networks.
Homex long-term
In the pursuit of paying long-term liabilities without prejudice to short-term liabilities, the construction company Homex brings to the market more than 500 million pesos.
The issue is the first of four same emissions that promise an interest payment every 28 days.
Establishing Competival
Established from NYCE, e-Quálity and Kernet, the leading company of information technology, a group of companies has been founded under the name Competival, whose objective is the service market of software clusters in Central and South America.
The corresponding investments amount to over 1.5 billion dollars.
Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
The world-enbombler of basketball, Héctor "Hetin" Reyes, was connected to the basket sport for more than 60 years and has traveled the whole world.
A few in Puerto Rico have as great a spiritual collection of the history of the country's basketball as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
Before he was tied to the wheelchair by a stroke in 2008, Rexes was part of this sport for 6 years, as a player of lower classes, as players of the first national league, Plenipotentiary and Head of the BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or President of the Basketball Association.
"For a long time, I spent a lot of time in basketball, even several times, when I was president of the BSN, head of the National Team and president of the Association in the 1990s," Reyes recalled at his home at the visit of Primera Hora, in Bayamón, where he has lived with Isabel, his faithful wife for over 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes is not exaggerating this statement.
The walls of his house are decorated with photos and memories of his long career and testify to them.
Bayamón in the heart
The most emotional memories are those that recall his time at the Vaqueros from the mid-50s as players until 1982, where he celebrated his 15th anniversary as co-founder or manager of the club.
"These were my best years, which I enjoyed most because I was part of eight championships of the Vaqueros since 1967 as managing director, co-business manager or trainer.
There were many fulfilling years, including the five consecutive championships from 1971 to 1975.
And then I joined a championship in 1981, the year of the debut of Jerome Mincy at BSN.
From then on, "Cuco" took over Ortiz, who was a very good administrator," says Reyes.
I remember Gene Bartow, who worked here as a coach and was employed at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said: "I have a very powerful and 2 m-large player.
Do you want him?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico ever had.
Bartow then recommended the freecast specialist Raymond Gausse, who was a citizen and one of our best throwers.
I remember when he said that if Mincy had enabled a championship for Bayamon, Gausse would take care of another one.
The Vaqueros championship with Gausse was awarded to him, but it was already out of a distance, because he was already in the top position of the association in 1988.
At that time he preferred to enjoy his executions and those of Mincy in the national team.
I remember the first time we won the Vorolympic tournament in Mexico against the USA.
Then came the 1990 World Championship, where we took fourth place, which should have actually been bronze, if not this Canadian referee who had us repeat the last move for the second time, said Reyes.
Was this group in the 1990 World Cup the best national team you've ever seen?
She is one of the best, as well as the one who won the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
My favorite, however, is the Pan-American team in Cuba in 1991, where we won gold and offered the US team a fight like when they won bronze against us at the World Cup.
Not only did Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and Piculín (Ortiz), but also the young players (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not be there for knee injury in 1990.
A team that was perhaps not the best in terms of personalities, but with which we won a gold medal and which gave us great joy, was the one of the preolimpic tournament 1995 in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolodo Hourrutiner as a substitute for the locked players because of the occurrence at the Pan-American Games in Mar del Plata, we won the gold medal against every forecast.
Who was the best player of Puerto Rico?
That was without a doubt Piculín Ortiz.
His figures on the level of international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated on this level as Piculín.
And this, without taking into account his career in the different leagues in which he played.
Who was the best coach from Puerto Rico?
This is a difficult question.
We had a number of good trainers like Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
I like Leo Arill's work.
What do you think is the best you've achieved in the association?
I was part of the most successful era of the national team from 1988 to 1995, which included the BSN at the beginning of the 90s up to 17 teams in one season.
What else do you have to do?
There are things I have introduced, such as the regionalization of the lower categories.
That the boys in Ponce, for example, play only in their territory and only meet teams from other corners of the island in the national playoffs.
Today the children make unnecessarily many travels and games.
At least I see the outcome of the prescribed trainings and courses for trainers, table officers and referees.
That's what I'm proud of.
What are you doing today?
I like to listen to music, see videos of music of my time in YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and occasionally go to a basketball game.
And of course I enjoy the company of my wife Isabel, who was always at my side.
Larry Hagman is dead
Larry Hagman was born on September 21, 1931 in Forth Worth (Texas) and became famous worldwide with his role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R." in the television series "Dallas", where he played a non-scrupulous, secretive and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the oil magnate J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of the greed of the 80s, is dead.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who came back this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas", died Friday afternoon due to cancer complications according to a press release of the family to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., producer of "Dallas".
"Larry was back in his beloved birthplace, Dallas, where he once again played the iconic role he liked most," said the family.
The Larry family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for the celebrations of the Feast of Harvest.
Linda Gray, who played the role of his wife in the original and follow-up series, was with Hagman when he died in Dallas Hospital, told her publisher Jeffrey Lane.
He made all the joys that knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, funny, loving and talented, and I will miss him very much.
"He was an original person and lived life to the fullest," said Gray in a communication.
Hagman was diagnosed in 1992 with cirrhosis of the liver, and he admitted that he had drunk a lot over the years.
In 1995, a malignant tumor was detected in his liver, and he undergone transplant.
In the years before "Dallas" Hagman became known on TV as a nice guy from 1965 to 1970 with the Sitcom "Beautiful Jeannie" of the TV station NBC.
There he played the astronaut Tony Nelson, whose life is put on the head when he meets an attractive "Jinn" (played by Barbara Eden), who will live with him at home.
He was also a performer of two comedys, which were only broadcast for a short time, such as The Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and "Lord We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His cinematographic works included well-rated roles in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Excellent Colors".
But it was his masterful interpretation of the enchanting loathsome J.R. that made Hagman a superstar.
The dramatic series of the CBS television chain on the Ewing clan and other figures in its surroundings was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The advertising saying "Who shot at J.R??" that would create expectation for an episode full of emotions, where Hagmann's figure was almost killed, led to an international speculation, and millions of dollars were betted in bethouses.
The series reached a viewer record at that time.
When the answer became known in a chapter in November 1990, it was seen by an average of 41 million viewers, the "Dallas" turned into the second most widely seen entertainment program since the end of "MASH" 1983, which had 50 million viewers.
It was Kristin, the brother-in-law of J.R. (interpreted by Mary Crosby) who had shot.
J.R. had weakened her and threatened to represent her as prostitutes if she did not leave the city, but others also had reasons to want to see him dead.
Hagman interpreted the role of Ewing as a corrupt, insatiable man with a charismatic smile: a backward businessman and unfaithful husband who strived to have his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray) appointed.
"I know what to stand on the tombstone of J.R.," said Hagman in 1988.
It should be called "This is where the honorable citizen J.R. Ewing rests".
This is the only business he has not won.
Victoria Principal, co-author of the original series, remembered Hagman on Friday as a "noble personality on and outside the screen".
He is unforgettable and unforgettable for millions of lovers in the world and remains in our hearts who have been lucky to know him and to love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with great success in the TV channel TNT.
The recording of five chapters for the second season was completed, and a sixth chapter was just rotated, informing the station.
By Warner or TNT, there was no immediate explanation as to how Hagmann’s loss would be treated in the series.
Born in Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of the actress and singer Mary Martin, who played classical works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was a youth when she got Larry during her marriage to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck at the theater platforms in New York at the beginning of the 1950s, after which he served in the Air Forces in England from 1952 to 1956.
There he met young designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in the Californian city of Malibu, where many celebrities live.
In 2001 he named his memoirs "Hello Darlin: Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
"I didn't write anything I thought might harm someone or affect him in any way," said the Associated Press of the time.
After the liver transplant, he applied for liver donation and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist anxious patients.
"I advise them, give them courage, I meet with them when their operations await and after," he said.
I would like to give them some comfort, such as "no fear, it's a little uncomfortable the first time, but it'll be good for you".
He also opposed smoking and participated in several campaigns.
Beginning of the course that studies the "end of the world"
Every week, students study apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, virus and germs and global warming.
Every semester, when the professor of religion decided to hold a course about the end of the world, he knew that he had an irresistible fishing hook: the end of the "long backward counting" of the Maya calendar on December 21, of which many people believed it meant the end of the world.
But Charmé had no idea what to expect in the following two months: the destructive Hurricane Sandy, which some have called "Deudarmaggedon", as well as a growing conflict involving Israel, the place of which the Christian theorists believe that the Apocalypse begins.
"I didn't notice that this will be the most apocalyptic semester there ever was," said Charmé this week to students at Rutgers-Camden University (New Jersey).
If someone analyzes what happened in the world today, as if we were thirty days away, this would be a really good period.
And he recalls that the bad is good for those with apocalyptic mentality.
And he is not the only professor to offer courses on the "end of the world" which should actually be the last in history.
In Temple, Professor Barry Vacker gives the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World."
Every week, students study apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, virus and germs and global warming.
"We analyze why these ideas spread over time," he said, as well as the way hypothetical scenarios are offered that lead to a certain human behavior.
If nuclear material comes into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month the students analyzed films with apocalyptic content and examined how they could compare themselves with real life.
"I have tried to inform the students about what is possible, probably, credible and impossible," said Vacker.
At the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, the professor of Latin American history Matthew Restall and his colleague, Amara Solari, formed a team of art history and anthropology professors to offer a course with the simple term "The End of the World".
"We don't accept 2012 so we always keep the option to keep the course up again, in case the world doesn't go down," said Restall.
Despite the "previous decline", students must study, create projects and participate in final exams.
In Penn State the final exam is carried out on the eve of the Apocalypse, which is why the students have no other chance than "to continue working until the night, where the world is supposed to end," said Restall.
The courses were very popular.
"In two hours there were no more places," said Restall about his course for high-average students who filled themselves with 35 students.
Weeks before the beginning of the semester, we received emails from students who asked if there were still places free.
Students, on the other hand, assure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"It's fascinating to see what people are doing to comfort themselves," said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student in Rutgers' camp for religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey.
The apocalyptic sectial or religious mentality is actually just a question of consolation or its lack.
The 25-year-old student Will Wekesa for psychology and nursing explains that he has seen all apocalyptic films.
"Never heard of a lesson where this is being taught," he said.
I enjoy it.
But none of the students surveyed - and less a professor - said to believe in the last date of December 21.
"Our first project dealt with the Maya prophecy, and in a certain way we discredit it," said Julie Zehlen, student last year in Temple, 21 years old and from West Chester.
The Mayas never predicted the end of the world; it's just a key point in the calendar, said Restall.
However, he notes that in Western society there is an apocalyptic fear that leads back several centuries when people responded to changes in their environment with the prediction of the end of the world.
The Internet has increased these speculations.
"Otherally, people don't think so," he says.
This is mainly the case in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the University of La Salle, who is teaching the Philippines this year, is quick to answer the question of whether he would know a course about the "end of the world".
"The Philippines do not participate at the end of the world," he wrote as an indication of an exception to a higher instance.
We have a condolence from the Pope.
Restall pointed out that many days had been spoken of by the last court over the years, and said that if nothing happened on December 21, "people immediately think of a new date" or that December 21 was the beginning of a seven-year period after which the end of the world would come.
Students and professors take this date easily.
Several said they wanted to go to celebrations about "the end of the world".
"Maybe I call on some friends so we can laugh together," said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old student for communication.
