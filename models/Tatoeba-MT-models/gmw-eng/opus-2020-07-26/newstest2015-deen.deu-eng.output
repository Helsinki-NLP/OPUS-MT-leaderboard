The Prime Minister of India and Japan met in Tokyo.
India's new Prime Minister Narendra Modi has met his Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe in Toko since his first important foreign visit since his election in May to discuss economic and security relations.
Mr Modi is on a five-day journey to Japan to strengthen economic relations with the world's third largest economic nation.
Plans for stronger nuclear cooperation are at the top of the agenda.
According to reports, India also hopes for a treaty on defence cooperation between the two nations.
Karratha police arrested 20-year-olds for fast motorcycle hunting
A motorcycle was seized after the driver had driven it at 125 km/h in a 70 km/h zone and through Bushland to escape the police in Bilbara.
Transport police in Karratha tried to stop a blue motorcycle this morning after watching it leave a gas station on the Bathdate Road at 125 km/h.
The police report that the driver then ignored the stop signals and continued on the Burgess Road before he turned off into the bushland where the officials lost sight of it.
The motorcycle as well as a person corresponding to the driver's description were later seen at a house in Walcott Way in Bulgaria.
The Karratha police accused a 20-year-old man of neglecting a stop signal and reckless driving.
He is expected to appear in Karratha on 23 September.
The motorcycle was secured and confiscated for three months.
George Webster sued for hotel rapes in Naim and Pitlochry
A man is on trial for rape of women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, was read the charge at a hearing of the Supreme Court in Glasgow.
He is accused of raped a woman at Scotland's Hotel in Pitlochry in Perthshire on 7 June 2013.
The charge is that Webster attacked her while she was "conscious, asleep, and could not signal consent."
Webster is also accused of having raped a second woman at the Golf View Hotel in Naim in the Scottish highlands on May 4, 2014.
Judge Lady Rae set the date for the 17th November at the Supreme Court in Edinburgh.
Rethinking on the very American ideal of labour rights as human rights
The Congress delegates Keith Ellison and John Lewis have put in place a legislative proposal to establish the organisation of trade unions as civil rights.
"As trade unions die, the middle-class jobs also die," said Ellison, a Democrat from Minnesota and vice-president of the Progressive Caucus in Congress.
Therefore, together with the civil rights icon John Lewis, I proudly present the employee empowerment law.
This groundbreaking law gives workers the same legal possibilities for discrimination due to the organization of trade unions as in other forms of discrimination - and stops so anti-unionist forces.
The addition of the National Labour Law to create a possibility for discrimination-related workers to organise a union representation in order to complain against a civil court for justice - and to obtain compensation or fines - is a useful and necessary initiative.
But it is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not according to American standards.
In fact, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and the other sponsors of their legislative proposal propose is the connection back to a very American idea.
Despite the setbacks to which trade unions have been exposed in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other countries throughout the country - Americans once encouraged countries around the world to recognise, extend and respect labour rights.
There was a time when millions of Americans still remember when this country called democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right of association in a breath.
When the United States occupied Japan after the Second World War, General Douglas Mac Arthur and his staff encouraged the country to adopt a constitution to ensure that the militaryized autocracy Hedki Tojos would be replaced by democracy.
In full awareness that the workers and their trade unions played a role in creating a new Japan, they used a language that explicitly acknowledged that "the rights of workers to union and joint bargaining and action are guaranteed."
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff urged the Germans to write a constitution that would ensure that fascism Adolf Hitler's would be replaced by a strong democracy.
In recognition of the fact that the workers should organize themselves and raise their voice in the new nation, the Germans added a clause that explicitly said: "The right to establish associations to secure and improve the working and economic conditions is guaranteed to every individual and every profession or trade.
Agreements restricting or targeting this right are null and void; measures aimed at it are unlawful.
When the former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt held the Presidency of the International Human Rights Commission, which designed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as adopted by the United Nations in 1948 as a global agreement, Roosevelt and the other authors included a guarantee that "everyone has the right to form trade unions for the protection of his interests or to join them."
For generations Americans have accepted the basic premise that labour rights are human rights.
When this country consulted other countries on how to form civil and democratic societies, Americans stated that the right to set up a trade union - and that this trade union should then participate in collective bargaining as an equivalent partner with companies and government agencies - should be protected.
After these rights were under fire in America, it is indeed very wise to see the American ideal again, as a result of which the working population must have the right to unite and to be heard in a free and open society.
As Pastor Martin Luther King Jr., fifty years ago, said:
The story is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the labor movement did not limit the strength of the nation, but increased it.
By raising the standard of living of millions of people, work has miraculously created a market for industry and raised the entire nation to unimaginable levels of production.
Those who attack the work forget these simple truths, but history preserves them.
The story remembers, and we should do that.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of civil rights as a protection against discrimination in the creation of employee representations - is long overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals that America has made in the past and that have solved the promise of democracy.
Richter temporarily stops law that all abortion clinics in Louisiana could force for closure
On Sunday, a U.S. judge provisionally stopped the implementation of a law in Louisiana, of the attorneys saying that it would probably have led to the closure of all five state abortion clinics.
This measure, which was passed by Bobby Jindal, Governor of Louisiana, in June to enter into force on 1st Sept., would force doctors carrying out abortions to acquire a patient's right at a hospital within a radius of 30 miles in order to acquire their practice.
However, the judge's decision means that doctors can continue to carry out legal abortions on a provisional basis while applying for such a right.
"The defendants can continue to work in accordance with the law while trying to obtain these rights," wrote federal judge John deGravelles in his judgment.
Within a month, a hearing shall be held for the judge to bring about a more lasting decision for the law.
Explosive advocates welcomed the decision to take the latest decisions against similar measures and said that doctors won so more time to obtain hospital admission rights.
"Today's decision means that women in Louisiana are deprived of a law that wants to take on their health and rights," said Nancy Northup, President and Chairman of the Center for Reproduction Rights, who had complained in the name of three of the five clinics of the state to stop the law.
It was not immediately clear whether the judgment was also extended to doctors from the two clinics, who had not joined the appeal and had also applied for rights of designation.
Louisiana is one of 11 States that have passed similar laws, with courts recently declaring such measures unconstitutional in Alabama and Mississippi.
Key points of a law in Texas, which would have forced most of the hospitals in the state to close, were stopped by a federal judge on Friday.
Expulsion advocates and the American College of East Retrinics and Gynecologists as well as the American Medical Association agree that law enforcement of doctors requires unnecessary restrictions.
Explosive opponents oppose the use of measures to protect the health of women, although some also welcomed the effects of the closure of clinics.
Only a doctor who carries out abortions in Louisiana has a patientâ€™s right of registration, told the Reproductive Rights Centre.
If all other doctors in the state are forced to stop performing abortions, this doctor would not perform the operation because of fear of his safety, the group said.
In their argument against the judgment, representatives of the State of Louisiana said that they would not punish doctors for the execution of abortions, while their claims for patient rights would still be pending.
Delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment options lead to higher death rates due to ovary cancer in rural areas.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James put a video home for their mother who died of ovary cancer in 2007.
For women in the rural areas of Australia, there is a higher risk of dying from ovary cancer than for women in cities.
Researchers analysed the medical data of more than 1100 Australians in which ovaries cancer was detected in 2005 and found that only 25 percent were alive five years after the diagnosis.
Research director Susan Jordan of the QiMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that for those living in rural and remote regions of the state, the risk of mortality during the study was 20 percent higher than for those living in urban areas.
SMALL STUDY: New medicines may slow down lung and ovary cancer
The researchers examined the medical care of women over seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the age of a woman in the diagnosis, the type of ovary cancer, existing prediseases and social and economic status also affected the chances of survival.
For elderly women and those whose cancer was more advanced at the diagnostic time, the survival rate was lowest.
For those living in rural and remote regions of the state, the risk of mortality during the study was 20 percent higher than for those in urban areas.
Although the study did not investigate why women living outside the city were more likely to die from ovary cancer, Dr. Jordan suspects a delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment centers as possible factors for this.
"This disease is best treated by gynecological oncologists, and they are mostly found in larger cities," she said.
Despite improving telemedicine services to counter distance, she proposed, as a possible remedy, that the service be strengthened by the doctors who have been flown in to give specialists the opportunity to provide women closer to their place of residence, as well as treatment programs for people outside their region.
Dr. Jordan said that regardless of geographical status, the study showed a poor long-term survival rate in women in ovary cancer and underlined the need for better treatment and precautionary strategies.
The study funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer is today published in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2013, Elisha Neave, a young mother of 33 years, learned from the gold coast that she had an aggressive form of ovary cancer.
Garden centres regret sinking household numbers
The decline, together with an increased decrease in the number of householders under 35 years of age, could result in the loss of tens of thousands of pounds per year when today's young consumers, as reported in the Financial Times, reach the "Near Age Group on Garden Products".
The report states that tenants spend an average of 55 percent of the amount people spend on their garden with their own homes.
The increase of people living in high urbanized areas without gardens, the popular process of asphalting gardens for parking purposes, and the sinking garden size are further factors that threaten the industry, in which an estimated Â£5 billion per year is implemented on sale.
In the Greater London area, in which the share of homeowners has fallen from 61 to 43 percent over a period of 6 years, the lowest expenditure on garden products per household is shown.
The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society point out that homes for rent or small gardens do not mean that people cannot draw plants.
Guy Barter, head garden advisor for the RHS said: "Container gardeners, for example, are very popular with tenants because they can take their plants with them when moving."
The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "golden age" of horticultural retailing due to rising home ownership and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
He also predicted for this year an improved market situation due to the better weather conditions after unfriendly weather conditions in March and April last year.
The protest movement in Pakistan, led by the opposition politician Imran Khan and the clergy Tahirul Qadri, continues.
In the capital Islamabad, around 1000 demonstrators stormed the state television station PTV.
Minister of Information Pervaiz Rashid said soldiers could have pushed the Protestants back out of PTV buildings.
The station started its operation for about 40 minutes, but now sends back.
At the same time, around 3,000 demonstrators tried to reach the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
About a kilometer away, they supplied themselves with poles and stones equipped with security forces.
The police used tear gas.
The demonstrators demanded Sharif's resignation, but he rejects it.
The army of the country is now calling for a political solution to the conflict to be "without wasting time and using it without violence".
After a meeting in the headquarters on Sunday evening, the military announced that "the army still has a duty to ensure the security of the state".
The military plays an important role in Pakistan and has already drawn more frequently.
The opposition politician Imran Khan accuses Prime Minister Sharif of cheating on the May election of parliament last year.
The protests were escalated on the weekend after Khan and Qadri called on their followers to press ahead with Sharif's residence.
Three people had been killed.
Turkey order US diplomats for spy reports
The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs has registered the most senior US diplomats in Turkey for information on a report on American and British espionage in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister BÃ¼lent said that the U.S. Embassy's CEO and Turkish officials had discussed the report on Monday.
The German magazine The Spiegel as well as the online magazine The Intercept reported that the former US analyst of the National Security Agency Edward Snowden showed that Turkey was a major area of activity for the US and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan reduced the importance of the report and said that all important countries were spying on each other.
An earlier report that also had the most important intelligence service in Germany in the visor caused significantly worse reactions from the Turkish government.
Warning strike: LokfÃ¼hrer threatens with consequences for counterparts
The national alert strike of the LokfÃ¼hrer on Monday evening could also affect passenger traffic in NRW.
The deadline announced for 18 to 9 p.m. for all transport companies throughout Germany, including distance, regional and S-Bahn transport,
The main direction of the warning strike is freight transport.

said the district president of the German LokomotivfÃ¼hrer (GDL), Sven Schmitte, in DÃ¼sseldorf.
We expect significant failures.
There were no regional priorities.
The main direction of the warning strike is freight transport.
The Deutsche Bahn in NRW announced that it would do everything to minimise the impact.
However, the GDL had not said where they wanted to strike, so it was difficult to predict the consequences in concrete terms.
Chief of Police of Magaluf of Corruption charged
On Friday, the prosecutors presented evidence of extortion by police officers and employees of the city of CalviÃ  to the office of the Public Prosecutor of Mallorca.
The chief of the CalviÃ  police in the holiday island of Mallorca was arrested after charges of corruption by businessmen and bar owners in the infamous binge drinking hotspot Magaluf.
Chief Commissioner JosÃ© Antonio Navarro was arrested by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the street in which most bars and nightclubs of Magaluf lie.
According to the online newspaper Mallorca Diario, the prosecutors presented on Friday evidence of extortion by police and employees of the city of CalviÃ  to the office of the prosecutor for anti-corruption of Mallorca.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the Spanish Guardia Civil in connection with the corruption accusations and were interviewed together with Navarro by a judge.
The national Spanish daily ABC reported that the angry nightclub owners said that the authorities' veterans had serious effects on their business.
"It's no longer about earning money, it's about survival," one of the businessmen told the court.
Leave our livelihood out of the game.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made international headlines this summer due to a viral YouTube video showing an 18-year-old British tourist who performed on 24 men during a sauftour Felladio.
The island authorities have since tried to stop the illegal behaviour of alcoholic holidaymakers in Magaluf by minimizing the number of participants in the infamous alcohol-dripped pub tours.
The Playhouse Club, in which the Fellatio incident took place, was forced to close for one year, while Playhouse and the Kneipentour organizer Carnage together have to pay a fine of â‚¬55,000 ($73,000).
The tourist resort Magaluf, which is particularly popular with young British holidaymakers, is also known for several accidents under alcohol influence, including the trend of "balconing", where people jump from balcony to balcony or from balcony to hotel pool.
The first spring day with wet and stormy weather conditions affects flights from Adelaide Airport
FRÃœHLING provided a winter surprise to southern Australia, with heavy showers and strong winds that affected flights from Adelaide Airport.
In the evening until 21 o'clock, another 5mm of rain fell on the city, after 6.6mm which had already fallen down in the night until Sunday.
The final rainfall was the result of a series of short, stormy showers, including a caste that started shortly before 20 o'clock and caused almost 4mm rainfall in about 10 minutes.
After the winter last week had provided an early dose of spring, the temperatures in the city on Monday again fell to a maximum of only 15.8Â°C.
The bending weather conditions have probably led to the delayed landing of a flight from Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane should have landed shortly after 7.30 p.m., but was hit by a sharp wind - a sudden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance - and had to take off.
At this time, windshields reached about 50 km/h on the ground at Adelaide Airport.
The flight data showed that the plane had to take off on a second landing flight and finally set up at about 20.40 p.m.
The delay in flight led to the delay of some other flights, including an Emirates flight from Dubai and a Quanta flight from Sydney.
For Adelaide a maximum temperature of 16Â°C is predicted on Tuesday, with possible showers.
Matthies thinks: Maximum time for great networking
In view of the galloping technical progress that threatens to transform our comfortable home into high-tech blackhouses, our columnist Bernd Matthies comforts himself with a very familiar electronic accessory.
As I write this here, I look at the spiral cable that connects the listener to the phone, and I think, "Boah, how retro is that?
But behind that is a consideration: If the cable were not, all listeners would fly around the house in no time, and that would be even more retro.
After all, it is true on the ekeltronic (ekeltronic?
No, tip error: electronic) sector the rule that the world news of today is the electric scrap of tomorrow, purchased - obsolete.
And whoever still has a tube TV in the living room today, for example, simply says that he refuses television in principle.
Why these considerations?
Because this week the push of the Ifa on the radio tower will again bring us our absolute incompetence in questions of electronics.
Today, the layman who blindly dominated washing machine and CD player does not even understand the purpose of the devices that are spread out before him with unfathomable eitlem expert speech: "Connected Home, Wearables, Health Care and Urban Technologies" promises us the press office.
Yeah, are you okay?
What should we talk about with people who apparently volunteer to spread such quark?
In fact, for about 20 years now, it's mainly about the fact that we're supposed to connect our house in a good way.
So that the yoghurt can re-order itself so that the fire detector will tell us on holiday in the Maldives that it will burn in the study room.
And wouldn't it be wonderful if we were to get from the office the air conditioning on our soon arrival ...?
Yes, but that requires air conditioning.
But a dream will certainly come true soon: We lift our watch, say to her out loud! - and at home the vacuum cleaner goes off.
I'm sorry.
Everything runs to nothing less than a revolution: "The boundaries between white and brown goods are floating," says an industry expert, one can connect the washing machine to a headphone, the steamer sends the weather report and the data glasses indicates how long the pizza in the oven still needs, but what is of no use because we are in storage.
From everyday practice, we also know: When a new modern device is really needed, the battery is guaranteed to be empty.
What is another reason for this is that the spiral cable on the phone will also survive the next radio exhibitions.
Israeli children return to their schools after the war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children from the territories near the Gaza Strip returned to schools on Monday, after spending the summer in air protection areas, while rocket and mortar shooting went down to their communities during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas and the schools in Gaza remained closed while the area recovered from the battles.
The start of the school brought a sense of joy and expectation to the communities drawn by rocket shooting holes in the south of Israel, but the signs of fighting are still fresh.
In the southern town of Ashdod, employees of the "Pashosh" kindergarten, which was hit by a rocket, removed from the walls and sliding walls before the students arrived.
"We're a little scared, but are excited," said Ronit Bart, resident in Kibbutz Saad and there English teacher.
Many children from our area urgently need to return to a routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter Shani Bart said it felt "a bit funny" to go back to school suddenly.
"These were difficult times, and we didn't leave the house at all," she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited the Kibbutz near the border with Gaza to offer his support.
Until a ceasefire the war last week, thousands of residents of the border communities remained in their homes like Saad or left their homes to move further away from Gaza in safer areas and escape the rocket and mortar fire.
Many residents of Nahal Oz, a municipality near the border with Gaza, where a four-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian murderer grenades, still hesitates to return.
The Ministry of Education told us that about a dozen families had not yet returned.
Their children were temporarily accommodated in other schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attended a school in Sderot, a border town in Gaza, which is heavily drawn by the Palestinian shooting.
He appealed to the children to learn a lot and said, "We will ensure that you acquire knowledge and provide you with security."
Israel and Hamas agreed last Tuesday on an indefinite ceasefire.
The peace of arms caused an immediate end to the fighting; however, important problems remain unresolved, such as Hamas's demand for an abolition of the Israeli-Egypt blockade of Gaza and the reopening of the air and sea ports in Gaza.
Israel calls for the disarming of Hamas and the handing over of the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the battles.
A new round of indirect talks is expected to start this month in Egypt.
In the war, more than 2,100 Palestinians were killed, three quarters of them civilians, and at least 494 children, according to estimates by the Palestinians and the UN.
Israel disputed these facts and estimated that at least half of the killed were fighters, but did not provide any concrete evidence for this information.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai worker, were killed.
Hamas and other fighters in Gaza fired 4.591 rockets and mortar shells during the fighting on Israeli cities, most in the south of the country.
Meanwhile, the Israeli military carried out more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of houses in the Gaza area and about 250,000 people sought refuge in more than 100 UN schools that were converted into provisional shelters.
While tens of thousands of people continue to live in the shelters and continue to fight, the educational authorities postponed last week the beginning of the school year.
"I hope the school will soon be open again so that we can continue to learn how the children in the world and the Jewish children," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who currently lives in a school in Gaza City.
After choice in Saxony: CDU-Vize Strobl challenges NPD ban procedures
In view of the NPD's loss of votes in Saxony, CDU-Bundesvize Thomas Strobl has declared himself before the Federal Constitutional Court for an end to the ongoing NPD ban.
Berlin - According to CDU-Bundesvize Thomas Strobl, the ongoing prohibition proceedings against the NPDs should be brought to an end before the Federal Constitutional Court.
"The NPD is cutting off worse than last time," said Strobl, who is also a CDU country ship in Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, the "Leipzig Volkszeitung".
This is a pleasant development in the right direction and a development that will make me come to the conclusion that the NPD is politically opposed and not before the Constitutional Court.
The NPD was very close to the five-percent hearing in the vote on Sunday.
A first start to ban the far right party had failed in 2003 because the constitutional protection had also been in the NPD-speak informants at the time.
In December 2013, the Federal Council submitted a new application in Karlsruhe after a long preparation.
The Federal Government and the Bundestag did not join.
Harburg: tents for new refugees
Refugees are now accommodated in tents at NeulÃ¤nder Platz.
The central first shot for refugees in Harburg is bursting out of all seams.
Now the internal authority has three tents of the Red Cross next to it.
The district politicians were only informed shortly before - they are little enthusiastic.
"These Hauruck actions continue to create reservations for the citizens and do not allow local politicians to participate constructively in the human accommodation of refugees," says Britta Herrmann, Group President of the Greens at the Harburg District Assembly.
Their party demands that the Harburg District Administration currently provides unused houses for accommodation.
96 refugees can be accommodated in the three tents.
Reasons for overfilling in the initial recording are the intrusion of aid seekers - and the fact that the authorities cannot provide enough places in subsequent facilities.
Many refugees therefore stay longer than the regulars for three months.
The house prices have experienced the strongest winter increase in seven years, shows a widely observed index.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Home Value Index for home homes in the Australian capital rose by 1.1 percent in August, according to the RP data from Monday.
As a result of this increase, the overall increase in June, July and August is 4.2 percent, the largest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9%, more than twice as high as the increase in the 12 months to August 2013, but the increases were not evenly distributed across the country.
The research director of RP Data, Tim Lawless, announced that Sydney and Melbourne are driving a divided market.
RP Data figures show that the house prices in Sydney increased by 16.1 percent last year, while Melbourne rose by 11.7 percent.
The following markets are Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices rose by an average of five and six percent.
At the other end of the scale is Canberra, which was hit hard by the cuts in government spending and where prices rose by only 1.4 percent over the year.
Mr Lawless continued that with the beginning of the spring, an increase in the real estate on sale would now be to be observed for the coming months, which would be subject to the market "a real test".
"If you look at the continuously high rate of auction prices, a generally fast sales rate and the continuously low interest rate environment, it is likely that home prices will increase even further in the next three months," he said.
In an opinion to the Neue Presse, he contradicts statements from the managing director, Peer Medau, and attests to this, "as a field ruler".
This is not the style of the university, says the communication.
In mid-June, the Medau family had already been informed orally about the university's presence.
The statement that the plans were only known in July is definitely wrong," said PÃ¶tzl.
At the same time, he points out that the plans are not "preparation or even decision-making" but "preferences".
The necessary expansion of the narrow road up to the castle for the access is also less dramatic than feared by the Medaus.
There was and is not the point of a nine-meter road.
According to the current stand, it is about 5,50 meters, which is a meter wider than before," explains PÃ¶tzl.
The argument of the Medau operators that their free and schooled parking spaces will only be used by university students in the future does not want PÃ¶tzl to apply.
It is not parked at all because it is now intelligently solved as with other public parking spaces.
Think of the locals
According to the president of the university, the Bergwichtel children's crib, which is on the grounds and which would lead the access to the park deck before its door, is "not to be affected".
Rather, he has to consider, "that this is not only about the child's crib, but also about the residents at the entrance to Friedrich Streib Street and the 800 students of the neighbouring real school.
It is therefore a matter of much more than the partial interests of Mr Medau," said PÃ¶tzl.
Whether the critique of the child critique, with the development of the street would be entitled "to lose a few natural spots of Coburg", "can the reader decide for himself".
At the beginning of October, PÃ¶tzl, together with the Bamberg State Building Office, wants to inform city councils about the building development of the university by 2020 "and in this context address the importance of the new development".
Peer Medau had last week informed the parents of the children's crib about the university's plans.
Therefore, the access to the new park deck should not lead, as before, over the campus and the Friedrich Streib road, but through the Medau mountain.
This means that the narrow road would have to be extended two-track on about one kilometer in length.
According to Medaus' high calculations, traffic in the park of Hohenfels would thus be tenfold.
About 2,000 vehicles a day are mentioned.
On the part of the city one did not want to comment on the project so far.
Glandorf withdraws from the Handball National Team
Holger Glandorf will not play for the DHB team anymore.
The 31-year-old of the federal ligigist SG Flensburg-Handewitt, in particular, caused health problems for this decision.
I didn't like the decision, it was matured over several months.
It is time for me to listen to the signals of my body and finish my career in the national team," the world champion of 2007 announced on his Facebook page.
He thus goes into international retirement with a balance sheet of 167 national games and 576 goals for Germany.
Because he wants to go to Torejad for a few more years for the Champions League winner from Flensburg, he is now no longer available to the new Bundestrainer Dagur Sigurdsson.
With the Icelandicman, who announces his cadre for the country games against Switzerland on Tuesday, Glandorf led a "long and good conversation.
His ideas and approaches have impressed me just as they will inspire my many years of fellow players and my followers.
But for my club I want to be healthy in the next few years too, longer regeneration breaks are needed that do not allow the current double load.
The left-hander had to fear even his career after a heel infection in 2012.
He had been treated with a cortisone syringe by team doctors from the German Handballbund (DHB), who later caused a strong inflammation.
An emergency operation and two other interventions followed.
Then Glandorf had announced a complaint against the team doctor, the dispute ended with a comparison.
Twelve years of professional and eleven years of national team careers do not pass any body without any trace.
I have some health construction sites that I can no longer ignore.
After the three infection-related foot operations that took place at short intervals in 2012, I never got a grip on my blood pressure.
This includes some other wear-related complaints.
At the beginning of the year, I noticed that I can control my head, but my body can't deceive," said Glandorf in an interview with the magazine "Handball Time".
For a comeback, he would only be ready in an absolute emergency.
"When all ropes are pulled, I'm always ready to talk," the two-time family father explained to the specialist magazine.
However, I can count the years in which I can still play handball on one hand.
I also have to say that after my long hospital stay in 2012, I have also become quite humble as to my health.
After my career I at least want to be able to go straight.
In addition to the 2007 World Cup title and the 2014 Champions League win, he won the EHF Cup in 2008 (HSG Nordhorn) and 2010 (TBV Lemgo).
In 2012, he won the European Cup with Flensburg.
German economy decreased by 0.2 percent in spring
The crises around the globe slowed down the German economy in the second quarter.
The gross domestic product fell from April to the end of June 2014 compared to the previous quarter by 0.2 percent.
This told the Federal Statistical Office and confirmed provisional calculations.
In the spring, the economy was in the middle of consumption alone, while investments declined.
Foreign trade also slowed down the economy.
As a result of the strong start-up in the first half of the year, a share of GDP of 0.8 percent over the second half of 2013.
Horstmar was the starting point and destination of the "MÃ¼nsterland-Mooiste", which led for the first time through the Burgmannsstadt on Sunday.
On Sunday, the Burgmann town of Horstmar experienced an invasion of Dutch "bike driver".
The largest cycling association in the Netherlands, NTFU, organized the so-called "MÃ¼nsterlande-Mooiste".
It is the largest bike tour across MÃ¼nsterland, the cycling paradise near the Netherlands.
More than 1000 participants thanked Jos ter Huerne for their registration for the organization of this tour through MÃ¼nsterland.
This tour was offered in various professional journals.
We came from Den Helder and drove overnight to take part in this tour.
We would like to get to know MÃ¼nsterland in this way too," the cyclists were delighted to find out about the route through the districts of Steinfurt, Borken and Coesfeld.
After registration at the club's home, Sta.
Katharina went on a small "peace trip" through the city over the wall, where the start took place.
Further, the route, which was written for three different categories, led back to Horstmar in the direction of Herrenholz over the SchÃ¶ppinger mountain towards Coesfeld and via Havixbeck and Bilderbeck.
On routes of 95 kilometers with 1175 metres, 120 kilometers with 1475 metres and 145 kilometers with 1775 metres altitude, the cyclists proved their good condition.
They were placed on their way in Havixbeck and Bilderbeck.
Main organizer Jos ter Huerne and mayor's representative Heinz LÃ¶lfing were very pleased about the success of this cycling event.
We are satisfied and it was a beautiful experience for all those involved.
The organization went without problems and there were no negative incidents", says Heinz Lolfing, drawing a positive conclusion of this event.
Unfortunately, not so many participants came, as the organizer had hoped, probably due to the bad weather forecasts and the morning rain.
"We will see ourselves again in 2015 with hopefully beautiful weather on August 30 or during another weekend," the cyclists promised to return to MÃ¼nsterland and the organizers plan a new edition.
Konstantin alarmingly honest memoirs
It is actually more philosophical testimony than biography, which Constantin alarm clock, songwriter, pacifist, political-proof activist, ex-huftling, has brought to paper in "MÃ¶nch und Krieger" on 287 pages.
The Munich-born on 1 June 1947 wrote down its memoirs, not chronologically, but more thought-fets for thought-fetzen, each chapter initiated by a matching song.
And he is mercilessly honest: From Onanie as a gymnasian to shoplifting and drug use, he leaves no human weakness.
Also to show how he himself has learned tolerance in dealing with his fellow human beings.
Wide space also includes abstract, but all the more important terms: love, soul, ego, being in the present, spirituality - all this he tries to get to the bottom, in a very philosophical, but also very personal way.
And he also explains his pacifism, his critique of society, his political commitment - and also, as he not only influenced the music (the opera lover became a soul and rock musician), but also his prison stay.
The latter has also brought Lebemann Konstantin Wecker closer to the ascetic monk who comes into being "by subtraction" as he says, "by leaving away everything unnecessary".
But there are also short anecdotes to the earth between all the highly spiritual views: for example, about beatings in one of GI's frequented locals or a mad-witnessed driveway, where he introduced a tree in front ofal.
Even there, he is mercilessly honest.
Lenny Henry: My father never took me into the arms.
I never said, "I love you."
Henry was one of seven children of a family of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley in the Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in a factory and her relationship was limited.
Henry tries for a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and was created from the series on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mixture of Reggae and Rap, with lively melodies.
But Henry had to work through some difficult childhood moments.
He visited "many" therapies after the death of his mother, and Henry is thoughtful about his relationship with his father.
It was hard to know him.
One never saw his face, but heard his voice: "Hum down with the noise.
Leave your sister alone.
Move!
I want to watch Cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - who had already grown up when I was a child - went to the pub with him and talked about things like the shape of the beer glass or the beauty of a cricket blow.
I never had such a conversation with him.
Most of my life, he was this serious guy in the corner who read the newspaper.
Recently Henry opened a foundry in Dudley, and although the conditions are better than at the time of his father, he gained an insight into how life would have been for him.
It's a little brighter now, but they're dark, intoxicated, deep rising labyrinth with flames and smoke and lots of rust.
My father used to just lay in the tub and then you could hear him sing as he started because he could wash the foundry of himself.
As I walked around, I realized that he had done this for years to bring the food to the table, and my respect for him grew bigger.
Henry grew up as a child without a love witness from his parents.
My father never hugged me, he never said "I love you."
Only when my mother was bad at the end of her life did we begin to say, "I love you, I love you, I love you."
Through his own daughter Billie, with Dawn French, he was able to share the love he had missed as a child.
Could you stop the "I love you"?
Stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22!
With Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
It is still friends with French, with whom he was married for 25 years.
Dawn is a good person.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry's mother was a diabetic.
That contributed to her death.
So when I became very, very overweight and showed symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, "You have to be radical.
So I went through this fitness thing and had to do a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And it's strenuous.
No one likes to eat carrots.
Henry's career change may appear in his elegant, short-cut beard.
Since he was praised by the critics for his othello, he has been captured by the theater.
It followed the comedy of the error, and then Fences of August Wilson.
This is a different experience from the Sitcoms and comedies that have filled his busy working life.
He started at only 16 years when he worked at a factory.
A DJ discovered him on stage when he imitated people and wrote to New Faces about him.
His television career began in the mid seventies. "I was the only black imitator/comedian on television for a quite long time."
He learned in the profession.
I had not only to grow up in front of the public, but also to learn from 1975 to 1985 how I could become an efficient joke story machine while I was a star through television, and that was really difficult.
Lenny 1975 at New Faces
Since his manager owned the stage right at the Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment program in which the people "painted black", Henry performed his comedy there for over five years.
My family was very uncomfortable.
I kind of wish it never happened, but I don't regret that I did.
It was a strange, unpleasant position for me, but I worked on giant projects and learned how to deal with a big audience.
But this "years of award-winning light column of British television" was also a "great parody of black people."
Henry worked in the eighties on an alternative comedy circle through the introduction of figures that mocked and celebrated British black culture.
The first series of the Lenny Henry Show went on show in 1984, and in the nineties he was known, among other things, as the chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!
Advertising, documentary films, TV-series and film-rolls were shaping his next decade, but after his BBC-series LennyHenry.tv 2008, he thought: "What are you doing next, Len, because it feels like you're just bringing about time or getting a little on the spot."
Then came a documentary series for Radio 4 entitled What's So Great About ...?
The first episode revolved around Shakespeare.
On Shakespeare I was really allergic.
I had never really learned anything about him at school and thought he was mostly a middle class domain, white in tights and a coalhead in front of him.
So I was very scared of that.
All we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench said "You should try it.
Don't hurt it if you don't know what you're talking about.
Take some of the words into your mouth, and then you will understand why we love all Shakespeare so much.
Henry introduced 20 lines from Otello's last speech for the documentary and he was enthusiastic.
I had the feeling that I could do this.
It was almost as if someone had finally put my head right on me.
"That's what it is, it's a serious thing, take them seriously, learn your text, research a little.
The samples were brutal, and I read this piece for months before we did it.
And it was a success.
They seemed to expect a car accident, and that just didn't happen.
And soon he appeared in the comedy of error.
Suddenly I was at the National Theatre and I couldn't believe it.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you changed."
There was a technical mistake and Henry instinctively felt that he had to entertain the audience.
"A little voice said to me, "You have to bridge now for 10 minutes while repairing the computer."
Instead, the stage director announced that the performance would continue as soon as the problem was solved.
I left the stage and said something inside of me, "Oh, thank God."
I'm not responsible.
I can let someone else do this.
"You play in a play, so stay in your role."
Henry in Fences at the Duchess Theatre
Learning the text for Fences was challenging.
Panic is very good, which strengthens the tendons.
This too was good, so it's like a big shield of the gods who tell me "This is your destiny."
He says this, of course, with a DONNERND voice.
So I'll stay with you.
I really love that.
I love being in a sample room.
But Henry still has the head of a comedian - our conversation has gone through with humorous outbreaks, while he always imitates people.
I have decided not to make a stand-up comedy because I find that this kind of instant satisfaction from a hall full of strangers is somehow dangerous.
If you're always looking for that, you're going to drive it in front of a wall.
I sometimes perform live in Apollo if I like to, but overall I don't get as much as I used to.
I wonder if he'll ever do a stand-up comedy tour.
The fun I have in a room with a director who helps to form a beginning, a middle part and the end of a trip - I don't think I ever want to give up.
Is this his new incarnation?
I think so.
I like to be an actor.
It's fun.
You always tell a story, and that's great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Huthi rebels block streets in Yemen capital
In the conflict between the Shiite Huthi rebels and the Yemeni government, the Huthis called for civil disobedience in the capital, Saa.
Huthi supporters would have occupied central streets in Sanaa on Monday, said a spokesperson of the Huthi Party "Ansar Allah".
The access to Parliament had also been blocked.
Yemeni media report a traffic shock in the capital.
According to the online issue of the newspaper "Yemen Post", Huthi leaders Abdulmalik al-Huthi had called for the measures on Sunday evening.
Huthi, according to the sheet, threatened with a further escalation of the conflict, should not meet his demands.
The Shiite Huthis fight for greater independence from Sunni Yemen and demand the withdrawal of the government.
The people of Huthi have been besieging Yemeni capital for almost two weeks.
About 30,000 rebels have built protest camps on the major access routes of Saa.
In the surrounding area, bloody struggles with the Yemeni army are repeated.
Kenya registers officials to limit "privileged persons"
Kenya has begun to register all state officials biometrically to clear "spiritual" from the government's salary lists.
Staff who do not register in the next two weeks would not be paid any more would be a government announcement.
The government suspects that thousands of people will still receive salary payments even after their retirement from the public service.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to fight corruption in the public service at the time he took office in 2013.
In an examination at the beginning of this year, it was found that at least $1 million ($700,000) per month of payments for "privileged" and other abusive financial practices were lost.
The government suspects that salaries will continue to be paid on accounts after a person dies or leaves the public service, reports Wanyama Chebusiri for BBC from Nairobi.
All officials must now appear at identification centres for the next two weeks to ensure that their data on biometric registrations are recorded, was reported in a government message.
All those who did not do so without a credible excuse would be removed from the salary list, the communication was continued.
"This approach contributes significantly to the rationalisation of the public service by establishing the actual number of officials and adjusting the salary list at both levels of government - so the "prisons" are eliminated," said Anne Waiguru, the Cabinet secretary at the Ministry of Decentralization and Planning.
The scandal about the art advisor Helge Achenbach will be negotiated in court for the first time on November 11.
Five heirs of Berthold Albrecht, son of the Aldi founder Theo Albrecht, claim damages from Achenbach and two of his companies in insolvency proceedings in a civil trial at the DÃ¼sseldorf Landgericht 19.4 million euros.
This was reported by a courtlor on Monday.
In the application, it is said that Achenbach had cheated on buying works of art and old-timers and calculated Berthold Albrecht higher than actually paid purchase prices.
As a result, the agreed commission would have been higher.
Achenbach has bought value items for Albrecht for 121 million euros.
Children need roots and wings
He was 44 years old in school, 23 of them as headmaster.
From this time on, Manfred Richter knows many established Petershausener and Kollbacher from their time as a student.
His methods were sometimes unconventional, but always worn by his striving to see the people in the student.
The snowheads are the most famous mountain in the Giant Mountains.
Manfred Richter loves the painting with the motif from his home country.
Richter was born in Trautenau/NordbÃ¶hmen in 1930, today Trutnov.
He was already interested in teaching at age 14 after four years of high school.
A year later, the Sudeten Germans were expropriated.
In half an hour, the family had to leave her home.
After a few months in a camp, it went to Bavaria in 1946 - in the freight wagon.
So it smeared judges into the Upper Franconian village.
Teacher education took place in Bamberg.
For this purpose, Manfred Richter had to walk ten kilometers a week to the next station, take the train to Bamberg, go there three kilometers across the entire city to school and back in the evening.
After two months, Manfred Richter was given a sleeping space in a Red Cross home in Bamberg: together with up to 15 fellow students in a dormitory room.
In 1951, after three years of teaching, he made the second State examination.
Since Oberfranken had no free teaching place for him, he applied for Oberbayern and came to the school in Kollbach on November 1, 1954.
The "FrÃ¤ulein room" was his first "service apartment" in the school house.
In 1958, he moved into a three-room apartment in the newly built teacher house next to the school.
This house bought Manfred Richter 1980 after the school was dissolved in Kollbach in 1968.
Until then, there were three classes in Kollbach in the school association Petershausen-Kollbach and five in Petershausen.
From the school year 1968/69 these were summarized in Petershausen in today's town hall.
When the school association Indersdorf was founded, only the primary school remained in the village.
In order to avoid retiring at the now smaller school, the then rector Georg Sigl moved to Karlsfeld - and Manfred Richter became his successor.
But Petershausen grew, and from September 1982 on, the children and their teachers were able to obtain today's construction, which was extended in 1997 after Richter's retirement.
Manfred Richter praises the uncomplicated generosity of the then mayor Ludwig GÃ¶tz, who, on municipal costs, had an additional work space built in 1997 and in the extension of cellars, although this was not eligible under the guidelines for school buildings.
"BÃ¼rgermeister GÃ¶tz was very school-friendly," said Richter gratefully.
Throughout his career, Manfred Richter never forgot the speech of a government representative who had responded to a talk of a school council on justice and justice: "You must never forget love." Manfred Richter put on what he had heard as a young teacher.
"You have to give the children two things: roots and wings," says the 84-year-old today.
And he had to learn, "It's not always possible." Whether he means only his students or just his own six children is not quite clear.
In any case, Richter's action was sometimes unconventional.
When students were teasing, they did not receive punishment from him, nor were they doomed to be rescheduled.
At the expense of the community, judges had two pair of box gloves purchased and had the two opponents compete against each other, even if there should be a auction.
For the benefit of the school, Richter served as rector for a good relationship with the former mayor Ludwig GÃ¶tz (CSU).
After retiring, the partyless judge moved the party to register at least as the latter on the CSU list for the municipal council in 1996.
But Judge was elected to the sixth place and joined the CSU.
180 kilometres in three days
HR4-RADTOUR 700 cyclists in the spa park of Bad Salzhausen and Schotten stopovers
When cycling in Bad Salzhausen or Schotten makes rest on their tour, this is nothing special in itself.
On Friday, however, the only impression was the number of Rastenden: the 700 participants of the hr4 cycle tour and accompanying tour enjoyed a break in the lower spa park of Bad Salzhausen and later a party under the open sky in the Schottner Alteburgpark.
Under the motto "Raddles and Celebrating on newly discovered paths between Nidda and Kinzig", the participants met in Bad Vilbel on Thursday and enjoyed a concert by Van Baker & Band there.
On Friday it became serious: The cyclists took the first stage, which attacked 60 kilometers across Florstadt to Bad Salzhausen and on to Schotten.
In Bad Salzhausen, the athletes of Mayor Hans-Peter Seum, who had joined the bicycle in Bad Vilbel, and the head of the private company Bad Salzhausen, Petra Schwang-DÃ¶ring, were welcomed.
In order to refresh the body and the mind, all kinds of good things had been prepared: the landwives from Ranstadt and Nieder-Mockstadt had baked 85 plates of apple, sweating, spread and cheese cakes, which miraculously mouthed the capable cyclists.
"Such cakes can bake only landwives," a participant from Aulendiebach praised, while he ordered another piece.
Cold refreshments could be obtained at the drinking stand of the GeiÃŸ-Nidda Turnverein.
The "Duo Bravo" entertained visitors with well-known melodies from operettas and musicals and won enthusiastic applause.
The beautiful ambience of the park was relaxing.
A gentleman also enjoyed a head massage from his partner: "He earned it, after all, he has established today's already leaped down bicycle chains again."
At the time, the mayor and the head of the company still had to work: they were interviewed at the well in front of the drinking spa house by Reporter Rainer Janke and took the opportunity to advertise on the radio for Bad Salzhausen.
Doctoral director Tobias Hagen, who has been a tour leader since the first hr4 cycle tour in 2004, was able to catch up for a short time, but he had to do with the technology on site.
His pickup truck, in which he communicated by means of three phones and a radio with his employees and the 15-member motorbike squad of the police Hessen, wrote Facebook entries and made reports, also needed a check.
"The majority of the participants are from the Rhine-Main area," he said, "but also from GieÃŸen or Fulda, from Lauterbach or Taunus, and even from many cities in Westphalia, cyclists have arrived.
The number of participants depends on the accommodation capacity available.
In category I the participants are accommodated in hotels, in category II in collective accommodations.
From the spa location, the cyclists had a good impression when they broke up again after one and a half hours: "Bye!"
"It was nice in Bad Salzhausen!" they won the farewell.
After arriving in Schotten, the group was allowed to take a short break.
But in the evening the cyclists were required in the idyllic Alteburgpark.
Under the direction of the Schottner Gesellschaft fÃ¼r Tourismus und Stadtmarketing (GTS), the park had received a beautiful holiday atmosphere and of course you had prepared treats, for example flame cakes with well-cooled feather whites.
Mayor Susanne Schaab, GTS Managing Director Markus HoÃŸfeld and MSC Chairman Wolfgang Wagner-Saxon in his role as Executive Board member of ADAC Hessen-ThÃ¼ringen welcomed the visitors.
The three clearly enjoyed the "many operations in Schotten".
DJ Tobias Hagen then released the dance stage.
The opportunity to move freely under the open sky was used eagerly despite the sporty activity on the bike.
Among the guests were increasingly mixing citizens who were just as excited as the great crowd of cyclists.
On the second day the stations Birstein, WÃ¤chtersbach and Bad Orb - including a concert with the Trenkwaldern - were on the program for the cyclists.
Yesterday, after 180 kilometers of cycling, the athletes met again in Bad Vilbel.
Dozens of Turkish policemen arrested for "conspiracy" against the government
A total of 33 police were arrested in Turkey due to the suspicion of "conspiration against the government", reports local media agencies.
The police authorities did not comment directly.
Among those arrested are 14 senior police officers, reports Hurriyet Daily News.
Some of them were involved in the corruption investigations against government workers, including four government ministers last December.
In July, a number of Turkish police officers were arrested because they allegedly founded an organized criminal association and tapped telephone numbers.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (then Prime Minister) described her actions as part of the activities led by the Islamic clergyman Fethulla GÃ¼llen against him and other persons in positions of power.
Not all children in Ukraine return to school
Schools almost everywhere in Ukraine opened on Monday (September 1st) after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally an important day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arsenij Jazenjuk brought his daughter to school.
There he told the journalists that not all schools had opened again, but he was determined to defend the country for future generations:
September celebrations were not held in every school.
Heaven is not everywhere peaceful over Ukraine.
We must fight for a peaceful heaven.
The whole Ukraine, a huge common Ukrainian folk front must fight for a peaceful sky.
Aleksan Papkelhow, headmaster of the School in Slavjansk, visited the Jazenjuk daughter, spoke in Russian.
We hope that there will finally be peace here and that the children will receive an education that will be useful to them in further life.
The first school day of the new school year is traditionally celebrated, with children wearing embroidered shirts, holding balloons in their hands and giving flowers to their teachers.
With Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found the great director she needs.
It meets with a proud sleek of fame from the banking world, media management and the inner circle of the Tory Party.
And she has her own front experience.
She started her career with Bain and Co., a global management consulting company that changed to Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the media world of Pearsons.
She was CEO of the Financial Times for seven years and resigned when the senior post of the parent company Pearsons went to a younger male colleague.
Their collection was reported to be almost $1 million.
Its political ranking is also solid.
She was recommended to David Cameron of Lord Browne, the former chairman of BP, when she sought more private-sector knowledge in Whitehall: she became a consultant to the Cabinet.
Her husband is a former Tory Councillor.
Already in May, I described the chairman's task with a poisoned chalice.
Not only does the BBC stand as a huge and complex unity in the heart of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
Trust works in two directions: inwardly on the first guard of the own management hierarchy in the BBC, but also outwardly as voice public concern and unrest when things are running wrong.
This ensures an almost unsustainable duopol, which requires a complete comprehensive reform.
But which newly arrived president would risk entering to hit everything and disassembly an institution that is as complex as a Chinese dynasty while perhaps killing himself.
It's a difficult task.
And as if that wasn't enough already, many are still interested in seeing the BBC reduced - power, money and status overtaken.
While competition is drawing closer and new technologies are threatening old, convenient security, the upcoming negotiation of the license fees for the BBC is facing special dangers.
For the modest sum of Â£ 145.50 a year, the British public is buying into the world's largest media company.
The BBC tells a good story: it says that it reaches 96 percent of all households and costs each of them only 40 Pence per day.
And apparently, the BBC rises back to the top on the popular scale: 53 percent support them today, compared to 31 percent 10 years ago.
The BBC's visual and user habits have changed: I get news headlines on my cell phone these days and see missing programs later on on my iPlayer.
But she remains a very beloved and remarkable institution.
She needs a remarkable chairman - I hope she found him.
Perry from Texas says that lower Tweet was not authorized
A Tweet from the official user account of the Republican governor of Texas, Rick Perry, on Sunday contained a depressive comment about the Democratic District Attorney, who is at the heart of a criminal charge against him for abuse of the official force.
The Tweet was later deleted and replaced by another one by Perry's user account, who joined the previous one.
A Tweet has just been sent out of my account, which was not authorized by me.
"I don't approve the Tweet and have deleted it," it said in the later news.
Perry's staff did not respond immediately to requests for comments.
Although the Tweets went out of Perry's official user account, it was not clear who actually operated the feed.
In the earlier Tweet, an unfavourable picture of the district attorney of Travis County, Rosemary Lehmberg, was drawn, who was sentenced in April 2013 for drunkenness at the tax.
Perry filed a veto against the financial support of her office when she refused to withdraw, which led to a charge against Perry - who could possibly be a presidential candidate in 2016 - before a Grand Jury in Austin this month.
The Tweet's text reads: "I don't always drink with the triple permitted alcohol level ... but if I do, I charge Governor Perry when he loots it."
I'm the drunkest Democrat in Texas.
Lehmberg's office was not entrusted with the management of the investigation of the Grand Jury against Perry.
This was led by Michael McCrum, a special state attorney from San Antonio, who was selected by a Republican judge.
Perry pleads not guilty and called the charge a political trick.
His high-class team of lawyers requested from the judge entrusted with the case to reject the charge and argued that the law against the most senior governor in Texas's history is unconstitutional.
Perry stopped $7.5 million of government funds to the Stateâ€™s public integrity unit - located in Travis County and determined in cases of state corruption in Texas - when Lehmberg refused to withdraw.
This veto provided a public complaint on the part of a left-wing watchdog group.
Perry's official user account is frequently updated - and sometimes famous.
After finishing fifth in the 2012 presidential election meetings in Iowa, Perry went on to speculate that he would stop by posting a second of a photo of himself while jogging near a lake, saying "South Carolina, we are coming!"
Berkeley explains housing market again for "normal"
One of London's most prominent construction contractors pointed out that the housing market in the south-east of England was "returned" to a normal level.
Homes in the capital were hotly sought-after and the subject of enormous price increases, which led the Bank of England, because of the widespread fear of a loan bubble, to set limits on mortgage loans in June.
Tony Pidginley, founder and CEO of the high-class construction company Berkeley, said on Monday: "Since the beginning of the current financial year, the market has returned to normal transaction levels since the 2013 peak", adding that this offers a "stable environment".
The real estate market in London was well established during the downturn, as foreign buyers pushed into the capital.
According to information from the Katasteramt, prices in the city area have increased by 18.5 percent in the last year alone, much more than the average increase in England and Wales as a whole.
The average sales prices at Berkeley's private, cheap and student offers rose by about one-fifth in the previous year and were around Â£423,000 at the end of April.
However, a stronger pound has made real estate property in London less attractive to foreign buyers in recent months - some of them have also been deterred by the introduction of new real estate taxes and political rhetoric for a possible "money tax" before the general elections in May.
Last week, London real estate agent Foxtons warned that the mortgage market report for April, which introduced tighter lending arrangements, would also lead to lower market growth in the second half of the year, both in real estate sales and in prices.
New data from the Bank of England from Monday show a decline in mortgage approval in July, which also indicates that the real estate market is cooling down.
Hamtions International, another real estate agency, corrected its forecast for the increase in real estate prices in London for 2015 down to 3 percent, on the basis of a already weakening domestic price awareness.
The transaction volume in the most expensive areas of London such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington has now dropped by a quarter year after year, according to the broker WA Ellis.
Nevertheless, the desire for a home home in the capital for Berkeley is a blessing, as the amounts due for short-term sales amount to more than $22 billion.
Mr. Pidgley added: "The demand for the right, well-planned product at the best locations remained stable and as a result the sales of the dates remained stable."
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new homes in the year by the end of April - almost a third more than the 2007 peak before the crisis.
The annual pre-tax earnings increased by 40 percent annually to Â£ 280 million, turnover by 18 percent to Â£1.6 billion.
In a communication on Monday before the Company's annual meeting, Mr. Pidginley said that Berkeley's revenue is expected to correspond to the current market expectations in the current year.
The analysts estimate the annual pre-tax income at Â£450 million.
In the afternoon, Berkeley shares in London trade stood at Â£23.96.
Naked photos by Jennifer Lawrence published by Hacker on the Internet
Jennifer Lawrence appearance at the 85th Oscar Ceremony.
Naked photos of Oscar award winner Jennifer Lawrence were published online by a hacker who claimed to have a "Masterlist" of images of another 100 starlets.
A representative of the star from "The Tribute of Panem" confirmed that the photos of Lawrence were real and sued the hacker for "eclatant violation of privacy".
The authorities have been notified and will pursue all those who are going to post the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos that were originally posted on the photo sharing page 4chan were supposedly created by a gap in the online storage system iCloud by Apple. The alleged "Masterlist" of the hacking victims includes the names dozens of female stars, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, BuzzFeed.
It is not sure how many of the pictures really are, although Winstead, star from "Scott Pilgrim against the rest of the world" also condemned the hack on Twitter.
"To those of you who are looking at photos that my husband and I recorded years ago in the private environment of our house - I hope you are so happy with you," Winstead wrote on Twitter.
Victoria Justice, from the Nickolodeon series "iCarly" and "Victorious", disagreed that it was about pictures of her and tweeted "These so-called naked images of me are FAITH, people.
Let's just get to the beginnings. *Wortspiel planned*.
Buzzfeed reported on the late Sunday that a spokesman of the pop star Ariana Grande rejected the authenticity of the alleged photos from her.
Exclusive extract from Howard Jacobson's highly praised new novel about love and the letter "J".
They melted, so one could best describe it, they slowly dissolved like a cardboard that was left in the rain.
Sometimes a woman told him that he was too serious, strenuous, intense, distanced, and perhaps a little scratchy.
And then shook his hand.
He knew.
He was stingy, like Igel, yes.
The last victim of this stinginess was a just beginning affair which had been more promising for a relief of the lonely boredom of his life than usual, and perhaps even brought him some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a shivering soft beauty with untamed hair and a flattering heart from a village on the North Island, which was even more remote and rough than Port Reuben.
She had come south with an older accompaniment that Kevern thought for her aunt, who had inherited a plot in a wet but paradise valley with the striking name Paradise Valley.
No one had lived in the house for several years.
The pipes were leaky, in the bathrooms were still spiders, naked snails had left their tracks on all windows and believed they heard all of this, and the garden was overcrowded with weeds, which looked like huge coal heads.
It was like the house from a children's fairy tale, both threatening and seductive, a garden full of secrets.
Portrait of the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on the longlist for the Man Booker Prize 2014.
The shortlist will be announced in the next week.
Kevern had sat with Ailinn hanging on the broken loungers in the high grass and enjoyed an unusually warm spring afternoon. Both had spiritually stuck into the console, which provided the country with soothing music and soothing news, when the sight of their crossed brown legs reminded him of an old song of a long forgotten black entertainer, his father had gladly listened to in closed shutters in the house.
Your feet are too big.
Due to their own aggressiveness, songs of this kind were no longer played on the console.
Not prohibited - nothing was so properly prohibited - just not played.
It has been successfully obsolated, as the word obsolescences.
The general taste made what decrees and regulations never made, and how the people in books choose the From-Tellerwashers-to-Millionary-Memoires, cookbooks and love novels, so they chose the ballads at the music.
In the euphoria of the day Kevern began to play an imaginary piano and sing in a grob-coman serenade of Ailinn's big feet.
Ailins didn't understand.
"This was a well-known song by a jazz pianist named Fats Waller," he explained to her and automatically put two fingers on his lips.
His father had always done this to stop the letter J before he came out of his mouth.
It had begun as a game between him and his father when he was still small.
His father had played it with his own father, so he had told him.
If you start a word with a J without putting two fingers on your lips, it'll cost you a penny.
It wasn't a very funny game back then, and it wasn't very funny even now.
He knew this was expected to happen, that was all.
It had to explain what Jazz was.
Ailinn had never heard of any.
Jazz was not played, even if it was not banned directly.
Improvisation was no longer modern.
It was only room for a single "if" in life.
People wanted to be sure where they would end at the beginning of a melody.
The same is the mind.
Its unpredictability made people nervous.
And jazz was a musically expressed mind.
Although he had been 10 years old without having heard of Sammy Davis Junior, Kevern knew something about jazz from his father's half-secret collection of old CDs.
But at least he didn't have to tell Ailinn that Fats Waller was black.
At her age, she probably couldn't remember a time when pop singers weren't black.
Again, no laws or constraints.
A consistent society meant that every element of this society gratefully agreed to the principle of group talent - gratefully like those spared from fate.
People of African-Caribbean origin were suitable for entertainment and sports through temperament and body building, so they sang and ran.
People who originally came from the Indian subcontinent were blessed with electronic talent as by nature and were in charge of ensuring that no family remained without a functioning service phone.
What was left of the Polish community took care of the sewerage; what was left of the Greeks, Teller destroyed.
Those from the Gulf States and the Levant whose grandparents had not left the country quickly as WAS WATER WAR, WHEN IT HAPPEN WAR happened - for fear of being charged with fires, even for fear that the flames would consume them next - had Labneh and Shisha pipes-restaurants opened, kept their mind and were depressed with inactivity.
Everyone according to his abilities.
Since she had only heard ballads, it was hard for Ailinn to understand how the insulting words that Kevern had just proposed to her could ever be revealed.
Music was expression of love.
"They're not really insulting," said Kevern.
Except for people whose feet are too big.
My father never insulted anyone, but he loved this song.
He talked too much, but the neglected garden gave him the deceptive sense of security.
Nothing could overcome the sound insulation of the huge coal-like leaves.
Ailinn still didn't understand.
Why would your father have loved such a thing?
He wanted to say that it was a jux, but he hesitated to put two fingers on her lips in her presence.
She already thought he was something strange.
"It seemed funny to him," he said instead.
She shook her head and blocked Kevern's view.
There was nothing else around the world to see but her un combed raben black hair.
There was nothing else he would have wanted to see.
"If you say it," they mean without conviction.
But that doesn't explain why you're telling me.
She seemed honestly concerned.
Are my feet too big?
He looked back.
Your feet aren't so direct.
Maybe your ankles, a little bit...
And you say you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
You hate?
Of course I don't hate you.
It's just that stupid song.
He could have said "I love you," but it was too early for that.
"Your big ankles are exactly the reason why you fell on me," he tried instead.
I'm a little perverted.
That didn't sound right.
It should've been funny.
When he tried to be comical, he often got into trouble because, like his father, he did not have the calming charm needed to tame the horror inherent in jokes.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel too.
Maybe he wanted to be that, Kevern.
Despite his friendly eyes.
Ailinn Solomons became red and rose out of her chair, threw the console and shed the wine they had drunk.
Holunder flower wine, so drunkenness was no excuse for him.
In her excitement, she seemed to tremble, like palmweed in the storm.
"And your dickhead is exactly why I feel drawn to you perversely," she said.
Except that I'm not at all.
She was sorry, both because of the unnecessary unkindness of his words and the fear shown in her eyes as she leaned against him.
Did she think he'd hit her?
She had not told him about life on the cold northern archipelago where she had grown up, but he had no doubt that it was essentially like here.
The same huge and icy cold ocean broke out here as there on the shore.
The same confused men, with even thicker skin and more corrupter after DEM WAS WATER than their ancestors as smugglers and beach robbers, moved from pub to pub, always ready to raise their hand against a woman who refused or laughed.
Dickkopf?
They'd have shown her a big fist if she didn't look after her!
They just slip - the most commonly used word for an erotic attraction between men and women, a countertoxicity to the non-thinking love ballads from the console - they first slip and then beat.
According to Kevern's view, this was an unnecessary refinement, as the Knutchen himself was already an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomons gave him a sign to go through her body.
He rose out of the chair like an old man.
She also felt pale, but the wave of his grief surprised her.
That wasn't the end of the world.
They hardly knew each other.
She looked at him as he was, as with a room on the upper floor, watching her companion in his room, a man bemoaned by something he himself had conjured up.
Adam leaves the garden, she thought.
She felt a sudden pain for him and men in general, although some had raised her hands against her.
A man turned away from her, bowed his back, ashamed, defeated, without a fighting spirit - why was this a sight she seemed to know well, if she could not remember a single time she had seen such a thing before this day?
When she was again alone, Ailinn Solomons looked at her feet.
Several years before the events just told, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher on behalf of Ofnow, the non-legislative monitoring body for the public mood, worked on a short lecture on the continued violence at a low and medium level in exactly the parts of the country where their reduction, if not abolition, would have been most likely, given the money and energy that had been invested in the extermination of this violence.
"It has already been done, and much has yet to be done," she wrote, "in order to appease the innate aggressiveness of a people who has waged a thousand wars and won most of them, especially in the remote corners and valleys of the country, in which the sweet breath of human kindness has been historically felt despite the high-inquiring church towers between the hedges.
But some of the characteristics stand out as inexhaustible.
The higher the church tower, it seems, the less the passion it continues to arouse.
The population weeps in the listening of sentimental ballads, intoxicates itself in stories of overcome difficulties and claims to believe firmly in the virtues of marriage and family life, but not only does the former rawness hold the rural communities firmly in hand, as well as our urban structures, but there is also evidence of the emergence of a new and behind-themed struggle at home, at work, on the streets and even on the fields of play.
"They have an unfortunate tendency to exaggeration," said her mentor when he read the whole report.
I suggest you read less novels.
Esme Nut tree lowered her head.
I also need to ask, are you atheist?
"I don't think I have to say that," Esme Nussbaum replied.
Are you a lesbian?
Again Esme called on her right to privacy and denied the statement.
Feministin?
Quiet again.
"I don't ask," Luther Rabinowitz said, "because I would be against atheism, lesbianism or feminism.
This is a free workplace.
We serve a free society.
But certain types of hypersensitivity, which in themselves are absolutely acceptable and praiseworthy, may occasionally distort results as you have presented them.
You yourself obviously have prejudices against the Church, and these things that you call "reliable" and "raw" could just as well be interpreted by others as an expression of natural power and vitality.
If you continue to ride on the road, WHAT IT IS, WHAT IT IS, IF IT IS AS if, if it had happened, it would have happened yesterday, it would mean that the country would take its essential life force.
Esme Nussbaum looked around while Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind his head, an LED lettering in Flamingorosa repeated the advice that Offnow had given the country in the last quarter century or more.
Smile at their neighbors, appreciate their partner, hear ballads, visit musicals, use their phone, talk, explain, listen, agree, excuse yourself.
Speaking is better than silence, the sung word is better than the written, but nothing is better than love.
"I absolutely understand what you want to do," Esme Nussbaum replied with a calm voice when she was sure that her superior had spoken to the end, "and I say nothing but that we have not yet been healed as effectively as we present ourselves.
My concern is that, without warning, we may find ourselves in the process of repeating the mistakes that led first to THE WHAT IT IS.
This time, however, it is not the others that we leave out our anger and our distrust.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his hands.
In order to indicate an angel's penance.
"They go too far," he said, "if you call acts "errors" that our grandparents may or may not have committed.
They also go too far, when you say that these would have missed their "wut" and "mistrust" on "other".
Actually, it should not be necessary to remind someone in your position that we are talking about understanding the past as in protecting the present, not about "us" and "other".
There was no "we" and there was no "other".
It was a time of disorder, that's all we know.
"From the one who, when we are honest with ourselves," Esme dared to throw, "no part of society can claim to have behaved well.
I'm not suing anyone.
Whether it was done bad or good, what happened has happened.
That was back then.
Nothing needs to be said about this - there we agree.
And just as no debt has to be allocated, there must also be no debt fixation if such a eradication would be appropriate and if there would be a way of eradicating it.
But to what does the past serve if we do not learn from it -
The past serves to make us forget them.
If I may say something about it -
Luther Rabinowitz had his pyramid coincided.
"I shall remember their account," he said, "and released it.
The next day, when she went to work as usual, she was overrun by a motorcyclist who, as described by passersby, was on the footpath in a kind of "brutal rage".
There are coincidences.
Lesotho military member says that no coup is planned; Prime Minister remains in South Africa
Official representatives of the military in Lesotho disputed to have planned a coup on the fall of the government and said that they were going against police who were accused of the arms of political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country and announced that the army of the country had surrounded its home and occupied government building in the capital Maseru.
The premiere brought his family to neighboring South Africa after he had reported attacks.
Military spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi said that there is no de facto coup, but the military reacts to the threat of "political fanatics" whose armed forces were imminent by the police.
"What happened this morning was that the staff of the defense forces of Lesotho, after having received several intelligence reports, that within the police some elements actually wanted to arm some of the political, party-political young fanatics who were about to do devastating damage," he said to Voice of America.
South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said that the military action had made the impression of a overthrow.
"Even if no one has claimed to have torn the government by force, all reports agree that Lesotho's activities so far show signs of a coup," he said.
Speaker of the Lesotho military told us on Sunday that the soldiers were going back to their barracks and that the situation in the capital was quiet.
In the meantime, the vice-premier Mothetjoya Metsing takes over the government during Thabane's absence.
Thabane told him that he believed he had become a target target because of his attempt to fight corruption in the country.
In Lesotho there have been great tensions since June after Thabane suspended parliamentary meetings due to the disputes in his unity government.
He said that his actions would not have undermined the government, otherwise uttering accusations.
Production in the Eurozone on a 13-month low
The rise in Eurozone production slowed to the lowest point of the last 13 months in August, according to a closely observed study.
The final Markit shopping manager index of the manufacturing industry (PMI) fell to 50.7 in August, after a stand of 51.8 in July.
An indication of over 50 indicates an expansion.
New orders went back and factories experienced collapses in a time of increasing tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures come before the European Central Bank (ECB) meeting on Thursday.
Markets expect the Bank to have a clear plan for dealing with a slowing recovery of the euro area and for the threat of inflation at an inflation rate of only 0.3%.
There are speculations that the head of the ECB, Mario Draghi, could provide further information during the course of this week on whether he is considering a quantitative relief for the euro area, according to those undertaken by the UK and the US during the financial crisis.
"Although small growth is better than no growth at all, the depressing effects of increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainties have become clearer for manufacturers," said Rob Dobson, senior economic scientist at Markit.
The factory PMI for Germany, Russia's largest trading partner in the EU, fell to the lowest level in 11 months at 51.4.
In the meantime, the second largest economic nation of the block, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.
France remains a concerned child, as is the decline in Italy from a solid expansion to stagnation.
Note that growth incentives in the key industry mechanism in Germany, Spain and the Netherlands are no longer reassuring either," said Mr. Dobson.
The decline in industry is likely to fuel the fire of analysts expecting further monetary or fiscal incentives.
A positive news came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI rose to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economic expert at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best thing you can say for the purchasing manager index of the Eurozone manufacturing industry in August is that the sector continues to grow afterwards."
He added: "Producers in the euro area are clearly finding life quite difficult at present, as the current increased geopolitical tensions, particularly in relation to Russia and Ukraine, are increasing uncertainty in the still difficult conditions in many countries.
These increased uncertainties have clearly affected the economy - in particular, and consumer confidence, and are likely to delay or even cancel some orders, in particular large orders.
He said that it would be "more likely" that the ECB would eventually have to introduce a kind of QE, "although we suspect that this will be limited."
The hell's decade of survivors of Beslan: Ten years have passed since the fearsome siege of the school, as the children in it still suffer today.
Ten years ago, more than 1,000 people from Chechen militias were taken hostage in a school in Beslan in southern Russia.
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed in the three-day martyrdom that shocked the world.
We returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death at the horror in the classroom.
Just a decade after the horrific siege of Beslan School, in which 334 people died, including 186 children, the heroic survivors warned last night of a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
As fanatic Islamist terrorists children and parents on September 1, 2004, the beginning of a new school year, captured and killed, this seemed to be the evilst of evil.
The tragedy united West and East into abominable, and then, surprisingly, turned into action and hope for the future in the middle of the worst misery.
Ten years later we returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death at the grudge in the classroom.
We found surprising young people who have overcome resistance, although the memory of this terrorist hell will pursue it forever.
Your greatest hope?
The fact that the war that is now invading Ukraine - and in which children like them die - is now ending.
The girl who was photographed trying to climb back into the broken school sports hall
She was photographed and famous by Russian star photographer Dimitri Beliakov when she tried only in her underwear to climb back into the broken school sports hall after a mine exploded.
Aida searched for her mother Larissa, now 40 years old, completely confused.
Both were considered dead, but they survived.
"A woman told me to run for my life, but I couldn't," said Aida.
My legs were flooded.
I got up and climbed back in to look for my mother.
A soldier put them in safety.
After a number of operations, she thought she was completely healed, but yesterday said: "The pain returned three months ago.
I'm afraid I have to be re-operated.
Some pomegranates are still in my knee.
Her goal is now to become a dentist to help the people as helped by doctors.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it didn't break me," she said campy.
"That's what happened to me, and you can't change that.
Once a year, I always go to the gym to remember those who have stayed there.
My friends and I are trying not to talk about it on other days.
The pain is too big.
My best friend and future classmate Dzera Gapoeva was killed there.
We played together when we were little, dreaming of going to school together.
"I don't want to marry until I finish my studies and start my career.
I think of a family later.
She says that the siege will always remain a part of it, although the memory becomes somewhat weaker every year.
I am glad that many people in the world still remember our horrors and we are so grateful for the help we received from people in Great Britain and everywhere.
When I see the photo of me online, as I climb back to school, I think many people see it for the first time, understand our disaster and contribute to the fact that something like this does not happen again.
The boy who fled through the bullet ball, in the opinion that his mother was dead
It was his first day of school (runs going to school at the age of 7) and survived the three-day siege into the arms of his mother Tamara.
As a seven-year-old, he said, "Mama told me to lie down if there was an explosion and hold her hand."
After an explosion, he thought she was going to die.
She said to him, "Run."
Fearless she could be dead, he fled and saw a crying grandchild on the way, caught it by the hand and fled through a ball ball.
His father Vladimir, who locked his son in his arms outside, said, "Damir told me his mother died.
He said, "I couldn't save her."
In reality, Tamara had been pushed outside and with leg injuries in the hospital, in turn assuming that her son had died.
After her reunification, she said, "I cry for joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damir was later flown to London (from the now dissolved newspaper News of the World) to receive the title of a Barnardo's Children's Champion by then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
"This horror is persecuting you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering," he said yesterday.
But I can say it's going to be more pale in my memory.
I remember right after that, I threw away all my toy guns.
But now I can play computer games with shooting scenes and that's no problem for me.
"I'm not afraid of going back to the gym, but I don't think about myself.
I remember these kids I played with in the yard and they didn't make it out.
We never say they were killed or killed.
We say they stayed in the gym.
I remember very well my trip to London, especially the toys store, where I could choose everything I wanted and the ride in an up-open car.
But now he is afraid of a place like Ukraine, where wars cause the kind of calamity he and his friends suffered.
This horror is persecuting you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it.
"I am so sorry for all those who suffer from the horrors," said Damir, who last week worked as a volunteer in a monastery.
I'm so glad to help.
I want to go to the police one day and hope they take me to the training academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, said, "37 children from our neighborhood were killed, can you imagine?
I remember the terrible silence after the siege, there were simply no children who could call and walk around, and this silence lasted many months.
She vividly remembers her trip to London with Damir.
The people in London were crying when I told our story.
At the time, I understood how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and show their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the price and the opportunity to travel to London in autumn 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and just tell her that 10 years have passed, but I still remember the meeting with her and her husband in London, and how Damir and I helped.
I remember what Damir wanted to eat Borschsch and they called all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember him playing with waiters in a restaurant. Damir shot her with his water gun and they ran away and played with him.
And that was only one month after the horror.
I was surprised that the British were so willing to share our pain and supported us.
She said, "I always think this world hasn't gotten better in these 10 years.
In Ukraine, the war continues now, and every day people die, and I believe that many children have been killed and are still being killed.
They're just like kids like ours.
I think that for many of the war is part of the news they hear when they are bored or busy with something else.
I just know what these people feel, the whole horror.
And I can't stop feeling that.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other and that is so sad.
Damir became big and is a very gentle and quiet boy, he is not at all aggressive or angry.
For example, he does not look for revenge, he is not overwhelmed by the past horrors.
I know he doesn't like to remember, but he has six close friends from the class and they sometimes go to the gym and light candles there.
When he was smaller, he suffered under it - I remember how he sometimes sat on the sofa, turned his face away from us for hours.
Not sleeping, his eyes were open.
I also remember him throwing all his weapons and other military toys. Damir is now 17, bigger than I am, good looking, intelligent and healthy.
I can hardly believe that I was so sure for a few hours that he was dead and I would never see him again.
When I recovered after the explosion and came on my legs, I looked around, and saw hell around me, with body parts lying around.
I was absolutely sure that my little boy could not possibly have survived in this hell.
"I remember calling him, "Damir, run, run away," but I was also so sure that he hadn't heard me.
But he heard it, and he ran away.
And so life continues for us, unlike that of many others.
Georgij Ilyin, 17
The boy whose terrible image became the symbol of the abomination of Beslan after the siege
Consolation: The Beslan survivor Georgij Lyin with his mother Fatima after the siege in 2004, right a picture of Georgij today
His bloodflowed face was drawn with fear as he ran around his life while Chechen terrorists shot down his classmates.
His image was one of the most shocking symbols for Beslan's barbarian.
His mother Fatima, 54, had dropped him off for his first day of school before going to school to bring her older son Vladimir to the university.
"I left the court about two minutes before the terrorists stormed him, and so my little boy stayed there alone for three terrible days," she remembers.
Not all alone, there was an entire family of relatives of us, but they were all killed.
Only my Georgia managed to survive.
The closer this date, the harder it is to think about it and talk about it.
There is no day when we do not remember this tragedy.
We don't think it's been a long time since, I mean, it would have happened yesterday, some scenes from these days are always persecuting me.
No one will ever forget that, I promise you.
Intrusive: The image of Georgij (left) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was immortalized as a statue (right).
I remember that this day, Georgij wanted to go to school so much he said he wanted to embrace his teacher.
I just knew he was alive when I saw him on TV.
And now there is even this statue of the weeping Georgia in San Marino.
Georgij doesn't like to see the picture, and it's hidden at home in the bookcase.
I understand this, but I also think that thanks to this image, people around the world feel our pain.
Georgij says today, "It is important that such a thing can never happen again.
"I doubt we'll ever know the truth.
People are constantly investigating such tragedies and never experiencing the truth.
And now they are investigating the crash of this Boeing in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what caused him?
This world becomes something terrible.
"I can't understand how this is possible because if you ask people, nobody wants a war, so how does that happen?
Ten years are nothing at all with such pain.
We need dozens of years to forget it a little.
It has attacked my health and I still feel it.
For about three or four years, I had a few nightmares because of the siege, but then it got better.
I went back to school later in 2004 and was afraid every day.
I was thinking of my friends and classmates who had been killed.
That's why I'm always going to the gym when September 1 is getting closer.
I want to pay tribute to my old childhood friends.
It's hard for me to go to the gym, but I have to do it.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is part of my past now.
I won't forget, but I'm sorry.
My life continues.
I graduated from school this year and visited a medical university in Wladikavkaz.
I'm going to be a heart surgeon.
My first choice was an education in the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but my health didn't allow that.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that won't happen.
Georgia Fanijew, 20
The boy who survived, although he was caught at the feet of a murderous terrorist
A miracle: during the siege, Georgij Fanijew was trapped at the feet of a murderous terrorist, but he managed to survive.
During the siege he was trapped in the sports hall and sat next to the bomb, which was fixed at the foot of a murderous terrorist.
It's really a miracle that he wasn't killed.
"We feel as if it had been yesterday," says Georgij, who wanted to go to FSB as a secret servant, but could not do this because of his health damage due to the siege.
It's still with me, it's nothing I left behind.
I'm older now and people say that kids can easily deal with bad experiences - I have to say that's not right.
"In 2006 I worked with psychologists and after that I actually felt a little better, but I can't forget it.
And I'd love to forget.
2005 - the year after - was the first and only time I went back to the gym.
I lost consciousness.
I will never return there again, and please don't ask me to show you where I sat in this famous picture.
Survivor: Georgij Fanijew today, with a photo of himself in hospital after the siege on the laptop
My pain is terrible and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know I don't like to think about it or talk about it and they never asked me about school.
I'm okay physically.
I should be careful with my injured knee, but I can walk well now.
But because of my health, I couldn't study at the FSB's Secret Service Academy in St Petersburg, as I wanted.
I sent in my documents, including the medical staff, and they answered that it was not possible.
My second passion was the animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I've been there for two years.
He learns the treatment of all animals "from cats to cows".
He said, "I knew that I would never tell my children about my experiences.
Children should know nothing about this, and they should not, of course, suffer it.
His mother Marina, 42, said, "This pain never leaves me.
He's in my soul, worse when the anniversary moves closer.
I will go to the celebrations to commemorate.
I know that Georgia will not go.
It must be much more fierce for him because he was there and I wasn't.
I waited for him at home and couldn't help.
I am so grateful to God that he was given back to me. Here in Beslan are all drawn from it.
It's in us.
Georgij is now an adult, but this horror is still in him.
It's hard to accept this when you're doing something so unfair.
He's a boy, he likes sports, but he can't take part because of his knee.
He's been operated several times, he can walk, but he can't run a sport.
I would say he overcame the horror to 50%, but you can never completely overcome it and forget it.
This terrible experience will always follow us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed at the siege and this only reinforces my pain.
I lost a lot of people I knew well and who were expensive to me.
My son is with me, and this is the greatest gift that God could make me, but my heart cries for the killed.
I know of families in which new children were born, but also widows who never married again.
It's hard to accept that life continues, even if you don't want to.
I'll never forget how my heart jumped in me when I saw him in the hospital.
And now I see what is going on in the world - wars in other regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why do they kill each other?
War is very close to our country now, and I almost cannot believe it.
We were once a friendly country, how can it be that we are now fighting?
People and children suffer, I am sure that many children have already been killed in Ukraine and many more have been killed.
If we could only grab all these rebels and throw them out - as far away as possible.
Aljona Tskayawa, 10
The baby thus carried by a special command in security
Gerettet: Aljona Tskajewa is secured by a Russian special-purpose command (left).
She is now ten (right) and does not remember the horrors at all
The world held its breath in 2004 when the baby Aljona was carried in the arms of a Russian police officer from the siege of Beslan.
The terrorists let them go, but in their cruelty their 30-year-old mother, the 10-year-old sister Kristina and her brother Makhar held back at the school gym.
Makhar, then three years old, escaped, but Aljona's mother and sister died in the murderous scourge.
Her father Ruslan has been married since then and has a little girl with his new wife, Svetlana, after his lost daughter Kristina.
Aljona, ten years old today, does not remember the siege and has grown up to be an intelligent and happy girl, say neighbors.
"They are now a big happy family and Aljona and Makhar are both great children," says a close friend.
Ruslan is a fantastic father and wants to spare them all the memories that go up with the tenth anniversary.
You'll understand why.
Man accused of crossing girls on pedestrian crossing in Fife
A 78-year-old man is in court because of the passing of a three-year-old girl on a pedestrian crossing in Fife.
Gordon Steward is accused of driving a girl on the transition to Pittenween in East Neuk.
The charge states that Mr Steward controlled his Audi Q3 without the necessary care and attention and injured the girl.
Stewart, 78, from Anstrother, rejected the charge in front of Dundee Sheriff Court.
Sheriff Charles Macnair QC started the procedure for January.
4 Tips for better underwater photos and videos
If you want to take photos or videos under water, there is a selection of devices.
The cheapest option is a waterproof point-and-shoot, like the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action cam like the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both of which are about $300.
I recorded these photos at a family festival with multiple cameras, all available at a price of less than $350.
Regardless of the equipment there are a few rules for the best results.
Check your equipment twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the battery compartment and other compartments are closed.
Set your camera to the photos or videos you want to record.
Some cameras and camcorders have scene and recording modes, which optimize the exposure time for the steamy underwater conditions.
And before you jump in, check the depth at which your equipment is functional.
Some cameras are only allowed for up to 5 feet, others up to 50 or 60 feet.
Search our shopping guide and review digital cameras for conventional and waterproof models.
Make multiple shots - because many will not work.
Point-and-shoot cameras have an LCD with which you can compose images, action cameras usually do not.
Even if you have an LCD, it is difficult to see this under water, and the correct image setting is a lucky thing.
So you take a lot of shots.
If your camera has a row mode with which a number of recordings with slightly changed exposure settings are made, use it.
Stay close to the surface.
The light becomes dramatically worse, the further you remove from the surface.
So if possible, stay close to the surface if you take shots in a pool, lake or sea.
This also allows you to bring more color into your photos; the deeper you go, the less color you will see.
Go close to the objects.
This is also a good advice on land, but it is all the more important under water because of the bad light conditions.
It is particularly important when you are working with an action cam: these devices often have a fixed wide angle lens, which means you need to get closer to your objects when they are to fill out the entire frame.
Andrew Lawson was a man of the variety whose character changes things, even in such a gigantic organization as the NHS.
As an anesthesiologist, he dedicated his career to saving the sick both the agony of the disease and the pains of treatment.
Among his patients, his wife remembers, was an MI6 employee who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.
Lawson knew that doctors are important to the diagnosis and disease, while the patients are mainly concerned with something quite different: pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the one whose path of suffering began.
"I didn't feel like it," he wrote in May this year.
I had trouble getting up.
While fighting with the flu-like symptoms, he noticed that he made impatient accusations to his wife Juliet.
"I prefer everything immediately than later," he noted.
When Juliet was on a business trip for a week, Lawson felt quite unusual and unfounded.
Something was in the air.
He asked a colleague to carry out an X-ray examination of his chest.
Only two weeks ago he had been skiing in the French Alps.
The results of the X-ray investigation were available.
He suffered from mesotheliom, an incurable cancer that attacks the breast fur, i.e. the skin that covers the lungs.
As with most cancers, the exact trigger is usually difficult to determine.
While some smokers suffer from lung cancer, not all lung cancer patients have been smokers in the past.
But Mesothelioma is different.
In almost all cases, the trigger is an asbestos load - contact with the fiber building material, which was once considered "wonderous" but has now been recognized as fatal.
For most of us, mesothelioma is a disease that can ignore as easily as possible.
Asbestos is finally a product of the past.
The most dangerous asbestos type was no longer used in Britain since the 1960s, when the industry voluntarily committed itself to not using it.
Even where he was still employed, only people in certain industries worked directly with the fabric - glueers, construction workers, carpenters and shipyard workers, for example.
As an industrial dangerous substance from another time, it hardly seems to be alarming today.
But this self-satisfaction is inappropriate.
Great Britain, it seems, is experiencing today the culmination of a mesoltheliom epidemic.
There are more deaths by Mesotheliom here than in any other country in the world.
With a total of 2,500 deaths per year, twice as many people die of this disease as in traffic accidents.
Annual figures of mesotheliomtodes cases since 1980 and expected deaths in Great Britain
The reason why we experience the fatal effects now, although asbestos has been illegal for years (1999 all asbestos types have been banned), is that a mesothelioma develops only after decades.
And the scourge of Mesothelioma is not limited to former workers in the construction industry.
Asbestos was, and is often still present in the houses where we live, the offices in which we work, the schools in which we learn and the shops in which we shop.
And therefore Mesothelioma knows no class barriers, financial limits, occupations or age.
The privileged bastions, from the elegant department stores in London to private schools, are not a protective room.
The Parliament buildings are asbest-fed.
Even in the hospitals where we are supposed to be healthy, this deadly carcinogen has already been selected as the source of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He wasn't a plumber either.
It was indeed difficult for him to imagine where he might have come into contact with asbestos.
Then he found out.
"It looks like there was a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at Guy's Hospital, where I completed my education for six years."
All students, nurses, doctors and gatekeepers use the tunnels.
You wonder how many of my peers are going to suffer from the same disease?
Unfortunately, he was able to answer this question at least partially.
"From the four doctors trained at Guy's Hospital who have been suffering from Mesothelioma in the last five years," he wrote in a letter in 2010, "I am the last to live."
How many of us will still suffer?
At Andrew Lawson, Mesothelioma was diagnosed at the age of 48.
When he died on February 17, this year, he was 55.
It was an unusually long survival period.
Fifty per cent of all mesothelioma patients die within 8 months of diagnosis.
The disease always ends dead.
So we can only repeat Lawson's question: "How many of us will still suffer?"
The leading expert in Great Britain on Mesothelioma, Professor Julian Peto, assumes that between 1870 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in Britain is expected to fall, a total of 90,000 of the disease will be killed.
Most of them have no idea yet that they will die like this.

A brief look at the case files of the courts, to which the persons concerned often refer because of claims for damages, shows how far the scourge of the mesotheliom has already been spread.
In June this year, for example, Marks & Spencer admitted that Janice Allen had negligently exposed asbestos.
She worked for nine years for the chain, from 1978 to 1987 and was responsible for the clothing department at two locations - one of them from the flagship store on Oxford Street.
Mrs. Allen was only 18 years old when she started her work at M&S.
Now she's got two kids in the twenties.
"Before this thing," she says, "I had never heard of Mesotheliom, I didn't even really know anything about asbestos.
I never thought this would affect me.
There are only a few people who know a lot about asbestos.
The fact is that the term asbestos refers not to a substance but to a group of six minerals.
The name comes from the word "Asbestiform", a description of the fiber structure that makes the fabric resistant and flexible.
Three out of six were used in construction.
Chrysotil, also known as white asbestos, is today by far the most commonly found asbestos in buildings.
It was used for roof panels, floor plates, tube insulations, boiler insulations, even for brake coatings in cars.
It is less deadly than other asbestos forms, but is still regarded by the EU and WHO as a "great health risk" with possible death toll.
However, the brown asbestos and the blue asbestos (crokydolith) are more dangerous.
United Kingdom was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suspect that "there is clear but indirect evidence that this was a major reason for the uniquely high mesotheliomrates."

Janice Allen may not have seen himself as a typical messothelioma sacrifice, but Julian Peto's work indicates that her story is by no means unusual.
He has submitted a study by the interested parties, which shows that "a significant proportion of mesothelioma was probably caused by asbestos contact in the environment without a known suspension by work or at home."
Most of these contacts are based on the "normal use and aging" of our buildings.
It looks like no one can expect to be safe.
A report from Goddard Consulting, which examined the palace of Westminster, shows how people could have been unknowingly exposed to the fabric in the heart of the government.
In 2009, Goddard reported that the service shocks and pipelines behind the committee rooms of Parliament were contaminated with asbestos, whose fatal fibers could be ignited by something as harmless as "strong air movements".
Members of Parliament are often accused of taking care of their own interests, but here it seems as if the opposite is the case.
While the management of the Parliamentary Labour Service insisted that the Westminster Palace had received a "clean health certificate", it is now undisputed that 1 billion pounds of labour must be spent over several years in order to renovate Parliament, modernise the electrical installations and remove asbestos, and that after the general elections of 2015, Members will probably meet more in the nearby QE2 conference centre than in the green banks in Westminster.
The Goddard report also pointed out that "the presence of asbestos was not handled in accordance with the relevant provisions."
No one can know if this mismanagement will cost life.
All you can do now is wait.
A person who could never exactly determine contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general physician.
Like Andrew Lawson, the 50-year-old Abbot suspects that he was exposed to asbestos during his work in hospitals.
"I worked in a hospital where asbestos complaints were decided positively," he says, "but I can't prove it in my case.
It is so difficult to remember all the places you worked on and the data.
What he remembers is the day at the beginning of December 2009, where he got such a fever.
He was 45 years old, and he was in surgery late in the evening.
Suddenly, I had a shaking frost.
It came all of a sudden.
I felt terrible.
I didn't think I could make the ride home anymore.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pain of the breast fur that touched skin around his lungs.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to suspect a mesothelioma.
He didn't go to work for a month.
Wondered doctors made X-ray shots of his chest and put on pleurakathether to extract fluid from the lungs and test it in the laboratory.
However, his complaints remained without diagnosis.
His health improved slowly, and he returned to work.
From time to time, however, symptoms returned, often after exercise and heavy breathing.
In 2011 a patient came Abbotts with similar symptoms in his practice and was later diagnosed with Mesothelioma.
But even now, Abbot did not associate this with his own case.
Finally, his patient was a few decades older and had worked directly with asbestos.
The connection in the case was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition worsened again and his family doctor brought his CT scans and X-ray shots to an expert group.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott felt sick for the first time, a probe equipped with a camera was introduced into the cave between the rib and the breast fur.
I'm an optimist.
I usually just keep going," he says.
Honestly, I didn't even worry so much.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of the biopsy was between Christmas and New Year in the week: "They told me it was Mesothelioma."
Graham Abbott: Diagnostic Mesothelioma
Suddenly, Abbott had appointments with Macmillan nurses, one of whom advised him to take a lawyer.
Only now did he grasp the extent of the epidemic.
"It turned out that asbestos was very widespread, especially in large public buildings where pipes were often isolated with asbestos," he says.
The people who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings now suffer.
And this is how Mesothelioma meets younger people who have not worked in the typical professions.
The most dangerous pipes with asbestostilations in hospitals were below the ground, so patients probably were not exposed to the substance.
But many employees who had changed from one building to another in pedestrian tunnels (like Andrew Lawson) or ate in underground canteens (as Graham Abbott often did) came in contact with the toxic substances with the greatest probability.
It turns out that over several decades after the war hospitals may have been lifesaving for patients, but life-threatening for the treating doctors.
He's still being removed.
Students turned their Bunsen burners on asbestos mats.
And it's not just hospitals.
Asbestos was often used in offices, shops, libraries and city halls due to its fabulous insulating and flame-retardant properties.
Schools too.
In fact, many people have probably had the first asbestos contact in the classroom.
All over the country, in thousands of hours of chemistry, students have placed their bunk burners on asbestos mats.
The issue of asbestos in schools is now frequently addressed on websites.
And since then, so innocent things have been contained in our homes such as floor plates or shed roofs by default.
"It is an industrial gift that is contained in large parts of our property," notes Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his trial against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, the only contact that occurred to a woman affected was the demolition of a garden shed in the 1970s.
So be careful how to tear off your garden scales.
The effects of the diagnosis, and the knowledge that the disease is incurable, is immense.
"It takes a while to process this," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to move on, but I realized that I couldn't concentrate on what I was doing.
I was in practice for two weeks.
Then I knew I had to go and take care of myself.
Well, I'm not going to experience any more Christmas.
With the greatest difficulty, the change of perspective was from the position of a doctor to that of a patient.
Like countless patients before him, he remembers how overwhelmed he was of all the information he had to deal with.
"It was very difficult to record all of this," he says.
"I asked my doctor, "How long do I have yet?"
And they gave me about 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I'm not going to experience any more Christmas.
That's it then."
Mesothelioma is particularly sensitive because it is our life-sustaining mechanism - the breathing itself - that causes fatal cancer.
Most cases of mesotheliom are caused by asbestos contact.
Asbestos consists of smallest fibers.
When the asbestos is irrigated and the fibers are inhaled, they can be stuck in the breast fur, the skin around the lungs.
Asbestos fibers irritate the breast fur and can trigger cell mutations.
"The problem arises with the inhaled noodle-shaped asbestos fibres," says Professor Tom Treasure, a heart thorax doctor who moved to Guy's Hospital in 2001.
Just the hospital that Andrew Lawson suspects has exposed him to the asbestos is now ironically, a leading center in the treatment of mesothelioma.
Lawson knew Treasure and treated some others who were probably also exposed to asbestos during their training in the hospital.
As soon as the asbestos needles reach the lung tissue, says Treasure, "they are pushed from the breathing process to the edge where the skin is.
From nature it is invasive from the beginning.
The usual options for other cancers do not work so well in mesothelioma.
For example, the effectiveness of an operation is hotly controversial.
Some think she's worth a try.
Treasure refuses this.
"You can't cut out the breast fur," he says.
They don't come around with the knife.
Therefore, the cancer "does not address chemotherapy very well," the "effect shows", but does not heal.
"Sometimes there are survivors," says Treasure.
But in the end, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients actually live long, much longer than expected.
Author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after the diagnosis.
Graham Abbott is still fighting for two and a half years after his own diagnosis.
After contacting Mesothelioma, Abbott came in contact with Andrew Lawson, who had become a one-man support and consulting firm for those affected four years after his diagnosis.
"Hello, Cancer Center," he was happy to introduce himself to calls.
"He was very positive," says Abbott.
He had received his diagnosis 4 years earlier and was still very active.
Originally, Abbott had been offered six chemotherapy cycles, which lasted four months and his life was expected to be extended only by one month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I wanted to give up.
But Lawson managed to "let things appear in a slightly more positive light."
After consulting several doctors, Abbot decided to continue his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski, heart thorax specialist at Guy's.
"We had an advantage by not having to move on, I just called and got a date," Graham admits.
A normal patient would need to receive a transfer and wait for the treatment to be approved.
Money is crucial for mesothelioma patients in order to be able to experience the best available therapies.
But if these treatments finally fail inevitably, many affected are faced with another financial concern - the future of the families they leave behind.
And so they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan from Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"It has been known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous to health," says Morgan.
But what changed in the 1960s was that one realized that even a very low load was a health risk.
And here the neglect of the companies began to play a role.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital finally contributed to their case, but it wasn't what Morgan calls a "full compensation" because Lawson couldn't prove with absolute certainty that his mesotheliom was due to an asbestos contact with the Guy's.
After the investigation to his death, however, a Guy's spokesman confirmed that "the asbestos fibers in the cellar area concerned were removed in the 1990s."
That was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to Remove asbestos
In fact, it is a huge problem for mesotheliom sufferers who seek compensation, to assign the deadly asbestos contact to a company or a workplace - usually decades after the incidents.
Many of their former employers have been sold or closed.
Insurance documents may be lost.
And those who oppose claims know that time is for them, but certainly not with the applicants.
In response this year, there were clear new legislation that makes it easier for Mesothelioma affected people to file compensation even if their former employers are no longer to be found.
The law has set up a $350 million fund funded by the insurance industry for all those diagnosed after July 2012 can prove a contact, but no one can sue.
In these cases, the complainants receive 80 percent of what a court in a normal compensation process could have addressed to them - approximately $120,000.
About 300 successful applications to the programme are expected per year.
Andrew Morgan thinks as many Mesotheliom affected people that Â£350 million represented a "very good work" in the insurance industry.
"This is a deal of insurers for insurers," he says, pointing out that this sum is a quarter of what insurers should have paid if the time had not gone by and Mesothelioma patients found the companies and could sue them normally.
Mike Penning, then Minister of Labour and Pensions, also admitted that the law was "not perfect".
But both Penning and Morgan admitted that, in the face of seven deaths, a rapid action is necessary every day.
"People suffer so much and need help today," Penning said during the second hearing of the Mesotheliom law in December last year.
At that time Graham Abbott was in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After her first consultations, Lang-Lazdunski recommended an operation from which he expected a positive effect in contrast to Tom Treasure.
This has been accompanied by radiation therapy and chemotherapy - a triple therapy that allows Lang-Lazdunski to present a survival rate of up to 40 percent over five years.
Abbott felt strengthened.
"This is, of course, with the most important," says Abbott.
You'll see that in patients.
There's something there that makes you move on.
If you give up, you'll get worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott underwent surgery in March 2012.
At the end of August, he had the last of the six chemotherapy cycles.
Aftercare scans showed no signs of disease.
Then I had a scan in March 2014.
There were several cancer spots around my chest.
I just got 50.
That's not life-threatening.
That's life-consuming.
Again, Abbot underwent six chemotherapy cycles.
Now the tumors are no longer visible.
But the process is physically and psychologically very strenuous.
You have to think of practical things -- about the money when I'm no longer, for example, or my wife, show you how it works.
If you get bad news, you'll get negative.
You need to look forward.
As father of Ellie, 16 and Tamsin, 14, this is not always easy.
"It's hard for parents," he says.
It's hard to know what to say and how much.
When I received my first diagnosis, I told my girl that I had a disease with which I wouldn't grow old.
They reacted quite differently.
Tamsin is very social and rude.
She told her friends and we soon got a lot of calls.
Ellie was more reticent.
She didn't say much.
Such conversations are something that all cancer patients have to go through.
But for Mesotheliomarkranks such conversations are not passed through by hope, not by a trace of hope for survival.
The disease (as eventually also for Stephen Jay Gould) brings a gross security.
As Andrew Morgan says, "Mesothelioma is not life-threatening.

China refuses Hong Kong right to government election, demonstrators swear retribution
On Sunday, despite the increased calls for democratic reforms, the Chinese Parliament decided against the nomination of candidates for the 2017 elections by the Hong Kong electorate.
This process is likely to fuel the long-announced protests in Hong Kong's business district, while activists led planning and mobilization to this within a few hours of the announcement.
The decision of the Chinese People's Congress allows the Communist leaders to reject all non-peach faithful candidates in principle.
"This is not unexpected, but it makes us angry," said legal expert Emily Lau, president of the Democratic Party.
That's not what Beijing promised.
They lied to the people of Hong Kong.
And it's clear we're dealing with an authoritarian regime.
In his defense of the Chinese decision, Li Fei, Deputy Secretary-General of the Permanent Committee of the National People's Congress, said that the admission of public nominations in the elections for the Hong Kong government would be "chaotic".
Since 1997, when Britain returned control of Hong Kong to the Chinese, Beijing has promised to let the inhabitants vote for the government office from 2017.
The Chinese leadership presented Sunday's decision as a democratic breakthrough because it gives Hong Kong's citizens a direct electoral right, but the decision also makes it clear that the Chinese leadership is holding firmly the course through a closely controlled nominee committee.
According to a new clause, only candidates are to be admitted "with love for the country and love of Hong Kong".
The decision follows a summer in which some of the largest and most public protests in Hong Kong have taken place for several years.
Behind the pro-democratic campaign in Hong Kong is the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers have threatened to close down the financial district if Beijing does not allow a real universal electoral right.
On Sunday evening, hundreds of Occupy-Central followers gathered in the rain in front of the government headquarters in Hong Kong within a few hours after the announcement.
During the demonstration, the organizers said that their movement had reached a new level of civil disobedience and planned them for protest waves in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide any further information, apparently to avoid problems with the authorities.
In an online communication, the organizers announced that the movement "has only considered the occupation of the central district as the last means, an action to take place only when all the dialogue opportunities are exhausted and there is no other choice.
We are sorry to have to say that today all the dialogue opportunities have been exhausted and the occupation of the central district will definitely take place.
The Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for Beijing announcement for days and security measures, including police and barricades, were scheduled for Sunday before the government building.
The unrest is strengthened by the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control of their city.
The entry of people from the mainland strengthens competition for products and services.
In addition, the fear is that Hong Kong's values such as democracy and freedom of speech will begin to break under the growing pressure of Beijing.
Some criticised the demonstrations of the Occupy-Central movement as it endangered the business business - the lifeline of Hong Kong.
"The protests they speak of could cause great economic damage, depending on how many are involved and how long they last," said legal expert Regine Ip, who has been criticizing the movement for a long time.
We don't want any fears about Hong Kong getting out of control.
This impression is bad for investment.
China's state-controlled media reported recently on the Democratic activists in Hong Kong as subversive agents controlled by Western powers.
In this summer, activists organized an unofficial referendum on the electoral rights in which 780.000 people participated - more than a fifth of the voters in Hong Kong.
In July, tens of thousands took part in one of the largest demonstrations of democracy in the history of the region.
The tradition of the U.S. school proms is now being transferred to the universities where Freshmen performances with the private aircraft are offered.
We are pleased to be able to respond to this demand and offer the first luxury travel service of Britain for students of today.
The company also offers transport options such as private aircraft, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Marten or McLaren P1 to make a particularly impressive appearance at the university.
Mr. Stewart also stated that the service has a security section.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who otherwise have to push their possessions through the country in a dangerously overcharged car.
Together with our new VIF options, we are looking forward to ensuring this year that students reach the university with a minimum of effort and a maximum of luxury.
One company speaker said that there are no new bookings as the service had just been introduced, but added that "Students would book the service in the next few weeks".
The company also announced that despite the tuition fees of Â£9 000 a year, it is expecting a market for this offer.
Students today differ very much from the students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago in their expectations and demands - it is more important than ever to make a great first impression, and with VIF you can do exactly that.
However, the National Student Union criticised the service as being cancelled.
Megan Dunn, Vice-President of the NUS for Higher Education said: "This offer seems completely separate from the lives of the majority of students.
Many students who begin their studies this month see themselves exposed to a crisis of living costs, as the financial support available in the form of loans and scholarships does not keep pace with the sharp increase in bills for the simplest living bases before they can even think of spending thousands of pounds on such a simple thing as arrival in the student home.
Feminists criticise racial questions and police behaviour after Ferguson
The unarmed teen was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo. at the beginning of this month.
The participants lifted their hands into the air and sang, "Hands up, don't shoot," while waiting for the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Mo, because of the shooting of the unarmed teen Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a change in the online discussions of white feminists.
According to her experience, white feminist commentators put gender before the race when it comes to addressing reproductive law and income inequalities.
However, while tensions in the Middle West rose and received attention throughout the country, Perez saw that the answers from white women turned to 100% around the race.
Compared to the answers of black women shortly after the shooting of August 9, the personal essays with titles such as "thinks to Ferguson of a white woman" and "feminism is not just about the oppression of women" were relatively late.
But for Perez, that meant an important change.
"I don't think there are many people in feminism who are about white and speak privileges in such a high-class way," she said.
People felt compelled to express something about the incidents.
It is characteristic of the crisis in which we are and because the situation in Ferguson is so ethnicized that they have to express it.
For English professor Koritha Mitchell from Ohio State University, Ferguson brought to light problems that black Americans are exposed to every day, but which are not considered to be "woman themes" in the cultural sphere.
"I can publish something fun on Facebook about me and my partner and get 150 likes from anywhere," Mitchell said.
If I post something about how colorful people in their own country are under siege, silence is deafening.
"How can it be safe for women to talk publicly about a relationship, but not about public security?" she asked.
For black women like Mitchell who have studied race, gender and sexuality in the history of the USA, there is no dichotomy between racial and gender problems.
For them black women did not have the luxury to clean up the topics; they live every day in the combined reality.
While white women now combine the topics of race and gender in feminist mainstream circles, Angela Hattery, professor of women and gender research at George Mason University, says that their predecessors did the opposite.
"Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were beaten and the reason was almost always the rape of a white woman," said Hattery.
White women had to be involved in the story to justify the lynch murder.
For Hattery, the division between white and black women came to the point where white fighters for the right to women's elections like Susan B. Anthony analyzed the country in the late 19th century and found that the struggle for electoral rights could only be successful for each group: women or blacks.
"They made the decision to stand up for the right to vote for women, and the right to vote for blacks was to come later," said Hattery.
Remembering such things, one becomes aware with power of why colored women do not trust white women.
We didn't do our job well.
We have never helped black women protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women received the right to vote in 1920, it took a decade to organize white women against the Lynchen in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group was formed almost 40 years after the original request for help from black women, says Mitchell.
For Mitchell, the flood of white feminist reactions to the questions raised by Ferguson - police behaviour, racial discrimination - is a mirror of the time when white feminists played "fangs" with the problems that black women have faced for generations.
"Wouldn't it be great if the activists who have such traditional feminist platforms take the right to raise a child as seriously as they do with the right to receive control?" asked Mitchell.
Second-generation feminists, who built their careers on the struggle for reproductive rights and access to contraceptional means, are now trying to understand what that means.
The famous white feminist activist Gloria Steinem went on Facebook two weeks after the shooting of Michael Brown and published a scored article by Rebecca Carroll, Guardian columnist, in which she demanded more protests from white Americans on racism.
"I hope that women who have a different but parallel reason to understand a danger inherent in the body - and opinions on the race that are clearly different in public surveys - will cause the changes," Steinem wrote.
Although Steinem stands for a more intersectional feminism in which racial and gender issues are addressed, some of its comments on the issue of race in America are astounded.
Christina Sommers, researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of "Who Stole Feminism?" said to She The People that young men in the United States, especially young colored men, "are far more vulnerable than their sisters," but Steinem's remarks about Ferguson are contrary to her previous criticism.
There are now hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
But when the White House recently imposed a small program, My Brother's Keeper, to help vulnerable young black and hispanic men, there were angry reactions from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
The police's relationship with the black community is not the only problem that pushes into the foreground of mainstream feminism.
After the U.S. Border Police has taken up nearly 63,000 unaccompanied minors at the south-west border of the country this year, the issue of immigration reform is also re-entered - this time as a women's theme.
Andrea Mercado, co-chairman of We Belong Together, an organisation that mobilises women for the reform of immigration, said that for a re-examination of the topic as an essential women's theme, she only had to publish the stories of immigrants' women.
"These speak for themselves," Mercado said.
When the vast majority of the work visas go to male immigrants, the women they accompany are in a position where they are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories find a afterlife in the women's organizations," she said.
"Schweine-Haus" in Ipswich is for sale
The picture of a house for sale was removed from real estate agents when it became clear that it showed a large pig that had made it comfortable in the living room.
The detached house has a bedroom, is located on a private street in Ipswich and is offered for 120,000 pounds.
The details included a picture of the living room of the house - to which also a pig belonged that his head had placed on a sofa.
Real estate agent Connells said the pig on the photo was the pet of the owner.
"But the photo was not published in any way and was now removed," said one of the company's spokesperson.
At the House ExposÃ©, Connells described the former assembly house as a "unique single-family house with one bedroom."
Although the broker has removed the picture from the website, it still appears on advertising material.
In the social media, the sale of the house caused interest when some asked if the pig was included in the purchase price.
The SW-city Harvey is home to a new millionaire after Lotto win
A lottery player from Harvey this month
The search for a new millionaire in the southwest of Perth lasts, with a happy winner who gets nearly $1 million from the lottery draw on Saturday.
For the second time in five years, a newspaperskiosk in Harvey pulled the jackpot in the drawing of the first division, after $1 million in November 2009.
The lucky winner, however, still has to report.
The shop owner Steve Forward said that the profit is for conversation in the small town in the southwest of Perth.
The city is talking about nothing else, and everyone's quite excited.
We thought such a profit could occur.
Eight WA winners celebrated last month gains in the first division, a due conclusion for a few happy weeks for the players in the state.
Last week, a player from Canning Vale was one of the five millionaires in August, after a married couple from Belmont had achieved the mega win of $7.5 million just a few weeks earlier.
The winning couple had played for twenty years and said that winning would allow them the possibility of a world trip and the purchase of a new house.
The millionaire from Harvey is the 59th winner of the first division in the WA this year, with a total of almost 85 million dollars.
Leonidas asked in the Gladiator Arena
Not only the gladiators stood knee-deep in the Matsch on the first Roman day of Rheinbach in the leisure park.
However, the attraction of the event was strong enough to attract well over 1,000 visitors yesterday who were defying the rainshows and the autumn cold and allowed themselves to be entertained by the historical spectacle.
There was a colorful cavalry of representations, performances, games, exhibits and information about the time of the Romans and their significance for the Rhineland.
The main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the martialist team of the Gladiator School "Amor Mortis", which used every rainstorm to demonstrate their robust martial art in the arena prepared with soft sand.
Gladiator-owner "Leonidas" proved to be a humorous and expert presenter and sent his men to the ring for heroic two-fight in various gladiator holes.
First, the "provocators" were on the row with rectangle shield and short sword as well as leg rail on the left leg and armrail on the right arm.
The "Essedarii" followed with breastplate, short weight and worms as well as iron gladiator helmet, leg and arm protection.
The performance of the "Retiarius" was particularly impressive, which came against the "secutor" with the throw net, the three-bag and the dolch and after a short fight hit the boy to the ground.
Since the swords were metallically interconnected, the shields were ripping and the worms flowing through the arena that could become a fear and apprehension about the health of gladiators.
But the imposing Summa Rudis, the muscular referee, had an always attentive eye on them.
"We wanted to revive Roman everyday life and make the culture of the Roman era experienceable," explained Lorenz Euskirchen, Chairman of the organizer "Friendeskreis RÃ¶merkanal", the intention behind the spectacle.
After two years of preparation, a "Oppidum Romanum", a Roman city, was established from the leisure park for a day, as Vice-Citizen Claus Wehage stated in his greeting.
Finally, the Romans have brought not only war and conquest in our region, but also the Roman culture and numerous buildings that we admire today.
Survivors were also to be amazed at the Roman day, such as "aqueduct marble" from the 11 meters high and 1400 meters long Roman Canal Bridge, which once stood at LÃ¼ftelberg.
The Frontinus Society once presented the water and energy supply to the water and now, and Managing Director Petra Fricke knew, "We still benefit from the knowledge of that day".
This also confirms the diploma measuring engineer Ralph Heiliger from the "IngenieurteamZwei" from Rheinbach, who presented measuring instruments of the Romans such as Chorobat, Groma or Dioptra.
The Roman villa in Blankenheim presented sketches and models of excavations anno 1894 as well as bricks from the original hypocaust, the warm air heating that once heated the Roman villa.
Impressing also the footprints left out of clay by Wolf and Fuchs two millennia ago, before they were burned.
In 2011 the Landesverband Landesverbund Rheinland had excavated the remains of a Roman villa in the Nord business park in Rheinbach.
They have found recast walls of an economic building with a darre for drying cereals and for grinding.
The building probably belonged to a Villa Rustica, an agricultural estate, explained the archaeologist Dr. Jennifer Morscheiser.
A number of finds from these excavations presented them in a glass vitrine, including a large plate, several fine glass vessels and parts of a delicate necklace.
The villa probably existed from the first to the fourth century following Christ, until the invasion of the Germans in the then Roman Rhineland, Morscheiser is suspected.
In addition, the children were engaged in the Roman windmill game, similar to today's mill game, or they wrote their names on waxboards like the Roman disciples once.
At the stand of the Romans ZÃ¼lpich, the children of Mosaics were allowed to lay themselves at the stand of the Glasmuseum Rheinbach Glass mosaics and use a heavy stone wheat mill at the stand of the natural center Eifel Nettersheim to ground the flour for a flade bread or a muesli.
The visitors passed through the leisure park with the Roman carriage, which was faithfully remodeled by two coldflowers, as well as the impressive state of the urban gymnasium, which presented here the results of their "Roman project weeks".
With a Roman week from 13 to 21 September, the municipality of Wachtberg will also contribute to the Roman year 2014 called Rhineland, which is to commemorate the death of Emperor Augustus 2000 years ago.
Together with the local and historical associations as well as the Wachtberger Wander-Verein, the Partnership Association and the Laity Spielkreis Oberbachem, there are thematic hikes, a lecture, cooking evenings and guided tours for school classes and a reminder of the Roman past Wartbergs.
For example, a Roman legionary is told about his work on the succulent quarries, is presented as living monuments from the Roman era and offered a funny lesson in terms of international understanding between a group of watchmen "Germans" and drawn Romans.
In the course of a project week, the Adendorf primary school is dedicated to the Roman theme.
With the Roman week, the numerous but often no longer visible traces of the Romans in Wartberg are to be made available again.
In the Wachtberger Town Hall a small presentation will be reminded of the find of the Berkumer Maton sanctuary in 1879.
Ebola: The Epidemic Harasses West Africa's Economy
The Ebola epidemic in West Africa is also a severe blow to the economy.
Markets are lost - and international companies go a long way.
The devastating Ebola epidemic hits the economy of West Africa.
The harvest is rotting in the fields, the mines are abandoned and the markets are lost - the virus has severely increased the region.
Also, some international companies are already on a distance.
"The Ebola epidemic is not only a medical crisis but also an economic one," says Donald Kaberuka, the head of the African Development Bank.
Liberia is the hardest hit
"It's a total disaster, we're losing a lot of money," says Alhaji Bamogo, who sells clothing on the second largest market in Liberia's capital, Monrovia.
On the market only those who want to buy food or something for disinfection against Ebola can buy.
Liberia is the hardest hit by the virus, only there were more than 600 victims of fever.
Recently, the health authorities declared that the disease was in progress at every corner of the country.
The virus has also spread in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria.
In all, more than 1500 people have already died, and thousands more have joined.
Foreign companies withdraw employees
Companies are running all over the resource-rich countries.
Foreign companies such as the steel group Arcelor Mittal withdraw their employees, several international airlines no longer fly to the affected regions.
The local merchants and farmers also respond: few merchants are still leaving their homes to get resuscitation.
In some areas of Sierra Leone and Liberia, which are among the quarantines, the cocoa and coffee beans that are important for export on the fields have rotted.
The farmers do not dare to leave their homes for harvesting.
Food will be scarce
"People will travel less and less," says Phillipe De Vreyer, Parisian expert for the West African economy.
The man, who usually goes to the market and sells his vegetables, prefers to stay at home.
Therefore, the population gets to feel the consequences of the epidemic directly and pressingly: food is getting scarce.
In the markets, the supply of basic foods such as rice disappears.
At the same time, the region heavily dependent on international companies threatens an image damage - with far-reaching consequences.
The greatest danger is that international companies will basically avoid the area for a long time, says Philippe Hugon of the French Think Tank Iris.
It is crucial how far and how long the virus will spread.
For investors, the impression "that it is dangerous to live in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia and thus to invest" warns Hugon.
The disease also burdenes the country's tightened state budgets
The disease also burdenes the state budgets of the countries concerned.
Moody's credit rating agency fears that their budgets will be severely tightened by the high expenditure on the health system and, in addition, by the worsening economy.
The African Development Bank has already promised to help the health systems of the countries concerned with $60 million (â‚¬45 million).
The effects are already noticeable in Nigeria, where only a few Ebola cases have been diagnosed so far.
Although the oily region in the southern Nigerian delta has not been affected.
But elsewhere, many people are already at home for fear of infection.
Reservations in hotels also go back significantly.
Protectors celebrate their 50th anniversary
The SchÃ¼tzenverein "Tannnenwald" Berngau celebrates its 50th anniversary from 12th to 14th September.
The preparations for the 50-year founding festival run from 12 to 14 September at the SchÃ¼tzenverein Tannenwald.
It is planned on Friday, September 12, a great entertainment evening with the group "Dorfrocker".
On Saturday at 6 p.m., the big BÃ¶ller shoots.
Afterwards, in the big feast of the evening of the mood with the "StoapÃ¤lzer Spitzbuam".
Blascapelle provides the music
Highlights on Sunday are the Feast Devotion and 9.30 a.m. in the parish church and the great fortress at 2 p.m.
In the afternoon, the distribution of prices of Federal and Gauschen is also.
A particularly beautiful sight will be the 25 Festdamen with their dirndls.
Festkapelle is the Blaskapelle Berngau.
Mayor Wolfgang Wild and State Secretary Albert FÃ¼racker have taken over the patronship.
The original name "SchÃ¼tzengesellschaft Tannenwald Berngau" dates back to 1907, when the association was founded on 21 March for "social entertainment through exercise in room cleaning and small caliber shooting".
The Nazi regime had led the association to disband in 1937.
It was only in 1964 that 19 young men were found who had raised the "new" Schuttenverein "Tannnenwald" Berngau out of baptism on April 30.
Karl March and Adolf Ried led the club as a shooter master through a difficult start time, in which it was mainly about finding a club venue and installing the shooting operation.
In the autumn of 1965, the SchÃ¼tzenverein started in the Gasthaus "Leininger" with two teams in the round races.
In the following years, the sportsmen, now organized in seven teams, established themselves in all classes up to the 1st Gauliga.
The club records purzelled every year and the magical border of 380 rings was reached for the first time in 1980 by Rudi Meier.
Just as the performance of active shooters has increased, the number of members has also developed positively.
After the club "Leininger" no longer met the requirements of a modern SchÃ¼tzenverein, the board of directors under the leadership of Johann Rinn decided to create a future residence in the cellars of the new "Landgasthof HÃ¤rteis".
After a work of 2700 hours, on 8 May 1988, parish priest Strasser gave the church blessing for the new storehouses.
One of the great highlights in the history of the club was certainly the 44th gaussing, associated with the solemn consecration of the new shooter flag in July 1991.
On 23 and 24 April 1994, the SchÃ¼tzenverein celebrated its 30th anniversary.
A BÃ¶ller group was founded in 1995.
Josef Schmalzl became a BÃ¶llerreferent.
A major challenge for the "BÃ¶llers" and for the association as a whole was the alignment of the Bavarian BÃ¶llers' meeting in 2005.
In many hours of voluntary work, last year's members of the association modernised the rooms and shooting facilities in the Berngauer Hof, thus bringing them to the latest state of the art.
Eleven teams in competitions
The sports services of the Sagittarius Association can also be seen.
A total of eleven teams are currently taking part in the competitions: six Air Force teams, an air gun team, an KK1 sports pistol, a youth and two AH teams.
The 1st team with Lars Ellrich, Katharina Ellrich, Steffi Grad and Kerstin Kellermann has joined the district league 1 in 2013/14 from the Gauoberliga (highest league in the SchÃ¼ttengau ANB).
The 2nd team with Verena Moosburger Alexandra Meier, Eva Schuhmann and Tobias Graml went from the Gauliga Nord to the Gauoberliga.
In addition to shooting, events such as Bockstechen, Faschings- und KÃ¶nigsball, club trip and Christmas party have tradition.
The shooters are also present at the festivals in parish and community.
Tony Stewart suffers accident when returning to the race track
Tony Stewart's return to the race track ended about half way through his race on the Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart ran against the wall for the second time after his right front tyres were placed in round 172 and his evening ended.
Stewart drove his damaged car into the garage and left it without talking to journalists.
His team chief Chad Johnston said that his 14-member team was disappointed, but now concentrate on the race next weekend in Richmond, Virginia.
"I wish we had a better commitment and a better result for him," he said.
We're going to Richmond and we hope we can do better there.
Stewart used to ride to a wall when he was racing on Sunday evening after a collision with Kyle Busch and had to have the right side of his car repaired.
"I went in with quite good hopes for a good result today," said Johnston, adding: "It just didn't work."
Not long after the second accident, Stewart's car was loaded into the tug and the team had packed and was ready for departure.
Stewart dropped three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car met and killed another driver in an ash race in northern New York State.
He decided to return this week and win either in Atlanta or on the next race in Richmond to win a place in the persecution.
He returned to his workplace during an investigation into the tragic incident that led to the death of 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who had stepped on the road during a race to confront Stewart.
On Friday, the authorities informed us that studies on the cause of the accident will continue for at least two weeks.
There has been no decision on the need to expect Stewart to face a charge.
The three-time champion was received with great acclaim when he was introduced before the race.
After a start at 12th position, Stewart had just entered the first 10 and was temporarily in fourth place.
After a restart in round 122, got bushs
Wagen with No. 18 out of control after the exit from curve 2 and collided with Stewart, both of which drove against the wall.
Stewart moved on, but fell back to place 21.
TanzfÃ¼udiger Jugend gesucht
Just try out: Laura, Lena, Lisa, Marie, Bettina, Emma and Head Lisa Neissel (from the left) are looking forward to their competitors.
Like many other clubs, jazz groups in the TV Jahn also create all day lessons at the secondary schools.
After the summer holidays, some groups have decimated strongly.
Now, increasingly young people are being sought for a sport that is healthy and has great fun.
In the two jazz and modern dance groups of Lisa Neuzel, once dancer in the jazz and modern dance formation "Spirits", only nine children are still present.
"Three in the group of eight- to twelve-year-olds, six in the group of twelve- to 15-year-olds," says the 20-year-olds.
With more assets, the whole thing would be much more fun, "you could dance quite different choreographies," she says.
Anyone who likes to dance can take between 17 and 18 o'clock on Thursdays or Fridays between 17 and 6.30 o'clock in the dance sports room at the former Hotel Meyer, FreistraÃŸe 9, without obligation into the training hours.
"The training starts regularly with a warm-up program," says the trainer.
After that, various choreographies are practiced.
JazzDance has the feature that there is no fixed shape and is therefore open to many styles.
Elements from folklore through classicalism to sport and acrobatics are processed in jazz dance.
Of course, social gathering is not too short.
"We're also going to eat, watch dance films, and we've been staying in the dance room before," Lisa Nieuwzel reports.
In the group you can make friendships, share a beautiful hobby and do a lot for your own motor development.
Whoever jazz dance is not like this, he can also kick into one of the other offers of the TV Jahn.
Children and young people can always get into the lessons in the areas of children's dance/jazz dance, Bambini ballet, video clip dancing and hip hop.
The dance trainer is Francisco Afonso.
Adult couples are welcome to the dance evenings on Monday and Wednesday.
Whoever has a desire for discovox, slow rolling, Wiener Walzer, Rumba, Cha-Cha-Cha and Tango is allowed to pass by and participate.
Bulgarian Prison Officers Protest Nationwide
Hundreds of prison workers from all over Bulgaria organized a national protest before the Ministry of Justice in Sofia capital.
In the peaceful demonstration, they repeated their demands for restoring their old working conditions, which were recently changed.
Higher salaries are also on a demand list to be discussed with the Interim Justice Minister Hristo Ivanov.
The officials have been protesting the new working hours for a month and calling for a return to the previous 24-hour shifts.
Despite the meeting between the trade union of prison workers and representatives of the Ministry of Justice, no agreement was reached, the National Bulgarian Ratio (BNR) reported.
Negotiations continue, the Director-General for Criminal Measures, Rosen Zhelyazkov, announced to BNR.
The protest of prison workers is expected to be supported by members of the union Association of the employees of the Ministry of Interior.
Ukrainian army has abandoned airport of Luhansk
In the Otpelraine, the pro-Russian fighters continue on the march.
After serious fightings, which reportedly included Russian tanker battalions, the Ukrainian army today, Monday, abandoned the airport of the rebel high castle Luhansk.
At the same time, the army announced that seven soldiers had been killed in the past 24 hours.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroschenko had previously drawn personal consequences from the severe defeats of his army in the fight against the separatists and announced changes in the top army without mentioning details.
Prorussian separatists shoot off aircraft
In the fight against Ukrainian government troops, pro-Russian separatists have again shot off a fighter plane and two military helicopters, according to their own description.
Some 100 soldiers had also been injured or killed in fighting in Donetsk region, according to the insurgents on Monday, reported Russian agencies.
Coast Guard vessels sunk
The insurgents also claimed that for the first time in the Asovian Sea, they had sunk two boats from the Ukrainian Coast Guard.
Ukrainian border guards confirmed that two of his ships had been shot on Sunday near the port of Mariupol.
There were seven border guards injured, said a spokesperson in Kiev to broadcast 112.ua.
Two crew members were considered missing.
Local media made Russia responsible for the incident.
The separatists also reported that they had controlled several localities in Donetsk.
Diplomatic offensive in Minsk
The Ukraine Contact Group is meeting today in the Belarusian capital Minsk.
In addition to representatives from Ukraine, Russia and the OSCE, a messenger of the separatists from the Ostpelraine should also participate.
In advance, all stakeholders used their appearances to publicise their demand.
NATO does not want to break agreements with Russia
NATO will not break its agreement with Russia due to the planned stations in Eastern Europe as a result of the Ukraine crisis.
NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said on Monday in Brussels that NATO adhered to the 1997 NATO-Russia Council's founding agreement.
However, the NATO chief accused Russia of "a sharp break" of the agreement.
"Today we have to face reality that Russia does not regard NATO as a partner," says Rasmussen.
From documents and statements from the Russian side, "that they consider us to be opponents".
Stronger NATO presence
Rasmussen has also announced that he wants to strengthen NATO's presence in Eastern Europe.
A "Readiness Action Plan" to be decided at the NATO summit in Wales will ensure that "we will have more visible NATO presence in the east as long as this is necessary," said Rasmussen on Monday in Brussels.
Kiev and Moscow agree on new gas talks
Russia and Ukraine have, according to official statements, agreed on new talks to resolve their gas dispute.
The negotiations were scheduled for next Saturday, said Russian Minister for Energy Alexander Nowak on Monday.
A decision by the European Union is still expected to be sent to a representative on the talks.
Ukraine has not been given any more fuel from Russia for weeks because of the conflict over the gas price.
Last, EU Commissioner for Energy GÃ¼nther Oettinger had mediated between the two sides.
Ukraine had warned that Russia could also interrupt gas supply for Europe.
Europe draws about a third of its natural gas from Russian sources, a large part of which flows through Ukraine.
Merkel speaks power word: Tout will come "fully clear"
Now the chancellor confesses clearly.
A free letter for all complicated details, however, it is not.
The CSU had a persistent concern from the CDU against the car moot.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel, after persistent resistance from her CDU, spoke a word of power for the introduction of a passenger car moat.
"To say it quite clearly: she's in the coalition agreement, and she'll come," said the party leader on Monday after the meetings of the CDU summits in Berlin.
But Merkel did not rely on a detailed model for the time being.
In the black and red government programme, "certain parameters" are called.
Federal Minister for Transport Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) made a proposal, and it is now being worked on.
The NRW-CDU, however, insists on its no toll on all roads.
Merkel also stressed that Minister of Finance Wolfgang SchÃ¤uble (CDU) was involved in the consultations for a draft law.
In addition to the topic, Dobrindt also talked about further ways to activate more private capital for infrastructure investments, such as broadband expansion.
"There's nothing special about it." SchÃ¤uble had left a "play" report uncomplicated on Sunday, his house was testing his own concept to pay for highway investors with tolls - after the 2017 election.
CSU-Chef Horst Seehofer then warned against developing the executive minister in the cabinet toll concepts.
CDU-Bundesvize Armin Laschet reaffirmed his objections.
"The coalition agreement never assumed that all district and federal roads were to be mutated," said the North Rhine-Westphalian CDU country president.
In this respect, it is an important signal that Seehofer has now announced to speak again on the subject.
Resistance against the plans also comes from the CDU country associations Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg and Rheinland-Pfalz.
Background concerns that tolls affect small border traffic with neighbouring countries.
Seehofer had demanded coalition fidelity due to the toll critique of the CDU.
The Left considers the plans to fail in the face of the dispute in the Union.
"The Murks-Maut is dead", said party chief Bernd Riexinger of the "Neuen OsnabrÃ¼cker Zeitung" (Monday).
"The minister fails with the toll." Dobrindt wants to introduce a duty of vignette on all German roads, which will start in 2016.
Domestic car owners may not, however, be additional taxed according to coalition agreement.
Therefore, they should be fully compensated for toll by means of the car tax.
However, the model must not discriminate against foreign drivers in accordance with EU law because of their nationality.
Genetic disorder often misdiagnosed
A Briton says she thought as a result of a misdiagnose over many years that she would die.
Karin Rodgers lived almost her entire youth in the belief that she had only a few years to live after she was diagnosed with another disease.
It actually suffered from the Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) - a group of inherited disorders that damage the nerves outside the brain and the spinal cord.
Charity CMT UK reported that misdiagnoses are a common problem in people with CMT because so little is known about this disease.
About 23,000 people in Great Britain are likely to suffer from CMT, which can lead to motor disorders such as muscle weakness, an unsafe course and curved toes.
Illness or pain also suffers. The disease is incurable and progressive, which means that symptoms get worse over time.
When Rodgers was 13, she believed that she was suffering from Friedreich-Ataxia (FA) - a disease with very bad chances of survival.
Rodgers thought she was sitting in the wheelchair before she would be 18 and dying before her 30th birthday.
The mother of two children, who is 51 years old today, said, "As a child, I knew I couldn't do the same as the others.
I fell down all the time and everything lasted longer.
I could never ride with the other kids roller shoe or skateboard and was often held at school because of my way of going and walking.
Rodgers said that at the age of 13 she saw her medical records after several operations to relieve her achillesses and stretch her feet when her doctor left the room and read that she suffered from FA.
"I felt guilty because I was curious, so I didn't tell anyone, but I went home looking for the disease in the library and wrote to the FA society," she said.
When I received an answer, I was shocked and terrifiedly panicked.
I thought I was going to be in the wheelchair at 18 and die at 25, and in between would slowly lose all my skills.
I did all this alone with me and planned my own funeral.
She said when she became 17 she realized that her skills had not decreased as much as she had imagined and asked her doctor.
He just got up and hugged me and said, "My love, I don't think you have it, otherwise you'd be in the wheelchair already."
I think you've got a little less life-threatening.
After some genetic tests, it was found at her CMT.
"When he told me what CMT was, I felt like I was a winner," she said.
Charity CMT UK has launched a CMT Awareness Month to draw attention to this disease.
Stabsfeldwebel a. D. Berni Diether has been working as a fireworks station since the closure of the former military practice place.
For almost ten years now, the former military training centre in Munich has stopped being shot.
Nevertheless, every month the ammunition of the biosphere appears in the heart of the Swabian Alb region.
The grenades are sometimes so dangerous that they have to be sprayed on the spot.
A deafening bang sounds in the explosions over the heart of the biosphere region.
In December 2004 the last sharp shot fell at the military training centre in Munich, which was closed at the end of 2005 after 110 years of military operations.
Since then, the 6500-hectare area is the core of the SchwÃ¤bische Alb biosphere, which is open to hikers and cyclists on 13 designated paths.
Taxation of businessmen in Washington increases with economic recovery
A recovery of the economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
Government and local tax decisions for companies in the country rose slightly last year, while economic recovery accelerated, so a newly published study last week, and companies in Washington were no exception.
Companies in District, Maryland and Virginia jointly paid $27.6 billion in government and local offices in the 2013 financial year, an increase of 3.8 percent compared to the 2012 revenue of $26.6 billion.
The corporate government and local tax burden rose by 4.3 percent last year to $671 billion, compared to 3.9 percent a year earlier, and it was the third growth year following the decline in 2009 and 2010.
State taxes increased more than local taxes, by 4.3 percent, according to the study conducted by the Ernst & Young Service Agency with the Center for State Taxation, a tax policy group.
More than half of the district's tax revenue, 56 percent, comes from corporate taxes, while 36 percent of Maryland's revenue comes from companies.
Virginia achieves the lowest tax revenue from companies by 28 percent.
Much of the increase in tax revenue is due to a recovery of the real estate values of companies, the researchers say, which led to an increase in real estate taxes by 3.7 percent this year after the three consecutive years with growth rates of less than 1 percent.
While a large part of these profits came from major states such as California, New York, and Texas, the process also seems to be for Washington.
Companies in the District, Maryland and Virginia jointly paid more than $10 billion in government and local property taxes last year, compared to $9.6 billion in 2012 - an increase over the course of a year by 4.2 percent.
But the apparent recovery in real estate values in Maryland is not so effective in increasing government and local tax revenues, as the real estate taxes here amount to just over one-fifth of corporate tax decisions.
Companies in Virginia and D.C. pay almost half of their government and local taxes in the form of real estate taxes.
"In Maryland the following is happening: a large part of the real estate, especially in the tax area around D.C., is owned either by the government or by non-profit organisations that do not pay real estate taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, Managing Director of the Center on State Taxation.
For example, Maryland is forced to rely much more on income taxes in order to be able to offer the same services that other countries offer.
The recent recovery in corporate tax revenue cannot be attributed solely to the recovery of the real estate market
Business revenues also seem to recover, according to the data.
Companies in the region reported income taxes on government organizations of $2.3 billion compared to 2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland took $1 billion into corporate income taxes, the highest amount of the region.
While the trend goes in the same direction, local tax burden on businesses does not rise evenly in all three locations.
The increase in the district was 4.3 percent in the national average, while the increase in Maryland was much higher, 4.9 percent.
Only Virginia reported an under-average tax revenue of 4.1 percent.
Virginia has the significantly lowest corporate income taxes in all three sectors (all three have fixed corporate tax rates).
The corporate tax rate in Maryland is 8.25 percent and in the district is relatively high 9.975 percent.
A similar study by the US Chamber of Commerce at the beginning of this year showed that less government and local corporate taxes are required in Virginia and that overall there is a better tax environment than Maryland.
The district was not studied in the study.
Despite the benefits, Virginia is under pressure from its southern neighbours.
North Carolina has passed laws to reduce its corporate tax rates this year from 6.9 percent to 6 percent, the same rate as Virginia, and the rate will fall to 5 percent next year.
If the State continues to achieve its income targets in the coming year, this law could reduce the state's corporate income tax rate by 3 percent by 2017.
In the meantime, small businesses in Washington seem to be better off, so they pay more government and local taxes, according to the recent study.
Business taxes paid as personal income taxes by small businessmen - a transitional structure that has organized most small businesses - in the district, Maryland and Virginia last year rose by 20 percent to $2.4 billion, a significant faster growth rate than overall corporate taxes.
The researchers say that the trend and increase in corporate taxes throughout the country is likely to continue this year, with an increase in general state and local government surplus tax revenue of 6.2 percent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period of the previous year.
Nevertheless, the Washington area could be lagging behind if the expenditure cuts of the Federal Government had an impact on the labour market in the region.
Partner city: German beer for Guangzhou
Hops and malt - also in China a popular combination.
German beer enjoys an excellent reputation in China.
Frankfurt's partner city in China now wishes to have a brewery and also hopes for a direct flight link between the two cities.
German beer, brewed in Frankfurt's partner city Guangzhou - that is the urgent wish of the official in China.
"We would be very pleased if a German brewery were to settle in our city," said the vice secretary of the South Chinese metropolis, Li Yiwei, this week while visiting a SPD delegation in his city.
In the course of the discussion, the Chinese ruling Communist Party's functionist repeatedly returned to this concern of the Twelve Million Metropole.
Guangzhou, also known as Canton in Germany, was one of the richest cities in China, and Li.
Therefore, people also had the purchasing power to be able to afford German beer.
Hessian SPD chairman Thorsten SchÃ¤fer-GÃ¼mbel, who led the German delegation, told the host that he would listen to a potential partner for the project in Germany.
"For beer, it doesn't need much: good water, grain and joy of life," he added at lunch with the party superior in Guangzhou.
This joy of life already exudes Mr. Li, he flattered the host.
As a result, the functionary from Guangzhou arrived with SchÃ¤fer-GÃ¼mbel - but with red wine, which was served at the food.
The Chinese brand Tsingtao dates back to German brewery.
Tsingtao-Bier is brewed after the German purity bid.
More business
A second wish of the Chinese hosts would be a direct flight link between Frankfurt and Guangzhou, said Vice-President Li.
The Lufthansa had previously offered the flight but in 2012 deleted for economic reasons.
"It would be worth it again," the local politician showed himself convinced.
Business between our two cities is growing.
At present, travelers would have to take the detour via Changsha in Hunan Province, lamented Li.
Also, the administration of the Guangzhou Province, the capital of which is Guangzhou, is hoping for the flight route.
The Vice Governor of the Province, Chen Yunxian, highlighted this wish in his conversation with the Socialists.
"This is a very good idea," SchÃ¤fer-GÃ¼mbel - Chinese vice minister Li Jinjun, an intimate expert in Germany, nodded in agreement.
Established Partnership
The lousy vice-chairman of Guangzhou hopes that he will be able to visit Frankfurt for a partnership meeting next year.
Li Yiwei was already at the Main but not yet in this function.
He came to office only this year after his predecessor had been transferred from the office because of corruption accusations.
The local party leader Wan Qinglian also had to go.
The attack against the functionaries from Guangzhou is part of a national campaign against corruption in the party and administration, which is enforced with hardness by Chief Xi Jinping.
The new leading politician Li Yiwei had worked in front of his party career for an American company, which is most unusual in the Chinese Communist Party.
Before joining Guangzhou, he was a senior functioner in Fujian, where the car builder VW built a large plant.
Frankfurt has officially received more than a dozen city partnerships.
The link to Guangzhou, 9000 kilometers away, is one of those that are maintained by both sides, for example with a student exchange.
Last year, the 25-year anniversary of the German-Chinese link was celebrated.
With its economic strength, the southern Chinese metropolis on the Perl River is almost as strong as all of Hesse.
Next year, they want to reach a gross domestic product of 250 billion euros, reported Li.
Family of Joan Rivers "press the thumbs"
Joan Rivers has been unconscious since her entry into a hospital in New York City three days ago, but her daughter has shown her hope that the 81-year-old comedian will recover from her illness.
"Thanks for your continued love and support," Melissa Rivers said today in a message.
We'll all push the thumbs.
According to her mother's sources, she was sent to Mount Sinai Hospital after an emergency in a hospital at Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopy, on Thursday.
The doctors keep them deliberately sedated and under close observation until they are more satisfied with their condition, which is still described as "serious".
The reactions came from many pages, even in the form of overwhelming online support from Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Environmentally friendly vacuum cleaners and rising wages
In future, more stringent environmental standards will apply to cars and vacuum cleaners that come into the market from today.
Similar to refrigerators and washing machines, new vacuum cleaners will receive a label from September 1st, on which the buyer can see at a glance central data such as the energy efficiency of the device.
In the "Euro 6" pollutant class, higher nitrogen oxide values apply to new cars.
In addition, there is more money for the scaffolders: they receive a nationally uniform minimum wage of 10.25 euros.
Amazon buys Twitch for $1.04 billion
AMAZON just confirmed what information had reported on Monday morning: The online retailer - and video producer, and a variety of other things - buys the video streaming service Twitch for $1.04 billion (970 million US$).
The announcement comes surprisingly, not because no one had expected a takeover of Twitch, but because it was widely suspected that YouTube would acquire the company.
Three months ago, it seemed as if the sale of Twitch to Google's video service was for a cool billion decided thing, and the collaboration also appeared naturally.
Twitch, founded only three years ago as Justin.tv, was launched as a general streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who wanted to publish their bravur pieces in games, a "youTube for live games", such as an insider.
The Tswitch interface.
And "let's play", a video genre in which Betterwisser gives the (mostly older) games a mark of secret science theatre, are already very popular on YouTube.
It is just so that YouTube is often called if you want to describe Twitch, so the news that YouTube Twitch wanted to buy was taken up a bit boring, a textbook example of a established technology company that buys up a potential competitor.
It's a mystery why the deal didn't work with YouTube, as the company reports that the company was ready to pay as much as Amazon.
All we know at the moment is this statement by Emmet Shear, President of Twitch: "We have decided Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term visions, and they want to help us get there faster."
Another secret is, honestly, the incredible success of Twitch.
For Snobs like me, who explain that they prefer to drive sports rather than to watch it, it is difficult to understand the attraction that assumes seeing others while playing instead of taking control of themselves.
It's one thing to look over your shoulder to a friend at 3 a.m. while she's sliding by Resident Evil, and something quite different to watching a spider shoot in the head 20 times in a row in Call of Duty.
You could just watch all these games right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games are now ego games, so watching without control over the eye perspective can be a really good recipe for headaches.
I admit that the speed currents in which Roger Bannisters of our time in electronics play the whole game in record time are entertaining.
But as long as not a game or humorvirtuosis is involved, its twitch channel is probably not so interesting.
But what do skeptics know about it like me?
Tswitch is called by 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of Internet traffic peaks.
And how exactly does Amazon want to make money out of it?
It is hard to imagine that Tswitch is integrated as elegantly into Amazon Instant Video, as YouTube Twitch could have just swallowed.
But Twitch has something that every company would like to have: thousands of young men who are being recruited as advertising customers.
As the chairman of Twitch, Shear, said Amazon and Twitch "believe in the future of gaming," and the medium shows no signs of shrinking, not even - swallow - as spectator sports.
On Sundays there was a lot going on at the HÃ¼pfburg at the Burggartenfest.
The concept of organizers was correct.
Despite the strong rainfall on Saturday evening, an estimated 1200 fans of music came to the open air festival in Burggarten.
For some time, the intake had to be stopped.
"That was annoyed," said Ron Sem, one of the organizers.
Salzwedel l Light and fun.
Maxim Sachraj and Ron Sem formed the name Amula from two Spanish words.
Because the open air in the Salzvedeler Burggarten is supposed to radiate brightness in the day and evening through various shows.
Well, the fun comes by itself anyway.
This was already shown on the early Sunday when the first visitors went to the open air.
The organizers had promised a feast for all generations.
And they did so.
Around the supply stations on the Burggartenwiese saltwedlers, but also guests from the closer and further surroundings had made themselves comfortable.
They followed the first live performances, wagged with the foot in the tact, enjoyed cool drinks - in short: relaxation pure and enjoyment were announced.
And that's across generations.
While the white sand on top of the ceiling at the beach bar was soaked, others were labed on a quarter of wine in the Vinothek, the young people killed on the HÃ¼pfburg, which was a great attraction for the smaller guests.
But even when child-skinning, the volunteers had to do their hands in the truest sense of the word to become lords and to enchant imaginative creations in the little faces.
The larger ones used the kicker tables or participated in a skateboard workshop, which the Goodfoot-Crew made from saltweed.
Until the big rains came.
Shortly before 5.30 p.m., he sat down on the visitors, especially families looking for the wide and dry.
But the attraction of the feast did not stop.
"There were more people than expected," said Ron Sem, who spoke of a "success on the whole line".
That is why there is nothing against a repetition of the big party in the coming year.
Although work on the content and size of the event still needs to be done, Sem made clear in a first balance sheet on Sunday against the popular voice.
He was annoyed that, in the meantime, the intake had to be stopped.
Obviously, the security firm had been booked with too little power.
The result: Some who had already paid no longer came to the site.
The resonance had been very good.
In a first careful estimate, the Salzvedeler spoke with organizers of about 1200 visitors who were walking in the Burggarten.
There were problems with sound technology.
The Salzwedeler Hip-Hop-Band Blocks`n`Rox broke down its appearance therefore.
The technicians were unable to create half a reasonable sound.
The planned Shisha lounges could not be built, because the tents could not be brought to the salzwedel because of a tire pan.
"But the next year they will be there," says the organizer.
The premiere of the Amula-Open-Air was more than successful by the number of visitors.
And this in bad weather.
However, the organizers have committed some errors that will be abandoned at the first time, but will have to be eliminated by the second edition.
In the social network Facebook, the organizers must also include criticism.
"Sorry, but for twelve euros you have just expected more," says Melanie Meier on the event page.
"You've taken over a little bit," says Ele Zimmermann in the same position.
Others don't see the initial problems so tight.
I think it's very good that some not only talk stupidly, but also really try to put something on their legs.
Hat off!", Stephanie JenÃŸ writes to the amula.
Now the organizers remain a year to dispel these criticisms.
New Radom in Berkum: Wartberg's landmark shrinks
He is not expected to do so.
Rather, the ready-to-eat component is waiting to be used in the distinctive building.
The action is in the context of a larger measure: almost 50 years after the construction of the TIRA space observation radar, the cover, the so-called radom, is completely renewed.
The new Radom with a diameter of 47,5 meters will be slightly smaller than the old one.
The size still remains world record.
The last step in completing the new shell is to exchange caps
The upper quarter of the old shell is separated and removed with a crane.
After that, the last quarter of the new shell is placed.
If the weather plays, the action will go over the stage at the beginning of this week.
Participant at the Ice Bucket Challenge Disperses Kiefer
Isabelle Roberts from Great Britain shouted so much when her icy cold water was poured over her head that she injured the bone structure of her face.
This ice-bucket challenge went painfully beyond.
A woman was sent to the hospital after she had screamed at the Ice Bucket Challenge so much that she spread the jaw.
Isabelle Roberts from Great Britain circled so much when her icy cold water was poured over her head that she violated her facial structure.
"The water was so cold that I cried, and while I was doing the deed, my jaw was just standing," she said to The Mirror.
Ice water is poured over the 20-year-olds.
Isabelle Roberts just seconds before the accident
I wanted to close my mouth, but that wasn't going to happen, the jaw was crushed, and then I understood that something was wrong.
My mother and sister saw this too and almost laughed at me, but I had to go to the emergency room.
The 20-year-old from Great Britain was sent to the hospital to re-enter the jaw after participation in the viral trend on Tuesday.
The clip has been linked to an Internet sensation and a thousand times on Facebook and Twitter.
Will the Burgvereine soon pull back at a string?
Last but not least, the two Wolfratshauser Burgvereinen were in the middle of the race.
Now the Boards are thinking about a possible cooperation.
As a model for the reconstruction of the Wolfratshauser Burg, the late Richard Dimbath, former chairman of the Wolfratshauser Burgfreunde, led the project in the French guÃ©delon.
A year ago, there was no good climate between the Burgverein and the Burgfreund Wolfratshausen.
The views so far seemed to differ, as the history of Wolfratshauser Burg and a possible reconstruction are supposed to be dealt with.
The two camps are now moving together: discussions are to be held soon on a joint approach.
Torsten SjÃ¶berg (Burgverein) and Herbert Piffl (Burgfreunde) confirm this on request of our newspaper.
"I called Mr Piffl and suggested that we could put ourselves together once," SjÃ¶berg reports.
In his view, all the members of the two associations could again take a stand.
This means that there are faster visible successes.
While the castle friends around the suddenly deceased Richard Dimbath until last had a reconstruction of the castle on the mountain forest in the eye, for the Burgverein um SjÃ¶berg the "Development and Experience" of the site stands first.
Herbert Piffl, second chairman of the Burgfreunde, made his own statement about the call very much.
Since Dimbath's death, he's been in front of the Burgfreunds.
A new president will be found at a meeting of members in mid-September.
Currently, according to the 74-year-old, the association counts about 40 members.
"After my friend's death, Richard Dimbath, we initially let the club's activities rest out of respect."This "thinking phase" was necessary to "think how it could continue".
According to Piffl, the new chairman should then go into the conversation with the Burgverein.
Until then, the Burgfreunde could also make a current mood inside their group.
A candidate for the Presidency is not yet available, says Piffl.
"But I'm confident that someone will find himself." He doesn't want to run for himself because he has his residence in Bad TÃ¶lz.
The new chairman should be a Wolfratshauser.
The TÃ¶lzer wants to work on the project "but very much likes to work on".
The differing views on reconstruction will probably remain in the eyes of Piffls in the near future.
He honors Dimbath as a "Missionary" who always believed in the reconstruction of the castle.
Two similar, well advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not an airlock.
Due to a high participation of the population and voluntary helpers from all over the world, they are a tourist magnet.
Piffl: "Even I was skeptical at the beginning.
But in the course of time I became more and more convinced that it would be useful to move forward the project". A "one-stop feature" for the FlÃ¼ÃŸerstadt could be created.
There's nothing else here.
In addition, the project would be financed by EU grants, visitor tickets and potential sponsors, Piffl believes.
"I personally don't want to throw the idea of reconstruction overboard," he hopes the Burgverein might be moving a bit at this point.
The goal of first documenting the story is "is important and good".
After that, you could keep looking.
Smart ways to save on university textbooks
Since the cost of university textbooks for many students is more than $1,000 a year, the fast-second semester student Matt Schroeder considered a clever savings idea.
He invented a loan system for books by students of higher semesters and offered a nominal compensation to delay the resale.
"My math book usually costs $180, but I got it for $10 for a semester and a Chick-fil-A-Keks," said Schroeder, 19, who attends the Covenant College in Georgia.
The books needed for the last semester would have cost him $430, he said.
He spent $120.
The college management informed students that on average they spend more than $1,200 a year on textbooks and study material, but that there were various cost reduction options for the students.
Online shops and creative approaches such as the Schroeders are increasingly the solution of the choice for the students.
Renting textbooks becomes more popular, so students can use a book for a semester, often at a much cheaper price than when buying.
Neebo Inc., which runs more than 250 university books, announced that since 2011, renting text books has doubled.
Surveys in the industry show that about a quarter of the books in the college bookstores were rented last spring semester, said Neebos Vice President Tevor Meyer.
Less than half of all textbooks are purchased in campus books according to the National Association of College Stores Trade Association.
Here's the one time for the best deals.
Buy Online
Some new books cost online only a third of the price for which they are available at the campus bookstore.
The ninth edition of "Calculus" vno Ron Larwon, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs almost $290, but can be obtained from the specialized textbook retailer Chegg.com for $239.99.
Buy used
If you don't mind the notes of other or normal traces of use, used books are a good option.
"Calculus" is used on Chegg.com to have $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, graduate student at Brigham Young University, says he spent 42 cents on Amazon.com for a useful edition of "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business."
The book was sold for $48.
Academics such as Ingrid Bracey, head of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls advised students to ask their professors if previous expenses were allowed.
Sometimes the updates to the seminar work are not relevant.
In such cases, older expenditure can often be purchased for a fraction of the cost of the latest issue.
Apart from Chegg and Amazon, half.com by eBay Inc is also a popular alternative for used books.
Renting
Renting textbooks is worth considering if you treat them quite well, remembering to give them back and you don't want to keep the books after the course is completed.
You can save more than 80 percent of the cost of a newly purchased book.
For example, a student could rent "Calculus" for the duration of a semester for about $20.
Learn about the terms of the business at which you rent, also about the penalty fees, which may apply to the writing of notes, symbols or signs of use.
tenants are careful: If you do not return the book, the penalty fees may even exceed the price of a new book.
E-Books
E-books instead of traditional textbooks are also an option.
Sometimes these books are de facto rented by providing an electronic license for a given period of wholesalers such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
At Chegg you can rent "Calculus" for 6 months for about $61.
Bracey says that students in literature courses often find the best offers, as many classics can now be downloaded free of charge, while scientific and engineering textbooks can be very expensive.
I'm sure you're looking around.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon be attending the Pepperdine Law School, recommends the ISBN number for price determination in books, as you can be so sure to find the right textbook.
And before an online order you should check, so Gault, whether the book is actually in stock.
He learned this lesson on the hard tour.
He bought a book that had four weeks of delivery and eventually paid the full price in the college bookstore.
Why "Guardians of the Galaxy" didn't become a cash hit
"The Expendables 3" of Sylvester Stallone played less than 30 million dollars of its 90 million dollars budget in the United States, while "Sin City: A Dame to Kill For" recorded only 12 million dollars of its budget of 70 million dollars.
The film "Sex Tape" tailored to Cameron Diaz recorded only $14.6 million at the opening weekend, while children's films, such as "threshings made easy 2", also disappointed with revenue.
An article by the Telegraph film critic Robbie Collins indicates that the lack of quality in the films could be the reason for the children's films themselves.
In 2014, Collins described "the worst year" as "the worst of all" for children's films and described "DrachenzÃ¤mmen leicht macht gegen 2" as purely "functional" fantasy continuation.
With films for a slightly older target group, however, it seems as if the quality of the films is not necessarily the problem.
In July Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore and Metacritical evaluation for every summer film launch, which was shown between the American Memorial Day and July 20, 2013 and the current year to at least 2,000 canvass.
The results are based on the opinion of the cinema visitors and film critics and point out that this year's film hits are equivalent to those of last year.
Some commentators believe that the development is due to changing visual habits and the growing popularity of web streaming services such as Netflix.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney's soon-to-be jungle book film, said to Hollywood Reporter's website: "I think times are changing."
We must accept this and not try to follow the past.
In contrast to the currently weak cash results of Hollywood productions, Netflix recently generated sales of the streaming content of $1.2 billion, almost twice as much as last year's sales of $837 million.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the film studios for focusing too much on filming comics and prophesied a "core melt" of Hollywood.
In the light of the current downturn, some commentators argue that his gloomy prophecy could well contain a true core.
However, due to the potential cash hits expected in summer 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic World, other film industry representatives are more optimistic:
The producer of X-Men, Simon Kinberg, described the decline in cash results recently as simply "cyclical" and said to Hollywood reporter: "The next summer the biggest summer at the cinema casino will ever be, and no one will worry about the business at all."
A few years ago, when the 2nd table tennis category was removed to streamline the ligen division, it was a step in the right direction.
Now the German Table Tennis League has taken an additional 3rd Bundesliga into the program.
The result: Whoever did not ascend has gone down.
While GÃ¶ttingen's highest-class team Torpedo avoided the descent in the Oberliga-relegation, in the coming season only five-class.
In spite of their magnificent passage into the regional league, Torpedo's ladies remain fourth-class.
The boys and girls of Torpedo start in the Lower Saxony league, as well as the boys of SC Weende.
The SG Lenglers and the Torpedo Reserves arrive in the new association league, in the Landesliga there are no more GÃ¶ttingen clubs.
The TTV Geismar plays in the League League, the Torpedo level in the Landesliga.
What looks like a better district class is now the new district superliga south.
TSV Seulingen, VfB Soldingsen, Torpedo III, Geismar, Einbeck, Hamenstedt, Upper SV, Langenholtsensen, FC Weser and TTC arrive here.
In the district league as regional representative Dransfeld and SC Weende play in the district class of the TTC II, Red-White, Upper SV II and the teams of the TTV Geismar II and III. Ladies' district leagues start at least in SolmÃ¤rke.
GÃ¼ntersen, TTC and TTV Geismar II are here with us from the game.
Torpedo III and Sattenhausen/WÃ¶llmarshausen start up in the district league.
Each with nine teams
The SC Weende sends his girls to the small district league.
Also the district league season of the SCW boys - there still starts Torpedo II - is not complete.
In a district class, Geismar, Tuspo Weende and the upper SV go into the season.
In the first season of the newly founded regional association, the two GÃ¶ttingen Kreisligen start with nine teams each.
In the western season are Red White II, Upper SV III, Laubach II, Torpedo IV and V, MTV Grone, Dransfelder SC II, Mielenhausen and SG Lengler II.
In the Ost-Staffel, Sattenhausen/WÃ¶llmarshausen, Nikolausberg and Landolfshausen play among others.
The ladies' club league consists of Sattenhausen/WÃ¶llmarshausen II, Bilshausen, Hemeln, Seulingen II, Tuspo Weende and the SG Rhume.
This is still better than in the district of Osterode, where there are no more ladies teams at all at the circular level.
It is striking that none of the six two classes of travel achieve goal strength, here the innovative and impenetrable circuit board will have to think before.
Nato Summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
On the weekend there were protests by opponents of the Nato summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in the center of Newport for an anti-nato march.
On Sunday, about 150 people gathered in Cardiff in front of the town hall there to hold a countertop.
Stephen Faircough has followed the developments on the weekend and talked to demonstrators who have traveled from Bridgend to Belgium.
Teenage flew out of the Blue Mountains
TWO young bush wanderers were put in safety with the rope winds after they were caught the night over in the Blue Mountains in NSW.
THE 16-year-old girl and the 19-year-old man broke out on their tour in Govett's Leap in Blackheath shortly after Sunday afternoon.
Concerned relatives called the police at about 8 p.m. when they had not returned home.
A search force from local police and rescue services broke out and the couple was found at around 23 o'clock near Bridal Veil waterfalls.
The girl had been hurt at the knee and the man had fallen and had his head knocked up.
Rescue forces stayed with the couple overnight, and they were flown out on Monday morning.
They were supplied in stable condition with an ambulance to the Blue Mountains Hospital.
Escalate anti-governmental protests in Pakistan
The around 1000 demonstrators were forced by soldiers from the PTV building, said Minister of Information Pervaiz Rashid.
After half an hour, the transmitter had re-recorded the radiation.
PTV director Athar Farooq said that the demonstrators equipped with sticks had damaged devices in the editorial.
Dead or injured were not reported.
The demonstrators demand the withdrawal of the head of government to whom they are accused of fraud.
The police told us, about a kilometer from the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, that on Monday about 3,000 demonstrators met with security forces again.
According to hospital records, a police officer was injured.
On the weekend, at least three people had been killed and more than 500 injured when demonstrators tried to advance to Sharif's residence.
They demand the resignation of the Prime Minister.
On Sunday evening, after a meeting in the army headquarters, the powerful military had called for a political solution to the conflict to be "without wasting time and using it without violence".
The communication also stated: "The army remains obliged to ensure the security of the state".
The escalating violence has raised concerns about military intervention, which has already been more frequent in the past.
The protests presented by the opposition politician Imran Khan and the preacher Tahirul Qadri have continued since the 14th of August.
Sharif refuses to withdraw.
Khan and Qadri had called their followers on Sunday to endure.
"We won't go back without having forced Sharif to withdraw," Khan said.
Qadri expressed himself similarly.
Khan accuses Sharif of having won the parliamentary election last May through fraud.
Qadri calls for the withdrawal of the central and provincial governments.
A transitional government will then reform the electoral system and call for new elections.
More than 40 000 security forces are used to protect the government district.
The demonstrators had at first waited peacefully in front of Parliament until Khan and Qadri called them to press for Sharif's residence on the weekend.

With the 2:0 above GrÃ¶dig, for Rapid a bitter week on Sunday has come an end of reconciliation.
"The victory is very liberating," said Trainer Zoran Barisic, whose team had reached an intermediate depth with the Aus in the Europa League on Thursday.
"The success experience was extremely important," confirmed Captain and goalkeeper Steffen Hofmann, who advanced with Green-White in third place.
Schrammel-Traumtor brings Rapid on Siegerstrasse Rapid has shown the right response to the disappointment against Helsinki with the second season victory and goes with a success experience into the national game break.
"We wanted to show a positive response," said foreign defenseman Thomas Schrammel, who, with his magnificent leadership Volley of the Sixteenth Count in the 14th minute, made the way for victory.
"I thought I'd cut all the frustration from Thursday and sniff him under the latte," said the 26-year-old smiled.
When Schrammel met for the last time in a federal league on November 13, 2010, it was still for Ried.
The first championship hit in the Rapid-Dress will therefore remain in special memory to him.
"For me, this is something very special, I'm out of rapid growth," said Schrammel.
Due to Mario Pavelic's short-term blessurfaction on the left hand side of the basin, Schrammel moved to the right-hand defensive side and made his business very good there.
He has enough experience that he can also exercise this position mirrored.
He earned the gate, he already made some assistants this year," Barisic praised.
Team shows character Schrammel also delivered the flank to 2:0 by Hofmann after just one hour, which finally made the decision.
Because the guests could have written before that.
"Thank God we've had a little luck today," said Schrammel, who was playing on the breakup of performance and results in the past few weeks: "The results didn't vote, but the playman was always good compared to last year".
Barisic even found that one had been "better in many games before than today" - against "the strongest team that played in this season".
The first three-pointer since July 26 has therefore proved that the team structure is still intact: "Today my team has shown that it has character".
For him no less gratifying: "That we finally played too zero again".
A lot of work during the Landerspielpause Also the fact that Brian Behrendt, Mario Pavelic, Christopher Dibon, Deni Alar and Michael Schimpelsberger have several failures to complain about, and Srdjan Grahovac, Stefan Stangl and Philipp Schobesberger gave their start-up debuts, make the victory even more valuable.
"You must not forget this," Barisic, who over the past three days lost with Behrendt and Pavelic players, "who have been very stable lately."
Therefore, the Landerspielpause has to be used to "pick wounds and make a bit in the physical field," said Barisic, who has five U21 selection players in his ranks.
One to which the break is probably particularly located is Captain Hofmann.
He tears for the team, passes over pain.
Especially in this difficult phase he showed that he is a very important player for us," Barisic noted.
Hofmann gave the game Rapids not only the structure prior to his change in the 68th minute, but also achieved the second goal.
For the 33-year-old who finished his 350th Bundesliga game, it was the first hit out of the game since 2nd November 2013 (4:2 on the Admira).
Hofmann: "Don't think everything's good now" "We must have had a little luck too, but at some point happiness must come back to us.
Now it was high time," Hofmann said.
He said to concentrate further work: "You can't always see it black and white.
We haven't played in the last few weeks as bad as that has been shown.
But we must not believe that everything is good now.
He could not dispute the importance of his role for the team.
It's a very young team that I can help very much at the moment.
They stick to me at certain stages," Hofmann said.
GrÃ¶dig-Coach Michael Baur had little to blame for with his team.
He regretted the fast hit "from the Tormitor category", as well as the regular gate of use in the 40th minute, which had been recognized by referee colleague in error.
The only accusation I can make to the team is that we didn't go to the gate in some phases exactly enough.
We have had too little conclusion.
Interior defenseman Maximilian Karner saw it similarly: "It started badly, but then we found pure and even made a gate.
In general, there would have been more in it.
Under this dowel there is rest
A powerful tribe we showed last Friday in our mystery of the summer series "My piece of RÃ¶ner GlÃ¼ck".
Several of these tree giants are still in the district, the pictured specimen is the "streets" above UnterweiÃŸenbrunn.
A rocky footpath leads up to the oak that is about 600 years old.
It passes groups, basalt stone piles and basalt stone lakes.
A small piece below the quarries of the Bauersberg, a kilometer north of the road to Weisbach, it stands.
Vital looks like the natural monument, it rises beyond the other trees of the surrounding area and reminds an American mammoth tree with a size of over eight meters.
A small Buddha on a tree stump indicates that it is a spiritual or mystical place.
However, despite intensive research, there was only evidence of the origin of the name.
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider has also consulted the Bishops' Home Archive and asked older people from UnterweiÃŸenbrunn to find out what relationship it has with the Gesruhechen.
The result of his research remained the quite sober explanation for the name.
Thus, until about 80 years ago, the goats' herds should have driven their animals from underwhite fountains to the tiredly redded meadows free of stones.
At the foot of the tree, the animal keepers exhausted from the ascent should have rested.
In the meantime, the area has gained its importance, because in the meadows actually weed goats again.
The area has also been declared the core zone of the Biosphere Reserve, Schneider has found out further.
When entering the stone collections, however, one should be careful, because the basalt heated up by the sun is also a popular place for cross-eaters.
A hiking trail leads from UnterweiÃŸenbrunn to the tree, but it is a little hidden.
Further paths are signposted, the direction HochrhÃ¶n climbs and invites you to an extensive hike.
Where's the Wasserburg?
However, a Wasserburg, which is sought for our next task, is rather rare to find.
The reflection in the tomb already gives a good impression of the building, but we have some historical buildings in the county to which the building counterfei might fit.
Where is our "StÃ¼ck des RÃ¶ner GlÃ¼ck" located?
My piece of roÃ¶ner GlÃ¼ck

After weeks of tuition, Italy's Prime Minister and President of the EU, Matteo Renzi, imposed on strong conservative resistance at the EU Special Summit last week the nomination of its Foreign Minister Federica Mogherini as the head of EU foreign policy, she will become the successor of British Catherine Ashton.
Renzi considers, as the government-based daily La Repubblica reflects, the calling of his Mogherini as a favorite in the government team as strengthening the position of the Social Democrats and his own in the EU.
He also expects a drive for his "reform package" in Italy.
Last but not least, Renzi hopes that he will keep calming the left-wing base of the party, as Mogherini is â€“ albeit in a moderate manner â€“ assigned to it.
In contrast to conservative representatives with President Jean-Claude Juncker and the Polish President-in-Office Donald Tusk, the dominant view in Rome is that this is a political compensation.
Because the EU's chief diplomat will be appointed as Vice-President Juncker at the same time.
The remaining agreement of the EU Parliament is considered to be safe.
Otherwise, President Giorgio Napolitano would hardly have called the nomination of the 41-year-old politician of the ruling Democratic Party (PD) a "important recognition" of the role of Italy in the EU.
La Repubblica spreads optimism that the Mogherini, who has been proven in leading party offices for almost two decades, will show themselves to be "standard challenges" for their ambition.
The native Roman is married and has two daughters.
Her party career began in 1996 in the youth organization of the then Democratici di Sinistra (left democratics), which merged with the Catholic Center Party Margherita to form today's Social Democratic PD.
In 1999, Mogherini became Vice President of the European Community Organisation of Socialist Youth (European Young Socialists) for three years.
With the election of 2001 in the Left-Democrat Party Council, she entered high party politics, worked in the Foreign Policy Department, whose head she soon became.
She occupied traditional priorities of Italian foreign policy such as the Middle East, was known by studies on NATO deployment in Afghanistan, in which Italy is involved with a quota of troops, maintained contacts with the Social Democrats in Europe and with the Democrats in the USA.
Since 2008, she has been a member of the Chamber of Deputies, in which she is an expert on defence and European and international affairs.
When Renzi became prime minister in February 2014, he called Mogherini to his foreign minister.
If today the PD has a better relationship to the strong peace movement in the country, which contributed to the more than 40 percent votes of the party in the EU elections in May, then Federica Mogherini, as noted in PD travels, has a share in it.
The proposals in Brussels, which have too little diplomatic experience of the new Commissioner for Foreign Affairs, are therefore lacking in substance, is being crowned in the PD.
In Brussels, especially by Poland and the Baltic members, suspiciously realistic accents of Mogherini are being pursued for the crisis in Ukraine and defamed as a "Russia-friendly course".
It supports the South Stream pipeline operated by the Russian company Gasprom, through which Russian natural gas is to be transported directly to southern Europe while surrounding Ukraine, which also serves the energy security of Italy.
After Renzi took office as EU chairman in July, Mogherini traveled to Moscow on her first visit to Moscow.
Photos that they showed with Putin at the Shakespeare hand were emboldened in Brussels, as well as inviting the Kremlin chief to a Milanan economic summit for October.
A total of nine young people started their training at emz-Hanauer in Nabburg on Monday.
This includes an Azubi who has previously completed another training in the company.
In four training professions, the new employees will be active in the future: electronics (three trainees), mechatronics (two), tool mechanics (two) and process mechanics (two).
All Azubis come from the district of Schwandorf: Tobias Braun and Thomas BÃ¼tsel from Schwarzach, Stefan Brickl and Florian Rewitzer from Schmidgaden, Johannes Beer from Neunburg form forest, Felix Domaier from Oberviechtach, Daniel Anfrage-free and Sebastian Zahner from Pfreimd as well as Ferdinand Strebl from Teunz.
The new trainees previously attended primary or secondary schools and real schools.
From Wednesday to Friday, all year-old trainees and trainers will go to a team training event in Oberammergau, where, among other things, whole day migration and rafting are on the programme.
The company counts in 435 and 950 employees worldwide.
The number of trainees spread over all years is 27.
The Socialists in France should "hold their mouths and put France in order," said the most important ally of Francois Hollande.
Mr Valls called on the left to show "their love" for the controversial socialist president, whose cabinet-transformation has been disillusioned by the great majority of the French.
The President deserves everyone's respect, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It's our duty to stay by his side," he said with great applause.
As an appalling gesture, the Prime Minister insisted that his government would not question the controversial 35-hour week in France despite fierce demands for easing the regulation of Mr Emmanuel Macrons, the new Minister of Economic Affairs.
On Saturday, Mr. Hollande called upon his fellow socialists to show themselves "unify" with the government.
But Christiane Taubira, the Minister of Justice, strove sand into the drive, in which she appeared at a meeting of retired socialist MPs and criticised the Socialist Party for taking the French "the faith in their future".
Marine Le Pen, the far-right leader of the National Front, mocked the constant struggle of the socialists and said that she could not imagine that the new Valls government would last longer than a few months.
Francois Hollande is the emperor without clothes, but Prince Manuel Valls has none either, they are forced to form a new government if the old one has not even survived a summer.
"And the new will not survive autumn or winter either," said Ms. Le Pen to supporters.
She repeated the call of her party after a resolution of the Parliament and said that she was confident that she would come out as a winner in favour of elected elections and would be ready for government.
France's ruling party suffered a defeat in the municipal elections in March and the right-wing national front lay ahead of the EU elections in May.
A survey in the Sunday newspaper Journal du Dimanche revealed that 76 percent of French people believe that the Socialist Party is in danger of disintegrating into several rival groups before the end of the Dutch term of office 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at Science Po University, warned that the French would quickly lose patience if the new socialist government did not achieve an improvement in the economy and record unemployment.
"There is a small window for opportunities, but public opinion must quickly feel that things change," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could worsen further.
Norwegian Cruise just before a deal with prestige cruises of $3 billion
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the third largest cruise provider in the world, is leading advanced negotiations to acquire the competitor Prestige Cruises International Inc for about $3 billion, according to experts in the industry.
A deal would give Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion, access to the luxury cruise ships of Prestige Cruises and its prosperous clientele, while competing with larger rivals such as Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
An agreement could already be announced this week, said the sources on Sunday and warned that discussions could end without results.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the private equity company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N) also owns a share of 20 percent of Norwegian Cruise.
The sources asked to remain anonymous, as the negotiations were not public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comments while a speaker for Apollo refused a comment.
The Norwegian Cruise company, based in Miami, operates 13 cruise ships on routes between North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
His income was $2.57 billion in 2013, an increase of 13 percent compared to 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also located in Miami, operates under the brand name Oceania and Regent, which jointly operate eight cruise ships on routes to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
It reported revenue for 2013 of $1.2 billion, an increase of 6 percent compared to the previous year.
The cruise industry totals about $29 billion and in the coming years it is expected to increase in emerging markets such as China and India due to the strengthening of the middle class.
The companies are trying to position themselves for these new customers as the best choice among cruise providers.
Prestige Cruises applied to the US regulators in January 2014.
Apollo is the majority shareholder in the company since a $850 million deal in 2007.
Norwegian Cruise was created in its current form in 2000 by a merger with a cruise provider owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a leisure and casinomic group under the control of Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise went to the stock exchange in January 2013.
Genting held 28 percent of the shares, Apollo 20 percent of the shares and the private equity company TPG Capital LP at the end of June according to licensing authorities held a share of 8 percent of the company.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise have more than 82 percent of the passenger capacity in American cruise ships, according to the original application documents for the movement of Prestige Cruises.
Pro-Hong Kong activists condemn China on the day after the election decision.
A peking faithful group swirled near the Chinese flag.
On Sunday, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress passed a framework law allowing only two or three candidates for the leadership election in Hong Kong in 2017.
All candidates must first achieve the majority support of a nomination committee, which is expected to be occupied by peking faithful members.
This decision will make it almost impossible for oppositional democrats to be allowed to vote and will encourage pro-democracy activists to perceive their threat and to paralyse Hong Kong's financial centre with "Occupy Central" protests.
Political reforms have long been a controversial issue in Hong Kong; and the leadership of China fears that the calls for democracy are expanding to other cities.
After the publication of a Beijing White Paper setting out China's predominance on Hong Kong in June, Democratic activists held an unofficial referendum on the electoral process in the Special Administrative Region, where hundreds of thousands marched into the business district of the city and organized a sit-in there.
Li's survey is organised by the government in Hong Kong and the Chinese liaison office in Hong Kong.
The Deputy Chairman of the Permanent Committee's Legal Commission, Zhang Rongshun, and Vice Director of Hong Kong Office and Macau of the Council of State, Feng Wei, should be consulted during the day.
Student activists announced to gather in front of the Hong Kong executive office in the afternoon.
The United Kingdom did not see any democratic elements until the end of the 150-year colonial government in Hong Kong.
Putin asks Kiev to take up "State talks" with the Okpelraine
Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to Russian media reports on Sunday, demanded that the Ukrainian government launch the fight against the separatists in the eastern part of the country and immediately open negotiations on the "statehood" of the retired region.
His spokesman Dimitri Peskov later made clear that Putin did not mean that the region under the control of the separatists would become part of Russia, but that its status towards Ukraine should be redefined in order to give the Russian-speaking region the power to represent its rights and interests.
Putin's call to the Kiev government to negotiate with the pro-Russian insurgents, however, is in line with the strategy he had seen five months ago since the start of the outpourings: help for the separatists in taking up territories and pressure on the Ukrainian government in order to enable the newly proclaimed Novorossija region to be effectively independent for an alliance with Russia instead of with the West.
In an interview with the state TV channel One, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to reconquer the areas held by separatists in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, which were taken in March and April after Moscow had annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea on 18 March.
The Kremlin and the separatists recently referred to the occupied area as "Novorossija" or "Neurussland", a term reminiscent of the pre-revolutionary shine of the Russian empire.
Putin pointed out that all those who are "captured in their illusions" in the course of the Ukrainian elections on 26 Oct. and while government groups attack civilian communities in the areas held by separatists hope that soon peace talks will be "captured in their illusions," reported Itar-Tass.
"We need to take up detailed discussions without delay, not only on technical issues, but also on the political organization of society and the state status of the southeastern Ukraine in order to safeguard the interests of the people living there," he said.
Peskov said Putin's reference to statehood must be seen in the context of the greater autonomy that has been discussed for months by the Kiev leadership in order to dispel fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights are threatened.
Only the Ukrainian government can grant the necessary autonomy to the eastern areas, Peskov said.
This is not about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but about an internal conflict in Ukraine."
The clarification of the Kremlin speaker on the correction of Putin's "felin interpretation" underlined Russia's claim for leadership in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the East as opposed to the direct annexation of Crimea, on which the majority of the 2 million inhabitants are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have far greater difficulties in annexing the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in eastern Ukraine, since most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians and pre-conflict surveys showed a broad majority of the population in Ukraine.
The autonomy addressed by Russian diplomats on international forums would empower regional governments in Ukraine to negotiate their own trade agreements and external relations, thus giving the Kremlin de facto control over an area that connects the Russian state territory with Crimea.
The peninsula in the Black Sea five months ago is the home port for most of the Russian Navy as well as an important trading port and historic coastal region.
The regions between the Rostov region in Russia and Crimea are also rich in mines, factories and foundries that produce important components for the Russian military.
In his speech on 7 June, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed that the Ukrainian legislation - after re-election - be considered as an addition to the Constitution allowing more control over its finances and language status to be given to the respective territories.
But his notion of autonomy seems to be in sharp contrast to that of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels whose armament and incitement is accused of Moscow.
Putin's last call to Kiew to negotiate with the separatist leaders at eye level followed a further march of rebels last week, after Russian troops and tanks entered the Ostpelraine via the previously peaceful region along the Asov Sea.
The Russian-supported separatists took over the hand, which, according to fears of Ukrainian security officials, is the first step of a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region to Crimea, the control of Novoasovsk.
For this reason massive civil and military preparations have begun to fasten Mariupol, a steel industrial port with 500,000 inhabitants located between Novoasovsk and the narrow access to the Crimean peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke on Saturday at a meeting of the EU leadership in Brussels and urged action to prevent another Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic independent for 23 years.
"We're about to stand by a point where there's no return," warned Poroshenko.
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now located on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU Summit did not take concrete action, and the leadership called for further sanctions against Russia to come into force in the event of an unspectified escalation of the Ukraine crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovajsk after two Russian tankers and 1,000 soldiers invaded the Donetsk region last week to support the besieged separatists, said Colonel Andrij Lysenko, spokesman of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council Report on Saturday in Kiev.
The first probably 63 Ukrainian soldiers, imprisoned by the Russian invasion in Ilovajsk, were exchanged on Sunday against 10 Russian parachutes who had been captured on Ukrainian territory a week ago, reported Lysenko on Sunday.
Naked photo scandal around Australian Promis and Gabi Grecko
Geoffrey Edelsten did not pay homage to his anger about hackers who probably stole naked images of his fiancÃ©e Gabi Grecko and a who is who the A-promis from Hollywood.
The film city is excited after a series of clear photos of a naked Jennifer Lawrence appeared in a hacking scandal around Promis on the Internet.
The hacker responsible for this probably has 60 nudget photographs of Lawrence, star from "The Tribute of Panem" and from Superstars, among them the models Kate Upton and Cara Devivingne, the singers Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle as well as the actress Kirsten Dunst.
Of the Australian actress Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski, and Grecko from Melbourne, it was said that private photos were also published due to an iCloud luck.
On the list are 101 promotions.
Your nobles, who had engaged in grecko last month, said to Confidential: "It's disgusting."
All private letters and pictures should remain private.
It is a shame that private information can be stolen and passed on to others.
Grecko, currently in New York, reported a news website that the hack was "damaging" and that the affected felt "singing hurt".
The hacker probably has 30 pictures of Palmer with her ex-girlfriend Scott Speedman, among them two shots in which she is located above without being in a pool.
"Love is invincible" with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck-Star Strahovski and the actress Browning from Sugar Punch were not available for comments on the hacked pictures yesterday.
A representative Lawrence' said to TMZ: "It is a loathsome violation of privacy."
Actor Seth Rogen condemned the hacker in his Tweet: "Posting hacked pictures from a cell phone is nothing but selling Hehlerware."
Just legally speaking, the spread of stolen images should not be tolerated.
Radler, Jogger and Wanderer were there yesterday at the 8th Radeln auf den GroÃŸe Feldberg and thus supported the association "Help for Cancery Children".
The tour, for which one was torturous, represented an easy training for the other.
In one, however, everyone agreed: it was fun.
Thomas Studanski probably slept well last night.
For the first time in his life, the head of the Oberurseler Brauhaus took the wheel to the Feldberg yesterday.
For the good purpose.
He can easily hide the small muscle cat because of his participation in the 8th cycling on the GroÃŸe Feldberg in favour of the association "Help for Cancer-Hicked Children" (Frankfurt) and a valuable knowledge.
It's a great thing.
"I know now that I can - fine!"
Little pimple on the way in the applause curve?
No, if I had stopped once, it would've been out...
Like Thomas Studanski, who is sitting for the CDU in the Oberursel city parliament, many of the 718 participants came to the mountains yesterday in the morning valley and came to exhaustion, but happy to arrive on the plateau.
On the other hand, it was easier for others to cross the distance between Hohemark and Feldberg nearly 11 kilometers long.
Norman DieÃŸner, for example.
The very red Green politician from the county day - red dress, red bike - made a bit of understatement at the start ("Every lot of professionals, there is arrival the goal!"), but then proved to be half a professional on the mountain and went through the finish after 45 minutes without any difficulty.
He also passed through the track in a slide, as did Nina Kuhn, press secretary of the city of Oberursel, who together with Frank GrÃ¼neisen.
For the two triathletes, the "Feldberg-Radeln" was not necessarily a sporting challenge: "This is about Charity, we like to be with it - we would have made an exit anyway today," said Kuhn.
On the way they had met Paul Wenzel from Oberreifenberg.
The boy (12) had gone down to Oberursel in the morning to straighten out on the height.
The Frankfurt Florian Ziertz had turned into the saddle at 9 a.m. on the morning, "make" the Feldberg twice to roll home with fun.
Fun also "Fried-Toni".
For the head of the Oberurseler Kultkiosk, cycling tours over the Feldberg simply belong to this.
He had spent 40 minutes with his 6.5-kilo racing wheel.
A crazy event.
For this purpose - I like to be there," said Andreas Balzke.
The trained Mainzer says of himself that he is an "ambitioned racing cyclist".
That's what he must be, because he was on the road with the "fixie wheel", which is also racing bikes, but without switching...
The fact that it was also easy to go up without a bike proved not only the 20 hikers who climbed up the White Wall and the Fuchtanz to the summit, but also a jogger, who pulled a car tire with weights on a cord.
Bergwacht-Arzt Professor Volker Lischke, who provided safety with his team, equipped with Allrad-Bully and Quad, said: "I know them" from Frankfurt, who trainings for a special sled trail, only that he pulls the sled himself."The man is thus, in some way, his own sled dog.
The 718 participants - and therefore as many as never - had been sent to groups in the morning.
The hikers first at 9.30 a.m.
The first cyclists and runners followed at 10:00.
Five minutes later, the first mountain bikers set off.
Bent Hansen, chairman of the association "Radeln auf den GroÃŸen Feldberg", gave the start commands and wished the participants a nice trip.
For next year, he hopes that he will be able to block the route up to the Feldberg to the safety of the participants.
