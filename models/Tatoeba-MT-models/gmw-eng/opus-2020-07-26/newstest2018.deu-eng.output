Munich 1856: Four Maps That Change Your View of the City
A place of error, where young people should meet today.
A tomb chapel, where now is dug for the S-Bahn tunnel.
Small gardeners managed the former cause of farmers.
The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories on a daily basis.
It's annoying if maps are not up to date.
Everyone who has had to get excited before, because the car-Navi showed a green meadow instead of a bypass road.
The historical maps of the digital Bayern atlas, an offer of the Geoportal Bayern of the state government, are anything but current - but precisely very informative.
Especially when comparing them with current online cards.
Then it becomes clear how cities and communities in the distribution area of Munich Mercury have changed since the 19th century.
The digital Bayern atlas is a patchy carpet that you don't recognize as such.
For cities and municipalities, more detailed maps, so-called original position sheets, have been included in the large overview map.
According to the Bayerische Versatungsverwaltung, it arose between 1810 and 1864 and the first measurement of Bavaria.
Your client: Napoleon.
The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.
Napoleon wished an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographic recording of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.
Even though the French troops finally retired with the peace of Lunéville on 9 February 1801: today's neighbors created the idea of a wide-ranging Bayern map.
Kurfürst Max IV. Joseph continued the project, founded the "Topographic Bureau" - and thus the Bayerische Versatungsverwaltungsverwaltung.
The original position sheet for Munich dates back to 1856 and can be found on the website of the Bayerische Landesbibliothek.
The comparison between the former and today is most impressive in the example of the state capital.
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.
An example of this is the Subsend, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.
Sendling was incorporated 21 years after the map was created, i.e. 1877, as a district of Munich.
Today, Untersendling is located in the middle of the city.
The houses of Subsendlings focus around 1856 along today's Plinganserstraße, which was first named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the uprising of Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705.
Where the Westpark is today, you can see nothing but fields - at first glance: a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers appears in zooming in: handwritten numbered corridors from the so-called "principle" from which the basic tax was derived.
Small parcels no longer prove farmers there - but small gardeners of the plant "Land in Sun".
A large green area is distinguished north of Untersendling.
The Theresienwiese, since 1810 scene of the Oktoberfest, was indeed a meadow in the 19th century - and not a concrete desert.
On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.
In today's Au-Haidhausen district, one reads not only the street name "in Gasteig" or the elevation "on the air" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt".
Yeah, here on the Auerfeldstraße, you used to lock people with madness.
It was founded in 1858/59 by the Munich Kreis-Arrenanstalt "Auf der Auer Lüften".
From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden headed the establishment - that psychiatrist, who is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.
"He was progressive for his time and ended, for example, the chain of the so-called error.
He has also forbidden the staff to use violence against the inmates," says Hermann Wilhelm, director of the Museum of Haidhausen, who has worked for an exhibition with the institution.
For 280 patients, there had been space at first, and later there were 500 places.
Sometime this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the circular organ in Haar 1905.
Since 2006, the Isar-Amper-Klinikum München-Ost, one of Germany's largest Psychiatricians, has been located there.
In the area of the former Auer Anstalt, young people now meet in the Munich Salesianum.
The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with training companies.
To the west is the football field of TSV München East, to the east residential houses from the 1980s.
In 2015 the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" was built in architectural direction to the original construction of the Irrenanstalt, which was destroyed during World War II in bomb attacks.
The Marienplatz was registered in 1856 as the "Main Square", the Kaufingerstraße was called "Kaufinger Gasse".
The Second World War brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.
In December 1944, the Allied bombs pulled many holes into the city centre.
A big one remained to this day - at the Marienhof.
The English Institute, small business houses and a medieval grave chapel once stood at the Marienhof, where these days' preparatory work and on April 5, 2017 the groundbreaking for the second S-Bahn line was held.
With the slider, the old Munich card can be compared with the aerial view of today - and fill in the hole at the Marienhof.
Citizensrechtsgruppe publishes travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Promotion of Coloring has issued a warning to colored people who travel to Missouri due to the discriminatory politics and the racist attacks of the state.
"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, which is scheduled to enter into force until 28 August 2017, calls on African-American travelers, visitors and Missourins to pay particular attention on travel through the state and to take extreme care, as a number of questionable, race-based incidents have recently occurred in the entire state and are noted here," says the Group's opinion.
A recently adopted Missouri law that makes it harder for people to obtain discrimination complaints, as well as the law enforcement authorities of the state that disproportionately target minorities, prompted the group to issue the travel warning, said NAACP.
"They have violations of civil rights that happen to people.
They are stopped because of their skin color, they are beaten together or killed," said the president of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, Kansas City Star.
"We hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not yet heard."
It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the USA.
The group cited incidents such as racist crimes against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no fuel left during the trip through the state and was detained by the Missouri police without being accused of a crime.
The Council also refers to a recent report by the Office of the Missouri Advocate General, showing that black drivers in the state are stopped 75 percent more frequently than whites.
"The recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and employees of what might happen in Missouri," said Chapel.
"People must be prepared to bring security money or let relatives know they're travelling through the state."
In 2015, Missouri reported 100 hate crimes, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime report program, which grade the state in terms of the number of such injuries to the 16th place of the country.
Travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law, which would make it more difficult to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination.
Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the states had passed immigration laws to oblige local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for immigration violations, which the ACLU believes will contribute to further racial profiles.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but recently interest groups have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the US.
Weidezaun Project Is Elementary
The Fischerbacher Weidezaun project is a success project and will continue next year.
The CDU members Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac have taken a picture on site.
At the Rechtgrabenhof of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the Fischerbacher CDU-Ortsverband met together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two delegates.
Markus Schwendemann initially provided insights into his farm, where he manages 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, provides 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and houses holiday guests in five apartments.
The "Black Forest Milk" is for him the alternative marketing route for the milk of his cows, so Schwendemann.
On the table of the guests comes only regional.
Since he is also BLHV chairman of Fischerbach, he called the Weidezaun project "essentially important".
I cannot profit from such steep areas.
The green land has a lot of work to do, and much has to be done with the motor sensation.
"We have to fight with the conditions and with the topography," said Schwendemann.
In 2003, he took over the parental farm and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizers, even though he did not operate organically.
For mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear: "The municipality has recognized the importance of the Weidezaun project and is happy about the Leader Funding".
At the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, farmers would need to be supported.
It is hoped that this could lead to the reforestation of the land for a long time.
"The greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how they carry on their operations," the mayor stressed.
Farmers are often criticised because of the support
A total of 25 parcels were collected by eleven participants in 2013 via the Weidezaunförderung.
The opening area is thus 40 hectares which must not be reforested until at least 2023.
Of the total cost of 71 500 euros, half of the total was funded via leader, a quarter was borne by the municipality of Fischerbach.
Thus, the farmers remained 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of pasture.
"The great advantage is the durability of the fences," said Schwendemann.
Kordula Kovac stressed: "You are doing a really good job without farmers and farmers."
Peter Weiß also stated: "The best food is produced here".
The Landschaftspflege (LPR) Baden-Württemberg enables the state promotion of pasture fences.
The aim is to keep the Black Forest open.
The existence of a funding environment designated by the LPR is a prerequisite.
Furthermore, the area to be fenced must not be slenderly manageable (incentive over 35 per cent) and thus be threatened with the reforestation.
For the 2018 Fischerbacher Weidezaun project, the eight participants are currently applying for 24 parcels, which want to build just under 16 kilometres of fence.
The surface of the site corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than EUR 112 000.
Is nothing holy?
Now the White House of Trump takes over the Statue of Freedom
The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.
The Americans appreciate this as well as any other - therefore the carefully staged fall Saddam Husseins on the Firdos square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe to the Statue of Freedom in a heated dispute with Jim Acosta from CNN on the president's proposals for the drastic restriction of legal immigration.
To remain fair, Miller didn't attack the statue himself.
A horde of boat owners and Liberty immitators would've suffered him if he had done it.
But he attacked their meaning, and in particular the meaning that was attributed to them, when Emma Lazarus' famous poem was added to his base in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument.
When Miller Acosta reproached: "I don't want to go into a complete thing about history here, but the statue of freedom is ... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.
The poem you refer to, which was later added and is not part of the original Statue of Freedom."
Miller is actually right, but as he himself formulated it, it is not really about history.
It's about contemporary resonance on the uproaring words of Lazarus, the only one in which a state invites not only any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "Your tired, your poor, / your afflicted masses who long to breathe freely, / the wretched waste of your rich shores."
There was never a time when the "eternal waste" on our screens was better seen.
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people in Trump's USA are not welcome.
This conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural debate: it is indeed a conflict over the meaning of America.
Lazarus - and her friends who worked to place their words at the base after their death - knew very well that they were doing a high-political action.
The sculpture should show the connections between French and American Republicanism by representing the female embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classic imagery.
Lazarus changed this meaning: In her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.
And she gives herself a completely different name: Mother of Exiles.
The connection of the poem with the picture is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativeism.
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, people from the right wing wanted to change this for a long time.
The great Shrith Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Freedom is not an invite, but rather an early neoconservative that brings the American flame to the nightly world: "Lady Liberty is moving forward.
It is intended to carry the torch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world.
The torch should not lighten the way to the United States."
It's quite unusual for Limbaugh to find something here.
The meaning of the statue is quite a matter of the viewpoint of perception.
The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see it as it was seen by the exhausted, miserable, but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships.
In the truest sense, it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and of the welcome they need to hear.
And of course this is not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever want to recognize.
Their torches should not lighten the way, but light the hatred, which is their only source of power.
2017 World Championship: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK team
Eilith Doyle remembers a time when only two Scottishs were part of the British team
Neil Black, the UK's light athletics executive, says that the 16-member Scottish quota in the World Cup framework "will make a massive contribution to the team".
A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017, which starts on Friday.
Black believes that "is developing something special in Scotland" and that the UK's athletics have to learn something from it.
"We welcome it, and we try to understand it, and we will continue it until we find out," Black said.
"I'm talking to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they've done.
The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.
British athletics: It has something to do with what they have done.
And also with the guy on the street corner.
Whatever the combination of circumstances, it is absolutely brilliant."
Several of the Scottish athletes are medal candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track, while Eilith Doyle was elected team captain.
"Eilidh is quite modest.
Her captain's speech was incredible," Black says.
"A number of athletes, regardless of whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.
The passion and the real feeling that Eilith brought in naturally were great."
The Commonwealth silver medal winner, who will compete at the 400m World Championships during her fifth World Championships, says that it is "unbelievable" that 16 shots are in the British team.
Scotland's best overall number of athletes at the World Championship was seven, which were achieved in 1983 and 2015.
The mid-range runner Muir is leading this path and has set five British and two European records last year.
It will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m races.
Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 metres, is another shot to watch after a great season that included victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers her first World Championships when the only other shot in the team was Lee McConnell.
The captain of the team says that she is "norm proud" of the fact that many of her compatriots are not only part of the team, but in some cases will also join the medals and the finals.
"The special thing about being a team captain is that she was elected by the other members of the team, so that it was a great honor anyway, but knowing that my teammates voted for me and chose me, makes it something very special for me," she added.
"Obviously, I am very proud of all the bulkheads that belong to the team.
It only shows how far we've come.
And they're here as established athletes, athletes who want to climb on pods.
What's my speech as captain?
Yeah, I think she went well.
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation, because we have a home world championship.
It is therefore really important to rely on this home support and to benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympic Stadium.
I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will just be such a great atmosphere out there."
Block critics on Facebook: Do not apply for a public office if you cannot tolerate heating voters
The father of our country knew something about bad press.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it did not last long until the newspapers beat him for everything, from internal politics to its political principles.
He shuddered at the critique, sure.
But he didn't silence his critics.
For in 1783 Washington said: "Free speech can be taken away - and, stupid and dumb we are being led to battle like sheep."
This brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work to be more like Washington.
Hogan's employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And the American Civil Liberties Union sued him for that at the beginning of this week.
The staff of the governor dismissed the action as frivolous, and the online comment was full of a counter-reaction with "Na, and?" .
"It's just Facebook," many people said.
But it's important.
And it's especially important when it's a guy like Hogan.
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly democratic state that is surprisingly popular.
He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.
Hogan is not a reactionary heathead.
He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict compliance with the principles.
He was also very skilled in using Facebook as a primary tool to connect with his voters and playfully debuting his hairless head to chemotherapy on his side.
Therefore, blocking those who come to the side of the governor - which is a public forum called official and paid by employees with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's spokesperson Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moderation.
But it's too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful people that swing the whips online.
The post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And these are only real people talking to their chosen leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a pastor, no trolls.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not proficient.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan’s Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, MD, wasn't hateful, but she asked about hate crimes.
"I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other news," she wrote in the comment section of the "The Post".
"I don't appreciate this idea either, if a number of people take a position on the same subject, then they are ignored by some rather than a so-called collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens".
What the governor's employees called "concentrated spam attack" would probably call others "promotion".
The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than in earlier times if one had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials or arrest and silence demonstrators.
But that's exactly what's happening digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticized for slandering Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is sued by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed.
One of the first milestones in this question was in Virginia last week.
The president of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County violated the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banned a voter from her Facebook page.
And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be so hard.
At the time of Washington, the time of affordable postage had a similar effect to that of the Internet.
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letterwriters responded to his lead.
And even back then, Washington had anonymous trolls.
The people who used pseudonyms like "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius" wrote all the letters to newspapers that made Washington's decisions.
Petitions criticizing his position on the Treaty of Amity, Trade and Maritime with Great Britain overwhelmed his office, according to the historical documents collected by the online papers of the George Washington Project.
But he didn't silence her.
Freedom of speech, disagreement and discourse are the basis of our nation.
And true leadership means accepting that.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for domestic comfort in the Renaissance Club
Former European No. 1 Ronan Rafferty will hope for comfort in the next three days, as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian will host the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
The Nordire, who led next to the Archerfield left to the final round of the year before he lost to Paul Eales, is connected to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador on behalf of the club founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
"I've seen how the Renaissance Club was built, and we see him achieve his glory with this event," said Rafferty.
"The players will see this course from his best side, he is in a great state.
Jerry did a great job when he determined this place.
He is a zealous champion of this game and proud of his performance here.
This is a great window for this course."
The English Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time, even though he has won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
"This really feels special," said the Southport-based player.
"I couldn't defend the Extremadura Open because it was taken out of the program in the year after I won it.
Coming back to this part of the world is magical.
It's a wonderful place to play golf.
The memories from the last year come back, and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon to win here last year.
It was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate."
Gary Orr, who came to the European Senior Tour earlier this year after his 50th birthday, returns to the campaign on his home floor.
This event will be his first Scottish appearance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"It always means a little more when you play at home," said Orr, the man from Helensburgh.
"You want to do it well, but you also feel this extra pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again, and I played a solid golf.
I'm glad about how it went."
With the trio on the field, the former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and Senior Major Champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty are.
Orr and the former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six bulkheads on the field, the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Admission is free, parking costs £ 5 per car with one inmate and £ 10 per car with two or more inmates.

Less lung cancer death due to passive smoking
Over the past two decades, fewer people have died because of passive smoking of lung cancer.
Scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) come to this conclusion in a study.
"Our estimates suggest that 167 lung cancer deaths per year are due to passive smoking," said study director Heiko Becher.
As a comparison, he drew up his own study on this issue in 1994.
At that time there were 400 lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking per year in Germany.
The new study is published in the "International Journal of Public Health".
House connections are very complex
The construction work on the Villinger Straße is in full swing and "is a bit in time," says Fred Heinze, head of the Bauhof.
In the area of house connections, the situation was more complicated than suspected, as underground much was hidden, which was not mentioned in the plans.
The traffic, which repeatedly hinders construction work, is a major problem for Stumpp's construction team.
"The ignorance of drivers in front of red traffic lights and barriers is already enormous," Heinze reports.
The road was blocked and only the buses were allowed to pass through.
Angelo Caruso, Marvin Kostorz and Tim Kostorz from Stumpp have been working on the bridge for weeks.
"The hot days were already quite strenuous.
But fortunately, we were supplied with cool mineral water by our friend Fritz Matt," says Marvin Kostorz.
Poverty and Death in Indonesian Goldland
When Bardina Degei cooked dinner, she doesn't use a stove.
She even rarely uses a pot.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of the Panai government in the unrested Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually places a sweet potato - locally referred to as "nota" - directly in the fireplace.
After half an hour, the corrugated tubular is removed and swallowed with freezing, unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work, e.g. to wash clothes with cloudy water from the nearby swamp.
A bucket in a homeless room serves as a latrine.
She was the youngest of her husband's four wives to be assigned no fields.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: Most villagemen are unemployed, and many drink hard, and there are soldiers here.
"No one dares walk around the village after 5:00," she says.
It is a rare insight into the daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony, which was taken up in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia, when only 1,026 elders were to vote by a public handset in front of the occupation troops.
An existing movement that developed for independence against Dutch rule quickly turned against the government of Jakarta, which has control over the region and excludes foreign journalists or lawyers from it.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, the independent part of Papua New Guinea included the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is as remote as it is grounded. The trip includes a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital of Jayapura to Nabire and then a morning 5-hour drive by car.
There is no public transport.
The town of about 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences and corrugated sheet metal roofs converted by rust into different yellow-brown tones.
Only very few Indonesians have made their trip here, let alone journalists and practically no foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, May Pago Papuan worshiped a god named Uga Tamee.
There were other changes as well.
"We weren't used to wearing these clothes," says Degei, pointing to her lively hand-weaved turban, her dark shirt and her bright skirt.
"Before we had only leaves on our bodies."
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst child mortality and literacy rates in Asia.
But it is also Indonesia's goldland.
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, Grassberg, owned by the Freeport McMoran from Phoenix, is located only 60 miles from Paniai, a highland province in the size of New Jersey with 153,000 inhabitants.
In 2015 alone, Freeport has reduced the value of $3.1 billion of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua has an estimated $78 billion worth of wood resources.
However, these wealthes are a source of misery for the Papua that ensures that Indonesia's powerful military preserves an suffocating presence.
A 2005 study in the New York Times reported that freeport paid local military members and units between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 to a single officer.
Papuan demands for greater autonomy threaten these golden geese and are mercilessly treated.
According to activists, more than 500,000 Papua have been killed and thousands have been raped, tortured and detained by the Indonesian military since 1969.
Mass killings in Papua's tribal highland in the 1970s became genocide according to the Asia Human Rights Commission.
In the region alone, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful demonstrators last year.
"We're going to lose everything," says a report by the archdiocese of Brisbane from 2016, in which reports on the atrocities of the previous year are included, such as illegal executions and torture - rape and electric strokes are particularly popular according to another report - and the brutal precipitation of peaceful demonstrations.
"It is difficult to count the number of victims, as incidents happen every week," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The screws have become stronger as Papua's resources bring an inflow of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is Christian, but demographic development is changing, as Muslim economic migrants come from the populated islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanian maintenance canteens sell fried chicken and gado, a mixed vegetables served with peanut sauce.
Local people are fighting to stay here.
"The migrants have begun to sell chickens and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local Papua," explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old paniai native who went to work in the provincial capital of Jayapura.
"It has cost the domestic Papua - the mama mama [the women] of Papua - their market."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, known as Jokowi in the Volksmund, promised to tackle the inequalities and violations in Papua during his 2014 election campaign.
The former Zimmermann secured 27 out of the 29 districts of Papua - including Paniai - on the way to the President's Palace in Jakarta.
But little has changed in Papua, and today the locals are cheating.
"Our hearts are broken because we voted in 2014 for Jokovi, with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored," says You.
In fact, Paniai only suffered two months after Jokovy's initiation in October.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children were outside and sang Christmas songs in front of a campfire in Enarotali, when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle.
The scared children told them to turn on their headlights.
One of the soldiers took on her tone and later returned with four soldiers, according to the local pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers who had drunk hunted and beat the group with their rifles, said victims and witnesses.
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children.
A child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so hard that he fell into the coma.
A few hours later, the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and things escalated the next day.
About 1,000 young Papua men, women and children gathered on a football court in front of the local police station and the military command center to demand justice.
They carried ceremonial hunting arches and performed the Waita dance - running in the circle and initiating a bird singing - by Papua's Mee Pago tribe.
Some demonstrators began to shake stones at police and military posts.
When the mood was heated up, the soldiers were sent a command via an internal radio: "If the masses resist more than three times, they shoot them dead," says an official document from TIME, which was not released to the local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, head of the Kego Koto quarter of Enarotali, saw the threatening danger and called for rest and demanded the crowd to return home.
No one was in the mood to listen.
"When I turned around, I was suddenly shot into my left wrist," he said on the veranda of his colorfully painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who fired, but says the bullet came out of the ranks of the soldiers gathered here.
"It was overcrowded, many shots were fired," he adds.
The native man Alfius Youw was hit three times, his cousin, who was witness to the shootings.
"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure it was him," said Yohanes, who like many Indonesians bears only one name, the TIME in a gloomy mood.
"I saw he was dead... I kissed him."
The chief inspector of the Papua Police, Yotje Mende, said reporters wanted his officers to "guarante" their station because they were attacked.
"We must defend ourselves if people threaten to kill us," said the spokesman of the Papua Police, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo, in 2015.
"It's about life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young demonstrators were killed and many more injured.
The following day the news about the killings came 'filtered' to Jakarta.
Two weeks, Jokowi in Jayapura gave a passionate speech in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and swore to address the historical maladies in Papua.
"I want this case to be resolved immediately, so that it will not happen in the future," he said.
In October 2016, Security Minister Wiranto said that he set up an extrajudicial mechanism for resolving historical human rights violations.
But the excuses almost immediately began.
"Most injuries occurred a long time ago.
Some were in the 90s and early 2000s.
The point is that we have committed ourselves to dealing with these violations, but there are processes that need to go through," he said.
Then Wiranto withdrew when he spoke to TIME on 5 June in Jakarta and said he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, "everything is regulated by law," he said.
Wiranto, who sued the UN for "crimes against humanity", who demanded more than 1,000 victims in East Timor's bloody independence vote in 1999, said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua have already been filed, including the Panai incident.
Panai families accepted such claims with gross infidelity.
"I have been interviewed four times over the last three years, but there has been no progress," says Yohanes.
"I'm tired."
He says that years later he still lives in fear.
"I'm scared," he says.
"I'm afraid of being arrested by the military, I'm afraid of being shot."
His brother Yacobus repeated the view that people in Paniai were afraid to discuss the incident.
He says he was beaten by the military after he helped bury four of the victims.
"After I buried the bodies, the military looked for me," he says.
The shootings didn't stop.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot at villagers in Paniais neighborhood Deiyai.
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company who refused to bring a unconscious man to the hospital, one person died and 17 others were injured, including children.
The man, the 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who was drowned when he was fishing in a nearby river, died on the way to the hospital.
Sincere villagers protested in front of the company's office.
The police said that the villagers threw stones on officers who responded by firing off warning shots.
But locals say that the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) began shooting at the crowd and killing one.
"We were so in panic, we're afraid there's going to be revenge," says the 29-year-old Domingo Badii, who lived near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were quickly brought in here, says the TIME.
"I've been hiding in my house for two days."
The Deiyai Parliament has called for the officers involved to be accountable and to withdraw the police's mobile brigade from the area.
Paniai was always an unrest for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development strengthens the dissatisfaction of tribal members Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal who live in the green highlands of Papua.
Many joined the "Free Papua Movement" (OPM), the rebel army that claims to defend the right of the Papua by attacking sporadic attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders come from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, thousands of people in Paniai have been arrested and arbitrarily detained in recent years, under the pretext of "guaranteing national sovereignty".
Some people never show up again.
Among the people in Papua is Paniai known as "a tragic, forgotten place".
Poverty strengthens dissatisfaction.
The bit of rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
Bread is just as out of reach.
People here build everything they eat: above all note and fruit and leafy vegetables.
Agriculture is the task of women who can process four or five fields of sweet potatoes each.
They keep most of the harvest for the family, while the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten pieces of note cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities between the local Papua and the new migrants have grown in greater numbers since the opening of new routes to Nabire Airport.
The few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better trained and more prosperous migrants.
Papua rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to lead their own businesses competitively.
"The young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there are no jobs or money here," says John Gobai, president of the Paniai Tribe Council.
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua.
In addition, restrictions on reporting of international media remain strained.
At the beginning of the year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported because of lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua, although the rare permission to film was granted them.
According to Phelim Kine, the deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch, the promises of Jokovy's campaign to abolish the restrictions of reporting in order to promote transparency and development were not realized.
"There are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia's troubled eastern provinces of Papua and Westpapua: visa refusal and a black list," he said in a statement.
Lack of control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely limited to the immediate neighbours of Papua.
In March, six Pacific states - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - requested the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the "various and widespread injuries" in Papua including the Panai shooting.
The same countries have historically supported the OPM.
The spokesman of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Arrmanatha Nasir rejected the group's accusations and said journalists in Jakarta: "In Indonesia, a democratic system still applies, and there is free media, so it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights cases."
People on the ground want more foreign governments to take note of this.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, under the direction of the human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on May 4, locals broke their silence and oppressed him "We want freedom", according to a source that also participated, but wants to remain anonymous.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but the Papua say that they will probably not vote for Yokowi again.
"Jokowi is a man who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the panai shots," says Gobai, chairman of the Council of Tribes.
He wants Yokowi to know that the Paniai people, apart from living under the constant threat of a predatory military, are in poor education and health services.
Gobai says that the Paniai people, like other Papua, consider their voice to be a "guilt" for Jokowi, which he has to repay.
"They don't need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite the threats and intimidations, families of the Panai gun victims carried out a final symbolic act of spite: the body of a victim was buried on a site exactly opposite the police and military station.
They know that they may never be given justice, but at least they will not let those responsible forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed," says Yacobus with lowered head.
"What else can we do?"
Fire capture Dubai's 'Torch' skyscraper for the second time
A fire was found on Friday in one of the world's highest living towers in Dubai and forced hundreds of residents to flee from the 337-metre high 79-storey building.
It is the second fire, which in just two years passes through the high house, which is randomly called the Torch Tower (Fack Tower).
The building was evacuated, injuries were not reported, and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame.
"We slept and we got up in the fire alarm and in the screaming of the people.
We ran down the stairs, and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor," said a resident who gave his name as George, Reuters.
Dubai's civil protection authorities said that the units of the fire fighting at 4.00 Local time (00.00 GMT) removed the fire and cooled the building.
The government said it was working on providing accommodation for those affected.
The incident can revive questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high-rise buildings around the world.
An investigation by the management of the Torch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damage came from the disguise, the outer panel for decoration or insulation.
In the UK, the police said that she believed that the system of plates for insulation and disguised panels at the London Grenfell Tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire that killed about 80 people.
No Davis Cup reform: Continued Best of Five
The President of the International Tennis Association (ITF) has passed through with his large Davis Cup coup at the General Assembly.
At the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City, the proposal to play Davis Cup singles for this sport was not supported by the necessary two-thirds majority.
The five-sa classics, which are often very long but also very much appreciated, thus remain in the traditional competition.
63.54 percent of the member countries voted in favour of the reform, the goal of ITF President David Haggerty was therefore barely missed.
"We respect this decision, but we are disappointed that our memberships have not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and Fed Cup.
We need a change in order to secure the long-term future of these iconic and historical competitions," said Haggerty.
One will continue to work to improve the competitions.
After many oppositions, it was not until the vote that the proposal had been put to the vote that the finale should be presented in a neutral place.
New from 2018 are only relatively small details: In future, the finalists will have the host right in the following year in the first round.
In order to reduce costs for the organizers, the requirements in terms of training places, etc., will be facilitated and players will have to take less official media dates before the Davis Cup.
More than 1 out of 5 US travelers brings banned items into the plane, finds out a survey
A flight passenger survey revealed that more than 20 percent of objects deliberately or unconsciously banned were smuggled past the US Transportation Security Administration control points, including at least 6 percent entering the aircraft while carrying accidentally banned knives or other objects with blades.
Less than 1 percent claimed that they had been late discovered that they had been in error with gun, ammunition or explosives.
The survey of more than 1,000 people - carried out by a jet charter service, Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - also noted that younger travellers are more likely to disregard the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted that they were knowingly trying to fly with something banned by the TSA, 19.7 percent were Millennials, compared to less than 15 percent who were members of the X generation.
The most common items that were deliberately thrown by TSA agents were food and liquids.
More than 3 per cent admitted that they were knowingly carrying items with blades through security control, while 2.2 per cent of female respondents and 3.7 per cent of male respondents also confirmed that they had deliberately brought illegal drugs into the plane.
The company said it had interviewed travelers all over the country to find out how many accidentally smuggling goods had caused by airport security and how many would have done it purposefully.
It is no surprise that the people who are most likely to be smuggled — knowingly or unknowingly — by the safety of those who are most likely to fly.
However, the company points out that the TSA directives are a bit complicated and confusing.
People are often unsure about what liquids they can carry or how much of it.
It is no surprise, therefore, that the largest amount of liquids seized by the TSA are prohibited.
For a while, people thought the TSA could view books as smuggling.
Liquids are permitted on domestic flights but not on international flights.
Elon Musk doesn't care: Tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel order
Electric-thousandsassa Elon Musk is happy to announce with the huge number of pre-orders for his new "Model 3" Tesla.
To date, he has indicated that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation.
In addition to the always triumphant figures for sales increases and even more huge sales targets, Tesla-Chef Elon Musk has for the first time revealed a different, less brilliant figure in the announcement of the latest quarterly balance: the cancellations of the new mass market model 3.
Over the past few months, Musk had often recruited more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car, whose extradition is just beginning.
Musk now clears: 63,000 pre-orders have already been withdrawn from a total of 518,000 pre-orders.
Critics have repeatedly pointed out that these are only non-binding reservations.
In case of cancellation, Tesla will pay back the 1000 Euro (US$ 1000 and UK $1,000) "Reserve payment" in full.
At the moment 455,000 such non-binding reservations are available, Musk accepted in a telephone conference with analysts.
However, the Tesla boss does not believe that the cancellation of around 12 percent of all orders could become a problem.
His argument: The challenge of ambitious growth targets is not about demand, but about the production side.
Last year, Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.
In 2018 - all models taken together - it is supposed to be 500,000, a million in 2020.
The demand for this is obviously there.
According to Musk, there are currently 1,800 reservations per day.
If you order a "model 3" today, you can expect extradition at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla manages to drive its brand new production roads that have never been tested in practice without major interruptions with maximum utilization.
Many experts doubt that this is possible.
However, if there are more delays, the non-bindingness of reservations could become a problem for Tesla.
Because then the company cannot prevent dissatisfied customers from running away in crowds.
EPO CEO Pruitt withdraws due to the delay in the Obama era rules to reduce emissions
One day after he was sued by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the head of the environmental protection authority, took back his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era in order to reduce the emissions of smog causing air pollutants.
Pruitt presented the change when his agency proved to be the needs of the state environmental authorities to respond faster than previous administrations.
He did not mention the action which had been brought against his previous post in a Federal Appeal Court.
It is a deadline for States to comply with the 2015 standards for near ozone on 1 October.
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay compliance by one year in order to give his authority more time, study the plan, and avoid "integrating into local decisions or hinder economic growth".
Pruitt, who was a lawyer of Oklahoma before his appointment by President Donald Trump, was for a long time a reliable opponent of stricter environmental protection rules.
Since his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly resorted to blocking or delaying regulations to which the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels are opposed.
The sudden return from Wednesday is the latest legal setback for the Pruitts regulatory rollback agenda.
Last month, a Federal Appeal Court in Washington decided that the EPA administrator had exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of Obama administration, which required oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methanlecks.
In an opinion published on Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that its turnover at ozone standards would simply strengthen the EPA's willingness to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely compliance with the new standards.
"In previous administrations, the EPO has often failed to comply with the deadlines for implementation and then waited to be charged with activist groups and other groups and in an agreement to set the date for implementation," said Pruitt, who accused the EPO more than a dozen times in his previous job.
"We do not believe in regulation through court proceedings, and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take the law and authority that we have."
Nevertheless, the EPO's opinion stated that at some point Pruitt will use its "permanence to delay and all other legally available powers" to ensure that the rules "are based on a solid policy and the best information available".
Republicans in Congress are pressing for a more comprehensive recast of the ozone rules.
A draft legislation approved last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measure was not yet put to the vote in the Senate.
The New York prosecutor general Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that had sued the EPO this week, said that the group intended to maintain legal pressure.
"The return of the EPO - according to our complaints - is an important benefit for the health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the more than 115 million Americans directly affected by the Smog that flows into their communities," said Schneiderman.
New York joined in this case California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and the District of Columbia.
Soil ozone occurs when pollutants from cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight.
The emerging Smog can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive groups of people and contribute to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Representatives from public health and environmentalists were cheering about Pruitt's surprising course change.
"It's worrying how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step from the person responsible for protecting the air we breathe," said Lori Ann Burd from the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to fight against the ideological crusade of the Trump government, to offer ourselves to the polluters and their particular interests".
Tumlingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius Church
750 Years of St. Hilarius Church: On the occasion of the anniversary of the Bergkirche, the old cemetery area in Tumlingen will be invited to a Serenade at 4.30 p.m. on Sunday, July 16th.
Whether it's idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historic St. Hilarius facility is a popular place to stay.
Visitors to the sixth benefit serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.
The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made the friends and sponsors Tumlingen's concern.
Walter Martini emphasizes: "It's a unique pedestal."
In 1267 the St. Hilariuskapelle was mentioned for the first time in the German document book: Count Hermann von Sulz sold "the mountain with the parish church at Tumlingen and Vogtei" to Magister Eberhard von Horb and to his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silber.
According to the text of the document, in addition to the former parish church, there was also a royal court to which the church or the right of patronation belonged and not vice versa.
So there were people living there too.
According to the description of the Oberamt Freudenstadt in 1858, next to the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which can still be seen in the local image of Tumlingen, was the "mountain" of the third, the glorious town center of the village.
Ancient maps from around 1600 support these historical events.
The patronat law came from the early Middle Ages of the Church.
A lord who built a church, equipped it and occupied it with a parish priest continued to be the owner of this church and could also inherit this own church.
This involved the right to employ a pastor or to propose a new pastor to the bishop.
There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.
The larger of the two bursts on Christmas 1673.
The newly acquired bell then first performed in 1692, but later in World War II it had to be delivered in 1942.
In the 30-year-old war (1616-1648), the windows were struck and the bell sails were stolen.
The roof was hidden.
In 1796, French troops were camped near the church.
They broke out the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.
Survivors of the church threatened in 1809.
Until 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius cemetery served as the last resting place for the deaf from Hörschweiler.
In 1823, the cemetery was extended and the Hilarius Church broke down.
Only the church tower was left to stop.
In the New Year's night of 1834, a storm split the church tower and half fell.
In order to prevent an accident, the tower was broken down.
Only today's tower dwarf was preserved as a witness to the 750-year-old history of the church.
Today Horst Kalllberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem of the "Creative Pensioners" as successor of Dieter Dockhorn care for the Hilarius plant.
As organizers, friends and sponsors invite Tumlingens to the St. Hilariuskapelle on Sunday, 16 July, to the sixth Serenade at the old cemetery.
This is created by the Combo of Kepler-Gymnasium's Freudenstadt and with contributions by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.
Local president Hartmut Romann speaks the final word.
The program starts at 4.30 p.m.
Entry is from 15.30 p.m.
For the sound of the Serenade there is an environment in front of the cemetery.
"Enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with the wide view over meadows towards the forest", the organizers show the fantastic view.
The Serenade takes place only in dry weather.
The organizers hope for many supporters to preserve the historic St. Hilarius plant, which is important for tumlingen and hearing students.
The friends and sponsors of Tumlingen feel particularly committed to home care, as Serenade organizer Walter Martini confirms.
Association wants approval of wind wheels to be checked
"Boisheim weert sich" sees no legal condition for the construction and has therefore turned to the Landrat.
The association "Boisheim weert sich" asked Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheimer Nette.
It was unlawful.
The association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Boisheimer Nette, no wind turbines could have been approved at all, since at the time in Viersen there was only a wind power concentration zone at the city border with Schwalmtal.
Within this concentration zone, the construction and operation of wind turbines is generally possible, but at the same time the concentration zone leads to an exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city.
The areas are intended to prevent a "sparing" of the landscape.
Although the city of Viersen had decided a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette a few days earlier by changing the land use plan, it had not been approved by the district government of Düsseldorf for a formal error.
"As a result of the lack of planning law, the authorisation decision granted is still unlawful and therefore also to be withdrawn," said Christoph Erkens, Chairman of "Boisheim weist sein".
Current state of affairs: The City Council decided again the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette before the summer break; approval of the district government is still pending.
It is clear from this point of view that the granting of an authorisation for the installation of wind turbines is not in the planning field.
The circle confirms the receipt of the invitation.
"The corresponding writings have been received in the circle of fours since last week," said one speaker.
The circle takes them to reassess the matter.
However, they are not likely to stop the procedure.
With a view to ongoing proceedings with the administrative court, the circle did not want to comment on the argumentation of the association "Boisheim weert sich" on Thursday.
The NEW Re, a subsidiary of NEW, is planning the construction of four and 200-metre-high wind wheels on an area on the Boisheimer Nette.
Last year the company, in which the city of Viersen is directly involved, had already concluded lease contracts with the owner of the approximately 65 acres of land.
With the construction of the four wind turbines, the electricity requirement of around 11 400 households is to be covered - which corresponds to about one fifth of the electricity requirements of all four households.
The NEW Re wants to invest around 20 million euros.
Last summer, foursens city council gave green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the Linnich wind farm near Aachen and a participation in a wind turbine in Übach-Palenberg in Heinsberg County.
Car and tractor crack together: woman dies in terrible accident
A terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning around 10 a.m. on the L 333 between Niederwallmenach and Bogel (Rhein-Lahn-Kreis).
A woman was killed.
Two more people were slightly injured.
The Landesstraße remained blocked for hours.
According to police information, a 17-year-old young woman from Bornich accompanied her car with her 53-year-old mother as a companion to the L 333 in the direction of Bogel.
City and dealers are planning "home shopping" weekend
Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region are to discover the shopping opportunities in the city centre in September.
The commercial association and the city administration want to take advantage of the weekend on 8 and 9 September to attract the residents to the city centre for shopping.
As the president of the trade association, Christian König, announced, the "home shopping" weekend will raise customers' awareness of what offers their own city away from the usual supermarket war.
According to this, a market with regional providers is planned, similar to the weekly market.
In addition, local companies will present themselves with their training places.
In addition, the shops of the city centre are to invite to the "night shopping".
The project was aimed not only at residents of the city and the closer region.
In preparation, advertising spots on the radio, an internet video and printed bags pointing to the action weekend, Christian König said.
City administration and commercial association cooperate with the Chamber of Industry and Commerce.
The commercial association and the city thus enter another stage of the "Attractive Downtown" project.
This includes new offers such as the first "Active Day" at the well-opened Sunday, discussions with all business operators and hosts to move them to active participation.
Also attractive offers for Saturdays and the absence of parking fees on this day are part of the concept.
In addition, customer potentials should be re-opened or re-opened.
This includes guests and tourists.
But many locals would also have lost sight of the city centre when shopping.
In the end, everyone would have to contribute to vigorating the city centre - to landlords, the businesses of the whole city and associations.
With a network it was worth overcoming the lethargy that had partly widened, King had said in spring.
Birgit Streich, head of the IHK-Center in Mühlhausen, announced that on the third day of "home shopping" in Germany, five Thüringer cities took part for the first time.
In addition to Bad Langensalza, these are Weimar, Sömmerda, Heiligenstadt and Bleicherode.
The day should "advertise for the value of local trade and enhance its importance for the common good of our cities," says Streich.
The action led by the IHK and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his/her own direct environment with his/her purchasing behaviour.
Two dead and several injured after explosion at US school
During construction work there was a gas explosion in the school building.
New people were injured.
In a gas explosion in the U.S. City Minneapolis, two people were killed and nine more were injured, some of them heavy.
According to the fire brigade, on Wednesday (local time) a injured person was still in critical condition.
A person died when part of a school building collapsed at the explosion.
One of the first missing was also rescued later.
The dead were employees of the school.
As a cause of accident, the authorities suspected work on a gas pipeline.
At the time of the holiday, only a few people stayed in the Minnehaha Academy building.
Trump put pressure on Mexico for the payment of the border wall to use his wired transcripts of telephone calls
The Washington Post published transcripts of telephone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia.
On 27 January, Trump, in a telephone call with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nito, requested to stop saying publicly that he would not pay for a planned border wall.
The US president insulted him because he had publicly charged the wall. According to reports he said to him, "You can't tell the press."
Trump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall at the southern border of the United States and vowed to have Mexico pay for the project.
Transcripts of his first call to the Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published and revealed a tense exchange.
Mr. Trump told Mr. Turnbull that a trade for the US refugees who emigrated to Australia would make him look like a "depp" after he proposed a ban on relocated refugees to the US.
Mr. Trump finished the call after he told Mr. Turnbull, "this is the most unpleasant call all day."
Moores Ford-Massaker: activists re-establish racist lynchakt as a call for justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury drove through a group of spectators in rural Monroe, Georgia, and rumbling to the Ford Bridge of Moore.
Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, could reach the bridge, a group of white men came out with guns to block his way.
The leader of the mob - a middle-aged man in a needle strip suit - took a long train at his cigar and looked through the windscreen.
Inside, the inmates floated in fear.
"We want this n ----r Roger!" the man roared.
"Get him out of the car!"
Shrew the silence when a young black man was torn from the passenger seat.
Fortunately, this terrible scene, which was played on July 22nd, is just a imitation.
But when a sling is thrown around the neck of "Roger", almost everyone in the audience came out with very real sighs.
Since 2005 civil rights activists have returned to Moore's Ford Bridge to imitate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom as well as George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were hunted by Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
No one has ever been charged with the murders.
"It is really inconceivable that no one was arrested in all these years - although we see them in our communities, even though we know who they are," said Tyrone Brooks, who helps in the organization of the supplement.
"It's a stain of dirt on a story, but it's a burden to our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Congressman of the state of Georgia and a lifetime civil rights activist.
For him the imitation serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual memory of the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.
"We want prosecution, we want to end, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but we must first obtain justice," he said.
"We cannot reach healing and reconciliation until we obtain justice."
A medical officer puts a bedcloth on the body of one of the victims of the Moore Ford-Lynchen on 27 July 1946.
According to FBI acts, which were received from NBC news, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected in the lynch process.
But no one was ever charged.
Although the suspects have remained free for decades, civil rights activists say that the double motivation for Lynch actions throughout the city was always known: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a decision by the Supreme Court allowed black citizens in Georgia to vote for the first time in the pre-election campaign in summer.
At about the same time as the election, according to the FBI of black farmers Roger Malcom a white landowner, Barnett Hester, fell down during a fight - supposedly because of a woman.
Brooks said that the rumor in the city was that Hester had slept with Malcom's wife Dorothy and that the baby she was carrying did not come from her husband.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid 600 dollars to free Malcom from prison, according to the FBI.
He was accompanied to prison by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
But when they got away from prison and approached Moore's Ford Bridge, a Lynchmob surrounded the car.
"As it turns out, it was Harrison who prepared and arranged the murders," concludes an FBI report.
"It is also obvious that there was a plot between the state and local prosecution, which was not only involved in the murders, removed evidence and covered the identity of witnesses."
Brooks puts it even more embossing.
"It was a right-wing massager," he said.
"They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community: "If you can register and if you vote, this will happen to you."
For almost a decade Cassandra Greene led the annual replica of the Moore Ford Bridge Lynch murder.
Their representation is illustrative, poignant and is based in a kind of deep racism, many of which would like to believe that he no longer exists in America.
It's hard to look at, and even more difficult to look away, but Greene said that's the point.
"We don't want to talk about the lynch, because we're then confronted with its insanity in all of us," she said.
"But I can't build a relationship with you if you don't want to listen to me or don't want to hear what I've been through."
The samples for this year's production began in June, and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen whites and the rest of the blacks - rushed into a room and sounded as Greene started a well-played overview of the piece.
Wade Marbaugh is here Greenes co-director.
He's been playing the role of chief clan member for years, but he said the role will never be easier.
"I feel dirty because I'm not like that," Marbaugh said.
"But I think it's very important to keep this story alive because we don't want to return to these times."
On the other side of the room, actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, tried their lines.
The play begins with Malcom, who screams at Hester and oppresses him, angry that he slept with his wife Dorothy.
"I said, n--he, get out of my property!"
Rascona returns the fire.
There's a break.
And then everyone (at least all black actors) will laugh.
Greene laughs the loudest.
"What?!" asked Rascona.
He's alarmed and confused.
Was I too hard?
"No," said Greene, still giggling.
"I just don't think that white people back then said a--he's."
"But", one of the other black performers swirled.
"You just have to meet the hard 'R.'."
And right there the energy shifts in space, a feeling of camaraderie replaces the discomfort.
Everyone is busy getting this right, not only because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four killed people.
The scene starts again.
This time, when Rascona says the N word, he says it sharply and emphatically.
Absolutely nobody laughs.
This repetition ends violently and quickly.
There are cries, shots, and then silence.
A woman, dressed in a mourning dress, stands over the actors' bodies and performs Billie Holidays' mourning praise "Strange Fruit".
Her voice breaks every second word.
About a hundred meters behind it, a group of about four dozen viewers wipes out sweat and tears.
The audience is almost evenly divided between black and white.
A couple have arrived from Ithaca, New York, to see the performance, many just come down the road.
They have experienced all Georgia's pressing moisture for almost eight hours when Brooks takes her on a pilgrimage to the tombs of the Malcoms and Dorseys.
Until this point, the murders have remained an anecdote, but now, standing on the same country where the Lynch murders took place, the air feels spooky.
When the last notes of the song go off, Greene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the body name.
Children raise their heads, register the fake blood and the silent bodies and whisper to each other.
"They're not really dead," murmurs a little boy, as if he wanted to remember it.
After a few minutes, greene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it's over.
The actors throw away the lynch rope and wipe off their tears.
Bradshaw embraces Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the clan member.
Nick Rascona embraces two of his fellow players and then breaks down in their arms crying, the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks through with him.
"It's okay," one of the women whispers.
"We know that this is not in your heart.
You did that for a reason."
Later, the audience joins with the actors for dinner.
At a table a white couple from Atlanta chats excitedly about the supplement with a black couple they have just met.
Denise Duplinski struggled to find words that left the feeling of performance.
"It's hard to hear these terrible words and deeds... coming from people who look like you and who do that because they look like you," she said.
"What this really does with me makes me believe that the Lynchen is still going on," she added, "now it's just called police shooting."
In the same room Tyrone Brook's court holds at his table, he eats and reminds of the civil rights.
He said he'd already started planning the performance next year.
"The imitation is in some way inspiring, because it describes the horror of what we have endured, but it is also a moment of learning," he said.
"It's so if we don't learn from it, it can happen again.
Whoever does not study his own story, who does not know his own story, is condemned to repeat it."
The Wagnerians in Bayreuth reconciled "Götterdämmerung"
In the fourth part of Richard Wagner's monumental work, director Frank Castorf also puts on a colorful-frivolous production in front of gigantic six-storey scenes.
The swivel stage (designed by Aleksandar Denic) also shows a shabby street corner with the Berlin Wall and Dönerbude, a "plaste and elaste" logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange.
Before that, an open Mercedes-oldtimer parked in which the Rhine daughters pose as Rockergirls, or alternatively an Isetta.
Stacked oil barrels remind of Castorf's leitmotiv - money, power and greed - which is drawn by its "ring" production.
The three Rhine daughters - sung by Stephanie Houtzeel, Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - harmonize as already in the "Rheingold".
Kess seduces them Siegfried (Stefan Vinke), tear a body into the trunk in Hollywood manner and give the Krawallo clique.
Stephen Milling sings the gorgeously dirty Hagen that surrounds the aura of a heavyweight boxer.
Brutal's scene when he beats Siegfried.
Later Gunther (Markus Oak) also has to believe in it.
The audience thanked the ensemble with a strong applause.
Foster, Milling, Vinke and conductor Janowski, who modestly bows his hands to the Merkel-Raute, are being celebrated.
There is a great coincidence for the Festival Orchestra, which shows itself on stage for the first time - in view of the great heat again in army leisure clothing.
The performance of Frank Castorf and his director team was eagerly expected.
When he had a valid pipe concert to perform in 2013, five years later there was a great jubilation in which the individual "buh" ransacked.
Festival director Katharina Wagner should have been happy about this.
"It is noted that the audience has grown up in a certain way with the "ring"", she said shortly before the performance of the dpa.
Not only had the audience made a form of peace with Castorf, but it had also become an understanding of his view.
I draw a positive summary.
Max Quantum works as a volunteer
They work in several places in their volunteer year.
Where's it going?
Quantity: Usually in Steinfurt in the furniture market, once a week I helped out here in Greven in the furniture bridge.
And I worked at school in the open all day.
How are your experiences with it?
Quantity: It is a beautiful, broad spectrum that I see here.
I have to deal with different people, young people, refugees, young adults.
You're now 26 years old, so you're a latetime volunteer.
How's that coming?
Quantity: I made Abitur.
And then a civil engineering study, let's say, successfully cancelled.
I realized for myself that it's the wrong thing for me and I want to do something else to work with people.
And then I asked myself, what are you doing?
Make a social year, there is an insight, there you can see how it is on the spot, in the focus maybe also, really.
And was it that way?
Quantity: I have collected great impressions.
I will start my studies in the social sector in the winter semester.
I'm going to study dual, I'm likely to do a social worker training at the Youth Office in Herne and study in Hamm at the University of Applied Sciences.
Is it not something unusual to have several different places of employment during volunteer service?
Quantity: Yes, it is very variable.
It always depends on where you make your FSJ.
It can be done from old age to youth work - in all possible facets of social work.
It was very varied with me.
I was also part of the OGS, so in the afternoon care.
For me, that was exactly the right thing that irritated me.
I could see my own strengths and see how it really goes.
Unlike in the civil engineering study?
Quantity: Well, this isn't about calculating statics.
You always have other people in your head, each having a completely different story.
Whether a refugee, or a youth who has been taken out of the family, you always have to deal with it individually.
Very interesting.
And you didn't have any fear of contact?
Quantity: I'm not the guy for that.
It's an area that gives you a lot.
A lot of love, a lot of kindness.
There are also negative moments, but that's how life is.
Pearson shortens further 3,000 jobs and shortens dividends to revive the business
The British education group Pearson said on Friday that it will reduce further 3,000 jobs and reduce its interim dividends by 72 percent, as another restructuring programme will be launched to overcome the pressure the company faces.
In addition to his previous restructuring, which had already lost 4,000 posts, the job reduction, which was announced mainly for the end of 2018 and early 2019, was announced by the Director-General John Fallon.
In May, Pearson announced a plan to reduce costs by a further 300 million pounds (394 million US dollars) in a third cost reduction programme to revive a business that was taken by the fast step towards digital learning.
The company, which had sold its stake in Penguin Random House to the partner Bertelsmann last month, said that the outlook for the financial year was unchanged after it had achieved an increase of 1 percent to 2.05 billion pounds in the first half of the year.
Kabul convoy attack: killed Nato-Soldat in suicide attack
A suicide culprit attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital Kabul, killed a NATO soldier and injured several others, say officials.
Five soldiers and one interpreter had been injured, told a declaration of the Nato.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians died during the incident in the Qarabagh district.
Bombarding is the last act of violence that Afghanistan hit this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Herat.
On Monday, a suicide culprit killed two people near the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul.
In a Nato opinion, the explosion had taken place on Thursday evening when a common patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by a "improvised force carried by persons".
The statement states that all the injured are in a stable state and are treated in the U.S. military hospital on the Bagram airfield.
Correspondents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so-called Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby bagram.
According to the United Nations, there were at least 1.662 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, of which about 20% were killed in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shiite district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they had carried out this attack.
On 31 May, a massive bombing in the city centre killed more than 150 people with the most deadly military attack of the country, since the US-led troops forced the Taliban from power in 2001.
Violence underlines the precarious security situation in Afghanistan, as US President Donald Trump is considering increasing the number of US troops supporting the military and police forces in the country.
Correspondents say that in the last few weeks, suicides in Kabul have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government, their policies, and especially in the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
EPO reverses decision to delay the Smog rule after appeals
The U.S. Environmental Protection Authority has cancelled a decision to delay the government of Obama’s regulation, which requires States to limit Smog-induced emissions. This took place one day after 15 states sued the Agency for the step.
Late on Wednesday, the EPO announced the decision to advance the so-called "Ozone regulations 2015", and said it was showing the Agency's commitment to cooperate with States.
"We believe in the dialogue with and that we are responding to our state partners," said EPA CEO Scott Pruitt in a statement.
In June, Pruitt announced the intention of the EPO to measure the ozone regulations - which are to be measured in a part of the country in order to determine where cuts must be made to comply with stricter air quality standards - in order to delay one year until October 2018.
A group of 15 mostly democratic states, together with the district of Colombia, filed a complaint on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal.
The government of President Donald Trump has tried to reverse a wide range of environmental impacts imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda to stimulate economic growth, according to Trump.
The efforts have, however, triggered the setback of democrats and nature groups who are concerned about the impact of increased emissions on public health.
The EPO website says that breathing air that contains ozone can "reduce lung function and enhance breathing symptoms" such as asthma.
Community Council
In the end, the decision was clear: with two votes against, the Council of Fluorn-Winzeln decides to set up a Community space in the future pension scheme.
Before the discussion there is an important information: The purchase contract for the still missing property part was signed, Mayor Bernhard Tjaden reports.
Although it will still take time for the area to be owned by the church, there is now no longer any obstacles to planning for the project to be voted on by a private investor.
For this there is a discussion of a Community area.
One of the two investors, who are still in the boat, has offered to meet the community.
On the ground floor it would provide a living space - about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with 70 square meters of area for a special price.
The administration and the majority of the municipal councils are in favour of providing such a common area not as a meeting place only for the residents of the senior residence but openly into the community.
As an example, the word "Strickcafé" made the round.
The decision, which was decided by the provision of resources for the current budget in the past autumn, was supported by funding.
The building is located in the renovation area.
The establishment of a Community space, Tjaden reports, would be capable of funding 60 percent of 30 percent.
The decision-making proposal is designed to signal to the investor that in this respect it is not wanted to throw a bump between the legs, the finding that both saddles - which are due to environmental cultivation - and pult roof - would be possible to reduce the amount of grape and make construction economically.
Needless, not only does Wilfried Sohmer mean that addition.
If it's helpful, he's going to pass the panel unanimously.
It's not that simple with the Community area.
Daniela Ruf refers to the many own buildings with which you don't move so well, and now you lean out of the window at the common room, she says, "I'm doing me hard with it."
Yvonne Staiger is absolutely in favour of the Community area - but absolutely against a municipal participation.
It sees behind it a hidden subsidy to any wealth or even foreign investors.
This is not the case, for the acquisition of the area does not give a grant, but instead obtains a real equivalent, in case of doubt, that is to say, a counter-reason.
There are three supporters of the proposal for a decision that is to be split up accordingly.
So it remains with two votes in the original program that Stefan Haller summarizes: "If we make the decision in this way, we are taking a big step to close a huge gap in our infrastructure."
Collision by car: Cycling is thrown on the road
When crossing the road, an 82-year-old cyclist was captured by a car on Wednesday in Garath and severely injured.
As the police told us, the 82-year-old Langenfelder had been on his bike on the road black road coming from Hilden.
The senior wanted to cross the road at the height of the road Am Buchholzer Busch.
A passenger driver in the same direction gave priority to him.
When the Langenfelder went to the street, he apparently did not pay attention to the traffic on the road.
He met with a car that controlled a 66-year-old Hildenine.
The man was thrown to the street.
He suffered serious injuries and was taken to a hospital with a Retugnswagen.
FC Bayern München has to give up on the Supercup against Borussia Dortmund on David Albaba and Thiago
The Supercup takes place without him: David Albaba has to let the game suffocate against Dortmund.
FC Bayern travels to Dortmund for the first time in the new season.
Seven pros are missing the champion in the Supercup against the cup winner.
Personal care at the German football record champion Bayern München is getting bigger and bigger before the supercup on Saturday (20.30 a.m./ZDF and Eurosport) at the cup winner Borussia Dortmund.
Trainer Carlo Ancelotti must also give up on David Alaba in duel with the BVB.
That confirmed the Italians on Friday.
In addition, the Munich-based Manuel Neuer, James, Thiago, Jerome Boateng, Arjen Robben and Juan Bernat are missing.
For the five defeats in the past six test games, Ancelotti has made the physical state and the lack of balance in the game of his team.
"We know we're not in the best physical condition," said Ancelotti, adding, "the most important point is the balance in the team.
She wasn't good last."
The 58-year-old, however, believes in an increase in performance in the first official duty game of the season.
"Football is also tactic, strategy, personality and motivation.
I have great faith that my team shows these qualities.
The team's ready.
We want to play intelligently," said Ancelotti, who expects a "sudden, intense game".
The duel of the two German football weights captivates the fans.
The game was sold out with 81.360 spectators, the German Football League (DFL) announced on Friday.
Walk in the resin from star to star
The first "star path" is to be created in the resin.
This is planned by the club Observatory Sankt Andreasberg.
There is a planetary route in Göttingen - since 2003.
A "star trail" meets the information needs of many visitors to resin, it was said.
He connected nature, science, movement and sports performance.
The members want to place tables along the planned route and then inform them about stars and constellations.
In a first phase until 2018, the association plans "goodly accessible installations at five to six locations" in the upper resin.
Inquiries come St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, Hohegeiß and Sieber.
The information on the tables is to be supplemented via the Internet.
Therefore, a good mobile network reception plays a role in the selection of locations.
Accessibility is also a criterion.
Later, the Star Trail train will be extended by train.
"On the Star's Path, the viewers learn a lot of interesting knowledge, for example about the physics of the individual stars," the association explained.
In addition, they learned why stars have different colors or why a star shines more brightly than another, although it lies far farther away.
It also averages in which constellation a selected star is located and when it is best to be seen.
Since 2014, the association has been operating in the mountain town of St. Andreasberg, the highest Observatory in North Germany.
The site in the heart of the Harz National Park is one of the six darkest regions in Germany, according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation.
Often from there, the Milky Way and even the Andromeda galaxy with the naked eye are clearly visible.
There has been something similar in the university city since 2003 on the initiative of the funding association Planetarium Göttingen, like the planned Starwalk - the planetary path.
Starting in front of Gebhard's hotel in the Goetheallee, which forms the interior of our solar system, the planetary path leads up to the Hainberg and the Observatory - as well as an "extraterrestrial" location in Diemarden (commonly equal) with the planet Sedna.
The stems with the individual planets - including the Pluto at the end of the dwarf planet - are exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion.
The earth shrinks to a sphere of 6.5 millimeters in diameter, while the sun, which is exactly 75 meters away, measures 70 centimetres.
The entire distance of the planetary path is about four kilometers.
While the light needs about eight hours from sun to pluto, pedestrians need a good hour to stela with pluto.
So pedestrians are faster than the light in space.
The march to the next fixed star, however, would take half a year.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lo makeenko meet for the first time, discuss a possible showdown
Vasyl Lomaekko and Mikey Garcia, who should be in a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing battle in the near future, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms in ESPN offices in Los Angeles, to Garcia, the unbeated World Boxing Council lightweight champion, going down the corridor to welcome Lomaenko, the World Boxing Organization Super-Federweight Champion.
After Garcia's victory by unanimous decision of the former four-division world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday on showtime, both fighters are members of the top five Pound-for-pound list.
Garcia stretched out his right hand and said, "How are you, Champion?
I wish you good luck."
Lomaenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday evening at 7 p.m. on ESPN.
When the couple posing for photos, Lomaekko-Manager Egi's climate noted that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the "perfect magnitude".
"I'm a former spring weight," said Garcia.
"I have risen to 140 pounds for Broner, but I'm not that big.
I'm small for 140.
I want to get down to lightweight.
And he has to move on lightweight [135 pounds] and then we fight.
That's what the fans demand.
Let's give them this."
Lomaenko agreed.
"Boxes need this fight."
Climates asked if it should be on pay-per-view, part of a strategy that Lomaeko must fight with a 135-pound debut this year to agree with Garcia next summer (37-0, 30 knockouts) who also has an interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell after their lightweight title fight in the forum on 23 September.
"This fight could take place in Pay-per-View mode, because all fans asked about it," said Garcia and later expressed an open attitude to the network that offers the best financial package.
We're the best.
No other names can create this kind of attention.
Whenever they are ready ..."
Garcia said he valued Lomaenko as "an enormous fighter", and he might be taking part in his Saturday fight.
But Lomakenko stopped with the generous praise for Garcia and said that he thought he was seeing the Trifle Champion from Riverside"very slow, I'm sorry Mikey... you wanted to go out".
Garcia said the focus is to show impact strength, then boxing.
Both said that they could feel the momentum that built up for their own struggle.
"This is the fight that needs to be carried out.
No other battle creates so much attention and enthusiasm.
I am more than happy to work on it," said Garcia.
Lomaenko said, "I've been waiting for the top fighters, and that's Mikey.
It will be a great fight."
Four injured after tyre-placer
In the event of an accident on the A7, four people were partially injured on Thursday afternoon.
According to the first information, the driver of an Opel Zafira probably lost control of his vehicle at 4.30 a.m. just before the connection point, after a tire-placer.
The car sluggished to the right into the bush, where it passed over and then remained on the roof in the green strip.
The four inmates - two adults and two children - were partially severely injured in the accident.
During the first care of the injured by the rescue service, the A7 was locked to the north for about one hour, then the traffic could be passed on the left lane at the accident site.
Fortunas Hoffmann: "Trier chain works better"
Andre Hoffmann hopes, after the 2:2 season, that the optimization of the defense formation in Aue will bring points.
With the first season, Andre Hoffmann was satisfied, with the result also, there would not have been the two countergates at 2:2 against Braunschweig.
"That was two countergates too much, and we have to be more careful in Aue," says Fortuna Düsseldorf's defense player.
In the Erzgebirge, the trier chain is also to be further optimised.
And there's no way a gate after a free ride will catch the ammo either.
"For the future, it will be so that no one will be on the line next to Michael (Rensing)."
Hoffmann is convinced that his team will be better prepared with the trier chain than with the Vier chain after the experience.
"But I don't know how we're going to act in Aue," says his coach Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure about his business, "because we're currently in the trine chain on the half positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann players who can build well," said Hoffmann.
"The requirement is, but we are even more harmonious and we don't make so many mistakes in the design."
Of course Hoffmann also drives to Aue to win the game.
"But whether you can speak of a wrong start after a decision, does not know.
The performance could be quite okay," said Hoffmann.
"If we can stand there on Sunday with four points and concentrate on the cup, we will certainly be able to talk about a regular season start."
His coach didn't want to know about that.
"I only judge the start of the season after six to eight days," said Friedhelm Funkel, who does not want to speak of an advantage to Aue, just because the game of Saxony in Heidenheim had to be stopped early because of a storm.
"Now they can almost start the season with a home game," said Funkel and Hoffmann, believing that the players from Aue might even be a bit fresher, as they would not have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against a favourite in the bones.
"But they don't know as much as 100 percent where they currently stand," says the fortuna's defenseman.
While guests from the Rhineland as a lighter favorite on Sunday go to the meeting in the finally (almost) finished stadium of Aue.
"The fact that we sweep them away just because we have the claim to be among the first six is stupid," says Funkel, whose balance with only one defeat against aue from nine games is quite positive.
"There is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga that you have to beat from the beginning," explains Fortuna's chief coach.
"To make such a statement would be arrogant and overwhelming."
And so Funkel doesn't want to experience his players on Sunday.
New results of Swedish asylum age evaluation tests published
The latest results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden, which have been subjected to a new method of medical evaluation of their age, show that more than 80 percent of the persons tested are over 18 years of age, but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish Forensic Medicine Authority (Rättsmedicinalverket) started carrying out the tests last year.
They should make the assessment of age more precise during the asylum procedure after the Swedish Migration Authority (Migrationsverket) has been criticised for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were minors.
To date, Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 cases to be tested and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March until 31 July 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were evaluated as 18 or older, while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was "perhaps 18 years of age".
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person "may be under 18 years old".
The tests shall be carried out only in cases where the age of the person is called into question.
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results have been stable over the past few months.
"We don't see any big difference in statistics in recent months, the figures are quite constant," he said.
The high proportion of cases in which the person was judged to be over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the applicant lied about his age.
In May, the Agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there are 442 cases that "propose that the examined person is 18 years of age or older".
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 published results, she found that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that he was 18 years old.
The method of medical age assessment, in which X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI recordings of knee joints are made, which are then analysed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticised in some areas.
A skeptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose work includes the assessment of the biological maturity of humans to see if they went through puberty sooner or later than usual.
"I had reason to think about it, and I don't think the type of measurement should be used.
An assessment of biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't say it for sure, we shouldn't pretend we could do it," he said to Metro.
Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, however, defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, you can say that the risk of a child being unjust as an adult is low.
The greatest risk is if the person is just under 18, in this case about 10 percent."
Full on the plan
Work on the three bridges of the Landstraße 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is progressing well.
On Wednesday a seven-ton concrete part on the bridge was installed at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach.
"We're very good at the time, it's gonna be great," says Reinhold Leicht, construction manager at the Department of Roads and Transport in Freiburg.
In April, work started at the same time on all three bridges in need between Schramberg and Lauterbach.
The building end is scheduled for October and it is easy to ensure that the schedule is observed.
The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads over the Trombach.
It is a concrete arch bridge covered with red coloured sandstone and has a total length of 4.80 meters.
It was built in 1900.
Like the other two bridges, it has now come into the years.
In order to ensure stability and road safety, the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated.
The other two bridges lead over Lauterbach.
They are made of red coloured sandstone.
Both were built in 1939 and are twelve, or 10.60 meters long.
The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach has now received a 1.30 m wide and seven tons heavy bridge cap on the north side on Wednesday morning.
This is an edge fixture that is also used as an operating path.
In the southern part of the bridge a 2.20 m wide bridge cap is to be used on Friday.
That's where the pedestrian path is supposed to go.
The particular thing about it is that it is finished parts, a patent from the Schramberger company Dizwo.
The other two bridges are already covered with the patented bridge caps.
Special sense of fingertips has required the laying of lines through the building in Lauterbach.
Because there is also a fiber optic cable connected to many companies.
Inhabitants were informed about the project in the run-up to the work.
In addition, fish and crabs first had to be fished.
For the bridges between the Bauhof building and the collector in the direction of Schramberg, the traffic is governed by a traffic traffic lights.
For the construction work on the bridge at Lauterbacher village entrance, the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels "Tannnenhof" and "Seven Linden" is fully locked.
The cost of the three bridge renovations is €700 000.
The whole thing is financed by the country.
AfD in Gerolstein: Bunter Protest at German potato salad
It is not so common for parties to pull at a stroke, but when it comes to the alternative for Germany (AfD) it comes together, which is difficult to put into a hat.
The parties (CDU, SPD, Grüne, FDP, FWG, Linke) represented in the Kreistag are part of a broad alliance that shows peaceful flag on that day, because the AfD in the Gerolsteiner Stadthalle Rondell invites the according to poster "great election campaign".
And well-known names at the start – like Alice Weidel, who together with Alexander Gauland forms the top duo for the Bundestag election on 24 September, and Deputy Federal President Beatrix of Storch.
But those who are on site already hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the AfD-ler, but to demonstrate.
The motto "The Eifel remains colorful".
Originally, the city picnic was planned under the motto "All at a table" on the Brunnenplatz, but now takes place at the parking lot below the Rondell - and thus directly before those who come to the AfD event in the Stadthalle.
A colorful picture that's there.
And what Christa Karoli, chairman of the Forums A world and one of the leading organizers, is really happy: "Toll, how many people have come together here."
There is music and a lot of food, including a "ur German potato salad that the AfD could eat easily," says the woman who brought him.
The police ordered many officers to Gerolstein, it shows presence, especially at the train station, which is just a few meters away from the venues.
How did the AfD actually get to Gerolstein?
Mario Hompes reports from the AfD Vulcan Eifel that he had tried to do such an event and got the supplement.
The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf had initially asked in Daun, but there was a rejection because because of the already built Laurentius Kirmes there are not enough parking spaces available.
So now the Rondell, Hompes is pleased that "we can have such a beautiful event here".
Looking at the event on the Rondell front square, he says, "That's the good right of the people, the main thing, it remains peaceful".
This also does: At around 20 o'clock on the Rondell Vorplatz, a band provides entertainment, in the Stadthalle various speakers, including the Rhineland-Pälzische AfD-Chairman Uwe Junge.
In the hall there are about 200 listeners waiting for the top candidate for the Bundestag election, Alice Weidel, and the deputy president Beatrix von Storch to give her speeches.
The police presence is unchanged, but so far the officials had a quiet evening.
The AfD event takes a little more than an hour, the guests on the frontyard have a longer breath, but also there is a cleaning up shortly after 21:00.
The police can stop - no special incidents.
Trombone Hits Trumpet
A re-hearsing with Wolfacher Posaunist Frederic Belli is in the series of Haslacher monastery concerts tomorrow, Sunday, at 8 p.m. in the monastery church.
Together with the Bulgarian trumpeter Miroslav Petkov he gives a concert under the motto "Black Sea meets Black Forest", or also "Balkanfolklore" meets a classic German education with roots in brass music.
Both soloists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have solo positions in European top orchestras.
Petkov is a solo trumpeter at the renowned Concertgebouw Orchestra Amsterdam and Frederic Belli is a solo-posaunist of the SWR Symphony Orchestra.
Both combine the desire not only to cross the boundaries on their instruments, but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres.
This is how Johann Sebastian Bach sounds with the two as well as in a new robe, Daniel Schnyders' "world music" combines with Bulgarian folklore, and in the piece "Exchange Suite" of Jazzecho award winner Nils Wogram, classical music, jazz and free playing combine into a fascinating overall work of art.
This central part of the program was first performed this spring with huge success in Freiburg.
The renowned composer Nils Wogram wrote it specifically for the two musicians and more: The Haslacher monastery church with its special acoustics is consciously included in the concert.
Kristen Stewart talks about her bisexuality
"Some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their life.
But I want to try it all out," says Kristen Stewart quite openly about their bisexuality.
"When I bite in grilled cheese, I think, 'Oh, that was cool, what's next?'
The Hollywood star's best-known relationship was Robert Pattinson's "Twilight" collide, which eventually broke up bitterly.
Despite all, the brunette actress assures the "Harper's Bazaar" magazine: "I was in love with everyone I dated.
Or do you think I played it?"
After her separation, Kristen admitted that she was bisexual: "I have always lived and seriously believed in dualism.
So it's never confused or hindered me.
I just never liked to be taken seriously."
According to "Bang Showbiz", she suffered especially below but in school when she preferred to dress like a Bub: "Not all girls are typical girls.
That really hurt me.
When I was eleven, the kids told me I'd look like a Bub.
I really felt attacked, scared and ashamed.
Now I look back and think to myself, 'Mother, be proud of you!'
Especially to the public, she does not like to explain her love life: "People expect you to behave in a certain way, and this annoys me.
And maybe some call me ungrateful, but I don't like to have to justify myself before the general public."
The governor of West Virginia announces that he will change the party
. The democratic governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced on Thursday evening at a rally with President Trump that he would change the party.
Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have removed themselves from me," said Governor Justice.
"Today I will tell you with many prayers and lots of thought ... today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia, I can no longer help you if I am a democratic governor."
The rally broke out in jubilation.
"Tomorrow I will change my registration to the Republicans," added Justice.
"As a coach, I would say it's time to play another game."
Mr. Trump previously promised a big announcement at the West Virginia rally.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia with 42 points, and Justice did not approve of the democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, which is the only billionaire in the state according to Forbes, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states and inherited a coal business from his father.
It's worth about $1.59 billion.
In the meantime, the Republican National Committee made a statement on Thursday evening in which it said: "The change of the party of Governor Justice is another blow for a Democratic party that would hinder us rather than work to make our country great again."
"With only 15 governorates and the control of the least-legislative bodies in history, the announcement of Governor Justice is only the last rejection of a party that is from top to bottom without leadership and is unable to find a positive, unifying message," said RNC chairman Ronna McDaniel in a statement the CBS News.
Coe praises "honorly" Russian excuse for doping scandal
On Thursday, the world's head of athletics, Sebastian Coe, praised what he described as a clear excuse from Russia to a doping scandal, but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be taken back into the sport.
Russia's athletic chief Dmitry Shylakhtin said during the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World Championships for athletics that his country's ban on sports was correct and that he was determined to fight the doping.
He said he was sorry for "all athletes who were taken away in competitions gold and silver medals".
Despite its comments, the IAAF Congress voted to maintain the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report from the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) had found evidence of state-funded doping in Russia.
"I thought it was a very open answer today, a very honest presentation," said IAAF President Coe to the reporters.
"The entire Council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognized itself that it has experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is redesigned."
Coe said that he was also "joyed" that Russia accepted the criteria for its reintroduction.
"I think it was a very constructive day, and I think progress has been made, but the Congress supports the Task Force's recommendations that this is not the time to re-establish Russia," said Coe.
"We must do everything we can in the coming months to normalize this situation.
The guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate clean athletes from the corrupt system," he added
Nineteen Russian athletes will compete as neutral players at the World Championships for athletics, which will begin on Friday in London, following the strict IAAF criteria.
The head of the IAAF Task Force, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia still had to meet some of the criteria for re-establishment.
Drug tests are still inadequate and banned trainers are still free to work, he told reporters in London after a lecture at the IAAF Council.
Sading Act for Soldiers Crashed in Mali
At a funeral in Fritzlar in northern Hesse, about 1,000 people of the two killed during a helicopter crash in Mali.
The ceremony took place on Thursday in the Domstadt under high security arrangements.
To the still unexplained crash cause, Defense Minister Ursula of the Leyen (CDU) said nothing.
She described the two killed pilots as "Konners of their profession".
"We bow ourselves to this highest sacrifice they have made on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany," she said.
The 33-year-old Major and 47-year-old North Hesse staff captain died on Wednesday a week ago in the West African Mali.
Their coffins were transferred to Germany and taken on Thursday by a guard of the Bundeswehr to Fritzlar Dom St. Peter.
At noon, only the members of the church took part.
After that, the funeral began in the circle of the family, close friends, representatives of the Bundeswehr and politics.
Among them were Hesse's Prime Minister Volker Bouffier (CDU) and the General Inspector of the Bundeswehr Volker Wieker.
Mourning guests laid roses, the members of the family stood arm in arm on the coffins.
In front of the church, Fritzlars and numerous soldiers persecuted the ceremony on a canvas.
Minister of Defense of the Leyen called the killed soldiers "highly decorated" and made use of them.
The Chief of Staff had built up the flight operation of Tiger combat helicopter in Fritzlar and had been one of the first six trained Tiger pilots of his regiment.
Volker Bauersachs, commander of the regiment, to whom the soldiers belong, also said: "If this crew could not turn away from the crash, then no one would have liked it."
Doubts about the UN mission in Mali did not show the Minister of the Leyen: the operation is dangerous.
But he was also of great importance "for a country from which we are only separated by two states," she said.
After the funeral, the coffins were brought out of the cathedral.
When and where they are buried, the Bundeswehr did not provide any information.
Prince Henrik doesn't want a grave next to his wife
The man of the Danish queen Margrethe (77), Prince Henrik (83), does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death.
This was reported by the royal house on Thursday.
Traditionally, the Danish royal couple are buried in the church of Roskilde.
The sculptor Bjørn Nørgaard already produced a sarcophagus for the two.
The Queen agreed with her husband's decision, continued in the communication.
Where Prince Henrik will be buried, be unclear.
But he does not intend to be buried in his French homeland.
Prince Henrik had never made a hail out that he was not happy with his title.
After the enthronement of his wife Margrethe in 1972, he would have liked to become king.
In 2016, he retired and also made the title "prinzgemahl".
Since Henrik in Denmark did not get the title and function he wanted, he did not see himself as equivalent to his wife - neither after death, explained Lene Balleby, the chief speaker of the Danish royal house.
Where the last retirement of the 83-year-old will ultimately be is still unclear.
But he does not intend to be buried in his French homeland, but in Denmark.
He likes the country he's worked for over the last 50 years.
The native Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, son of a French noble family, met Margrethe in London in 1965.
He worked at the Thames in the French Embassy.
During his later wife, the people’s sympathys were always in contact with him, and Prince Henrik had a serious standing with the Danes in his almost 50 years of rule.
In an autobiography Henrik said over the first years in Denmark: "A few months after my arrival, everything I did was criticized.
My Danish was changing, I preferred wine instead of beer, silk stockings instead of knitted socks, Citroën instead of Volvo, tennis instead of football.
Even for the Gauloises, which I smoked instead of Virginia-Tabak and which in this country had the reputation to be the brand of social-critical intellectuals, I could not hope for for forbearance.
I was different.
I seemed to be satisfied with that position and not ashamed.
That was two mistakes!"
Prime Minister Weil wants quick new elections
CDU and FDP before possible majority in Lower Saxony
Lower Saxony's Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) is, after losing the red and green majority of government for a rapid re-election of the Landtag, however, he does not want to withdraw.
Because on Friday, I voted for the resolution of Parliament.
Previously, the surprising withdrawal of a Green Member from her country group in Lower Saxony, the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) had fallen into a severe crisis.
Five months before the official date of the Landtag election, the red-green coalition in Hanover lost its narrow one-voice majority in parliament to the opposition from CDU and FDP.
The former Green Deputies Elke Twesten justified their step with the non-nomination for the 2018 election in their constituency in Rotenburg (Wümme).
"I see my political future in the CDU," she said on Friday in Hanover.
Mr Björn Thümler wants to recommend his group to include them.
Thus, CDU and FDP together had 69 seats in Lower Saxony, SPD and Green 68 seats.
So far, the ratio has been reversed.
The new Landtag will be elected regularly on 14 January next year.
Thomler said that the red and green state government now had to decide whether it could continue to rule without a majority in this situation.
Stephan Weil, however, considers it essential that the country day decides its own resolution as quickly as possible.
The CDU Group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday.
The Constitution also provides for the possibility that the Landtag will withdraw the confidence of the Prime Minister and choose a successor.
"Our Constitution offers several options.
These options need to be checked legally clean," said Thimler.
"You will discuss all questions in peace if they have been legally duly examined."
Thomler called Twesten's step "but a little curious".
The politician himself stressed: "I am not a traitor.
I feel very good".
She referred to herself as a supporter of Black Green.
The Greens asked the retired MEPs to return their country mandate.
"We assume, of course, that it will return its Landtags Mandate, which it has received through the Green List of Lands, with immediate effect," said the presidents Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner.
The Group president of the Green Anja Piel said: "We regret the decision of Every Twesten Extraordinary."
You have deliberately decided not to have a debate in the group.
"Even against the background that there were no differences in content, we cannot understand this step."
SPD Chancellor Martin Schulz condemns the transfer of Lower Saxony Green Deputies Elke Twesten to CDU as betrayal.
"The behaviour of former Green Members in Lower Saxony is not only betrayal to voters, but also betrayal to Red Green," wrote the Federal Minister of Social Democrats on Facebook on Friday.
He supports the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) to have the country day quickly re-elected.
The exit of Twestens costs Red Green in Lower Saxony the majority.
The politician "in her hurt vanity and in her frustration her personal interests for the well-being of the country", criticised General Secretary Hubertus Heil.
"It is a scandal that the CDU in Lower Saxony is involved in this dirty intrigue and is trying to strike political capital from it."
Lower Saxony's head of the CDU Group Björn Thümler wants to recommend to his deputy to include every Twesten in the CDU.
The leader of the SPD in the Bundestag, Thomas Oppermann, accused Twesten of falsifying the results of the 2013 Landtag election with personal career thinking.
The CDU was then strongest in front of the SPD, but SPD and Green had a thin majority of one voice in the country day.
Minister of Agriculture in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from poisons, Mr Schmidt?
Germany is discussing contaminated eggs.
How could the scandal happen?
How can consumers protect themselves.
Minister for Agriculture Christian Schmidt (CSU) is in the interview with the editorial network Deutschland (RND) .
Mr Schmidt, how can consumers protect themselves from poisoned eggs?
I can only encourage all consumers to view the eggs in your refrigerator carefully and to check the stamping pressure.
On the consumer protection portal www.foodwarnung.de, the federal states will submit the latest information on the egg levels concerned.
The eggs concerned should be destroyed or returned.
Even if, after everything we know at present, a health hazard is practically excluded.
Is Aldi now taking over the best possible crisis response - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the Enlightenment is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture?
Food monitoring is the task of the federal states.
Nevertheless, my house has immediately stopped and has been in close exchange with the authorities of the countries since Germany became aware of the problem.
All information and risk assessment are available to consumers.
Trade must, as well as manufacturers, ensure that the products sold are transportable and safe from health.
If the maximum residue levels of 0,005mg/kg are exceeded in eggs, they are not transportable.
However, unloaded eggs can be sold and consumed.
This time the businesses are not to blame.
Are production companies and consumers in the same boat?
According to the current state of knowledge, production plants are not in direct debt.
Rather, they have to expect economic damages from service companies due to alleged illegal practices.
As always, there are not very many controllers in the serious event.
Is there only a lack of staff or the final responsibility?
They were just the official controls that revealed the process.
The truth is, however, that food fraud and criminal energy can never be excluded by 100 percent.
This is precisely why a consistent awareness of such events and the transfer to the public prosecutors in cases where criminal offences may occur is of crucial importance.
I have already made it clear several times that I expect the responsible authorities to have complete information.
Is regular alarming in food scandals really necessary?
Consumers have the right to obtain only safe and transportable foods.
When an unauthorised insecticide is used in the food industry, consumers are rightly outraged.
Thanks to the budget, manufacturers, dealers and consumers are in a situation that is absolutely not necessary.
In principle, it must be clear: the unlawful use of the insecticide Fipronil in the holding of food-producing animals is not acceptable and must be terminated immediately.
This must be consistently and with high pressure at all levels.
I expect all the competent authorities to be informed quickly and without delay.
How the financial rules of football affect Neymar's move to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unhindered spending by European football clubs will not disturb Neymar's world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to French Paris Saint Germain.
Some of the consequences will still come for Paris Saint-Germain from UEFA, because the leading organization that oversees the European game has the power to ban teams from accessing the prestigious Champions League tournament.
Financial fair play rules launched by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG has to prove at some point that Neymar's transfer was financed without major losses.
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to buy out Brazilians from its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to several ten million dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.
PSG can certainly loosen the money to sign Neymar and bring him to a galaxy of other stars, given the financing of the team by the energy-rich ruling family of Qatar.
Clubs may spend a lot of money on the acquisition of players, but have to fight with legitimate sources of revenue that allow them to break-even point in their football business.
The FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA President in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs that had taken huge debts in their quest for success effectively cheated and risked ruining themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, FFP moved from concentration to the debt of the clubs to monitoring their losses.
The change meant that the business model originally used by Roman Abramovich in Chelsea in 2003 - a club with potential bought and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - should become a harder matter.
During the current three-year FFP exposure period, which runs until 2018, clubs can lose 30 million euros.
And although Platini fell from the Presidency in 2015 into disrepute, his UEFA successor Aleksander Cefinin continues to work to deter excessive spending.
"FFP is certainly not dead and we will certainly strengthen the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for FFP at UEFA, to The Associated Press last week.
Although the PSG has paid Neymar’s buy-out clause in a lump sum, it may distribute the amount for accounting for the duration of its contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract so that the balance can be reported in the annual accounts for the next five years of EUR 44.4 million.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 made the PSG, together with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the most severe sanctions.
The PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (at that time 82 million dollars), which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the team members for the 2014/15 Champions League remain limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players.
UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to overcome their financial supervision by bloating their revenue from companies connected with the owners of a club.
While a cataric company could sponsor PSG if the value of sponsoring exceeded the standard market rates, UEFA would not allow this to be considered legitimate income.
This is exactly what happened in 2014, when the UEFA decided that the value of the sponsoring of PSA was bloated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.
It has been reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come to Qatar about payments from the organization committee of the 2022 World Cup.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 have argued that Neymar will become ambassadors of the World Cup and that such a way of managing the UEFA regulatory authorities could be easily found out.
The current sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to any attempt to circumvent the rules.
UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG about Neymar's transfer, said the people who are familiar with the situation on Thursday.
They spoke with The Associated Press under the condition of anonymity, since they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.
The latest reports published show that PSG 2015/16 achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of 542.4 million euros.
The accounts for the last financial year still have to be published.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to be a blessing for sponsorship deals, merchandise and jersey sales.
The association expects sales to rise by at least 30 percent after the signature.
The Spanish league was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players going, and she tried to prevent Neymar's withdrawal by claiming that PSG would violate the FFP.
"It is a clear case of "financial doping" with the club and the state," said the President of the La League, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily AS regarding Qatar's ultimate ownership of PSG.
Arsenal Manager Arsene Wenger, whose association is owned by an American sports tycoon, shares the reservations of La Liga against a state that finances an association.
"It's the consequence of ownership and this has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years," said Wenger on Thursday.
"When a country has an association, everything is possible.
It will be very difficult to respect the financial fairplay, because you can go different ways or have different interests if a country has such a big player to represent a country."
Swiss is looking for a new schoggileverant
In recent years Chocolate Frey has produced on-board chocolate for Swiss.
Now the sweet cooperation is coming to a possible conclusion: the airline is rewriting the order.
Swiss spokesman Meike Fuhlrott confirmed a report by the newspaper "Nordwest Schweiz" of Friday on request from the news agency sda.
According to current planning, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.
Products would be checked every two to three years and subject to quality control.
"We are very satisfied with the current supplier Chocolate Frey," said the speaker.
About 17 million small red and white packed shoggi boards to 14 grams a year distribute the flight attendants to the passengers before landing.
The Swiss did not want to make any information about the costs.
Industry insiders estimate the order volume according to "Northern Switzerland" to CHF 1.5 to 2 million - the Migros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of around one billion francs.
But more important is the advertising effect: For a Schoggi manufacturer, it is a prestigious order.
The Swiss does not want to reveal how many candidates there are in the new call for proposals.
However, only Swiss manufacturers come into question.
According to the newspaper report, Chocolate Frey intends to try to renew the contract beyond spring 2018.
For the sda, the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for an opinion.
Since 2006 the Swiss has been distributing chocolates on board their flights.
Before the Swiss signed a contract with Migro's daughter, Barry Callebaut had supplied the chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hug.
Swiss introduced the possibility of placing the logo two and a half years ago with the launch of cooperation with Chocolate Frey.
The airline cooperates with various Swiss chocolate producers.
On long-distance flights, the customers of First Class are spoiled with treats from the Confisery Sprüngli, in the business class wet passengers Schoggi from Lindt and in the Economy Class Schoggi by Chocolate Frey.
Swiss Schoggi is also distributed on the short line by Chocolate Frey, both in business and in Economy Class.
athletics - Diskus-Olympiasier Robert Harting reaches World Cup finale
The three-time world champion is fighting for a medal on Saturday in the final.
His brother Christoph, Olympic winner of 2016, failed in the national World Cup award and could only look at the Discus competition from the gallery.
The Polish champion Piotr Malachowski, who threw 65.13 metres in length, also qualified for the final fight with the first attempt.
Nostalgia goes into the niches in "White Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective"
This repetition of history is nostalgic at the same time because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80s, for the 90s-green era (as the foreth-thinks David Wain and Michael Showalter turned the sketch comedy "The State" for MTV), and for themselves - that is, for 2001, before their stars, such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd, went to bigger things.
As a cultural artifact it is equally a parody and an embodiment of our Facebook-enabled era of permanent memories.
But as a franchise, it feels like time is scarce.
"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not only because of his absurd humor (it contained an original story for a talking can of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).
By turning to the core of the Gags - actors of the middle ages play horny children who will grow up - they still have the impossibility to win back the last part of the joke.
"Ten Years Later", with his adults playing adults now, is less emotionally rooted and his parody goes more according to the casting pot principle, including a reef on the stalker films of the 90's like "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle" ("The Hand That Rocks the Cradle").
At one point, a character appears through an Apple powerbook, some inline skates and "a number of other things from 1991".
Many of the central stories are the same.
The lovable Coop (Mr. Showalter), now Roman author, still has not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) has still not lost his virginity.
And there is another crazy-boss-like plot in which Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter) is involved, which is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a good impression by Michael Ian Black).
As always, the excursions are the best part of the franchise.
It is especially fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rudd who shows Matt Dillon's lower lipstick of "Singles", whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy now feels like an oldcracker.
It's the moments of random madness that could stir this franchise like a kind of repeating "Seven Up!" series, until he reaches what I consider to be his logical conclusion: "Bet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later", whose last scene will show the band how she will visit the film premiere of "Bet Hot American Summer".
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon now reminds us of another kind of nostalgia: the revival of the Cold War of "The Americans", the film "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW" with its east-west ring fight iconography.
The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with Rhys Thomas as director indicates to be a found TV series: a Romanian drama of the eighties with the two police as friends, two officers from Bucharest fighting for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism-Leninism.
The main roles - a hard-assed Gregor and an idealistic isef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Uliki, whose dialogues are synchronized by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in English.
It's a brilliant idea.
But it's not much more than an idea.
There are some nice gags to watch (the police spend the time watching chess on TV, as Americans might do with football).
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - provides a decent game 'Find the Voice Out'.
But "Comrade Detective" is so committed to the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer carrying a Reagan mask - that it often plays like a single one.
With six long episodes it pulls away, and comedy is not fast or often enough.
"Comrade Detective", who was edited to a lower length, could deliver his agitprop satire better, as Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the American Embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who devour a bunch of hamburgers.
The message for the imaginary communist audience is that Western culture can make everything a food for a situation.
The fictitious Romanian creators were not wrong: we do it even with our own younger story and with hers.
Hit against drugs mafia in the country
The police have succeeded in a blow against the Italian Mafia in Baden-Württemberg.
On Wednesday morning numerous objects were searched in the Schwarzwald-Baar-Kreis, in Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, as the state prosecutorship Konstanz informed us on Friday.
Thereby 15 accused persons aged between 25 and 77 were arrested and already issued arrest warrants against them.
In addition, the officials secured large quantities of marijuana and cocaine, firearms and several hundred thousand euros.
Two people were arrested in parallel radices in Italy.
German warrants were issued against the two suspects of Italy.
The two are therefore likely to be delivered to Germany.
Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the action.
A total of 300 officers were in use.
The members of the Mafia are accused of organized drug crime, serious acts of violence, attempted murder as well as robbery and extortion.
Since summer 2016, the public prosecutor's office has been establishing a consensus against organised drug trafficking in southern Germany.
There was a strong exchange between the public prosecutors in Constance and Palermo, and the investigators of Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.
On Wednesday morning, therefore, the large stake was also accompanied by four Palestinian officials.
In particular, Italian nationals with close links to the Italian mafia came into the sight of the investigations.
Also an incident on May 27 in Hüfingen, where several shots were fired into a restaurant early in the morning, should go to the account of the gangs.
Way to complain large gaps in the foreign register
"Data from citizens who should not appear there": According to a report, the foreign register in Germany has significant shortcomings.
This leads to some serious misconceptions in asylum proceedings.
According to a media report, the Federal Government Refugee Management Commissioner, Frank-Jürgen Wiege, has highlighted large gaps in the foreign central register.
Defects in the data recorded there could lead to "partly serious misconceptions" in asylum procedures and deportations, warning in an analysis that the "South German newspaper" is available.
According to the register, 10 million people with foreign nationality are included, including about 5.7 million from non-EU countries.
The data are therefore managed by about 600 foreigners authorities in Germany.
Because the data had not been sufficiently maintained, the data quality in parts had not been good.
In individual cases, data from 1921 had been found, "from people who have long been no longer alive, or from citizens who have become German citizens and who should not appear in the register anymore".
"Infective data inputs can slow back processes considerably," the report says.
In the statistics on persons subject to departure, EU citizens were also included who would not have to leave.
However, such false allocations led to "a distorted debate on the handling of persons with exitees", according to the analysis.
Meanwhile, the Federal Government has apparently begun to send refugee families with under 16-year-old children back to Italy once they have arrived from there.
This is based on an internal paper from the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), reports the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung".
Thus, the paper states that BAMF has carried out such procedures "with regard to families with children - with the exception of infants and young children - to Italy since 1 June 2017".
Since the end of 2014, this was practically impossible, according to the newspaper, referring to the difficult situation on site.
Under the Dublin Agreement, refugees of the EU Member State are responsible for achieving them first.
If a migrant travels to another EU country, that State can send him back to the country of entry.
For reasons the Office now writes: "In the meantime, the capacity to absorb families with minor children in Italy has increased considerably".
Italy has provided guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families.
Even the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) considers these commitments to be sufficient.
Other EU countries would also send refugees back to this area under the Dublin Agreement.
Mr Ulla Jelpke, the speaker for the left-wing political group in the Bundestag, criticised this decision: "Familys with children threaten to accept human rights and risk the child's well-being because of the shortcomings in the Italian asylum system.
Second best result achieved
A total of 220 litres of blood from people living in Oberreichbach was already provided by the blood donation for other people.
At least by the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday.
Previous to all Jürgen Greule, who now shared 50 litres of blood with his now 100 donations.
Traditionally, at the meeting of the municipal council, the church appreciates the multiple willingness to donate blood.
"It is awesome how our body is designed for this and we will respect the donors, who provide their blood for strangers, and will not be able to do so," underlined Mayor Karlheinz Kistner.
"One single blood donation helps several people," explained Holger Maisenbacher, the head of the German Red Cross (DRK), as the canned are disintegrated into their components.
Three people could already benefit from a blood donation.
At the same time, Maisenbacher reported on the actions carried out in spring in Oberreichbach.
"This year, with 114 donors, we achieved the second best result," said the DRK team leader.
Obviously, the switch to the theatre house a few years ago led to higher numbers of participants.
Already before, Thomas Bockstadt, Susanne Reichle, Sandra Schöck, Thomas Reichle and Meta Umber were among the multiple donors and were awarded 50 blood donations each.
Half so many book Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger, while Tamara Pfrommer, Petra Schleeh, Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Vetter paid ten times a 500 milliliters of their life juice.
The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the weakening of inflation have dampened speculations over an increase.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain "earth" when it maintained the interest rates on family income in the middle of a strengthening pressure.
The Bank's Monetary Committee (MPC) policy makers voted 6 to 2 to keep interest rates at 0.25%, with fewer members in the month seeking to increase, as weak economic growth has weakened support for an increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts to 1.7% in 2017 and to 1.6% in 2018 and warned that the pressure on household income would continue, with inflation expected to rise to just under 3% in autumn.
However, it indicated that in the next few years, interest increases would be necessary to reduce the inflation generated by Brexit and said that credit costs might have to rise more than expected in the financial markets.
Members also voted to withdraw part of the Mammut business package, which was issued one year after the Brexit.
It will call for time for the financing plan to make cheaper financial resources available to banks from next February, although it has been said that it will now be expected to make 15 billion pounds more available under this system - with 115 billion sterling.
Minutes after the decision on the interest rate, the Bank said: "In the central forecast of the MPC the gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak in the short term, as the pressure on household real income continues to burden consumption."
On interest rates, she repeated that "a certain streamlining of monetary policy" would be necessary to cool down inflation and a "more than" extent than markets expect.
Markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that increases would be made "step-by-step" and "limited".
The Bank's downward-corrected growth forecasts for this and next year are 1.9% and 1.7% compared to the May forecast.
It has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8% in 2018.
The pound fell after these news to the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5% to $1.31 and fell by 0.4% to €111.
The decision does not change after the recent disappointing growth figures have reduced the rising expectations of an interest rate increase and GDP has risen from 0.2% in the second quarter to 0.3% in the previous three months.
Growth is expected to be 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will slightly recover after the bank towards the end of the year.
The most recent inflation report has been little enthusiasm for households affected by an increase in inflation and a small increase in their salary, as the tightening up first becomes worse before it improves.
She added that monetary policy cannot "prevent" the loss of income in the coming years, but she added that, at the end of her three-year forecast, wages will be "clear".
The economy is also strengthened by the increasing demand for British goods, which is due to the weak pound, which will compensate some of the lower consumption expenditure.
The decision comes one year after the reduction of interest rates to 0.25% last August following the shocking EU vote that caused the decrease of the pound.
The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years for this to fully reach the prices and the economy.
Prior to the bank's final decision on interest rates, the call for an interest rate increase had increased as inflation increased pressure on heavily depressed households, with three policy makers calling for an increase to 0.5% in July.
Inflation fell from 2.9% in June last month to 2.6%, although the bank said that this was expected and it will attract again in the coming months.
The Bank said that the excess in relation to its 2% target was "very" attributed to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, Director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "In view of the recent decline in swap rates, the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again, as the lenders are looking for business and want to end the year in a positive way.
The market looks particularly good for those in whom the existing deals run out and complete the new mortgages, and many with free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular."
NHS (The National Health Service) is expected to prescribe controversial HIV drugs 10,000 people
Patients will receive access to a "transformative" HIV prevention treatment from September after a fight before the High Court against the financing of the drug in the NHS.
NHS England stated that a pre-exposition prophylaxis (PREP) taken prior to sexual intercourse can reduce the risk of infection in high risk patients by approximately 86 percent, now provided by the healthcare service through a first three-year study for an estimated 10,000 people.
He agreed to finance the trial after the appeal court had confirmed last year a judgment of the Supreme Court that the NHS had the power to pay for the PREP despite the claim that the local authorities should finance it.
The chess train announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England chief Simon Stevens as a "important new intervention", while the National Aids Trust (NAT) called this "deciding moment".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to enable people to register, and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced in all of England in April 2018.
Preexposition Prophylaxis (PREP) is a consequence of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in infectious patients.
Taking PREP before sexual intercourse means that just enough medications are present in a person's body to prevent HIV infection.
Such drugs can already be taken two hours before sexual intercourse every day or so.
Those in question for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexuals and persons with HIV-positive partners who have not been successfully treated.
In clinics, appropriate participants are identified who agree to the study, including men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment.
People who live in England and are registered with a family doctor may also register for possible participation in their local sex clinic.
The program will be £ 10 million and NHS England signed a contract for the supply of medicines this week after an international competitive procurement.
The study is intended to assess the entire potential of PREP by collecting clinical evidence, such as it is used, taken up and implemented on a large scale.
Stevens said, "This great new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in the more than three decades of continuing progress in dealing with one of the greatest health challenges facing mankind."
Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National Aids Trust), said: "This is a decisive moment in the fight against HIV.
PREP, if it is targeted at people in need and at risk, offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic.
From September onwards, people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner, leading to the improvement of many, many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement."
Ian Green, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "The priority must now be to ensure that the study is carried out quickly across the country and that nobody who has a risk to HIV is left behind.
Now that the PrEP test medicine has been obtained, we are on the best track to protect more than 10,000 HIV-infected people."
Sharon Hodgson, Minister of Shadow Health, said: "The beginning of the PrEP process is welcome and superfluous after months of delays and slow implementation by the government.
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and stop the transmission of this life-changing infection.
This attempt brings us one step closer to understanding the benefits of PEEP.
Now, it is important that this study is carried out throughout the country as soon as possible to protect people who are HIV-infected, and that they will contribute to the end of the spread of HIV in society'.
Living the big life: intermediate floor and clever designer tricks have turned this little Earls Court apartment into a generous home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, reduced himself from a big house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment in 2014.
It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is a proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags.
"Before, I lived in a much larger room with my ex in Knightsbridge," says Joanne.
"I was looking for something comparable to my price.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and she had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and made an offer on that day."
Since the first visit, the 1,000-square-foot apartment has been completely overwhelmed.
Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - wanted to add Joanne storage room and an intermediate floor to make optimal use of the generous ceiling height.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
That was my requirement," she says.
To this end, she commissioned Erfan Azadi's Architecture and Design Studio Duck & Shed to use the 12.5-foot ceiling and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne.
The ceiling was not large enough to accommodate two rooms, so the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate floor where one could stand.
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the requirement.
"The steel plant is quite complicated," he explains.
"We had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stacked over each other without having to bend.
It wasn't just about building a simple platform, but to lay the steel so that he had the right height for the function above or below."
This arrangement enabled Erfan to place two rooms in full height above each other - with a lot of additional drama.
For the mezzanine floor, a classic copper light window from Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area.
Reflected gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.
At both ends a short corridor is mirrored to make it work longer.
In the kitchen, the reflection feels like a window in another room.
At the entrance, mirrored units provide space for all Joanne's ticks and glasses.
By perceiving a more glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used.
Folding kitchens are nothing new.
The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.
"A little engineering went in there," Erfan explains of the steel-strengthened, veneered MDF door.
"It is counterweight, so that when you move the door up, it slides very easily."
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne was able to gain additional 16 m2, an additional bedroom and an improved layout.
"At the end of the day you will sell the ground floor - or how your property is appreciated," says Erfan.
"In a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will come in and perform a calculation based on the ground size."
Here they have managed to enlarge the floor surface while at the same time using high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage.
"The materials are the things you touch and therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan.
"You don't fall in love with the electric sockets in the walls.
These are important, but they don't play with your heart."
It shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square meters of something by default into something quite amazing.
In fact, like Joanne, you could decide not to leave them.
Brothers fight for a $500 million real estate empire
Two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, in a dispute because of one of Victoria’s largest real estate empires worth more than $500 million.
The former director of the 'Carlton Football Club' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, just three doors away from his younger brother Paul, who has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business assets should be divided.
Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014, but a sharp debate on the separation takes place in the Supreme Court.
Together with her mother Anna, the brothers own 38 real estate worth more than half a billion dollars, accumulated since the family bought a business on Smith Street, Collingwood, in 1973.
There the Westco Jeans family founded and grew into a chain of 160 retail shops.
It was sold for 85 million US dollars in 1999.
This money was invested in real estate, and the portfolio of De Lutis now includes offices in the city center, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping centers in the suburb.
According to an agreement with her late father, Colin - described by Paul as "main manager and dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - owns about two thirds of the corporate assets and Paul about one third.
A court act states that this means that Colin owns 316 million dollars and Paul worth 176 million dollars.
The division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.
"The divisions proposed by Colin left him with what I thought for the best objects," he wrote in a first Affidavit in 2015.
The first hearing of the Supreme Court took place last Friday after a number of failures.
The brothers now also fight for control of the existing business - of which Colin, as Paul claims, had excluded him.
Colin argues that this is not true, but accuses Paul to manage some possessions incompetently.
In an early Affidavit filed by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.
"My Italian heritage prescribes that the family is the most important priority," he wrote.
The costs are increasing in the case, with hundreds of pages with Affidavits, emails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and law firms held by both sides.
Ms. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated dairy bars and delicacy shops from the late 1950s and bought a business in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They used the security to buy the Collingwood property, in which Colin opened the family's first jeans shop.
Colin says he started Westco there when he was "in my last years of high school when Paul was still a small child (about 10 years old).
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass on their property to their sons in a good way.
"Luigi often told me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis Group, claiming that Mark was paid 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars when he left.
Both Luke and Mark were bitter, Paul says "about the conditions of their financial separation".
Colin was very reluctant, although he was a former AFL board member and after a biography from 2015 by Eddie McGuire was the best friend of the TV star.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.
Only Colin answered by SMS to say "I really can't say much" because the case was before the courts.
"It's very, very sad that my brother Paul decided to sue me and pull our family name through the courts," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he had tried to meet his brother's demands.
"Our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end in our current conflict," he said, adding that he "always hopes for a solution."
On Friday this hope seemed to be over.
"Our affair will be solved by the courts in the near future," wrote Colin.
Trump's new Chief of Staff is planning to restrict the President's Media Abstinence.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.
If so, he'll be the first.
Politico reports that the new head of staff of the White House is planning to limit the flow of information to President Trump, including news media reports, in the hope of keeping the boss on a more uniform course.
Here's a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When John F. Kelly, the new head of staff of the White House, met with executives on his first working day, he presented a major problem in President Donald Trump's White House that he wanted to repair: bad information that got into the president's hands.
Kelly told the employees that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he received good information."
Kelly's diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.
President Trump's relationship with television goes back decades - and now that he's in the White House, his television advertising is still strong.
"If candidate Trump was upset because of unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting from jobs that were to be convinced," said former campaign advisor Sam Nunberg in February to Politico.
Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keeping Trump's Twitter habit under control is, according to six former campaign officials, to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a constant praise price."
Okay.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit was ever "under control" is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaigners know something we don't know about others - that Trump's Tweets contained even more ignition without their interventions.
We'll probably never know anything about the Tweets that Trump hasn't sent.
If his employees already managed him several times to keep trouble away from him, then their efforts would be worthwhile.
But no one has consistently prevented Trump from controversing.
Part of the problem is that people in a White House, composed of competing parties, are constantly trying to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that may promote their views of the world.
Politico - all concerned with this story - reported in May about the preference of advisers to provide the President with dubious information for strategic reasons.
This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher:
"Current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react like a volcano to negative press cuts, especially those with damaging leaks, and that he is working hard to find out where they come from.
That's exactly what happened at the end of February when someone maliciously gave the president a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of Internet provocator Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy staff chief Katie Walsh to be "the source behind a pile of leaks" in the White House.
Although Johnson was permanently banished from Twitter because of shocks or that he did not offer concrete evidence or that he had expressed false accusations and revoked them in the past.
Trump read the article and began to interview staff about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that the then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary General of the White House, Rob Porter, "have tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork that Trump receives".
How did that work out?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later.
Perhaps he will prove to be more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his consultants are still striving for influence.
These unchangeable factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Most-affected criminals get mail from Europol
Since the address is unknown, the assistance of the population is requested and desired.
Police all over Europe are sending out postcards to dangerous criminals on the run this summer.
Since the addresses of the sought serious criminals are not known by nature, information from the population is hoped for and asked for.
Europol reported on Friday the action followed by the "EU Most Wanted" event calendar of winter.
Experiences have shown that many refugees hide from vacation destinations, it was said by Europol.
21 postcards were drawn up for wanted criminals from 21 EU countries.
Since 2016, the website www.eumostwanted has been viewed more than 2.5 million times.
36 of the online requests have so far been arrested, at least 11 of them due to notices after publication on the website.
Travelers negotiate a grave and return to the 'Millionary Series'
Some of the most wealthy owners of the West Midlands are again on the foot of war with some determined travelers who have negotiated a grave drawn by the community in order to call back a field in front of their mansions.
The travelers have parked their 20 caravans on a field outside a wealthy street of Solihull, which is called the "Millionary Series".
They brought with them horses, babies and an army of transporters after they were thrown out only in May, but without being deterred by a grave dug out by the council in order to prevent their invasions.
The tactful group found a gap in the defenses and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained unimped to find a way.
Angry residents have pushed the Council of Solihull, who said that it is "necessary to deal with the problem".
An anonymous resident said, "They moved there on Monday evening after they were sent by Bentley Heath, where they threw stones at the passers-by.
The Council must be forced by shame to implement it, since it was useless in dealing with the problem.
The travelers were there in May, were moved on and are now back.
More arrived last night, probably even more today."
She added: "The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with this by holding long instructions to protect its parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I am not happy to continue paying my municipal tax if the Council can't even stop it."
A resident who didn't want to be called said, "It's ridiculous, we just saw the last round of these travellers just to be plundered by another round.
The numbers have increased this time and you have even seen a horse in the park area."
A speaker from the Solihull Council said: "We are aware of an unauthorized camp in the country beyond the Streetsbrook Road and we are working with the Solihull police. We are taking the necessary legal steps so that they can continue as soon as possible.
In order to support our collection of evidence, it is very important that as many people as possible report to the police an anti-social or criminal behaviour by calling 101.
This contributes to creating a picture of the situation in which the court must examine when we present our case."
From Birkenhof, Waldhotel Luise will be
From the former Hotel Birkenhof, the Waldhotel Luise.
The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and will be opened again on 1 March next year.
These are good news for the city.
After all, with the closing of the Hotel Birkenhof by the then Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH on 13 April 2014, about 30,000 nights per year were lost and also revenue from the city tax.
In autumn 2014, given the dramatic increase in the number of refugees who came to the county, the hotel building was offered to the Landratsamt as a collective accommodation, which led to controversial discussions.
The city prevented the housing of asylum seekers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location.
The decision was not undisputed in the municipal council at that time.
But, above all, Freudenstadt's mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and already spoke of interested parties at the house at the time.
He's supposed to be right.
The Luisenhotels group with Managing Director Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, purchased the former Hotel Birkenhof during a voluntary auction in Berlin and wanted to make it a three-star plus category house under the name Waldhotel Luise.
The group has four houses with the Freudenstadter Objekt.
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.
They are called Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.
The former Hotel Birkenhof has been in front of the entrance for some time now, and when you enter the house, it becomes clear how extensive renovation work will be carried out.
The floors were torn out, ceilings partially removed, old baths were removed from the rooms.
The entire hotel building is a single building.
There is still much to be done by March.
"It's actually a nice hotel," says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper.
Everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style.
The rooms are equipped with large walkable showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are installed.
Later, everything was to become "become beautiful" as Thomas Scherer expresses himself.
"We want to make a jewel out of it."
Swimming pool, wellness area and a meeting room are included.
You don't want to position yourself at the high level of hotels in Lauterbad, but already on an elevated city centre level, Scherer emphasizes.
The Waldhotel Luise, with about 60 rooms, wants to set up a wide range, explains Scherer.
Both individual vacationers, groups or businessmen should feel comfortable at the hotel.
He has already had discussions with OB Julian Osswald and tourism director Michael Krause, according to Scherer.
The city's ideas are similar to those of the Hotel Group.
"We're on the same line."
Thomas Scherer does not want to determine exactly the level of investment asked for.
Nearly less than a million euros, he's counting.
The outdoors are also brought to the front man, which is already clearly visible.
A large terrace is created in an courtyard, which will be accessible from the restaurant, which is public.
Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Friedenstadt is a good market".
Russia-Affairs: US special mediators are setting up Grand Jury
In the Russia affair of US President Donald Trump, Special Agent Robert Mueller is said to have appointed a so-called Grand Jury after a report.
The panel has been working in recent weeks, wrote the "Wall Street Journal" calling on people who are familiar with the matter.
The newspaper rated the step as a sign that Mueller expanded and intensified its investigations.
The CNN station reported that there were already first charges of the panel in connection with a meeting between Trump's oldest son and a Russian lawyer.
US intelligence services have been accusing Kremlin for some time now to have been involved in the 2016 presidential campaign.
Mueller investigates whether there were agreements between Trump's campaign team and Moscow.
The aim of the investigations is to focus on several men who acted as a Republican's adviser in the campaign.
According to reports, Mueller also underwent more and more Trump's private and business environment.
The "Washington Post" wrote a few weeks ago that the special mediator Trump personally got to the centre and examined the accusation whether the president might have disabled the justice in the course of the affair.
The main task of Grand Jurys is to examine this evidence in possible criminal cases and decide whether to file charges.
Grand Jurys are therefore also called indictment chambers.
Mostly they are switched on when it comes to larger and controversial cases.
The procedure always takes place behind closed doors.
The panel can also be switched on by the prosecutor's office to invite persons to the hearing under oath.
According to CNN, pre-charges have already been issued, which are about the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.
The report called for a statement to be made to those involved in the meeting.
In addition, they should provide documents.
In addition to Trump Jr., Trump's adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner as well as his then election campaign leader Paul Manafort also participated in the conversation.
Legal experts said on Thursday evening in the U.S. television that the establishment shows that Mueller does not let himself be intimidated in his work and that, if necessary, he wants to act quickly.
However, it should not necessarily be said that the Grand Jury would end up in order to decide on the raising of a charge.
Nevertheless, the establishment of the body was the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause for concern for President Trump.
In the midst of the new revelations, the President used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to present the Russia affair as a campaign of its political opponents.
"The history of Russia is a total invention," said Trump.
The issue gives Democrats an opportunity to "feel good because they have nothing else to talk about."
His special advisor Ty Cobb explained in an opinion that he knew nothing about the establishment of a Grand Jury.
But these also usually work in secret, he stressed.
The White House endorses any measures which have accelerated the work of the special mediator in a "fair" way.
The former FBI chief James Comey said three times that the President is not determined.
There was no reason to believe that something had changed in this respect, the statement continued.
But Mueller had only been used after Trump had fired Comey.
Because of this outrage, accusations against Trump had become loud, and he wanted to hinder justice.
Comey told a Senate committee in June that Trump had asked him to stop the investigation against the then national security adviser Michael Flynn.
The President is under great pressure because of the investigation.
According to presentation of US media, the White House collected material against the specialized mediator and his employees.
This triggered speculation about whether Trump wanted to release Mueller.
Unlike an independent special agent of the Congress, such as in the Watergate affair around the later retired President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired at the President's press by the Ministry of Justice.
However, several Senators of both parties want to prevent such a step.
On Thursday, two groups of Republican and democratic senators presented draft legislation that would make it difficult for the special mediator to be released.
Antarctica: Gigantic Iceberg is driving in Antarctica
In the Western Antarctic, a giant iceberg from the nearly seven-fold size of Berlin has solved itself from the Schelfeis.
This was reported by the Berlin Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.
The Coloss, which is larger than a trillion tons and is 5800 square kilometres, is now driving north and will probably need two, three years until it is melted.
It is at 175 kilometers in length and a width of up to 50 kilometres one of the largest ice giants that researchers have registered over the past three decades.
A danger to people does not come from him.
To what extent climate change has played a role in the destruction of the iceberg, according to researchers, it is unclear.
In total, however, there has been a series of unusual collapses of ice skeletals in the region for around 30 years, writes the US Research Center for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) in a fact background.
In the opinion of many researchers, this could be related to global warming.
So far, the now broken Coloss was part of Larsen-C-Schelfeis.
Schelfeis swims on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.
As a result, it continues to grow into the sea and breaks down regularly.
The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is located to the south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic peninsula.
To the north of this crag, the balance of waxes and demolitions was disturbed a few years ago.
A complete Schelfeis was destroyed there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.
There is a great deal to say that Larsen-C-Schelfeis is also in danger, because the front edge has never moved as far back as it is at present.
In addition, the ice plate is under tension and could disintegrate if a piece breaks off at a key point.
The melting of skeletal and iceberg does not increase the sea level, as they swim on the water and push out ice as much water as it does after melting itself.
However, the loss of the claw makes it possible for glaciers to flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before.
This could possibly increase sea level, but only to a small extent, writes the British research project on the observation of Antarctica (Midas).
According to AWI data, Larsen-C-Schelfeis is the fourth largest kelp in Antarctica with nearly 50,000 square kilometres.
At the transition from mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front to the free ocean about 200 meters.
There it breaks down regularly.
"Although it is natural and we are not aware of any direct connection to climate change, the ice shield is now entering a more vulnerable position," said Martin O'Leary of the British Swansea University.
"This is the widest withdrawal since the beginning of the records," he also confirmed.
Among scientists, it was controversial whether the Larsen-C-Schelfeis will now grow again or return in the long term and may coincide, said his colleague Adrian Luckman, adding: "Our models say it will be less stable".
But this development will last for decades.
Even though these researchers do not bring the destruction of this giant iceberg back to climate change, many ice-creams of the Antarctic Peninsula have been broken over the last decades.
This long summit of Antarctica extends towards South America.
According to data from the British Antarctic Survey research program, the Arctic Peninsula ice area has dropped by 28,000 square kilometres since the 1950s.
The increase in temperature has contributed to the decline.
The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed around three degrees in the past 50 years, counting among the areas where the temperature is rising fastest.
CDU wants house tariff for staff
Because it is becoming more and more difficult to occupy free positions, the CDU is calling on to leave the employers' association to become more attractive.
It was only shortly before the summer break that the county day gained 41 new posts in the administration.
More than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in Mettmann.
Now another 17 trainees have their first working day behind them.
The teaching places in the circle are apparently very desirable.
Around 620 applications were made for the places to be awarded this year.
Nevertheless, the circle still lacks staff to cope with the increased requirements and tasks.
At the moment, there are still 50 unoccupied places in the district of Mettmann.
Doctors and engineers, as well as general administration forces, are being sought.
The CDU now wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG in the circuit day and respond to the lack of expertise in the administration.
The management is intended to develop, according to the wishes of the parties, "a concept for personnel acquisition and personnel development".
The aim is not only to meet short-term needs for skilled workers, but also to counteract the future-oriented shortage of candidates, says.
The overall concept should be oriented both internally and externally, show concrete measures for cross-border beginners and include a training offensive, require CDU, FDP and UWG.
That sounds like a good approach.
Because the circle has to do with personnel problems that were previously unknown.
Other cities recruit good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.
This is about a real "public employers' competition".
In addition, a high number of employees who leave the service in the event of illness or age.
It is therefore time to act, so that there are no more places left unoccupied.
However, Klaus-Dieter Peoples, head of the Group of the CDU, goes beyond the common request with his party.
He recently caused a great surprise in the circuit day, when he publicly questioned the personnel cost cover and surprised the other parties.
Peoples would like to see all possibilities reviewed that allow for the withdrawal from the local employers' association.
"If we do not come to a satisfactory solution in the short term, the county administration with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the surrounding cities - should seek a house tariff," said Volks.
In this way, the CDU is trying to pay the employees and officials better than the public service regulations provide.
At present, salaries are precisely prescribed, increases or more money are only available if you switch to a higher level that is geared towards career years.
However, the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years.
Only a few weeks ago, new spaces had to be set up in which employees took care of the provisions of the new Prostituent Protection Act.
Not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers, Landrat Thomas Hendele and district director Martin Richter have a problem: they have too few personnel.
Italy strengthens the sound of NGOs-migrant rescue boats
Italy has warned NGOs that they are using lifeboats for migrants in the Mediterranean not to continue if they do not comply with new rules for their operations.
"If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue to work," said Marco Minniti, Minister of Interior in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa.
Minnitis Warning came a day after the Italian authorities seized a boat from the German aid organisation 'Jugend Rettet' because their team had effectively cooperated with traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.
The aid organization, which has only been in operation for a year, refused to make detailed accusations to the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us, the salvation of human life remains our top priority. We are therefore very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," said the organization in an opinion on the social media.
"We can only assess all the accusations currently made after we have collected all the information and can assess the situation."
The Italian authorities had been monitoring the boat of 'Youth Rettent', the Iuventa, since October.
It is suspected that its crew will take on board hose boat migrants who will be delivered directly from traffickers, and that the smugglers will be able to leave so that the ships can be used again.
At least such a meeting was said to take place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the file of the prosecutor whose contents were published by Italian media.
The crew is suspected of disposing of the authority of the Italian Coast Guard Station, the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not for any other reason.
Under the Code of Conduct, boats such as the Iuventa must have, above all, an Italian police officer on board who monitors their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to adhere to the code: Save the Children, MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary, but acceptable, as they would not bring with them any "essential changes or handicaps" of their rescue actions.
Among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel laureate Organization of Doctors without Borders (MSF).
Minniti has now said that the number of migrants arriving after the rescue measures in Italy has fallen sharply in recent weeks, indicating that efforts to strengthen the Libyan Coast Guard and cooperate with local mayors have borne fruit.
"In recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," said the Minister.
He announced plans for further discussions with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
Ascents and Trials
Nine Weilermer biker, the "Berliner Austposten" and two guest drivers met in Wagenheim in the Nordpfalz to enjoy four days of trials and sights.
Three friendly guides were available for this purpose.
The accommodation in the Wagenheimer Valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.
The Burg- und Weinfest von Wachenheim was a welcome extra.
The first tour led at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim.
They followed vantage points, partly on towers, from which one could see far above the brooks forest and the plains in front.
In the meantime there were always longer increases, which rewarded the long trials.
On the second day, Bad Dürkheim went to Saline and the Volksfest Wurstmarkt.
Again, the vantage point was at the vantage point, coupled with "flowy" trials and moderate increases.
On the last two days, many meters of altitude were fixed again.
Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and shelters brought welcome breaks.
In Bad Dürkheim, bikers breathe in the outdoor inhalorium of healing soles.
Neustadt was also controlled.
After 173 kilometers and almost 4500 metres of altitude, the group had met the Palatinate Forest from its best side - sporty and cultural.
Console instead of lawn - Bundesliga prepares for e-sport
Do the sports stars sit in front of computer consoles in the future, instead of being perplexed in wind and weather over the stadium grass?
Fact is: e-sport has long become a serious industry, become a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high-gagen included.
This has also been recognized by the first Bundesliga associations that are increasingly involved in this field.
The VfL Wolfsburg started in 2015, later followed by the FC Schalke 04 and last of the VfB Stuttgart, which founded an e-sport department in mid-July and signed two pros for the computer game FIFA 17.
"We hope to inspire completely new young target groups for the VfB," says CEO Jochen Röttgermann.
He's sure that there's still a lot of clubs on this train.
The next weekend, the FIFA Football World Association in London will organise the first Interactive Club World Cup, in which the gamers of different clubs compete against each other.
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, for example, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or PSV Eindhoven qualified.
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sport.
The ex-trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players.
"The real football must deal with the 14 to 30-year-olds in particular, that the young people will continue to go to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old.
And: The clubs tried to conquer all kinds of markets, especially the Asians.
With prominent e-sporters under contract, one could be much more present online in these markets than to send the Bundesliga team to Asia only once a year.
What exactly is it about?
At e-sport, computer games such as "League Of Legends", "Dota 2", "Countstrike" or the football simulation FIFA are challenged at competition level.
As in normal sports, they have long established leagues in which the professionals compete against each other.
And at the Asia Games 2022, E-Sport is already part of the official program.
But is this really a real sport?
For many, the idea is certainly necessary.
Ingo Froböse, too, has long dealt with the question.
For the professor at the Deutsche Sporthochschule in Cologne, e-Sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions, which are also found in classical sports - e.g. increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.
It also needed cognitive skills, technical and tactical understanding, and a fast response capacity.
Professional gamers should not only train at the console but also train their bodies and pay attention to the diet.
"The fit player is a good player."
Froböse also sees problems: "Doping is becoming more and more a topic".
Controls were difficult to carry out in online games, and in the scene the structures of classical sports were missing.
Positively, the scientist emphasizes the high integrative effect of e-sport.
The players are on the move internationally, that is like a large global family, there are no intercultural obstacles.
A study of corporate consulting Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts rapid growth to the e-sport.
In 2016, 50 million euros had been implemented in Germany, mainly through advertising, sponsorship and large tournaments.
In three years, turnover is expected to be 130 million.
This is little against the almost 2.4 billion euros of football leagues.
However, the e-sport "is no longer far from the other established sports such as handball, basketball or hockey," the Deloitte consultants write.
Internationally, many countries have gone on.
Large markets are Asia and the USA, where ex basketball players Shaquille O`Neal and Baseballstar Alex Rodriguez participate in the US team NRG eSports.
Hollywood player Ashton Kutcher invests in the eSport bet provider Unikrn.
There is also a lot of work in Europe.
In a Norwegian school, e-sport was introduced as a subject of education, says Froböse.
In the Netherlands and France, according to Dutt, football First Leagues are now obliged to set up an e-sport department.
"In the European comparison, Germany is lagging behind," explains VfB Chief Executive Officer Röttgermann.
Only to fall into nostalgia, and to explain the old times, is now not enough.
The aim is to preserve the association's tradition, but at the same time to align the company with the modern market.
"We live in a digitized world," Dutt says.
"You can't hold on to the fact that everything remains the same with football as it always was."
Gift-Eier ade - The egg alternatives for cooking and baking
In the meantime, almost all the federal states are affected by the scandal of poisoned eggs.
Aldi Süd and Aldi Nord have responded and have removed all eggs from their sales throughout Germany.
Only eggs that have proven not to contain fipronil are to be taken into the shelves.
Michelle Carter sentenced to suicide for the lyrics that Conrad Roy pushes
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend to commit suicide through texts and calls.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months her sentence behind bars and five years have been suspended on probation.
Carter was sentenced in June for negligent killing of Conrad Roy, who took his life on 13 July 2014.
Roy's father said at the hearing on Thursday, "My family is inconsolable.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was allowed to stay free until he was called.
She had been confronted with a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her legal representative argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from a mental illness.
Dressed in red pants and a creamy blouse, Carter stood there with tears in her eyes, with folded hands and eyes facing down when she was sentenced.
"Your actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
"She ended his life to make her own better.
She took no responsibility," she said.
"She didn't show any repentance."
But Carter's lawyer said it's a "sorry circumstance she totally regrets."
Judge Lawrence Moniz said, however, that he did not find out that her "age or maturity or even her mental illness has a significant influence on their actions".
A prosecutor read a statement from Roy's mother Lynn Roy, who said there's "no day when I don't trust the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything. I try to be there for his sisters, despite all my pains that we will carry with us for eternity," it says.
Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, said that she would be "followed" by the realization that she would never take part in the wedding of her brother or be an aunt to his children.
"No longer having this only person with whom I have been together since I was born every day is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life," she said.
The case seems to set a legal precedent because there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to call on another to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead from carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.
The case attracted national attention after Carter’s textual announcements revealed that she had encouraged him to end his life.
"Get up, jump from a building, start yourself, I don't know, there are many ways," she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family.
In the moments before his suicide, she wrote: "You have to do it, Conrad" and "all you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy."
Judge Moniz said that Carter was looking for attention through Roy's death and ordered that she benefit from the case through some press.
The case has shared the legal opinion.
Among the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was sentenced to murder in Italy in 2007 for being acquitted two years ago.
Ms. Knox, 30 years old, published a comment in the Los Angeles Times: "Michele Carter deserves compassion and help, not prison."
Joshua Kimmich: Learning from the new mini lamb of FC Bayern
It is no coincidence that Joshua Kimmich was allowed to be captain at the Audi Cup.
FC Bayern dares the Confed Cup winner a big season to - extra-motivation does not harm that.
There was something else in his place in the cabin, which Joshua Kimmich immediately saw, even though the extra garment was very small.
But, of course, since there was no Philipp Lahm and no Manuel new to be seen far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup, he put his arm on him.
"The coach didn't announce it," said the Confed Cup winner after his first commitment as Bayern Captain.
Well, it could've run better than at the 0:2 against the SSC Naples.
But Kimmich was able to interpret the sign of the coach.
Not the eight-year-old Arturo Vidal had been chosen as a player of the youth players, debuters and professionals who had just come out of vacation, but he was chosen as a player.
It is best to distribute sugar to those whom you have much confidence in who you want to keep with the mood.
Whoever was chosen to enter the heritage of lamb, a small extra-motivation can only use well.
Kimmich confirmed: "This is what you want as a player: take responsibility".
On Wednesday the 22-year-old flashed over the field as a mini lamb.
Right back, that's his position now, the white binder on the arm did her wrongs.
And at all, Kimmich acted in this initial formation like the one who can best control the rowing.
He gave instructions, tried to direct the uninspired troops.
He had the look for the whole, while many others were busy with themselves.
Vidal thus overplaying his lack of fitness (almost hardly worked); Renato Sanches thus coming out on devils to join the performance of the Asia trip (folding even due); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle with not to be negative in their first appearance in the Bayern jersey.
After all, it worked very well.
Süle ran alongside Kimmich, Rudy before the defense, both served sovereign.
The prominently occupied Napol storm was often difficult, and Süle also tried to succeed in the game building a few times.
His colleague Rudy admitted that the result "was not as we hoped."
But he also showed a good performance in the debut.
Game shift, tempo change: "For this style, I was also picked."
How uninhabited this Bayern world is for the new entrances, one saw after the game.
Rudy, for example, did not give one or two in the catacombs, but certainly gave six or seven interviews.
Kimmich accepted after a few cracky statements in the back of his new co-player.
There he heard an interesting sentence from Süle: "I have already noticed what is going on here.
With Bayern you just have to win every game".
After all, he doesn't have to teach the new anymore.
Alaba Motivates ÖFB Women
David Albaba believes in the success of our ÖFB girls
Austria's best-known footballer has reported on Twitter shortly before the game and wished the ÖFB girls all the best.
The Bayern-Legionary is a club colleague of ÖFB-Captainer Schnaderbeck and is also involved with our Ladys.
The Tweet of the Austrian footballer of the year and Champions League winner should be a special motivational syringe.
Our ladies might also need the famous Bayern shower.
Company satisfied with Rhine-Palatinate Minister: Economy praises Wissings Tempo
It was often irreconcilable, the relationship between the country and the regional economy, when Eveline Lemke (Green) was still Minister of Economic Affairs of Rhineland-Palatinate.
This is evident after more than a year in which the new Minister for Economic Affairs Volker Wissing (FDP) is in office.
Chambers and companies from the region speak of a change in economic policy at the same time as the old minister.
Frank Natus, Chairman of the Association of Trier companies (VTU), says: "Wissing takes up the desires of the economy that Lemke has all blocked".
Natus sees the biggest turnaround in infrastructure policy: the gap between the Kelberg and Adenau motorway 1 is now at the top of the country's priority list.
This year, the Ministry hopes that a planning procedure will take place until 2021.
A role in the country's plans is also played by the Wester Umgebung Trier, which is in the urgent need of the Federal Roadmap.
The aim was to take the route into operation in December 2020, says Prime Minister Cornelia Holtmann.
Natus sees a signpost to support regional but internationally competing companies.
The Chamber of Industry and Commerce (IHK) Trier strives, as suggested by Wissing, to produce a Rheinland-Pfalz label in order to increase sales in supermarkets and stop the trend of German wine exports that have been falling for ten years.
In addition, Wissing has an open ear for people who want to start their own company, the IHK praises.
The Trier Chamber of Crafts sees an additional incentive for young trainees in the new Masters-Bonus, says Managing Director Matthias Schwalbach.
A premium of 1000 euros is foreseen for the remaining master's exam and 2500 euros if graduates become independent within ten years of the master's training.
However, the list of homework for the country remains long.
The planned road construction is fast to create facts, while at the same time the country lacks the necessary staff, says Jan Glockauer, Chief Executive Officer of the IHK Trier.
Of 56 new engineers who want to recruit Wissing in the field of mobility, only 29 jobs have been employed so far.
The IHK demands that more orders be awarded to external offices.
CDU fact-finding vice Christian Baldauf refers to calculations of the Court of Auditors, investing the country in 2017 and 2018 more than 20 million euros less in the preservation of national roads than proposed.
Frank Natus also expects a country's concept of how to address the shortage of skilled workers in the region.
In addition, the current broadband expansion in the country was sobering.
In 2016, regional companies had assessed the network supply in an IHK survey only with the grade 3.4.
They complain about high-end Internet connections and breakdowns.
On the other hand, ex-economic minister Eveline Lemke is currently out of politics and is still sitting in the Supervisory Board of the wind power company Pro Wind.
The Green Group left Lemke for April to become President of a private university in Karlsruhe - where after four months it had already cleared the field again because of disagreements.
Audi is expected to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter-reaction
One day before Audi announced, BMW said it would offer to update the software to more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW president said that the company felt that "there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions," and that this involved European cities - including Munich, where BMW is based - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the undertakings as recalling.
European car manufacturers have strongly promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules on carbon dioxide emissions.
But the nitrogen oxides that emit diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The cost of the automotive manufacturers to install plants to neutralise the exhaust gases emitted by diesel vehicles also increases, which makes it difficult to maintain the price of the cars competitive.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of stifling the powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem.
The companies are trying to avoid Volkswagen's mistakes, which could regulate the use of so-called switch-off devices to comply with the requirements when a car has been tested, but which can be withdrawn under normal driving conditions.
In the United States, several Volkswagen employees have been charged with charges, others being examined on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics was arrested in Audi's engine development in Germany.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be brought to court in the United States.
At the beginning of this year, Audi was included in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen, after the authorities accused Audi of installing a system to bypass emissions rules in Europe, and an application focused on the United States was extended.
The involvement of Audi in the investigation could seriously burden Volkswagen: The luxury car manufacturer contributes disproportionately to the profit of Volkswagen.
This message has the raft on Saturday on the Isar
The city wants to protect the Isar.
In order for the Isar visitors to join us, a raft will travel through Munich on tomorrow Saturday, which has a special message.
Whoever pulls it to the Isar on Saturday, there will see a big raft between Flaucher and Reichenbachbrücke.
And that's not a usual raft, with Isar tourists.
But the Baureferat wants to clarify.
On the raft you can see a large info transparent.
It shows a garbage mountain.
The start of a public campaign to appeal to the Isar visitors.
With the motto "Wahre Love is ..." the understanding for the Isar is to sharpen as a protective wild river.
As early as last summer, the raft was passing over the Isar and this year there are further actions and measures to achieve a considerate and environmentally conscious behaviour.
Mordillo's Squirrels and laughing against suffering
Mordillo was temporarily one of the most published cartoon characters, the noodles of his figures are his trademarks.
The Argentineman also draws 85 and works on a film.
His message: laughter, "because there is too much suffering in the world".
Guillermo Mordillo was born on August 4, 1932, the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.
In the first years as an artist, he went through what frustrated him, among other things, as a signer for lucky cards.
"The happiest day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job," he said.
After stations in Lima, New York and Paris he succeeded in the end of the 60s: with the publication of his cartoons in "Paris Match" and then also in "Star" and other leading magazines around the world.
Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.
Again and again, the artist of cities was inspired.
Large round Mordillo figures delve into drawings with the shaft tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow.
In the early morning, according to his own statement, he still sits at the drawing table today, working almost ten hours a day.
About calendar, puzzles, books for big and small, t-shirts, plush animals and watches continue to find a lot of distribution around the world.
He has also been working on a cartoon and a TV series with his characters for six years.
The main person in the movie "Crazy Island" is a giraffe - Mordillo's most popular animal in his drawings - who has a thousand-füssler as an opponent.
For the first time, his characters speak in the 3D film, which will come to the cinema screen in 2019.
"I don't know exactly what they're going to say, it's weird for me," says Mordillo.
The script isn't written by him.
That's why he uses the TV series, which, like his original drawings, is produced wordlessly.
Lavender from Provence threatened by climate change
It has become a symbol of Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change.
Because of the conditions that are reminiscent of drought and the diseases, the lavender is declining, causing great headaches to scientists and farmers who are trying to find solutions.
Eric Chaisse, expert at the agricultural research institute CRIPPAM in Provence, said: "The lavender in Provence is effectively threatened because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in recent years, which has brought much less rain in spring and much more in autumn.
This has an impact on the life of lavender.
There is also a small cicada, a microbacterium that transmits dwarfs, and in very dry weather there are many of them."
And there's a lot on the game.
Lavender oil not only attracts vacationers, it is also very popular for perfumes and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: "Instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.
So we have fewer parts with essential oil."
The solutions that are considered include better water distribution and the slowing of the evaporation from the soil, but also the spraying of the plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties more resistant to drought.
The town of Geisa in the Thuringian Rhön this year celebrates its 1200th anniversary.
The high point is this Saturday and Sunday with a medieval festival.
Cramers, fumes, dealers, vagants or a country slave camp are to be experienced in the city centre on these days.
The murder of a journalist underscores the growing threat in Mexico
Riodoke weekly staff usually meet on Wednesdays to review their plans for reporting on the latest chaos in the state of Sinaloa through organized crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars.
But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to speak about security.
It was told that it is important to change their routines.
Two high-ranking journalists are discussing what feels more secure: they are to take their children to the office that was the goal of an attack with grenades in 2009, or leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on a table on the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.
You ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary to provide perceptions and abdominal feelings.
There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists suspected of being on the salary list of government or cartels, a catalogue of criminals making the chaos of Mexico dangerous.
There is no rest from the violence, and as the bodies accumulate throughout the country, more and more journalists are involved: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nito took office in December 2012. 589 are facing attacks and threats under federal protection and until now there have been at least seven deaths in seven states this year.
Among the latter is their editor and inspirator of Riodoce, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist," wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs.
His lack will be deeply felt, although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez showing his middle finger with the word "Justice" depends on the facade of the Riodoke building. Two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts showing his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panama hat.
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared topics, trauma, nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special law firm was set up in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists, according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists, only two criminal proceedings have been initiated.
As with most thousands of murders each year associated with drug trafficking and organized crime, the murderers of journalists are rarely brought to trial.
At Riodoke, they still insist on dealing with the violence of Sinaloa, although they are inconvenient and although the terrain is now even more treacherous.
Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting for the discussion of security has little value, says Ibarra.
"It's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.
"As long as we don't know why, we all distrust."
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left Riodoke newspaper office in the capital of Culiacan.
He only managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. He was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot at him, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated "Twelfter River".
The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left behind a woman and two grown-up children.
Rumours tend to fly around Culiacan freely.
But there is practically nothing but silence on the issue of Valdez.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and the extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa had become one of the bloodiest battlefields in the country, as rival groups are fighting here to fill the vacuum.
It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa someone or several people are shot every day on the street or that the cemetery is full of decorated, two-storey mausoleans for drug kings who are larger than many homes for the living.
Forget for a minute that there is a state of "rest" if only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes to the United States.
Nevertheless, and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, was to blame for not being able to protect his friend.
He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.
First, in February, there was the release of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel fractions in war with Guzman's sons.
This publication may have upset the sons, suspected gang members bought up each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaperskioske.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for its own security after the seizure of another newspaper that had published the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be there.
He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to set up Riodoce and sold 50 dollars of equity.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to operate journalism without encountering the risk-of-supply problem," said Bojorquez.
As time went by, the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.
Reporters loved to be able to publish hard-catching investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to treat.
Eight years after the establishment of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot-Prize" for her reporting in Latin America.
In the same year Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in the persecution of the Mexican drug history, wherever she led it.
He voluntarily admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to keep living," he said at the time of the CPJ award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa "is a way of life," he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento TV.
"You have to take on the task that comes to you as a journalist - either that or you play the stupid.
I don't want to be asked, "What did you do in the face of so many dead ... why didn't you say what was going on?"
The Riodoke team missed Valdez, the fun bird, who, like a port worker, was quick, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted in his routine.
He would always wear his hat.
He would always go to El Guayaquil, the bar opposite the office, and sit there at the same table.
Now they ask: Was his love for routine his destruction?
His death has also forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their work and stay alive.
"They don't like it when you deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret runways and runways" to move drugs.
"These things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.
The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-maintainment.
Trust his own instincts.
If it smells wrong, stay away.
The anger is, said the editor of Riodoke Andres Villarreal, that "a sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing happened to Javier."
The old rules, as he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a toxic mixture of random smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where Riodoke’s staff met for security training, no mobile phones were allowed. Days before, it was known that spyware sold exclusively to governments was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two policemen sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.
They were commissioned by the state government to protect Riodoce's offices in a four-storey building in a middle-class area of Culiacan.
In the middle of a joke, some of the reporters wondered if these officers were among the 50 percent of the police who the governor himself called untrustworthy.
It has been months since the reporters went to the mountain landscape, where the drug gangs are de facto under control.
For the issue of this week, Riodoke has looked at three main stories.
There was the murder of the brother of the former known boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had an exhibit on the government expenditure that focused on the governor's home city.
And there was a group that carried out a kidnapping in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block away from the office of the prosecutor.
There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was given when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite place of drug dealers and authorities.
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who belonged to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), who ruled almost the entire century all political levels.
Recently, several PRI governors were accused of corruption because of high-ranking cases.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this locality, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military attack.
Just a few months earlier, the readers had considered Valdez's column to be the best informed source of the kidnapping.
"Before we'd known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El Flaco" because of its slim body stature.
"Now all channels of communication with our sources are broken."
Valdez's office was turned into a storage room for signs and stickers who protest against the murders of journalists, because the employees became something they never expected themselves: activists in the name of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez took a few signs and went to a demonstration next morning because of another journalist to the office of the prosecutor.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed, in the western state of Michoacan.
A burnt body was discovered and officials say, based on DNA tests, that it's his.
Throughout the country, journalists have become louder by writing "SOS Press" in organized protests on walkways and buildings.
On that day, director Bojorquez is away in Washington and there he tries to collect international support for the justice in the case of Valdez.
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day after the murder of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and killing them because they told the truth.
She has since asked that she be reunited by the government because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were "circumventions" of organized crimes, government officials involved, and an indifferent society.
In his last book "Narco-Journalism", he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs, but also by orders of politicians and security forces who were under a cover with organized crime.
Last year, the Media Guard Group "Articulo 19" has assigned more than half of the attacks to journalists of the police and officials.
"In Mexico you die because they want you to shut your mouth," said Ramirez.
Obviously, the murders have a deterrent effect.
No one forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamulipa six years ago.
Her body was found together with a note that was supposedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "Here I am because of my reports."
A computer keyboard and headphone were located next to its separated head.
Some branches have chosen to close like the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the murder of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others continue, as El Manana von Nuevo Laredo did after her director's murder in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartel with an editorial on the title page with the heading "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their home countries or even from the country.
It's a painful decision.
It's hard to find work in exile, and they're still watching the streets and looking for dangers.
And sometimes they are hunted, as it seems to the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Veracruz.
For those who remain behind and continue to work, it is a daily dance with risky decisions.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that the drug trafficking scared him.
"Mexico goes to hell, and that's why I became a reporter," he said.
At midnight last Friday, when the last issue had already ended, Riodoke's editors sat on the sidewalk in front of the office and drank beer when all of the phones started to swim.
A number of shootings with gang rivals and security forces near Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.
The war continued to escalate as promised by a number of cartel messages in the region.
From the brothstone edge, they have published the news on Riodoke's website via mobile phones.
The title page had to be changed the next day.
Siren howling around - another shooting in the area.
Bojorquez took a look at the police who kept the guard to see if they were ready.
If they were even afraid, they wouldn't show it.
Under the tremendous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible to all of Sinaloa, Riodoke's employees followed his footsteps.
"How can you just remember to close it," said Bojorquez, "if on the same day Javier was murdered, the practitioner asked me to send her to the street for reporting."
Dinosaurs used camouflage to avoid his enemies
At first glance it looks like a statue, though a terrifying one.
Now researchers have found out that the first findings of the incredible Nashorn of a Canadian miner were so well received that experts described it as "Mona Lisa the dinosaur".
It was so well received that they could even find that his scaly skin was reddish brown - and they said she had had something of a "unscrupulous past".
The report in the journal "Current Biology" called him "the best-kept dinosaurs ever found and one of the best dinosaurs in the world".
The Fossil is a newly discovered species of nodosaurs who lived in the middle of the Creed Age between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
Its incredibly well preserved state has baffled researchers who describe it as "really remarkable"
According to reports in National Geographic, the armored plant eater is the best preserved fossil of its kind.
It was found by Shawn Funk when on 21 March 2011 he dug in the Suncor Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in north Alberta, Canada.
He met something that seemed to be missing from the surrounding rock, and decided to look more closely.
The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
They spent the next six years exposing the wild animal within 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) of heavy earth clumps.
After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.
"If you blink a little with your eyes, you could almost believe it slept," said the main author, Caleb Brown, scientists at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature can be seen.
"It will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur exemplars - the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs."
Researchers have found that this plant eater, although covered with armor and resembles a changing tank, was probably threatened by flesh-fearing dinosaurs.
The heavily armored dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as counter-shading, which is also used by many modern animals.
This would have allowed better mixing into its surroundings and avoiding its enemies, say experts, which suggests that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million-year-old creature from the Nodosaur family made headlines in May and is now on display at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Borealopelta marketmitchelli after museum engineer Mark Mitchell, one of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours carefully discovering it.
The amazing preservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of sheds and armor over his body.
They discovered the countershadowing, a common method of defense in the animal kingdom, which means that the tip of the creature was darker than its underside.
Although the counterestimation is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borelopelta exceeds by far the size of the animals living today.
It indicates that the dinosaur was hunted by enough pressure from meat-eating dinosaurs that evolution favoured the veiling of confrontation as a means of survival.
But most of the contemporary animals that use countershadowing - think of deer, zebras or belt animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey, indicating that this nodosaurs was exposed to a real struggle for survival.
"Strong predatory behaviour on a massive, heavily armored dinosaur shows how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the Creed period must have been," Brown said.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was reddish brown.
Scientists continue to investigate the animal for clues about its life, including its preserved intestine content, to find out what it ate as its last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, was thrown into a river and driven out into the sea, where he sank on his back to the bottom of the sea.
At that time Alberta was as warm as South Florida today, and rivers and oceans probably spread much farther inland than they are today.
"This nodosaurs is truly remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved scaly skin, but also remains in three dimensions and retains the original form of the animal," Brown said.
"The result is that the animal looks almost the same today as in the early creeds.
You don't need a lot of imagination to reconstruct it. If you just shivel with your eyes, you might almost believe he's sleeping."
The Creed Age was a time when huge theropods, flesh-fearing dinosaurs, standing on two legs, roamed the earth.
Although the king of them, the tyrannosaurus Rex, lived for millions of years after Borelopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his frightening ancestors.
This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11.5 m) long, six tons heavy monster.
The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borelopelta was sunk and mummified in the mud after death in the sea.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk when on 21 March 2011 he dug in the Suncor Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best-kept dinosaur of the world, including skin and armor, and is complete from the snout to the hip.
The creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
It contained two 20-inch-long tips that rang from its shoulders.
The researchers believe that the armored plant freshener was floated by western Canada until a flooded river flowed into the open sea.
But the underwater burial of the dinosaur preserved its armor in exquisite detail.
The petrified remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the skin residues still cover bumpy tanks along the dinosaur
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is so 'same as a profit in the lotto.
The more I see it, the more confusing it becomes.
Stoned remains of the skin still cover the bumpy armored plates that carry the skull of the animal.
Its right front foot is at its side, its five fingers are spread upwards.
I can count the sheds on his sole.
In the thunderstorm: Mass caramage on A8: Many injured
A major accident on Thursday evening on the A8: Nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a mass car bomb.
There are numerous injured, kilometres long traffic jams - and Gaffer.
On the Stuttgart-Munich motorway (A8), about 20 people were injured on the late Thursday afternoon at a mass carbambolage.
According to the police's first information, about 5 p.m., between the Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (Landkreis Aichach-Friedberg) connecting points were nearly 30 vehicles during a thunderstorm, probably including trucks.
No information was available on the exact number of injured persons at first.
It's about slight to moderate injuries, a police spokesman said.
There was a great warning of rescue vehicles at the accident site.
The A8 was completely blocked towards Munich.
In the direction of Munich, a ten-kilometre back-storage was formed.
As reported by an AZ reporter, there were also massive obstacles on the counterway - due to numerous Gaffer.
The fire brigade recorded the vehicle steering marks which now have to be expected with delicate punishments.
Shortly after 18:45 a second accident occurred on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dating.
There was a collision between a car transporter and a car.
A rescue helicopter was on its way to the accident site.
Deutsche Bahn: Group tests "Comfort Check-in"
It's a moment that almost everyone has ever experienced: you're sitting in a train and sleeping.
Or you're deepened in his work and you're just having a brilliant thought.
And then, pufff.
Come the maker and wake up an unpleasant or pull the passenger in the middle of the workflow.
Road ticket control.
But the times of interruptions are soon over.
The Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the unsavory ticket control.
You simply confirm by phone that you take your place and thus devalue the ticket.
A test operation is currently running on two routes.
"Come on the offer, let's expand it.
It is expected to be available on many other long-distance routes in Germany at the beginning of next year," said one railway speaker.
"Comfort Check-in" calls the train the ticket cancellation without creators.
However, in order to be able to use it, some requirements need to be met: You need a smartphone or tablet.
And you must have booked an online ticket - what most passengers already do anyway.
You also have to buy it via the app of the train, the DB Navigator, which is the most convenient way of booking tickets.
And lastly you need a seat reservation.
Because the "Comfort Check-in" works like this: You get on the train, you call your ticket under "My Tickets".
A button for electronic devaluation will appear on the test customers.
The train attendants receive a notice on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and has taken the booked seat Y.
When checking the ticket he knows that a passenger with an already devalued online ticket is sitting there.
So you can continue to sleep, work on, keep quiet.
The "check-in" has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which in turn the passengers should use.
"If you want to travel by our train crew without ticket control, check the DB Navigator for yourself.
This enables passengers to make their travel time more personal in the train," says Michael Peterson, the marketing director of DB Fernverkehr.
Second Plus: "And our employees have more time than today to address individual customer needs".
Those who often drive rail know that in addition to delays and missed trains the ticket controls are among the greatest troubles.
Because often you have, in any case, one of the travellers does not have all the documents you need for the devaluing of online tickets.
Either the credit card or the identity card or any other document you have to show is missing.
The result is endless discussions between train attendants and passengers, which leads to a bad mood in the compartment or large space and delays in controlling your ticket and, at the end of the day, takes the time to look after other concerns.
Only a small number of test customers can still use the new service.
And that's only on the ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen connections.
Other train numbers on the same route are not yet fully accessible.
How did an activist come to learn the answer to the question, "Whose Streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to its core.
Just one day after she arrived in New York City, the St. Louis born in St. Louis sat on the bed of an Airbnb apartment that she rented and scrolled by Facebook on her phone.
She stumbled over a post from someone from high school.
"The police just killed an 18-year-old child, and it's still on the street," it said.
Confusioned that nobody else had posted the information on their feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the handle @TeePharoah was constantly retweet on their timeline.
The rapper from the area of St. Louis, the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old who was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo., to tweet live.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body, which was stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours.
"That's wild," Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new to her and her community.
She dropped off her phone to return later in the evening to Tweets about people on the Canfield Drive.
There were photos of the police band and people screaming, and of a man who claimed to be Brown's father, who carried a sign with the inscription: "Ferguson's police just killed my unarmed son!"
She watched a live feed where a police officer stood in front of a group of demonstrators with a calling dog.
In another video, she said, another cop rescued his rifle and shouted, "I'll kill you... animals all."
"This is not common," Ferrell recalled her statement.
"This is not the kind of murder that we used to use and which we can call typical."
At that moment, I felt shaking frost.
I was angry and wept."
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After the landing at 23:00, she took her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would drive to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the next three years is the subject of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?", in the cinemas from the 11th century onwards.
It is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resistance that consists of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to ask for answers.
When Ferrell drove to Ferguson with her daughter, who wore a flower dress and a matching crown, they discussed a conversation that they had countless times before this morning “about the black experience and the black state”.
"You remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe in?" she remembered what she said.
"We're going to Ferguson now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right.
I couldn't take her with me," Ferrell later said.
"What happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past.
She needs to know it and see it and be pulled up into it.
It must be well developed, not only activism and organization, but also know the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do in order to be free in order to free ourselves.
Even though I am lucky to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience blatant racism, she is no different from the next black woman-child.
I have the feeling that I would do her a bad job to keep her away from it."
The first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was located on South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police department that became a camp area when the activists waited for the possible non-attack of Officer Darren Wilson.
There Ferrell and her daughter joined a local business owner who did lunch.
They prepared bags and helped pass them on to demonstrators.
Slowly a new kind of activism began to take on Ferrell figure.
"My activism completely changed after 9 August," she said, noting that as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was president of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on eating justice and health inequalities in black communities.
"I had no experience organizing.
All of it has come."
Weeks later, Ferrell met during an evening demonstration of Sabah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the film.
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar only wanted to "document" what happened.
A question came to mind with Ferrell: "Do you want to document or do you try to find a story that you can take advantage of?"
This scepticism was fed by countless cases of people, often by whites, in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance.
As Folayan recently stated in an interview: "We had heard that people born and raised in Ferguson did not center their voices and we wanted to do it differently."
Folayan had already cooperated with Co-Director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism around death-gatherers.
His commitment brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other locals, followed the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years after Brown's shooting.
"This documentary isn't someone who speaks to us or speaks to us," said Davis.
"This was the main thing for me, as these people are represented, for so I shall be represented."
The goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - to show that the movement "is not a Messiah leader, but a community that comes together," said Folayan - she proved to be the most open participant in the film.
As a result, documents from "Whose Streets?" show surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life, how she falls in love and marries her wife.
"I felt like naked," Ferrell said, laughing when she saw the finished product for the first time.
"But I understood that there must be a certain vulnerability in this work and in the humanization of black people."
In addition, Ferrell's story repeats the role of black gay women in the broader Black Lives-Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement, who, after the killing of the black teen Trayvon Martin in 2012, marked the film "BlacklivesMatter" in social media, identify themselves as gay.
"Black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement overall," said Ferrell, "and therefore we fight constantly on different fronts.
Black, gay women must bear the main load of everything."
Folayan agreed to notice that "the movement is really kept up by black women and many black women".
It insists, however, that "this is not an affirmative type of action", in which Ferrell was selected as the heart of the film because of her identity.
"She was the person who ransacked up this energy," she said.
"It's not a coincidence, although she was on the front line, because in a life at these intersections as a black, gay woman is so much at stake.
You can feel their energy through the screen."
Meanwhile, the news cameras in Ferguson have long disappeared, but the racial connections between the community and the police continue to exist.
Ferrell is on probation for 21⁄2 years because of the blocking of a highway at a demonstration.
She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls her home: "A chaos".
Nevertheless, she clings to a singing and she feels committed to this memory since she went to Ferguson three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It's our duty to win.
We need to love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose - except our chains."
From "Tream" to "Größenwahn": TV readers discuss about bit gallery
The bit gallery moves people, although it is not built for a long time.
But the idea of a shopping center on the south end of the pedestrian zone has split the population in advocates and opponents since the first presentation 2009.
Coldly, the theme hardly leaves one.
The topic will also be discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg".
While one of them says to the bit gallery: "That would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be really great" (Nicole Sights), from the other side comes "no man" (siggi bets) or quite simply, "Größenwohn!" (Lars Scholz).
While the proponents build on the fact that a gallery attracts more customers to the city, of which the other businesses also benefit, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will then be bleeding out.
In addition: The gallery is planned exactly on the property on which the farmer's market hall stands, in which 13 direct marketers offer their products.
This will end with the construction work.
The gallery-makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - that is to the Beda Square with the possibility of sitting outside.
Simone Zimmer: "We have been buying almost weekly in the farm market hall for many years.
Mostly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the country women very much love to.
We also discovered the butchery for us.
We would like to see an opportunity to maintain this offer also during and above all after the construction of the gallery.
In other cities there are.
Above all, the Kleinmarkthalle in Frankfurt is interesting."
Gerd Densing: "Whether direct marketers settle in a market hall in the gallery, the amount of rent arrives.
But this is probably not exactly low in the new project."
Eva Kilic: "What shopping palaces in Bitburg?
Whether clothing, shoes, drugstores or supermarkets: I find it superfluous.
There's enough of that in our city.
You can see how many stores are empty here - some for months and years.
However, since there is not even a regular weekly market here, it is all the more important that we at least keep the market hall.
After all, the product offered there is fresh, most of it is offered directly by the producer and is priced at the top.
As you can see, shops in a shopping mall are only rented by larger companies, because the rents there are often not portable for a retailer.
Harm, special shops are almost no longer available, and what is left of them will probably disappear."
Wolf Fandel: "A shopping mall with a market hall does not fit for me.
And the gallery doesn't fit for Bitburg.
Above all: Where do you want the farm market hall to go during the construction period?
The old Edeka would be the solution - even permanent if the bit gallery comes eventually.
Or does the ghost of bit-galerie make it possible to distribute all the business from Bitburg before?"
George Marquet: "It just won't work.
And no one needs a shopping center that's empty.
In my opinion, it would have been better to promote a real farmer's market instead of this gallery.
But for a farm market hall, thanks to the madly many - as I find - useless construction projects in Bitburg no more space.
When the farm market hall is broken, a piece of culture will disappear again."
A matching similarity: Artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA
In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York there are many faces to see - white, black and brown, which are almost insignificant - hanging on cables from the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupfern and Haarschnitten, who were sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth Prison, where the former intelligence analyst arrested a 35-year imprisonment after making her public as a secret diplomatic news about WikiLeaks website.
The new exhibition, which was opened on 2 August, is called A Coming Resemblance (an appropriate similarity).
She is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline combined her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transwoman and groundbreaking dissident whose condemnation was converted from Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office.
Dewey-Hagborg has been created by the algorithmic analysis of DNA extracted by Manning, from the 30 portraits, how one might look with these genomic data, a sharp, though intellectual comment not only on the formability of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also on identity.
Manning, who was born Bradley Edward, but has already been openly talking about the identification as a woman since her puberty, was sentenced in 2013 for 20 charges, including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft.
Through the prison, her image was suppressed, so much that there was only a single photo - a grainy black and white selfie in which maning obviously sits unwell on a driver's seat and carries a platinum wig - with which she was associated.
In 2015 Dewey-Hagborg just came from the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.
In it the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigarette stump and gum by extracting DNA from the waste to create a picture of what these people could look like.
That was the time she received an email from a newspaper magazine.
"They conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," said Dewey-Hagborg at a press preview of the new exhibition.
And she couldn't be visited at that time and she couldn't be photographed, so you contacted Chelsea and asked if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned Muse became uneven friends of letters who over the course of two years exchanged several letters.
They even created a comic "Suppressed Images" illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which foretold a future in which President Chelsea's judgment would be converted and she would be able to see the exhibition personally.
In fact, that Obama would demand a release of Manning after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas was a welcome kind of happy meeting.
At the opening of the exhibition there is something deep and strong, as Donald Trump wages a war against informants from the government camp and against Transgender troops to find new, second-able ways to further ignite the rigid divisions he should actually fix.
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said that "things happen for a certain reason".
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning, with its oversized signature (the "i" in her family name, has a heart) demanded an end to "automatic fragmentation, the basis of which has been gender, race, sexuality and culture."
On the opposite wall is its mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousand-footer of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show by including the 200 letters (or nucleotide according to the highly developed scientific lexicon of the artist) how surprisingly similar, at least in biological terms, we are all.
"What people hope to take from this is that our genome does not care about who we are and how openly genetic data are for interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose 2007 video-work, Spurious Memories, is also on display.
"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so that's 30 of these stories."
The last piece in the exhibition, stored in a separate space, is a page from the comic novel mentioned above.
She shows Manning how she shows up with a freephone phone in her hand from the disciplinary caskets of the United States like King-Kong.
"If they cold your speech, they won," it says.
"Never hold your mouth."
"It came directly from a letter she wrote to me," said the artist, greeting from Philadelphia.
"I still get goose skin when I talk about it."
Manning hasn't seen the exhibition personally - just as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if it is to do so, then it will be welcomed by the masks in the middle of the room, by its own genomic simulations, which join together like hordes of protesters.
This was also targeted, as everything in the exhibition, up to the size (5" 2, Mannings Statur), in which their genetic haplop groups were written with pencil.
"In the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," said Dewey-Hagborg of the portraits.
"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea, like the movement that was also behind its liberation."
Professor of the University of Northwestern and an employee of Oxford University for killing
A national hunt is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee of Oxford University who is being sought as a suspect after a man was stabbed in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with fatal injuries.
On Monday, for Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) warrants were issued for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, as the acts of the District Court of Cook County show.
The documents say that Cornell-Duranlee, 26, died after several tricks.
A community warning system published by the Chicago Police Department states that the body was discovered on 27 July.
Officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body.
Cornell-Duranleau was declared dead at the place of the event, and detectives investigated the sticks as murder, while the police were actively looking for the two suspects, officials said.
Lathem has been an extraordinary professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, vice president of university relations, said in an e-mail statement that Lathem was now on leave and was excluded from entering the campus of Northwestern University.
"This is a criminal case under investigation by the competent authorities, and Northwestern University cooperates in this investigation," Cubbage said.
Warren is Senior Treasure Assistant at Oxford University.
In an e-mail statement from the University of Somerville College, a spokesperson said that "we are in contact with the UK police and ready to help the U.S. investigation authorities in any way we can imagine."
The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted him to sit down.
Chief Communications Officer Anthony Guglielmi, Chicago Police Department, said he urged the suspects to stand up to the authorities.
"The police have an idea of their whereabouts, and our efforts to locate them strengthen themselves," said Guglielmi.
Guglielmi said that local, regional and national authorities help find the suspects.
Guglielmi said the police received a call from the Grand Place building manager who had just received a mysterious tip saying that something had happened in apartment 1008.
The police described the scene as very cruel.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on 27 July.
It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi said.
The Grand Plaza management team published a statement to the residents: "The police are currently working on the timeline and the background of the victim and researches a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident."
"We will complete the WADA Roadmap in the near future" - Russian vice-premier Mutko
Russian vice-premier Vitaly Mutko said that it will not take long until the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) are implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti-doping agency (RUSADA).
"At a certain stage of meeting the roadmap criteria, RUSADA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).
The WADA Roadmap has been updated in this respect," Mutko said on Thursday.
The PM commented on the second part of the WADA Roadmap to comply with the Code, which describes the criteria for the re-establishment of RUSADA and has recently been published on the Organisation's website.
According to Mutko, he has nothing to worry about.
"All things have been announced, everything is being implemented.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future," he added.
However, one of the criteria set out in the list notes that the Russian anti-doping authorities have to accept publicly the reported results of the examination approved by WADA by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren on alleged state-funded dopings in Russian sport.
Regarding the matter, Mutko said: "We are conducting the investigation, as our anti-doping system has erred.
All measures have been implemented.
But there were no government programs, and we won't admit something that doesn't exist."
Mutko's words were in agreement with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of the independent Russian Anti-Doping Commission.
In conversation with the Russian sales office RSport at the beginning of the day, Smirnov added problems to the past in Russian anti-doping organizations, but then added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
Nobody has to accept this report unconditionally," added Smirnov.
In November 2015, RUSADA was excluded from carrying out doping controls in Russia during the Doping scandal of WADA.
However, it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping (UKAD).
After a visit to the headquarters of the organization in Moscow in July, WADA General Director Olivier Niggli stated that RUSADA is moving "in the right direction" to be re-established.
Aldi no longer sells eggs for the first time
This was shared by the groups of companies.
It is a purely prudent measure of caution that it cannot continue to be expected of any health impairment, as stated in the Communication.

The start-ups that will help your company not to become the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure the happiness of your e-commerce start-up with your employees, but the surveys did not work.
Answers were often vague, not helpful, or - even worse - fraudulent.
And even if you promised anonymity, some workers did not trust the process.
"There was simply no consistency and objectivity," said Erret, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care Company Madison Reed.
She called people from outside for help.
A new race of human resources startups is growing to help companies figure out how their employees feel.
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring the employee engagement, it allows companies to conduct surveys, address specific groups and demographic groups, offer employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases allow Whistlebloggers to bypass the C-Suite executives and to contact the Board directly.
"You now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for persecuting their health, but where is the fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employees' engagement.
Erret said that she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint.
In addition to the snap surveys and surveys of certain teams, it offers a heat card of the company that shows at a glance what units have most complaints and which managers have low consent results - so that you can drill down why.
Companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture must remain so that you will not become the next Uber who has been involved in scandals since a former employee has published a blog post describing an environment of harassments in which those who have spoken have been punished.
For start-ups like Glint, this desire is a lucrative business opportunity for an overview.
The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could have more than $11.7 billion in 2020, according to the financial website Let's Talk Payments.
Denver, Colorado, start-up converter, helping companies prevent and detect bad behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the middle of the Uber case in miscredit.
Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber has recently signed up as a client.
Like Glint, Convercent lets companies send tailor-made "pulls" surveys, collect real-time confidential answers and view the heat cards of your problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior.
And when the Chief Executive is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.
"The public opinion court has captured the regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and managing director of Convercent.
When a company is found that treats its employees badly or behaves unethically, it can experience costly consequences through consumer boycott, employee fluctuation and complaints, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 locations, has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have a simple way to reach their headquarters.
Earlier, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she would have to find a telephone number or e-mail for the company headquarters, file a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously.
It was often an intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesday's General Counsel, who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees.
Now that the company employs Convercent, problems that have previously been hidden and addressed by managers who have sat in offices in cities or states can be identified and addressed more quickly, such as discrimination, harassment or unfair practices.
"I can get closer to this holistic, 360-degree view of the experience with employment," said Vitrano, who heads the Risk Management Group of Ruby Tuesday.
"And we protect our shareholders from employment disputes."
Companies began to take ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously in 2002 after the accounting company Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations through the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.
But it took until the "social media came to their right" that companies recognized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry going online.
"Before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service and charge companies with recurring fees for the use of their products.
It's a business model and a chance that the agreement of Venture Capital Investors has supported both start-ups.
Convercent received $10 million in financing in February from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, which raised the total capital to $47 million.
Glitzern secured $10 million in November of Bessemer Venture partners and brought his entire financing to $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising given the networked nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
There is a growing complex of research that shows that today's employees expect more from their jobs than before.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only used.
The employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.
"If people are happy to be in a company, feel that their voices are heard, and that the work you do is worthwhile, then they feel more committed to making this company successful," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies run well. Companies run well when employees are involved and committed.
If the analytics tools third parties promise to increase the involvement and use of the employees, it is no wonder that you will find support.
The data about the employee engagement according to the experts of the workplace culture is important.
But the data are useless if the managers of a company do not take action.
In fact, if a company asks employee for your feedback, it may be expected that change is on the way.
And if change doesn't come quickly enough, or not at all, it can breed disappointments and motivate employees.
"If you are asking for 4,000 suggestions, you must be ready to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kotter International, which has seen companies that have too much to rely on collecting data.
"Because if you don't follow, employees will ask themselves, "Did you really hear me?
Do you care?
And who don't you worry about, why should I? "
Madison Reed, who is now carrying out monthly employee surveys, was able to launch measures on the same day when a problem is reported on Glint, says Ert.
And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company by the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, and to add a communication training to address the problems.
With Ruby Tuesday, the company is always getting new insights about its employees, and it hopes that in the long term, this will lead to a better bonding of employees in a sector known for high sales.
"If you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency, you will lose the people," said Vitrano.
"And if you lose people, you also lose customers.
And if you lose customers, then you will lose businesses.
The NCAA eliminates the two-day practices and makes a long day for the browns
It goes to 23:00 when a lot of UCLA football players talk on one side of the team's new field of practice on campus.
Some have removed their tricot upper parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp.
For a good part of the team, these inactive minutes are a lunch break.
Players who are enrolled in the summer courses will return to their final exams after the three hours of practice before returning to the Wasserman Football Center at 6:30 the next morning.
"This is a real treadmill for the boys for the next three days," said Bruins trainer Jim Mora shortly before Monday became Tuesday.
The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to facilitate the burden of players, and it has actually extended its days - at least until the final on Friday.
Therefore, the first three UCLA training sessions should begin at 19:15 in order to meet the already packed schedules of the players.
The compromise away from the two days is more than one day when the Bruins moved the start of the camp almost one week after the last season and carried out practical exercises during the summer school for the first time during Moras six times in Westwood.
They are scheduled to take 18 exercises during August. 20 before the formal preparations for their start against Texas A & M in September.
Mora said that he supported the NCAA's change of rules, even if it added another point to the highly skilled routes of the players.
"We're putting this huge load on them for three or four days, and it's very challenging," Mora said.
"And they just pushed it through, they pick themselves up, they're great people.
I think as soon as we get to Saturday and we have more time, it will really be great."
The UCLA will terminate its practices as soon as the camp is finished, which, in view of the clear vision lines of its fields, will not be an easy task in the face of an adjacent parking lot and the adjacent Luskin Center, a hotel of elevated class that has already been recruited with footballs, which would be a protective net behind a torso.
Bruins players should occupy the hotel from this weekend, but Mora admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season.
"We will use our security," said Mora.
"This is a real problem, and it's not far from coming to mind that people are renting a room there and then going there to plan to record an exercise.
If you have the videotape of an exercise, it is a pretty good business.
But we have security forces there, and we have security forces at car park 8.
We'll do the best we have.
That's why I'm not too worried.
We have a plan."
Facebook wants to intensify fact review in the fight against fake messages
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false reports to third-party auditors and then display their results under the original post, said the world’s largest online social network on Thursday. It’s one of his efforts to fight fake news.
In an opinion on its website, the company said that it will start with the use of updated machine learning methods to identify possible false reports and to send them to fact reviewers that may show results of the fact-finding from the original article.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news, many of which believe that they have also influenced the 2016 US presidential elections.
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe, with the French voters flooded with false stories in the run-up to the presidential elections in May, and Germany supports a plan to punish social media networks if they are unable to quickly eliminate hateful postings as before the elections there in September.
On Thursday, Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new facts review is being launched in the USA, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to knowing which stories are challenged by third party fact-controllers, people want more context to make sound decisions about what they read and share," said Sara Su, product manager for Facebook news in a blog.
She added that Facebook will continue to test its feature of the "related article" and work on other changes to his message feed to reduce incorrect messages.
Create a Comic Roman: A Castle in the History of England
In his recent past, the little Scotney Castle was on display in a Squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cozy seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent and has now become an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mofoic Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents.
"I think it's so nice to look at the handwriting of someone who's been dead for 300 years," he says.
"What a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand."
'A Castle in England' outlines the period from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scotney. Each story was illustrated by another emerging British artist - Isaac Lengiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It's not Rhodes' first book based on an archive: He wrote 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found unexpected emotional.
"I only responded to the thumb print on the side of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700s who worked for the Jacobins," he says.
"This is his thumbprint!
And letters always smelled like smoke, because at that time a fire was lit because of the light.
For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect, as if it were also there.
Oh, I love archives!"
For someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle for almost four months ("To be honest: I have overrated my welcome greeting") all this seems to be too nice to be true.
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, looking through the archives, and studying the castle's many treasures and curiosities, such as the mounted hyena heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the tomb.
He walked through the site and the ruins of the old castle and talked to landscapeists, gardeners and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.
Then, at night he drank "Whiskey and started writing".
The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown because the National Trust only received full access in 2006 when the last Erbin, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employees just started to take care of the archive he described as "the chickens of years in which aristocrats said "Oh, throw it on the attic".
Diaries, letters from the time of the English Empire, maps that represent who had something: "You might think that land conflicts would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a birch that fought for the two families.
Guys, let everything go his way!"
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to dive into English history on a broader basis, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381.
"There is a record of an uproar that appeared in the castle in 1380, in this book entitled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex'," says Rhodes.
"The peasant uprising began in this area and I thought a uprising was a good start.
Maybe they're connected to each other?"
Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like 'The Priest', which tells the story of the Jesuit priest who the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or 'The Smuggler', in which the smuggler Arthur Darrell was depicted from the 18th century, who staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery made only years later when his coffin was excavated).
The Darrells are Rhodes' favorite family of Scotney: "The gentlemen seemed to be pretty Gauners, to make debts and spend money on things they couldn't afford.
Other generations of Darrell men solved their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of good looking boys, with a talent to recruit."
After the end of his deployment in the castle Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences
He has spent a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel-Roman over Elämanmäki, the site of a Sanatorium from the early 20th century, which has since been called back by nature.
But Scotney has a special place for him.
"I was sad to go back," he says.
It was like, "Oh, now I have to finish the damn life again."
Campaign started: More than 300 years old Marienkapelle hidden in Rhöndorf
With the holding of the 301-year-old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf, the city of Bad Honnef launched its campaign on Friday to introduce a new roof mark (rundschau von Thursday).
Until Thursday, Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz will keep the logo and slogan secret.
At the end of August there is to be a festival on the island of Grafenwerth as a highlight of the campaign.
"Too nice for us.
Or?", the makers of the action have asked about the posters on the Rhöndorf chapel since yesterday.
"We don't really think that (of course!)," they write on their website, which was opened yesterday.
"But we use this measure to gain your attention.
And to make it clear that something is better than it seems.
We are basically firmly convinced that, as a Bad Honnefer citizens, we know very well about the beauty and appeal of our city."
The action is about more than "only" a logo and a slogan, it continues.
"It is important to make a single promise, one that gives the city an unmistakable unique character."
Finally, they compete with other municipalities.
A medium five-digit amount can be costed by the city of Bad Honnef its new roof brand and the campaign.
Military Reforms in Turkey - Erdogans Anxiety of the Army
In Ankara, each year at the beginning of August, the Supreme Military Council (YAS) advises on retirement and transport in the Officer Corps.
So is this week.
At first glance, a normal process.
But nothing is routine among Turkish forces a year after the coup.
The meeting was no longer held in the General Staff building, as before, but in the Prime Minister's office.
Under the chairmanship of the Head of Government, the five vice-premiers as well as the Ministers for Defence, Home Affairs, Justice and Foreign Affairs took part in the deliberations.
This meant that the civilians in YAS were in abundance.
The government attracts the reins in the military.
Although General Staff Officer Hulsi Akar remains in office, the commanders of the army, the Air Forces and the Navy were dismissed.
Since the failed coup, Chief of State has fired Erdogan 169 of the 326 generals and admirals.
More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of the exile preacher Fethullah Gülen, who sees Erdogan as the wiredriver of the coup test.
Against 486 persons who should have been directly involved in the coup trial, negotiations have been taking place in Ankara since this week.
On the day after the coup, Erdogan had called the attempt to overthrow him as a "God gift" because he gave him the opportunity to "clean the forces completely".
But does Erdogan really have a grip on the army?
At the end of February, the newspaper "Hürriyet" published an article entitled "Unhavior in the Military headquarters".
In the general staff there are concerns about an increasing "Islamization" of the army, which manifest itself, among other things, in the lifting of the headache ban for soldiers, the newspaper wrote.
In any case, the big cleaning of the army and the security forces continues.
In mid-July, Erdogan fired another 7395 public servants by decree, including 2303 police officers and 546 soldiers.
It seemed as if Erdogan had tamed the military.
The generals used to be considered as the real masters of the country.
Three times they drew attention to their role as guardians of the worldly state order.
After his 2002 election, Erdogan pushed back the power of the military step by step, not least in response to the European Union's reform targets.
Former officers say that Erdogan is moving towards the Islamization of the armed forces.
In the magazine "Vocal Europe", a not-called officer, who sought asylum for fear of persecution abroad, warned that the Turkish army would be "full extremists and Salafists" in a few years.
If this is true, such a development could not leave NATO cold.
In any case, after the cleansing of the alliance, there are doubts about the willingness of the Turkish army to use it.
The management structures and operational skills are "weaked", say Nato diplomats.
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
There will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card, said President Donald Trump, quoted by the media.
It provides for a reduction of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, more stringent rules for obtaining visas for a temporary work permit and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the President.
The draft law is to be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, increase wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers and will do so by changing the way the US is spending the green cards to citizens from other countries."
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system.
This new application procedure will benefit candidates who speak English, who have the financial resources to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy," said Trump, quoted by the American media.
Ministry wants to repair route for Rennsteigshuttle
Time and again in recent months, the future of the race-step shuttle has been disputed - now it is to be done very quickly.
Even before the end of the year, it is planned to be built on the maritime route on which the tourist railway runs.
In order to ensure the long-term future of the Rennsteigshuttle, according to the Ministry of Transport, construction work on the route will continue this year.
"With the decision to continue ordering and renovating the Ilmenau-Rennsteig route, the country is committed to this particularly important connection for tourism," said transport state secretary Klaus Sühl on Friday in Erfurt.
The cost of repairing the route amounted to approximately 2.5 million euros.
Of this sum, the country takes over 75 percent.
The contract, on the basis of which the shuttle is to be ordered by the country in the future, is currently finally being voted, explained Sühl.
The Ministry and the South Thuringia Railway as an operator have already agreed on the technical details.
"This means that the roadmap, the vehicles used and the quality standards are negotiated," Sühl said.
The planned contract between the Ministry and the Railway Company will be concluded for a period of eleven years.
This means that the race platform shuttle was to be ordered regularly on December 2017.
The Rennsteig shuttle is a popular rail link between Ilmenau and Rennsteig stations, especially for tourists.
In recent months, a pilot company has tested whether the route is used by a sufficient number of people to order it again regularly in the future.
The route is also highly construction-related in parts.
The rise of sex-roboters is real, and we should worry about
Just when you thought it couldn't get even more crazy in 2017, a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots comes.
Yeah, actually.
Sex robots are a big thing right now.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharpy, emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we must begin to take their rise seriously.
Customers can choose the robot's eye color, the shape of the breast wax and the type of fingernail.
"People are making fun of them, but the companies are delivering a lot of them, and we will get to see them even more often," said Mr. Sharpy on the publication of his new report.
Modern sex dolls have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence.
The user can also "adjust" his robot according to his convictions and select everything from the robot's eye color to the shape of the chest warts to the type or color of his fingernails.
But it will be even more disturbing, as many robots have the "personalities" that would make a Stepford woman look progressive.
Modern sex dolls have developed into robots with a silicone skin.
For example, the RealBotix robot allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing, such as shyness.
And then there are the Roxxy Gold-Roboter, developed by True Companion, with pre-programmed personalities such as "Frigid Farrah", who convey the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "abendurable" personality.
"Roxxy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as well as possible", the True Companion website is a warmer one.
So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.
She also has her moods during the day - quite like real people!
She can be tired, fixed to conversation, or can be "in mood"!"
There are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robbers - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sublime female characteristics, the allusions to rape, when you go a step on Frigid (here's adversary) Farrah, one is most concerned.
On his website, True Companion Roxxy compared with a vibrator, but for men.
"If women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can't men have Roxxy?" it says on the website.
However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just a different sex toy.
Their emergence and their increasing refinery point to something dark and deeper in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition.
Most men will of course not keep sex robots, and while the FRR notes its growing popularity, they still remain at the edge of consumer culture for the time being.
But what cuts through the marginal zones can be very instructive in relation to the spirit of time in which we live.
And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market gives them permission to do so.
There is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots appear at a time when the rights of women worldwide are threatened, in which there is a president in the White House who has advocated sexual attack on women.
The most daunting aspect of the television series 'The Handmaid's Tale' ('The Magd report') is not the graphic images, the intertwined bodies and the outcast eyes, but how realistic this vision works.
The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment this does not feel like a great leap.
The goal behind these sex robbers is to make physical resemblance to actual women as realistic as possible (although with pornstar proportions).
Their builders want them to feel human that they are imitating the movement of a real body.
But, put to the point when it comes to their "personalities", the robots do not represent real women.
They cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply leave.
They have no mediation or a background story, nothing that suggests independence or anything that could disrupt the imagination of total submission.
In other words, they are decent slaves.
Or to express it in the speech of 2017: maids
Trump's great performance?
He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of common sense
It has become a signification of the Trump era that the political divisions that polarized the US election have also divided families in small format.
Around Christmas and Christmas Day, the U.S. newspapers gave advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump’s chosen relatives.
We are all supposed to have our filter bubbles burst.
Less noted is the power of Trump to bring families together.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-wing poet who lives in Chicago and has been working with the Republicans in our family for a long time, visited me this week in New York.
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican relatives with whom she had struggled for decades for politics, is suddenly and quite peculiarly on the same side.
This is certainly a good thing about the dining table, but I see in a further context that this also entails significant risks.
The left was strengthened by Trump, but the appalling effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.
When we speak of "normalization" and Trump, we are referring to the terrible possibility that one day his kittens will no longer repel us.
There is, however, an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump Republican of the right wing "normalizes" which suddenly appear to be the epitome of reasonableness in comparison to its standards.
Today I find myself affected by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's hilarious version of the mad - the dog on the roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew what his tax return looked like) - both of which, compared to Trump, actually occur as a very mild crime.
If Trump goes, the next candidate of the Republican must be spiritually healthy in order to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.
When my cousins were in town, we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park, the largest carousel in the New York Park Department, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need a caffeine.
The horses are enormously large, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all the clowns are crunchy and the animals twist to look full of fear over their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climbing music conveys this in a strange way.
So many clichés of a city disappointed: the views of high buildings become old, the skylines become too familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city does not meet the dream.
Thirty-five years later, and I'm still not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is in fact not a Swiss cottage - the theme-Pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage does not count - but rather a large circular traffic in the north of London.
However, the Central Park Carousel is still a strange magical experience, as there can be two two years old, one 11-year-old and two women in the 40s and everyone has a great time.
If I could have rated the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately no one asked for it.
On the other hand, this week in a department store, I was forced to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale from one to five stars before I could move through my credit card.
In the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same, plus the option to balance the rating with a 15% tip - this to buy something over the shop table.
This not only leads to a slowing down of what should actually be a neutral exchange, but also to pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is necessary.
The poor woman in the department store was apologisingly grinning, while I was tired of having the experience of giving her my credit card with five stars.
Oscar Pistorius moved from prison to hospital with chest pain
Pistorius has for the second time left prison for a hospital visit.
Last year, he was taken to the hospital for the treatment of cuts at his wrists, which he said he suffered from prison authorities after a case in his cell.
Pistorius was sentenced to a first death sentence for murder after an appeal by the prosecutors.
He killed Steenkamp in the early morning hours of Valentine's Day 2013 by shooting her several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed that he thought his girlfriend was a nocturnal intruder who was hiding in the cabin.
The prosecutors have announced their intention to file this time against the six-year sentence of Pistorius Appeal, of which they say it is too thoughtful.
The National Enforcement Authority said it would object to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the opposition could be heard this year.
Pistorius is in danger of his punishment being increased to 15 years if the prosecutors are successful.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
When Bauer Arnold finds a strange egg
As the last of the Blumberg schools, the fourth graders from Fützen and Epfenhofen were released into the holidays and into the secondary schools.
Three of the redundancies will go to the gymnasium in the future, four to the real school.
Headmaster Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürgerhaus Biesental in Epfenhofen on Tuesday evening.
The 29 students of the four classes under the direction of Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder chose a young eagle who grows up in the chicken farm but is then released into freedom.
In addition, the mint crowd performed a musical titled "The Eagle in the Chicken Court".
Bauer Arnold found a strange egg, and had it hatched by his chickens.
Instead of a chicken chick, a little eagle came out.
But the hope of making a chicken out of him broke down, and the eagle spread its wings on a high mountain, and disappeared.
After that, classes three and four showed a chicken dance in the study of Yvonne Frank.
The hens danced with the young golfers who carried cylinders around the bet.
The eagle stands for integration, said headmaster Angelika Sitte.
Although the youngster is different from the other chicks, they belong to it.
But he will never be like a chicken.
His determination was to be free.
She wished every fourth grader that he felt accepted in his new school.
It was followed by thanks to the former headmaster Michael Müller, who always comes in at school-levels, and the parents.
The cooking period is now over, explained class teacher Sophia Schumacher.
After two years of teaching, she left her students very reluctant because it was a really great time.
In the end, she had been able to rely on the fourth graders.
Finally, all students made a song of summer time and holiday season sound.
There was great joy among the children.
For the new school year, eight first graders have already been registered.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians were detained for illegal camping in Greece, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, quoted by television, reported.
On the morning of August 1st, a group of illegal-seating people was arrested in Sithonia by the police, including the two Bulgarians.
On the same day, they were released while an investigation is currently under way.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported that the Bulgarians were released later.
The Greek authorities have tightened control of the free camp and have fined anyone who is found to remain in a place that is not intended for this purpose.
The checks will continue throughout the season.
The Ministry said that the court can impose a fine.
Software Update for Diesel Vehicles: What the data subjects need to know now
How exactly does the software update take place?
Do Diesel drivers have to participate in the action?
The most important questions and answers at a glance.
At the Diesel Summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of about 5.3 million cars.
They are intended to improve the exhaust behaviour of emissions-class cars Euro 5 and partly Euro 6.
Euro-4 diesel or worse are excluded.
Anja Smetanin of the ACE Auto Club Europa gives reviews:
Is the new action mandatory?
No, the negotiated software updates are voluntary.
"The mandatory updates previously only apply to the vehicles that have foam software," says Anja Smetanin.
Its retrofitting has ordered the Federal Power Agency (KBA).
How and when will customers be informed about updates?
Manufacturers have announced rapid implementation over the next few months, but have not yet stated a precise date.
Daimler has indicated that he has written to each person concerned.
If an inspection has been carried out, it will be done within the framework.
How long should the upgrades overall progress?
"To say hard," says Smetanin.
This depends on the commitment of manufacturers and on political pressure.
"For we have seen that car manufacturers are not acting voluntarily on environmental issues."
How long should the update take?
The conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop.
It could be more time-consuming to get an appointment.
What do drivers who don't drive BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW group do?
The ACE advises to wait.
It is believed that foreign producers would investigate, according to Smetanin.
Is there now a massive price decline of Euro-4 cars?
The ACE fears that.
But just in the regions where driving bans threaten.
In rural areas, there has been no loss of value for older diesels.
The ACE advises to wait for a sale.
LL Cool J receives Kennedy Center award
Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington.
The first prize ceremony under President Trump promises to become political.
One of the winners doesn't want to come - out of protest.
LL Cool J (49) is the first rapper to receive one of the coveted awards of the renowned Kennedy Center.
This year, singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68) and choreographer Carmen de Lavallade (86) and the TV producer Norman Lear (95) are among the honours.
The awards will be presented at the beginning of December.
Traditionally, US President Donald Trump will host a reception and join his wife Melania in the ceremony.
The award winner Lear, known with progressive TV series, has already announced that he will not participate in the Gala.
The "New York Times" he said: "This presidency has decided to neglect the arts and human rights completely - even to withdraw the funds from them - and that burdenes me".
The 59-year-old Estefan stressed that she would use the conversation with Trump to clarify her perspective.
The Kennedy Centre, named after former President John F. Kennedy, is the largest cultural institution in the U.S. capital.
Previous winners include Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks and Sting.
We make the city worth living
Roland Wacker, Haslach's city builder, will retire next year.
The job is already under way, but suitable candidates are rare.
==References====External links==
And the work is still great fun for him, as he does in the press interview.
He reports various but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor.
At the same time, he is surprised that no application has yet fulfilled the requirements profile.
The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time.
Thus, taking into account the regular notice periods, there is still enough time for an update.
Since Haslach acts as a lower civil law authority for the administrative community, the applicant must provide the necessary conclusions.
Because this function definitely wants to keep the city.
If they could no longer fill them, the citizens would have to go to Offenburg for consultation.
But closeness to citizens is important to the city and to it itself, says Wacker, who reports about a good operating climate and good mood between authorities and citizens.
In more than 30 years in office, a number of important projects have gathered, which Wacker looks back on with pride.
"We make the city worth living," he is sure about the construction office and its employees.
In the future, however, diverse projects will also be on the agenda: The transformation of the former Hulla area and the Niederhofenparkplatz, for example, have taken place.
The Kinzig bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is renewed, and the stadium renovation is still the subject.
Only the latter will beat with around 1.5 million euros, "if we do it right," is Wacker valued.
"All in all, great tasks await my successor.
The work here is fun."
A large room is available for a city builder.
Haslach's own construction yard and gardening could be used to react to a lot of things quite flexibly.
"You can move a lot," says Wacker, and the design of greenery is often mentioned by citizens and visitors.
Since the old town as an ensemble is under the protection of monuments, it is important to "have an eye to what fits in" when new buildings are approved, emphasizes the separating city master.
After all, the city builder has a high responsibility.
He's a builder, "in the end everything runs over my table."
With support and coordination he can count on long-term employees: Markus Neumaier (Hochbau) has been there for ten years, Manfred Schöner (Diefbau) has been there for 15 years.
Also, that his successor remains for a long time, Wacker wishes: "We are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the place".
For continuity is not only important for a good operating climate, but also for the further design of the city.
According to the information of the city of Haslach, if Roland Wacker wants to inherit, he should be able to present a completed degree as a diploma engineer or Bachelor with architecture and have good expertise in the fields of construction planning and construction planning.
The urban building office is under construction, construction planning, basic acquisitions, administration of the urban properties, urban farm with construction yard and town gardening as well as lower construction law, including monument protection.
Bicycle thrown on lines: South Railway line locked
According to police, the so far unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bike on the lines from the train crossing in the Leoben street (B116).
These were so damaged that the nearest freight train had to be stopped.
The investigators go out of two male perpetrators and have been looking for them since the night hours.
Near the crime scene a rosarot scooter and a bicycle driver had been observed by witnesses.
"This goes far beyond a ravine stroke," said ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch to the APA.
He or the perpetrators would have put themselves at great risk and also threatened train traffic.
In addition to the damage to the locomotive and to the system, as well as the delay minutes and the costs of rail transport, the railway customers could also be exposed to the perpetrators.
In total, the speaker said that a "significant" sum should be taken into account.
The damage was remedied on Friday afternoon, and rail traffic on the South Railway could be managed without obstacles.
Nearly ten passenger trains had been lost on Friday morning, two of them covered long distance transport.
freight trains did not fall out, but they were late.
According to ÖBB-Sprecher Christoph Posch, some 200 meters of overheads had to be exchanged.
Insulators and masts were also damaged.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help relieve IBD (inflammatory intestine disease)
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.
But a new study states exactly the opposite: A diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could relieve the symptoms of patients with inflammatory intestine diseases.
The incurable condition, which affects around 1.3 million in the USA and 300,000 in the UK, causes stomach cramps and bloating, recurring or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
While those affected are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products in order to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine.
The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells in the intestine patrol to ensure that harmful microbes hiding in the food do not penetrate into the body.
Cells capable of causing inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance tends too far towards inflammation, this may result in inflammatory intestine disease.
Experiments found that some kind of tolerance-promoting immune cells occur in mice carrying a certain bacterium in their guts.
And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of cells.
Professor Colonna said: "We have established a link between a bacterial type - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestine microbiom, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had these immune cells".
He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan promote more tolerant, less inflammatory intestine environments, if the same system also works in humans.
Postdoctoral Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found out that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same strain, which was, however, separated, did not have this.
She suspected that the difference had to do with the intestines of mice - the community of bacteria, viruses and mushrooms that normally live in the gastric tract.
The worms of the mice were DNA-sequenced and six bacteria were found in the mice with the immune cells, but without they were missing in the mice.
Mouses were raised in a sterile environment, so that they lacked a gut microbiom and did not develop this type of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells.
In order to understand how the bacteria affected the immune system, the researchers had L. reuteri grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - to immature immune cells that were isolated from the mice.
The immune cells developed into the tolerant cells.
When the active component was cleaned from the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism, known as indol-3-milchic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the feeding of the mice, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophan values were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our stomach-intestinal tracts.
It is not known whether tryptophan side products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan have been found in humans with inflammatory intestine disease.
She said, "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote, as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine.
Potentially, high tryptophan values in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an extension of this population."
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United and Nemanja Matic have committed a "genie"
At Manchester United, Nemanja Matic signed a "genie", Jose Mourinho believes after the midfielder made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening.
The 40 million pounds signature of Chelsea began with a 2:1 victory in Dublin, the last pre-season game before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid began on Tuesday, and impressed in the holder role, when people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira marched for popularity.
Matic, however, had been excluded from the blues' preparatory Asia tour and only managed 45 minutes, which Mourinho admitted that he had to improve before the Premier League season began.
"He needs time, but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," said Mourinho.
"We will help him to be ready sooner than later."
In addition to Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku started at the Aviv Stadium when Mourinho formed his start-xI for the beginning of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wished for three more new commitments, but he insisted that the club had already done a "fantadic work" to fulfil three of its four priority new obligations.
"To get three out of four, I thank the association," he added.
"I'll be happier if they get four out of four for me, but they've made a lot of effort."
Boeing "paint" Dreamliner in the sky
The US aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the silhouette of a dreamliner into the sky.
The pilots flew from Seattle in Washington, Washington, but the drawing began in Marquete in Michigan, United States, and moved in the form of a dreamliner across the USA, which is several thousand kilometers.
The action lasted 18 hours and one minute.
On radar screens, the shape of a dreamliner was to be.
The whole thing was a endurance test for new engines.
Boeing had already made such advertising.
Thus the number "787" and the Boeing logo were painted into the sky.
New low for Martin Schulz - Hannover, we have a problem
As the wind turns: when Sigmar Gabriel was still SPD chief, Social-Democrat Prime Minister before elections always looked at Berlin with a certain concern.
It was the most important wish of the electorate.
Since Martin Schulz held the party, this has changed fundamentally.
Since then, the employees from the Willy-Brandt-Haus have been watching with increasing horror the events in the SPD-controlled state capitals.
What Schulz has got from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described in the approach with counterwind.
It was a setback.
And one by one.
After the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony, the Bundes-CDU sees a general signal against coalitions of SPD and Greens.
"This shows once again: Red-Green simply can't rule reliably," said CDU Secretary General Peter Tauber of the editorial network Germany (RND).
The surprise of a Green Deputy, the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) has fallen into a serious crisis.
Five months before the Landtag election, his red-green coalition lost its one-voice majority to the opposition from CDU and FDP.
The Green Federal Managing Director Michael Kellner has asked the retired Lower Saxony Green Member Elke Twesten to return their mandate.
The transition to the CDU means a clear falsification of the voter's will.
Each Twesten must immediately return its mandate," said the Federal Managing Director and election leader of the Greens to the editorial network Germany (RND).
"It must not be true at all," sighs a SPD election fighter, when on Friday morning the new Hiobs message reaches the party headquarters.
Stephan Weil, SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony, is standing to the CDU without a majority of government after the change of Green Deputies to Elke Twesten.
It is the preliminary highlight of a number of large and small crises in SPD country associations.
And no one knows what's next.
The abuse began with the unexpected clear defeat at the Saarland election in March.
A blue eye, that's all, calmed down the comrades back then.
After the Landtag elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia, everything will be different.
It did - and everything got much worse.
The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into the tumble, the Düsseldorf-Pleite killed the party smoothly.
In the weeks following, the comrades got up tired.
Then, when they had just created new courage, the G-20 summit came from Hamburg.
And with him came the next downfall.
Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD countryman, lost his Nimbus on that weekend because he was in the Elbphilharmonie while his city burned.
And because in crisis communication after that, he was doing pretty much everything that can be done wrong.
Since then Scholz has been fighting for his political survival.
So now Stephan Weil.
Because of the VW exhaust and its role in the Supervisory Board, the Lower Saxony Prime Minister has been criticised for a long time.
Mystical figures have been added.
Nevertheless, or perhaps precisely because of this, Because over the past weeks, we have been trying more and more to accentuate in the covenant.
The aim of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin was not to hide comrades in the vicinity of Martin Schulz.
They let him be granted because they promised to stabilize the party from time to time.
Now the exact opposite could occur.
Weil is basically not at fault with the internal competition of the Lower Saxony Greens.
And Schulz hasn't.
At the same time, the comrades are trying to keep their own ranks closed.
Her anger is directed towards the Greens, and above all to the abject Parliamentary Twesten.
"It is unbearable and harmful to democracy, as Mrs Twesten puts her own career interests about the interests of all others," says Matthias Miersch, head of the party links in the SPD-Bundestagsfraktion, the editorial network Germany (RND).
Mrs Twesten has been elected to parliament not because of her person as a direct candidate but because of the country list of the Lower Saxony Greens, the Lower Saxony MP continues.
The logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate.
Thomas Oppermann, head of the SPD-Bundestagsfraktion, laments an "undemocratic maneuver".
"The voter's will four years ago was clear: The people made Stephan Weil the Prime Minister," says Oppermann, who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as a top candidate in the Bundestag election, the RND.
"Now the personal career thinking of a future CDU member is falsifying the election result," continued Oppermann.
He called for the background to be clarified.
I want to know if there has been more or if there have been further commitments from the CDU Lower Saxony.
Funding for local centres III
Anyone who wants to renovate his house into the years can soon get support from the country.
The mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of STEG informed city development on Wednesday in Empfingen.
At the beginning of the information event Schindler once again looked back at the so far happening.
Since 1991 there have been rehabilitation areas in Empfingen.
At the time, from 1991 to 2004, the state of Baden-Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding.
In the rehabilitation area II from 2005 to 2016, the grant was still 60 percent.
For Schindler, the renovations to date are a "success" project - it is finally important to promote internal development as well, and not just to open up new construction areas.
On April 4th, one received from the government president Karlsruhe the information that there will be a renovation zone III.
The grant amounted to 833 333 euros, of which 500 000 euros were from the country, the rest from the municipality of Empfingen.
How does a renovation area come about?
One will, as Schindler continues, investigate where the "real old" houses are.
It also plays a role in renovating whether there is any interest in the planned area.
Where appropriate, the territorial borders could then be shifted again.
The STEG represented Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel on Wednesday evening.
Keller presented the contents of the federal state programme "Social City", in which the renovations would then be carried out.
The core of the programme is the revitalisation of inner cities, the improvement of housing and working conditions and the maintenance and expansion of infrastructure.
The measures would relate to objects, i.e. per plot.
Finally, the area of renovation would be defined as a statute.
Since 1 January 2017, the eligibility period for the funding will run until 30 April 2026.
However, until September of this year, the inventory would be carried out only once, in the context of which the parties to the reorganisation area will receive a questionnaire to be completed.
In November or December, the decision on the Statute will be taken as far as possible in order to start the reorganisations in the coming year.
Pietzschmann then explained that each municipality had to carry out the above-mentioned preliminary investigations.
It is a question of evaluating the urban malaise and deciding when to renovate and to what extent.
A renovation note will then be entered in the basic book for the respective property.
Pietzschmann himself will come to Empfingen again and take a picture of the situation, she promised.
Gotzel stressed that the project’s participation was an important factor in success.
Therefore, there will be questionnaires sent by post to citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled in until the end of the summer holidays.
The yellow questionnaire is the "Building and Landing Arch", in which it deals, among other things, with the structural condition and the restoration prospects.
In the grey questionnaire, the "house and apartment sheet", information about the size, division and inhabitants of a living room can be made.
The blue "operator's sheet" shall be completed only if business premises are operated in the building.
However, it should be noted that Gotzel points out that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time a request for funding.
Furthermore, new construction measures were not eligible.
Schindler also stressed that the distribution of funding functions according to the "wind dog principle" - who first comes, eats first.
You can't "reserve" funding for later.
Finally, photos of the project "Statskern II" were shown to make the present "fragrant" a renovation.
British inventor sets himself a microchip to come with a hand movement in house and car
A British inventor is the first in the country equipped with a microchip to open his door, enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement.
Steven Northam, 33, had implanted the tiny chip between thumbs and toe fingers and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company BioTeq.
He has joined Dr. Geoff Watson, a consultative anaesthetic at Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out according to medical standards.
The technology resembles a cat and dogs implanted microchip and takes only 30 seconds.
Mr. Northam's company also wants to change the locks on houses and cars in such a way that they are compatible with the chip, anything at a surcharge of £300 per lock.
The married father of one has now built both at home and at his BMW Z4 technology, which begins when his hand is on the wheel.
The advertising costs of the White House cost taxpayers thousands
The White House's decision to fly a marine helicopter to the South Lawn for an event that highlights American production last month costs taxpayers up to $24,000 according to the military's figures left to the TIME magazine.
The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the President is on board, was the heart of the event on July 17 in the White House with American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence, and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries.
The connecticut helicopter was displayed next to a Maine yacht, a Wisconsin fire brigade and a Mississippi forklift.
The White House military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmented order or FRAGO, hardly 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, after the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter.
"I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility," wrote the commander of the HMX-1 on the eve of the event to his superior, the Deputy Marine Commander for Aviation.
The news showed that the helicopter arrived at the South Law on 17 July at 7 a.m. for the event at 3 p.m. and stayed until the lawn was cleared between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. this evening.
The note adds that if departure from the White House were to be delayed, a second team would be needed for the return flight due to the restriction of hours of service.
The original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event, while the unit's security staff remained on the ground during the time on the ground.
It was not clear from the records made available by the TIME whether a second flight crew was ultimately required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal workers from using state property for political purposes.
Data sets show that HMX-1 asked if the event could violate the provision.
"A question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case," the commander wrote.
"Sounds like you're locked," replied the deputy commander.
The event "Made in America" was called official by the White House and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.
But also official events have political overtones.
At the event, the President launched the reform of the health reform that was under way in the Senate, and he promoted efforts to reduce government legislation.
The use of the aircraft, known as the Marine One or Air Force One, for politically beneficial purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are obliged to use them for the journey.
But to request their use only for a photo-OP is unusual.
Trump carried out an investigation in February, when the Presidential Plane carried out taxi services against the background of his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account is full of news that is appalling itself about the use of the presidential aircraft by its predecessor.
"The White House is enthusiastic about the show "Made In America" - the products from all 50 states produced by American workers with American materials," said Lindsay Walters, deputy press secretary of the White House.
HMX-1 crews often perform training flights in the Washington and South Lawn area to stop the US President in the White House with precise centimeter rates.
When Trump was at the beginning of July at the G20 summit in Germany, HMX-1 carried out 58 exercise landings in the White House.
The flight for the "Made in America" event was included in the training needs of the flight crew for the month, said an official.
Helicopter units also flew 11 hours on this day for "non-Presidency support missions".
The White House said that taxpayers took over the burden for none of the other props presented at the event.
A spokesman from Sikorsky said that the company had not been involved in exhibiting the helicopter on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 has no budget records for presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
However, according to hourly rates of the US Department of Defense for the financial year 2017, the DoD refund for the VH-3D amounts to 24,380 USD per hour of flight.
The flight time of the aircraft is recorded as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.
The White House argues that the actual costs for the operation of the helicopter are well below this rate.
"The cost of taxpayers on the basis of estimates for refund rates is highly misleading," Walters said.
"These estimates include personnel, maintenance and many other hidden costs, which are included in the annual funds."
According to a 2015 RAND study, the refund rates for DoD do not include the personnel costs, but take into account the cost of fuel, maintenance and contract conclusion.
At that time, the former press speaker of the White House, Sean Spicer, defended the use of the helicopter for the event.
"The idea is to present things made in America this week," Spicer said.
"And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security, and I assume that hundreds, if not thousands of people, are dependent on it.
And I think, like most Americans, we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment, for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly.
It is of course appropriate to highlight this."
It was not clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter when he entered his tour over the South Lawn for the event, but he sat in the driver's seat of a firearm car.
In the White House, Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and joked with the media about his own fleet of corporate products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the president, "I have three of them."
TC BW News in front of tricky task
The top-ranking leader of the Second Tennis-Bundesliga occurs at the table three Searchsdorfer SV.
The TC Blau-Weiss Neuss will arrive in Kiel tomorrow from 11 a.m. on the table third Searchsdorfer SV.
Despite five games still flawless balance sheet, the leader of the Second Tennis-Bundesliga has gained the sense of reality.
Team chief Marius Zay has any respect for the opponent.
"This is a compact team that always plays in a similar format.
I think the team is very good at the rear positions."
For class and stability at the Searchsdorfer SV, imports from the high north mainly provide.
"The Danes and Finns can even refer to stakes in the Davis Cup.
And they are also strong in doubles," says Zay, looking at Harri Heliovaara (Finland), Andre Göransson (Sweden), Sören and Esben Olesen, Martin Pedersen and Andreas Bjerrehus (all Denmark).
"It'll be hard for us as always.
You also need a good portion of luck."
The Neusser team for the trip to the high north is practical.
His debut for blue and white could give Maxime Janvier.
If the current Challenger Tournament in the Italian Biella active Frenchman does not join the Bundesliga Party, Zdenek Kolar (Czech) who plays in the Czech Liberec will come to his first appearance this season.
The so far uninhibited Chilean Hans Podlipnik-Castillo was at the ATP tournament in Kitzbühel on the ball yesterday with the Belarusian Andrei Vasilevski.
He should be there in Kiel as well as Botic Van de Zandschulp, Niels Lootsma (both Netherlands) and the Belgian Julien Cagnina.
After his two wins last Sunday against the club on the Alster, Máté Valkusz could also join the team again.
If it is not enough for the 18-year-old Hungary, who was the number one of the junior world rankings in January 2016, someone from the coach staff around Marius Zay will fill up the cadre.
How America can damage the OMV
Donald Trump did not really work happily when he signed the law to tighten sanctions against Russia on Wednesday evening.
"In his Hast to pass the Law," Congress packed a few "constitutional rules", he valued.
The response from Moscow was also as sharp as expected, and even Brussels shuddered against the US advance.
After all, the draft is designed to punish European companies that help Russians build gas pipelines into the EU.
Since then, investors of the local OMV, who together with other European companies are worried about the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea line Nord Stream 2.
The dry cult is huge.
Nevertheless, it is too early for an assessment of the consequences, according to the official statement of the oil group.
In fact, Donald Trump himself would have to bring the sanctions to life by means of an executive order.
Twelve weapons are available for his choice.
"The press" has considered which of the Group could defend itself and which could really hurt him.
Narcos Season 3 Trailer: Without Pablo Escobar, the Cali Cartel is centered in the hit series of Netflix
Despite the second season of Narcos, which Pablo Escobars Killer reveals, the series of Netflix is not over for a long time.
The seasons three and four were already confirmed by the streaming service, the first received their first trailer and showed the latest evilweights of the show.
With the third season, the DEA has focused its attention on the richest organization of the world's drug trade: the Cali cartel.
Headed by four powerful fathers, they operate "like a Fortune 500 company" only with more government bribes and violent actions.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is her head, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) commands the Mexican connection, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) is located in New York.
In the newly published trailer Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, inviting the American and Colombian law enforcement authorities to support the war on drugs.
Other new actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos will begin on September 1st.
Role backward: The city provides 46 kitchen aids
The city organizes the day table itself.
With fixed contacts for the children and a assignment to the team.
The clock is turned back in the city's day-care facilities.
On 1 September, the city of Krefeld will take over the food supply in the urban day care facilities (Kitas) again in its own right.
For Sonja Pommeranz, Deputy Head of the Youth Assistance Department, this is a good news: "We all were very happy."
Bought is kept out of the house: a caterer takes over this task and supplies freshly cooked cooked ones.
The city operates in the Krefeld area 46 kindergartens, in 44 children receive a warm meal at lunchtime.
Last Kita year, 2800 children each sat at the tables, and the need is growing steadily.
"In the meantime, not only do children who are cared for 45 hours a week eat in the Kita at noon," explains Pommeranz.
"The offer is also valid in the 35-hour care if children stay until 2 pm."
46 part-time staff have kitchen service from September 1st: they warm up the dishes provided, supplement them with salad, raw food and fruit, serving the meal individually, giving the food, cleaning up, rinsing and cleaning the kitchen.
"The employees are firmly assigned to a kita," says Pommeranz.
The size - there are two-groups as well as seven-group facilities - decides about the hour range.
"The kitchen helpers are now firmly part of the Kita team," Pommeranz says satisfied.
"So they are much more involved and it is easier to implement pedagogical concepts for the Kitaguide".
For it is also about: healthy nutrition and cooking lessons.
"The children are supposed to help prepare the food."
The direct connection of the kitchen power to the team would be useful.
Also for the children.
"They have a known force in the Kita, a person who is familiar to them, and not constantly changing people".
This continuity is important for the children.
The cleaning of the Kita rooms - so far also the task of the kitchen forces - will be done by special cleaning staff in the future.
In addition to improving the quality of the kitchen performance, this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - also has the charm that, in the cost comparison between self-regulatory and public procurement for the city as the most economical, it is said from the Press Office.
And that, although 46 part-time workers are re-established.
"But these hours do not fall as much in the weight of about 750 people in the educational area as they do," says Sonja Pommeranz.
Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women, says the UN
Elections can only be representative if all members of society, including women, play a role, said the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, President-in-Office of the United Nations Mission, said that hundreds of women will be candidates in Council elections in the provinces. Three women are candidates for the role of Vice-President and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overestimated," he said on Wednesday in a statement.

Men trying to rob 13-year-old girl
Two young men aged 19 and 23 should have tried on Thursday to rob a 13-year-old girl.
According to police information, the men spoke to the 13-year-olds who had stayed with friends on the Kolpingstraße about 14.55 because they wanted to call with the girl's cell phone.
The 13-year-old, however, rejected the request and continued with her friends.
Then one of the perpetrators tried to grab the girl's cell phone and necklace, but this was wrong.
Without prey, the duo fled.
The two young men were later arrested by the police.
The investigations are under way.
GMB issues about investments in the McViet factory in Glasgow
A trade union wants to make sure that managers of the Biskuit manufacturer McViet have the long-term obligation to produce in their plant in Glasgow.
GMB Scotland said that the company had been silent about the future of investments at the Tollcross site.
More than 500 employees work in the factory, which produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies in addition to other products.
McVities owner Pladis said he has invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years.
He added that employees and trade union representatives would "know first" if their activities changed.
In a letter to the company's head office, GMB asked Scotland McVie's to "remember that funding for the modernisation of production lines will not be advanced".
GMB-senior organizer Drew Duffy said, "The fact that we cannot gain clarity from the general site manager about the business needs and investment plans for the future of tollcross affects our members deeply.
Generations of families have worked here, and the labour force is concentrated heavily on the local community and the Grand Duchy, an important pillar for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantage.
Therefore, under the perspective of jobs, wages and prosperity, and against the background of the Brexit, the increasing cost of living and the chronic decline in production, the eastern end of Glasgow urgently requires a flourishing production presence at McViet".
A spokesperson from Pladis said: "The head of the branch at Tollcross only received a letter from GMB Scotland yesterday, and the company will react directly to it as we appreciate the continued commitment of employees and trade union representatives.
Two months ago we had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross, where some questions were discussed openly.
We discussed with the employees that, like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and insecure economic environment, we are constantly reviewing our business - and this applies to all our business segments and locations - in order to remain competitive.
She added: "In recent years, we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our Tollcross site, especially in production lines and operational improvements.
We fully recognize the heritage of Tollcross as a production site. Should our operations change at the location, the employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to know this."
Did the PSG warn Barcelona about Neymar three years ago?
The page of La Liga regrets her interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not fail in her persecution of Neymar after making an offer of £ 189 million to trigger his release clause, but did they warn Barcelona three years ago of the world record robbery?
The sensational approach has stimulated the transfer window in summer, because the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record to more than twice the previous brand, with Paul Pogba returning 89 million pounds to Manchester United last season.
After the end, Neymar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the world’s highest-paid professional sports player. PSG offers wages of over £500,000 per week.
Barcelona is angry at the way Neymar has forced his way out, although a source near the Catalan board insists that the club has always given its best to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned by the PSG president three years ago about this prospect?
When Manchester City showed interest in the signing of Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strong warning for any club that wanted to sign one of the best players of PSG.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we'll be in opposition to them, we'll contact their players," said Al-Khelaifi.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to sign one of our players, this will have consequences."
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line, with the Spanish club expressing interest in the PSG midfielder Marco Verratti at the beginning of this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to leave under any circumstances, and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its prize offers for Neymar.
Roller overturned and damaged
In the night from Friday to Saturday, an unknown perpetrator deliberately overturned a scooter in the Königsfelder Straße in front of the property number 30 and thus put on the car's disguise of more than 200 euros.
The Schramberg Police Department, phone 07422/27 01-0, asks for information.
To an accident on the B 215 between Stolzenau and Leese, the police are looking for witnesses.
Because a car came across him on his lane, the driver of a VW Touran had to leave out, and there was a touch of the guiding board.
On Thursday evening the 34-year-old from Rehburg-Loccum with his VW at about 19.55 o'clock on the B 215 from Stolzenau was on his way to Reade.
In the area around Stolzenau, a car arrived at him on his lane, so he had to leave to the right.
The Touran driver was able to work on the guiding board.
==References====External links==
The driver of the upcoming car, a Mercedes Benz, had passed a truck and continued his journey without caring for the traffic accident.
According to the accident, it may be good that the Mercedes driver had not noticed the accident at all.
The police are now asking witnesses of the incident as well as the driver of the vehicle to contact the commissioner in Stolzenau on Tel. 05761 / 92060.
Interview: "Domspatzen report relieves Pope-Bruder Georg Ratzinger"
The Regensburg Domspatzen report on abuse cases relieves Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger.
That's what author and historian Michael Hesemann means.
The final report on the abuse scandal in Regensburg’s domspatzen continues to ensure discussion.
Christian Weinnder, spokesperson of the reform movement "We are the Church", declared an apology to the German Press Agency after publication, from the former Regensburg Bishop and today's Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller, as well as to the master of the cathedral Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the emeritus Benedict XVI.
It would be very useful to the view of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regret at their own omissions or their then false assessment of the events.
The Vatican newspaper "Osservatore Romano", on the other hand, criticised that the reporting on violence in the domspatzen is measured by "two-dimensional measures".
As for the assaults in Regensburg, nobody doubts that it is about "damaging and shameful acts" that would have to be punished and prevented in the future; however, the "Grad medial manipulation" is striking, according to the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the national Italian bioethics committee.
"The habit of calling the Catholic Church a source of all evils is already part of everyday experience and is preparing public opinion to consider it normal," says Scaraffia.
Fürstin Gloria von Thurn and Taxis also said in the interview with Bayerische Rundfunk: "You like to go to the church and that's a eater found".
In addition, she pointed out that in her youth "beats were quite a normal educational means" to "get done with young children, as I was one".
They found it unfair to apply standards today for earlier decades because the world has changed.
In connection with the reports on abuse cases, Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared.
Completely wrongful, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who, with Ratzinger, wrote the book "My Brother of the Pope" (translated into 12 languages).
"I have to protect Georg Ratzinger," says Hesemann, "because all this had nothing to do with him," he appreciates the results of the final report.
What exactly does the 440-page report presented by the lawyer Ulrich Weber, who was appointed by the Bishop of Regensburg with the Enlightenment?
Between 1945 and the early 1990s, a total of 547 Regensburg domspatzens were "with high plasticity" victims of assaults, 67 domspatzen sexually abused.
In the final report, Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994, says: "In summary, it can be held that in many cases, the master of the cathedral R. used forms of physical and psychological violence.
In particular with high emotionality, the punishment for the students could also be more severe.
However, in contrast to many other accused, many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore, despite violence, even combined positive memories with him".
In the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal in the Cathedrals of Regensburg Georg Ratzinger, in his opinion, is relieving.
Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "conceptions of violence against the protectionists in the Domspatzen in Regensburg" gives an contradictory picture of Domkafelmeister Georg Ratzinger.
For one thing, many students emphasize his "humanity".
On the other hand, he also appears as a choler and perfectionist, who became hand-griffed to the public when a domspatz musically did not deliver top performance.
How do you value this final report as his biographer?
Michael Hesemann: If you make the effort and read the whole 440-page report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself more why the name Georg Ratzinger is found in it at all.
He is just eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly acquitted by any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.
The excesses of violence at preschool also occurred outside its sphere of action.
In any case, it can be accused of experiencing it too late or of not taking first indications seriously enough.
The domspatzengymnasium on which he worked was felt by practically all the respondents as - so literally - "salvation", "heaven" and "better world".
Thus, the broad majority of his pupils Georg Ratzinger present an excellent witness, described him as "hot heart", "popular", "real", "competent" and "comprehensive", as extremely kind teachers, who regularly supplied the boys with cakes, biscuits and candys and "even of grapes of children".
Only a minority complains about its perfectionism and its high emotionality, which has already led to anger outbreaks.
Not only did he bang with chairs and throw the keyband on the floor, but he also distributed the ear figs and pulled all too cheeky boys on his hair or ears, he admitted himself years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for them.
However, it must be said to his honorary salvation that such methods of education were widely used in the time, the 1960s and 1970s, with parents as well as teachers.
Do you know any of these discipline methods as well?
Of course, I think every one of us who was born before 1968.
I have also experienced this in a secular school, a state gymnasium.
Compared to what this report actually refers to, namely, the horrific sexual abuse and the excesses of violence at preschool, these are of course bagatelles.
It is already being asked if it is no longer related to his acquaintance and his role as brother of Benedict XVI that many media just fell upon him.
Many who never understood him work hard at the Bavarian Pope.
The truth is, however, that the account relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect!
In the media, much has been reported on the subject of abuse in the Cathedrals of Regensburg in connection with the report.
In the final report, is Georg Ratzinger also charged with any negotiation or complicity with regard to sexual abuse?
Michael Hesemann: Quite clearly no.
None of the 67 victims of sexual assault claim to have entrusted themselves to the master of the cathedral.
Not even the parents were inaugurated.
"I never dared to talk to my father or my mother about it," said one affected deputy for the others, "it was all very embarrassing to me."
The real problem in clarifying sexual abuse was and is that most victims are silent.
If they did not even entrust themselves to parents and siblings, then certainly not a choir conductor, who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators in the profession.
How do the domspatzen-students assess Ratzinger's role in the abuse cases?
Michael Hesemann: A student in question formulated it this way: "As regards sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) would have had timely knowledge and could have stopped the respective perpetrator.
I also feel that ... it is really absurd to assume that he ... is more intrusive or clear or more open to boys than to their parents, head of the boarding board, trust teachers, etc.
That one talks to him about sex... - unthinkable."
The report thus comes to the clear conclusion: "The fact that students and/or their environment were entrusted to him in advance could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation".
So, as far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is acquitted of any complicity.
Nor can he be accused of not preventing or displaying him.
There is no reason, therefore, to link his good name with these remorseful crimes, as has unfortunately happened in some cases.
In the media, a lot of "waltexcesses" was read at the Regensburg domspatzen.
The former master of cathedral Georg Ratzinger is accused in the report "Wegsauen".
Must he live with that accusation?
Michael Hesemann: This is the big problem that in reporting everything was mixed and mixed into a huge melange of sexual abuse and violent excesses and somewhere in the middle, Georg Ratzinger.
But that is, in turn, an abuse of the report.
There is a clean separation: between the preschool and the gymnasium of the domspatzen, between sexual abuse and excesses of violence and, let us say, other accusations.
In addition, the report deals with incidents since 1945, i.e. from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not choir leader of the domspatzen.
The whole terrible beating pedagogy, the cases in which boys were legally harassed and painted by sadistic teachers, and were horrified under it, all took place at preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions had to prevail.
But they had nothing to do with Domkafelmeister Georg Ratzinger, because he only got the boys face when they were already on the domspatzengymnasium.
On that point, as most witnesses emphasize, was the subject of preschool taboo.
One was only happy to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paradisiac" states.
What was different on the domspatzengymnasium?
Michael Hesemann: Although there was discipline, there was no sadistic violence.
And this is true of Georg Ratzinger, who concludes that "many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore, in many cases, even link positive memories with him despite violence".
At most, so remains the accusation to have looked away.
Despite all efforts, however, the report could define only two periods of time in which it was reported by the preschool conditions.
The first time in 1970/71, when he started to establish himself and from the processes at a school where he was not working and responsible, (so the witness) didn't want to hear anything, and then only around 1993 again.
Georg Ratzinger consistently closed his ears before the conditions?
Michael Hesemann: No, because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the domspatzengymnasium, which the report even reproduces.
In this he points out "that in preschool the fine continues to be practised".
In view of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent action.
This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed, when beatings were long forbidden in Bavaria.
Before that, they took place in a legal grey zone, as each of us still knows.
It was also difficult for him to estimate where the persons concerned might be exaggerated or dramatized and where the permissible limit had really been exceeded.
But you can't say he'd always looked away.
That's just not true.
It was only in 1980 that the beating of schools was officially abolished in Bavaria.
Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today's educational standards to the time.
How do you see that?
Michael Hesemann: We historians talk about the "Iftrick of Anachronism", i.e. the danger of evaluating past by present moral standards.
The princess is right.
But of course this does not apply to sexual abuse, which was always abominable and not to what was broken up in preschool in contradictions and violence to innocent children's souls, which goes far beyond what was common at that time.
That's all terrible, and I'm glad it's finally worked out.
But at the same time, I have to protect Georg Ratzinger, because all of that had nothing to do with him.
His means of discipline and punishment, that is, ear figs and to pull on the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.
When physical punishment was banned, he also adhered strictly to it.
What picture of his Regensburg era has Georg Ratzinger then made in the conversations with you for the book "My Brother of the Pope"?
Did the subject of beatings also come up with language?
Michael Hesemann: Well, the book is about the life of his brother Joseph, that is Pope Benedict XVI, from his perspective, the cathedrals played only one side role.
Nevertheless, I do not hide that he led a strict regiment there.
But this must also be said once again: without this perfectionism, without the requirement of absolute discipline, it would have hardly been possible for him to form an institution of world rank from the previously known nationally-known Regensburg domspatzen, true European cultural ambassadors and his musical tradition, who went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).
With biscuits and candys alone, one does not make a big singer and stand before every success, no matter what field, yet always discipline, passion and self-surpassion.
As what kind of person did you see Georg Ratzinger talking to her book?
Michael Hesemann: Through the work on the book and beyond, I have really met Georg Ratzinger very well and have experienced him again and again as wonderful, humorous, fundamental, deeply believing and heart-good people, from whom one cannot imagine that he could do something even a fly.
I regularly get along with how many former domspatches still today, 23 years after his retirement, regularly keep in touch with him, visit him, read him out - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family.
Those who still do not forgive him that he was once strict with them are clearly in the minority.
Most domspatches thank him today for enriching their lives and bringing them to the world of music.
And that he was always a good, fatherly teacher - a strict father, certainly that may be - but still was also a kind respectable person, to whom they still look up today and whom they worship.
And, once again, it is clear that all that one proposes is education methods that were on the agenda at that time.
We can be glad that we've been overcoming this time for a long time.
But it is most unfair to make a man, just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother, a media scapegoat.
There is the evil intention behind it, all too obvious.
Because the report that has just been published relieves him.
Now it would be impossible for a 93-year-old man, who has acquired great merit and would not at last let anyone know the Regensburg domspatches outside Bavaria and perhaps Germany in peace.
