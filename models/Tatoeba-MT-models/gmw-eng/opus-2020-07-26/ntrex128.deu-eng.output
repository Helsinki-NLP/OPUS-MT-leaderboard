Members of the National Assembly for Wales fear confusion with the Muppets
For some members of the National Assembly, the proposal to change its title in 'MWP' (Member of the Welsh Parliament, member of the Welsh Parliament) creates a presumption.
This is due to plans to change the name of the National Assembly to Welsh Parliament (Walisian Parliament).
National Assembly members of all political directions fear becoming the target of ridicule.
A member of the Labour Party said that his group was concerned because the name ‘twp’ and ‘pwp’ reimmises.
For non-Wallisian readers: in Welsh 'twp' stands for 'dof' and 'pwp' for 'a'.
A National Assembly member of the Plaid Cymru Party stated that the entire group was "unhappily" and had proposed alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said that his group was open to the change of name but pointed to the great similarity between 'MWP' and 'Muppet'.
In this context, the Welsh letter w is spoken similar to the letter u in the English spoken in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission (National Assembly Committee) currently drafts a law for the changes to the names, said: "The final decision on designations for the members of the National Assembly is of course with the members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act of 2017 authorised the Welsh National Assembly to change its name.
In June, the panel published the results of a public hearing on the proposals which gave broad support to the name 'Welsh Parliament' for the National Assembly.
With regard to the titles of the members of the National Assembly, the Welsh Parliament Members (Walisian Members) or WMPs body preferred the most favourable option of MWP at a public hearing.
The members of the National Assembly seem to suggest alternative options, but it could pose a problem for the chairman Elin Jones, who is to present a draft law within weeks.
The Reform Act will include further changes to the functioning of the National Assembly, including rules on the disqualification of National Assembly Members and on the design of the Committee System.
The members of the National Assembly can finalise their names during their debate on the law.
Macedonians agree in a referendum on a change in the country name
The voters decide on Sunday whether the name of their country should be changed to 'the Republic of Northern Macedonia'.
The referendum was started to settle a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has a province with the same name as Macedonia.
For a long time, Athens has insisted that the name of its northern neighbor means that this claim is based on the Greek territory and has repeatedly opposed its inclusion in the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the referendum on the change of name, said he would not recognize the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change of name is the price to be paid for accession to the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's are silent in view of the difficulties of the churches in Harlem
"The old people I was talking to said in the past there was a bar and a church at every corner," Adams said.
"Today, there is no longer any more."
He said the bar's disappearing was understandable.
"The social life of people looks different today," he said.
"Bars are no longer the living room of the neighborhood in which people regularly find themselves."
At the churches he fears that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as the church leaders assume, and that they will “be at the beginning sooner or later”.
Churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment houses with apartments in which people live who do not support the remaining refuges.
"The overwhelming majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white," he said, "and thus speed up the complete closure of these churches, as it is unlikely that most of the people who move into these apartments will become members of those churches."
Both churches were built by white communities before Harlem became a black metropolis: Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist community moved out in the 1930s.
A black church that held its services nearby became the owner of the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black municipality under Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, a large shopping street in Harlem that refused to hire or support Blacks.
During a fire in 1939, the building was badly damaged, but when Father Johnson's community members planned the reconstruction, they commissioned the bell game.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor in St. Martin's, proudly called the bell game "the bells of the poor".
The expert who ringed the bell game in July used other words: 'A cultural treasure' and 'an irreplaceable historical instrument'.
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the world's first bell game played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who had been changed to the larger bell game in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said he was not replaced by St. Martin's.
What has been happening in St. Martin's in the last few months is a complicated story with architects and contractors, some of whom were drawn by the church's lay leaders and partly by the diocese of the Bishops.
In July, the local councillor, consisting of lay leaders, expressed written concerns about the diocese that the diocese would try to pass on the costs to the local council, although it had not been involved in the commission of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complain about lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Hai injured in California 13-year-olds diving after Lobstern
In California, on Saturday, the first day of the Lobster season, a shark officially attacked a 13-year-old boy when diving for praises.
The attack took place just before 7:00 a.m. near the Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
As Chad Hammel told the KSWB TV station in San Diego, he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy's cry for help and toaded to the boy with several others to help draw him out of the water.
Hammel said that he first thought the boy was happy to have a praiser, but then he realized that the boy was screaming “I was biting!
I have been bitten!"
When Hammel arrived with the boy, he found that his entire key leg had been broken up.
“I cried that everyone should come out of the water: ‘There is a shark in the water!’”, Hammel added.
The boy was flown to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is in a critical state.
The type of shark responsible for the attack was unknown.
Rescuer Captain Larry Giles told the media that a few weeks earlier a shark had been seen in the area. However, one had concluded that it was not a dangerous shark.
Giles added that the victim had suffered traumatic injuries in the upper body area.
Officials locked the beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Encinitas for 48 hours for reasons of security.
According to Giles, there are over 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to advance the cosmetics market in the United Kingdom
Sainsbury's attacks on beauty departments with specialized assistants, boats, superdrugs and Debenhams.
As part of a large-scale advance to the 2.8 billion UK-consumed cosmetics market in the UK, which continues to grow, while fashion and household goods sales decline, the larger cosmetics departments in eleven branches are tested nationally. If they prove successful, they will be extended to further branches next year.
The investment in cosmetics coincides with the search of supermarkets for opportunities to use shops previously used for television, microwaves and household goods.
According to Sainsbury's, the scope of its cosmetics is doubled for the first time to up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Also existing series of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees receive more space and brand areas similar to those in shops such as boats.
In addition, the supermarket is relaunching its "Boutique" make-up series, so that most of the products are vegan friendly – an aspect that is increasingly demanded by younger customers.
In addition, the perfumer Fragrance Shop will be tested in two Sainsbury's branch stores. The first sales office was opened last week in Croydon in the south of London, and a second one will be opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Online shopping and the transition to the daily purchase of small amounts of food in local supply stores mean that supermarkets need to do more to enable customers to visit them.
According to Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, the sales outlets will increasingly look like department stores, as the supermarket chain is trying to fight with more services and non-food items against the discounters Aldi and Lidl.
Since the purchase of the Argos and Habitat chains two years ago, Sainsbury's sales offices have been set up in hundreds of branches of Argos and also a number of Habitat sales outlets. This has increased food sales as well as the profitability of the acquisitions.
The previous attempt of the supermarket to reorganize its cosmetics and pharmaceutical departments failed.
At the beginning of the 2000s, Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with boats, but ended after a discussion on the distribution of revenue from the stores of the drug dealer in the supermarkets.
The new strategy follows Sainsbury's sale of its 281 branch-wide pharmaceutical business to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million pounds three years ago.
The company indicated that Lloyds will play a role in the plan in so far as in four branches an extended range with luxury hating brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy is added.
Paul Mills-Hicks, business director at Sainsbury's, said: "We have redesigned the appearance of our cosmetics departments in order to create a more attractive environment for our customers.
In addition, we have invested in specially trained colleagues who are available as consultants.
Our brand range is tailored to all needs. Due to the seductive environment and the convenient locations, we are now an attractive destination for cosmetics purchases that challenges the previous type of shopping."
Peter Jones 's anger' after the retreat Holly Willoughbys from a business worth 11 million British pounds
“Dragons” Den”star Peter Jones is “voicing” after TV moderator Holly Willoughby withdrew himself from a business worth 11 million British pounds with his lifestyle brand company to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for the common homewear and accessories brand Truly.
The business of the two was compared with Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The "This Morning" moderator, 37, announced her withdrawal to Instagram.
Holly Willoughby angered “Dragons” Den” star Peter Jones with her very short-term withdrawal from her lucrative lifestyle brand company to focus on their own new connection contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Jones is said to have been "wrong" when the "Golden Girl" of television admitted to be unable to devote enough time to the common homewear and accessories brand Truly because of her new business – worth up to 1.5 million pounds – on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire.
The company was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and would probably have doubled Willoughby's estimated assets of 11 million UK pounds.
While Willoughby, 37, announced her withdrawal from Truly on Instagram, Jones left the UK on his way to one of his holiday homes.
One source said: “Truly had by far the highest priority for Holly.
It should ensure for them their future over the next decades in the long term.
Their decision to withdraw came as a surprise to all parties involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, just before the market launch.
At the Marlow headquarters, a warehouse is waiting to be sold."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the “this Morning” presenter, one of the most promising stars in Britain, could cost the company millions due to high investments in products from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear and possible further delays in the market launch.
Moreover, it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, the mother of three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly in 2016 with Capp, and Jones, 52, joined in March as chairman.
The couples spend the vacation together, and Jones holds a 40 percent share of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby is to become brand ambassador for M&S and replace Ant McPartlin as the moderator of the ITV broadcast "I'm A Celebrity".
A source close to Jones said last night: "We do not comment on its business affairs."
Hard words "and then we fell in love"
He joked at the criticism that he expected from the news media for a comment some would consider "non-presidious" and for so positive statements about the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said the voice of a news moderator imitating:
"I have given up nothing."
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting, as the first meeting in Singapore was praised by Trump in June as a great step towards the denuclearisation of North Korea.
However, the denuclearisation negotiations have been set in motion.
More than three months after the Singapore Summit in June, Ri Yong Ho, the top diplomat of North Korea, said on Saturday to leading politicians from all over the world on the occasion of the UN General Assembly that the North did not see a "corresponding response" from the USA to North Korea's first disarmament measures.
Instead, he noted, the US imposed sanctions that should maintain pressure.
Trump showed much more optimism in his rallying speech.
"We are very successful with North Korea," he said.
“We were facing a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have this great relationship."
He said his efforts to improve the relationship with Kim showed positive results: end of rocket testing, support in the release of hostages and return of the mortal remains of American military members.
He also defended his unusual way of talking about the relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to be presidential, but instead of 10,000 people standing outside trying to get into this crowded arena, about 200 people would be standing here," said Trump, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquakes devastate an island in Indonesia and cost hundreds of human lives
According to the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told that they would not be used.
Although more than 10 percent of the population were expelled from Lombok, no national emergency was declared a prerequisite for the mobilization of international aid.
"In many cases, they have made it very clear that they are not requesting international support, so this is a little difficult," said Summing.
While Save the Children is creating a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet sure whether foreign employees can work on site.
Sutopo, spokesperson of the Civil Protection Authority, said Indonesian official assesses the situation in Palu as to whether international agencies should participate in the aid measures.
In view of the destructions with which Indonesia is constantly struggling, the country is still unfortunately poorly prepared for natural violence.
While Aceh tsunami shelters have been built, they are not a daily sight on other coastal strips.
Despite a warning that had entered into force, it is likely that the Tsunamiwarnsirene in Palu contributed to the deaths.
Travel between Indonesia's numerous islands is already a challenge in the optimal case.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A lazarette ship stationed in Lombok for the treatment of earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but will reach the place of the new catastrophe in three days at the earliest.
President Joko Widodo has made the improvement of the proposed Indonesian infrastructure the core of his campaign and has spent plenty of money on roads and railways.
However, the government of Yoko who is seeking re-election next year suffers from financial deficits.
In addition, Joko is under pressure due to persistent confession tensions in Indonesia. Members of the Muslim majority there practice a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were expelled from their homes and homes when gangs of Christians and Muslims fought on the streets with machetes, arrows and bows as well as other primitive weapons.
View: Liverpools Daniel Sturridge achieves deep compensation against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from Chelsea on Saturday at the Stamford-Bridge Stadium in London with a hit in the 89th minute in front of a Premier League loss against Chelsea.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri at 0:1 return of his team at about 27 meters away from the gate of Chelsea.
He directed the ball to the left and then shot it in the direction of the rear post.
The shot sailed high over the penitentiary and drifted into the right upper corner of the net.
Finally, the ball fell over the jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and then into the net.
“I just tried to get into this position and get to the ball. Players like Shaq always play as much as possible, so I just tried to make as much time as possible for me,” Sturridge said to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming and had a contact with the ball. I didn't think too much about it and just take the shot."
Chelsea led the Belgian Star Eden Hazad to the mid-term with 1:0 after a hit in the 25th minute.
The blues-sturmer gave a pass with the heel back to Mateo, then turned off near the middle field and sprinted into the Liverpooler half.
Kovacic played a fast double pass in the middle of the field.
He then shot a good steep pass, so Hazard got into the penitentiary.
He left the defenders behind and closed the net with a left shot at Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool plays at the Champions League's Group Phase on Wednesday at 3:00 p.m. in San Paolo Stadium in Naples.
Chelsea is in London at 15:00 on Thursday in the UEFA Europa League Videoton.
Number of tsunami deaths in Indonesia increased to 832
The number of victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, as reported by the Civil Protection Authority on Sunday morning.
Many people are said to have been caught in the ruins of buildings that were destroyed by the earthquake of strength 7.5 of Friday, which caused up to six meters of waves, reported the government spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, was equipped with the ruins of broken buildings.
Police arrests man, 32, for suspects after a woman was stabbed
A murder investigation was initiated after the discovery of a women's lie this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old was found in Grayson Mews on John Street at 7:55. A 32-year-old man was arrested for suspicions of murder.
The police urge residents to report if they have seen or heard something.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is at an early stage, but I ask everyone who has stayed near the John Street in Birkenhead and has seen or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I also ask all people, especially taxi drivers who may have taken up a Dashcam, to contact us, and they may have information that is of the greatest importance for our investigation."
A police officer confirmed that the woman whose body was found lived in Birkenhead and was found in a building.
This afternoon, friends who believe they know the woman arrived at the crime scene to find out where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing, and the police told us that she is in the process of informing the victim's next family members.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews was trying to get to his home, but was informed by the police that no one is allowed to enter or leave the building.
He was speechless when he learned what had happened.
The residents are now informed that it will take hours for them to enter the building again.
It was heard how a police officer told a man that now the whole area is treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared in tears dissolved at the place of the event.
It repeats again and again, 'this is so terrible'.
At 2:00 p.m., two police vehicles were inside the lock-off and another vehicle before the lock-off.
Within the lockout, several police officers were in charge of the housing block.
Persons with information are asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call the number 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously under 0800 555 111 and refer to Protocol 247 of 30 September.
The Cromwell statue in front of Parliament will be the latest monument to the dispute on the transformation of history
Their banishment would be poetic justice for its destruction of so many cultural and religious art products of England by its fanatical Puritan followers.
The Cromwell Society, however, described Crick's proposal as "turity" and "try to redefine history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable in the current debate on removing statues that Oliver Cromwell’s statue was aimed at the palace of Westminster.
The photo tower in the British Civil Wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the false Cromwell would be sacrificed for the deeds of his ancestors Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent representation of Cromwell is proof of the 19th century's opinion and part of the history writing of a figure, which, in the opinion of many, is still worth celebrating.
Regarding Sunday Telegraph, Goldsmith said: “Cromwell is considered more than today by many, perhaps at the end of the 19th century, than anyone who defended Parliament against pressure from outside, of course by the monarchy.
Whether this is an entirely correct representation is the subject of continuing debate on history.
It is certain that the conflict formed the subsequent development of our nation in the mid-17th century, and Cromwell is a uniquely recognizable figure that represents one side of this divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and remembering."
Chicken bites Chinese farmers dead
According to local media reports, a farmer on a market in southwestern China was attacked and killed by a pig.
The man named "Yuan" was found dead with a severed arterial flood near a pig's stable on the market in Liupanshui in Guizhou Province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer is preparing to inject pigs in Xining in the province of Qinghai, China.
He was reported to have arrived with his cousin from Yunnan's neighboring province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead and saw that a door to a neighboring piggy stall was open.
He said there was a big male pig in the stable with blood on the snout.
According to the report, a forensic investigation confirmed that the 250-kilometer pig had bitten the peasants to death.
"The legs of my cousin were bloody and mutilated," was quoted by Guiyang Evening News, the cousin named "Wu".
Recordings of a security camera showed Yuan entering the market on Thursday at 4:40 p.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told the Evening News that the pig had been imprisoned to prevent attacks on more people, while the police collected evidence at the crime scene.
Yuan's family and the market authorities are negotiating reports on compensation for his death.
It is rare that pigs attack people, but such cases are known.
In 2016 a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts. The man suffered serious injuries.
Ten years ago, a 40 - pound [290 kg] pig jammed a Welsh farmer between himself and a tractor until the farmer's wife could hide the animal.
After a farmer was eaten by his pigs in Oregon in 2012, a Farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a "emissioner".
“They’re just playful.
They like to develop and are very curious ... they are not intent on hurting someone.
You just have to treat them with the right degree of respect," he said.
Hurricane Rosa's remains bring widespread strong rains to the southwest of the USA
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa weakens along the way over the colder water on the north coast of Mexico.
In the coming days, however, pink will bring floods of rain in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.
On Sunday at 5:00 o'clock east coast time, Rosa showed wind speeds of 136 km/h, corresponding to a hurricane of category 1, and was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
In the meantime, a trough begins to be formed across the Pacific, heading east to the west coast of the USA. When Rosa reaches the Baja California Peninsula as a tropical storm on Monday, high tropical humidity is transported northward to the south-west of the USA.
Pink will cause up to 25 centimetres of precipitation on Monday in parts of Mexico.
Then, in the coming days, tropical moisture produces widespread rainfall in the southwest through interactions with the moving trough.
Locally, 2.5 to 10 centimeters of rainfall can cause dangerous floods, water - driving debris, and possibly land slides in the desert.
High tropical humidity leads to precipitation rates of almost 5 to 7.5 centimetres per hour, especially in parts of the south of Nevada and Arizona.
In the southwest, especially in a large part of Arizona, up to 5 to 10 centimeters of rainfall are expected.
Due to the spread of tropical rainfall, there is the possibility of fluid floods with rapidly worsening conditions.
In the face of the threatening tropical rainfall, it is strongly dissuaded from walking into the desert.
Strong rainfall can cause canyons to rip, and thunderstorms bring local winds and wind that leads to dust.
The nearby trough brings local strong rain in parts of the coast of Southern California.
It is possible that total precipitation amounts of more than one centimeter may result in a small amount of dirt floating in the water and in smooth carriages.
This would be the first rainfall of the rainy season in this region.
The first isolated tropical rainshowers reach Arizona on Sunday evening and Monday morning. On Monday evening and Tuesday it rains widely.
On Tuesday strong rain spreads to the Four Corners region and stops on Wednesday.
In October, strong temperature fluctuations are possible throughout the United States, as the Arctic cools, while the tropics remain relatively warm.
This sometimes leads to dramatic temperature differences over short distances.
On Sunday, there is a good example of dramatic temperature differences in the middle of the United States.
Between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, there is a temperature difference of almost 12 oC.
In the next few days, the continuing summer heat tries to develop and expand again.
For a large part of the center and east of the United States, a warm October beginning with widespread temperatures is expected to reach 27 oC from the Southern Plains to parts of the northeast.
New York City could reach 27 oC on Tuesday, which is about 6 degrees above the average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a high probability of above average temperatures in the first half of October in the East of the USA.
Over 20 million viewers have seen the hearing of Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million viewers on Thursday saw six television networks captivating statements by the board Kavanaugh, nominated for the Supreme Court, and the woman, Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual assaults in the 1980s.
In the meantime, the political situation continued. The TV stations interrupted their regular programme on Friday because of a last minute shift: an agreement negotiated by Jeff Flake, Senator from Arizona, which means that the FBI should conduct a one-week examination of the allegations.
Ford advised the Senate Justice Committee to be 100% sure that Kavanaugh had been drunk at a high school party, bullied her, and tried to remove her clothes.
Kavanaugh said in a passionate statement that he was 100% sure that this did not happen.
It is likely that more than the 20.4 million viewers reported by Nielsen have seen the hearing.
The company determined average viewer numbers at CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
For other networks such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, which had broadcasted the hearing, the figures were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen usually has problems measuring viewer numbers in offices.
To put this into the right perspective: This corresponds to the number of spectators in a play-off football game or in the Oscar ceremony.
According to Nielsen, with an average of 5.69 million viewers of the full-day hearing, the station Fox News Channel, whose mean-oriented moderators strongly support the nomination of Kavanaughs, recorded the highest numbers of all networks.
ABC came second with 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million viewers.
The interest remained high after the hearing.
In the Friday drama Flake was the central figure.
After the moderate Republican office had published a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was filmed on Friday morning by cameras from CNN and CBS, as protesters in the elevator on the way to a hearing of the Justice Committee out loud with words.
He stood for minutes with his eyes lowered while he was shocked. The scene was transmitted live at CNN.
"I'm right in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the country the truth?"
"They have power, while so many women are powerless," said one woman.
Flake said that his office had published and added a statement before the elevator closed that he would have more to say at the hearing before the committee.
All cable and radio networks sent live hours later when the Justice Committee was to vote on the transmission of the Kavanaugh nomination to the entire Senate.
However, Flake said that he would do so only on condition that the FBI, as called for by the democratic minority, would investigate the accusations against the candidate in the next week.
Flake was partly convinced by an interview with a friend, the democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After an interview with Coons and then various Senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision was of great importance, as it was obvious that the Republicans would not have sufficient votes without the investigation for the confirmation of Kavanaugh.
President Trump has initiated an FBI investigation of the accusations made against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of using Brexit for political purposes
In an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans for leaving the European Union to use the future of Britain for political purposes and undermine the interests of the nation.
The British Prime Minister Theresa May will meet on 29 September 2018 at the Conservative Party's party in Birmingham.
In an interview with her on the cover of the newspaper, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson reinforced his attack on her so-called "Chequers-Plan" for Brexit by calling a proposal that provides for the mutual introduction of customs duties by the UK and the EU to be "fully absurd".
Deadly Shots on Wayde Sims: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson in connection with death of the LSU player
In connection with the fatal shots on Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at Louisiana State University (LSU), the police arrested a suspect.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, according to Baton Rouge police, was arrested and detained for death.
The Authority published video recordings of the dispute between Sims and Simpson. According to the police, Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
As the CBS partner station WAFB reports, the police secured the glasses at the crime scene and said that Simpson had been found on the glasses DNA.
After a survey of Simpson, the police reported that he had stood the fatal shots on Wayde.
The lawyer reports that the security deposit had been fixed at $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office published a preliminary report on Friday, according to which the cause of death was a shot wound on the neck.
The police thank the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, the federal police crime-technical laboratory, Southern University Police and local citizens for their support in the investigation leading to the arrest.
LSU sports director Joe Alleva thanked the regional executive authority for 'their care and their quest for justice'.
Sims was 20 years old.
The 1.98 m-large winger grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played for the LSU basketball.
In the last season, he scored an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, the LSU basketball trainer, Will Wade, said that the team was "deeply shaken" by Wayde's death and "is under shock".
"You're always afraid of something like this," Wade said.
Volcano spits ashes in Mexico City.
The southern quarter of the Mexican capital was reached by the ashes thrown out from the volcano Popocatepetl.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned the Mexicans to stay away from the volcano on Saturday after the activity in the crater had increased and 183 emissions of gas and ashes were recorded within 24 hours.
The Authority monitored numerous cases of roars and shocks.
Images in social media showed thin ash layers on the windshields of cars in quarters of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Since September 2017, geophysicists have shaken an earthquake of strength 7.1 Central Mexicans, increased activity on the volcano, 72 kilometres southeast of the capital.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police clashes with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of independence
In Barcelona, six people were arrested on Saturday after collisions between the willing police and pro-independence demonstrators. Thousands participated in other demonstrations to commemorate the first anniversary of the polarized independence conference in Catalonia.
A group of masked pro-separatists, who were held back by the willing police, recruited them with eggs and also sluttered color powder, so that dark clouds of dust in the usually populated streets.
In the course of the day, the police were also hand-cuffed with the police who used their strike sticks to stop the fights.
For several hours, per-independence groups "No forgetful, no forgiveness", while facing Unionists calling for "long live Spain".
As the local press reported, fourteen people were treated because of smaller protests of injuries.
One year after the referendum of 1 October, which was considered illegal by Madrid, but was celebrated by separatist Catalans, the situation in the independent region remains very tense.
The electorate had opted for independence by overwhelming majority, although the turnout was low, as the turnout opponents boycotted mostly.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year when the police attempted to prevent the vote in violent clashes in front of the electoral venues.
Per-independence groups had camped outdoors on Friday night to prevent a demonstration for the national police.
The demonstration took place, but was forced to take another path.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated with his wife in the protest of the separatists, said he saw the prospects that Catalonia would gain independence no longer with hope.
“Last year we experienced one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy, because they could choose, but now we're hanging tight," he said.
Despite an important, though scarce, victory in the regional elections last December, the Catalan pro-independence parties had difficulties in maintaining the momentum this year. Many of their best-known leaders are either in exile or in detention, where they are waiting for their procedures because of their role in the organisation of the referendum and the subsequent Declaration of Independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in favor of the police on his phone, said that the conflict had been shaken by politicians on both sides.
"The situation is becoming increasingly tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in detention since the end of last year, announced his candidate for election to the European Parliament next year.
"As a candidate for the election of Europe, it is the best way to promote the reduction of democratic values and the Spanish Government's oppression," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after house was rammed by car
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a house in Londonderry had been rammed several times by a car.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 19:30 a.m. after British summer time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemings said the gates and the building itself were damaged.
In addition, an armbrush may have been shot on the car.
Menga hit means for Livingston 1:0 victory over Rangers
Dolly Mengas' first goal for Livingston secured the victory.
The raised Livingston FC surprised the Rangers and led to the second defeat for Steven Gerrard in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox Association.
Dolly Menga's hits proved decisive for Gary Holt's team to be able to compete with Hibernian in the second half of the season.
Gerrard's team will remain in the premiere this season without winning out and will be facing the Hearts next Sunday, which will be eight points behind.
Previously, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday in the Europa League.
Livingston can in the meantime increase his winning series in the division to six games, i.e., Chief Trainer Holt has not reported any defeat since he took over Kenny Miler in the last month.
Livingston misses opportunities against bold guests
Holt's team should have been in charge long before the hit, because his directness put the rangers ahead of the various problems.
Scott Robinson broke through, however, slowed down in front of the gate. Then Alan Lithgow could only shoot far after he had come down to hit Craig Halkett’s headshot at the gate.
The hosts were happy to let the rangers play in front of themselves, as they knew they could hinder the guests in the event of standard situations.
In this way the decisive gate came about.
The rangers allowed a free-flash, and Livingston prepared a chance for Declan Gallagher and Robinson to shoot Menga together. This shot the gate with a ball contact from the center of the penitentiary.
In this phase, the Rangers had dominated the ball ownership, but could not overcome the defense of the hosts, and Torhüter Liam Kelly remained largely unlit.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos Kelly once forced to defend himself.
Scott Pittman was averted by the Rangers-Turhütter Allan McGregor with his feet, and Lithgow ended the ball from another standard situation of Livingston.
Illnesses continued to enter Livingston's penitentiary room and were regularly brought out of the danger zone, while two requested crimes - one of Halkett's against the changed Glenn Middleton and one of them - were refused because of hand-playing.
“Phenomenal” by Livingston – Analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland in the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and a strong result for Livingston.
They were outstanding without exception and have again exceeded expectations in this upward trend.
Their style of play and their team have hardly changed since their return to the top teams, but Holt deserves great praise for the way in which he has watched the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great and led an excellent organized defense, while Menga Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall stayed on Trab throughout the game.
The Rangers, however, lacked inspiration.
As good as they were temporarily under Gerrard, they could not reach this standard.
Her last ball was insufficient – only once they were able to penetrate the team of hosts – and that is something like a wake-up call for the rangers who are in the middle of the table.
Received erdogan with mixed reactions in Cologne
On Saturday, 29 September, there were smiling faces and blue sky as the heads of government of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which should serve to repair relations between NATO's associations.
There had been disputes on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan traveled to Cologne to open a big new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police called security reasons for keeping a 25,000 people away from gathering in front of the mosque. However, many followers found themselves nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan demonstrators – many of them Kurds – also listened. They condemned Erdogan’s policies as well as the decision of the German government to welcome him to the country.
The opposite protests reflect the polarizing effect of the visitor, who is praised by some German Turks as hero and who are maimed by others as autocrats.
Traffic accident in Deptford: Cycling dies in collision with car
In a collision with a car, a cyclist was killed in London.
The collision took place at about 10:15 UK summertime near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a traffic-rich street in Deptford to the southeast of the city.
The driver of the car stopped, and sanitians took care of the man who died in the accident place.
Months before the accident, another cyclist had died in an accident with a driver's flight on Childers Street, some 1.6 kilometers from the Saturday accident.
According to Metropolitan Police, officials worked to identify the man and notify his next family.
Roadblocks and detours for buses are set up, and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long-Lartin Prison: Six unrest officials injured
According to the Prison Office, six prison officers were injured in unrest in a high security prison for men.
The unrest broke out on Sunday at about 9:30 UK summer time in HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire and stopped.
Specialized Tornado officials have been added to end the unrests involving eight inmates who are limited to a wing.
The officials were treated locally for minor injuries on the face.
One speaker at the Prison Service said: “It was specifically trained prison staff to fix an ongoing incident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and want to make it clear that police officers will be handed over and may spend a long time behind bars."
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the head of prison was treated after an attack by a penitentiary in the hospital.
In October last year, officers were sent to prison to fight severe disturbances in which the staff were attacked with poolballs.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with fluffy floods (Dürre districts may benefit)
It is rare that a tropical depression reaches Arizona, but this is likely to happen at the beginning of next week, when the remains of Hurricane Rosa pass over the southwest affected by deserts and present the risk of floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings about floods of flooding on Monday and Tuesday from the west of Arizona to the south and east of Nevada and to the southeast of California and Utah including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to approach with rain on Monday evening and move directly across Phoenix on Tuesday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix informed a Tweet that “since 1950 only ten tropical cyclones have come close as tropical storm or tropical depression Phoenix to 320 kilometers!
Katrina (1967) was a Hurricane within 64 kilometres from the Arizona border."
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 centimeters of precipitation with up to 15 centimeters in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
In other areas of the southwestern desert, including the central rockies and the Great Basin, 2.5 to 5 centimetres are likely and can be separated by a total of up to 10 centimetres.
For those who do not have the risk of floods, pink-related rainfall may be a blessing due to the drought in the region.
Although floods are of great concern, this rain is likely to be useful in part, as drought is currently taking place in the southwest.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, at least an extreme drought occurs in just over 40 percent of Arizona, the second highest category," reportedweather.com.
First of all, the path of the Hurricane means that Rosa will meet on land on the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning, Rosa will still have Hurricane strength with maximum winds of 136 kilometers per hour and will be located 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico. Afterwards, the Hurricane will move north by 19 kilometers per hour.
In the Pacific, the storm will hit colder water and thus weaken.
Therefore, Rosa is expected to meet the strength of a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening in Mexico.
Precipitation may be severe in parts of Mexico, so that there is a significant risk of flooding.
"From Baja California to the northwest of the Sonora desert, precipitation amounts are expected from 7.5 to 15 centimeters, with up to 25 centimeters possible," saidweather.com.
Then, as a tropical storm, Rosa will move north over Mexico, reach the border to Arizona on the early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, and then move through Arizona up to the south of Utah until the late Tuesday evening.
"The main danger is expected to be very strong in the context of pink or its remains in Baja California, the northwest of the Sonora desert and the South West desert in the United States," said the National Hurricane Center.
As a result of these rainfalls, life-threatening floods and floods are expected in the desert, as well as in mountainous areas of land slides.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four arrests for attempted murders
After a 16-year-old found in Somerset, three boys in the teen age and a 20-year-old man were arrested under the suspicion of attempted murder.
The teen was found on Saturday at 4:00 a.m. in the Excelsior-Terrace area of Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to a hospital, and his condition is 'stabilized'.
According to Avon and Somerset police, a 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the wheelstock area.
The officials asked all who had records of the events on a mobile phone to report.
Trump said that Kavanaugh suffered 'under the common sense, anger' of the Democrats.
"A voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice against the unscrupulous and unheard tactics of the Democrats," said Trump at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh suffered during the entire nomination process "under the common, the anger" of the Democrats.
Kavanaugh said before the Congress on Thursday and rejected Christine Blasey Ford's accusation that he had sexually harassed them decades ago when both teenagers were.
Ford also said at the hearing that she was accused.
The President said on Saturday that the American people had seen the brilliance, quality and courage of Kavanaugh on this day.
"A voice for the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh is a voice for the confirmation of one of the most experienced legal heads of our time, a lawyer with an excellent balance in the service of the general public," he said of the crowd of his followers in West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to the nomination of Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of the participation of Republican voters in the intermediate elections.
“Five weeks before one of the most important elections of our lives.
I don't argue, but in reality I'm acting on," he said.
"That's why I fight everywhere for great candidates."
Trump argued that the Democrats were committed to 'promising and blocking resistance'.
The first important procedural vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday in the Senate, said a high employee of the GOP leadership to CNN.
Hundreds killed in earthquakes in Indonesia, victim numbers rise
According to the authorities of Saturday at least 384 people were killed. Many of them were swept away when huge waves hit the beaches because of a strong earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people had gathered on Friday at a festival on the beach of the city of Palu, when, at the fall of the darkness, up to six meters of waves hit the beach, tearing many people to death and destroying everything that was in their way.
The tsunami had preceded an earthquake of strength 7.5.
"When the Tsunami threatened yesterday, people still went on the beach and did not run away immediately, and they fell victim to him," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson of the Indonesian Civil Protection Authority BNPB at a conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come alone, he was swimming cars, trunks and houses, he met everything on land," said Nugroho. He added that the tsunami had been pulled over the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before he hit the coast.
Some people were climbing on trees before the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated and accommodated in 24 centers in Palu.
Air shots published by the Civil Protection Authority showed numerous destroyed buildings and shops, congested and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday the coastal city was shaken by further earthquakes.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian authority BPPT (Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology) said in a statement that the massive earthquake of Friday released energy corresponded to the 200-fold energy of the nuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
Due to the location of the city at the end of a long, narrow bay the tsunami could have grown, said the authority.
Nugroho described the damage as "comprehensive" and stated that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels were collapsed.
According to his information, the bodies were found among the ruins of broken buildings. 540 people were injured, and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the number of victims and the damage could have been higher along the coast 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communication with Donggala was completely paralysed, according to Nugrohos, and there was no information.
According to a Red Cross statement, more than 300,000 people live there, and its employees and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could be much worse," said the statement.
On Saturday, the Authority was often criticized for not informing that a tsunami had met Palu, although the waves entered official information at the time of the warning.
Amateur shots published in social media show a man in the upper floor of a building, who desperately warns the people on the street below him before the approaching tsunami.
Within minutes, a water wall is on the shore, swimming buildings and cars from it.
Reuters could not immediately verify the authenticity of the recordings.
As a result of the earthquake and tsunami, a massive power failure occurred, which interrupted the communication around Palu and made the authorities more difficult to coordinate rescue measures.
According to the authorities, the military has begun sending cargo aircraft from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuates still urgently need food and other vital goods.
The airport of the city remains closed until October and has only been opened for assistance.
For Sunday a visit of President Joko Widodo was planned at Evacuation Centres in Palu.
The number of tsunami victims has risen to over 800.
The situation is very bad.
The staff of World Vision from Donggala safely reached the city of Palu, where the staff in tent accommodations in the courtyard of their office were housed, but after words of Dosebas passed along the way at scenes of devastation.
"They said they saw many destroyed houses," he said.
The situation is very bad.
Even when the relief groups began with the hard task of getting disaster aid started, some of them assembled that skilled foreign workers would be prevented on the trip to Palu.
Under Indonesian law, financial assistance, supplies and personnel from abroad are only possible if the location of an accident has been declared the national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened so far.
"At the moment, it is still a disaster at the provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, spokesperson of the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the government says, ‘okay, this is a national disaster,’ we can accept international support, but so far this status does not apply.”
While the second night since the earthquake and the tsunami of Friday fell over Palu, friends and family members of the missing were hoping for one of the wonders that lighten up the sad stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday a young boy was pulled out of a wastewater canal.
On Sunday, rescue forces liberated a woman who had been trapped under debris for two days next to the body of her mother.
Gendon Subandano, the coach of the Indonesian paragliding national team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian games that ended in Indonesia at the beginning of this month.
Other prisoners in the Roa-Roa Hotel were his students, as Mandadi added.
"As a senior in paragliding, I have to bear my own emotional burden," he said.
Gendon told how he had been round in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa-Roa Hotel among the paragliders, desperately sent WhatsApp news to the competition participants from Palu who participated in the beach festival.
His messages, however, only led to gray question marks instead of blue hooks.
"I think that means the news wasn't delivered," he said.
Thieves steal 26.750 US dollars during the storage of an ATM in Newport on the Levee
According to a press release by the Newport police on Friday morning in Newport on the Levee Diebe stole an employee of Brink’s while filling a ATM $6,750.
The driver of the vehicle had emptied a ATM in the entertainment complex and wanted to spend more money, said Detective Dennis McCarthy in the press release.
While he was busy, "a man came after Brink's employee" and stole a bag full of money that was intended for the machines.
According to the press release, Witnesses saw several suspects flee from the scene, but the police did not indicate how many people were involved in the incident.
Persons with information on the identity of the suspects are asked to contact the Newport police in 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes its name – in Ye.
When he announced the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The being formally known as Kanye West" (The officially known as Kanye West).
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for some time and has used him as the title of his 8th album released in June.
The change presupposes his appearance at Saturday Night Live, where the release of his new album "Yandhi" is expected.
He appears in the broadcast as a substitute for the singer Ariana Grande, who, according to the producer's information, has cancelled for "emotional reasons".
The word is not just a abbreviation of its current professional name, but according to its own statement, it has a religious meaning for the West.
“I believe that ‘ye’ is the most widely used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you’,” West said in a conversation about his album with Radio moderator Big Boy.
“So I’m you, I’m us, it’s us.
From Kanye, which means “the only one”, only “Ye” – simply a reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, everything.
The album reflects more of what we are."
He is one of several famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who worked with West earlier, has already written his name with and without binding stroke and capital letters.
Mexico's AMLO promises not to use the military against the civilian population
The elected Mexican president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised never to apply military violence against the civilian population, while the 50th anniversary of bloody repression against students in his country approaches.
On Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza, Lopez Obrador promised to "never use the military to suppress the Mexican people".
Soldiers had fired at a peaceful demonstration in the square on 2 October 1968, killing 300 people. At that time left-wing student movements were in the process of establishing themselves throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador praised to support young Mexicans through monthly support for students and the opening of other free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of training led young people to criminal gangs.
United States should double financial resources for artificial intelligence
In view of China's enhanced activities in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double its spending on research in this field, says Investor and AI-Praktiker Kai-Fu Lee, who worked with Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments follow AI announcements from various areas of the US government, although the US generally lacks a formal AI strategy.
In the meantime, China presented its plan last year: the country intends to become the No. 1 in the field of AI innovation by 2030.
"The doubling of the budget for AI research would be a good start, given the fact that all other countries are so much further behind the US. We are looking for the next AI breakthrough," said Lee.
The doubling of the financial resources could double the chances that the next major AI success would be achieved in the USA, said Lee this week in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of the company Sinovation Ventures, which invested in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an AI system that defeated the top-ranking American Othello player. Later, he was a senior executive at Microsoft Research and President of the Google branch in China.
Lee honored earlier technology competitions from the U.S. government such as the Robotics Challenge of Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and asked about the time of the next competition, as he wanted to help identify the next visionaries.
According to read words, researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to obtain state subsidies.
"Not China takes the top academics away, but the companies," Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recruited Koryphaen from universities to work on AI.
According to Read, a changed US immigration policy could also be conducive to US AI efforts.
"I think that green cards should be offered automatically in the field of AI-based people," he said.
In July 2017, China's State Council presented its plan for the development of the next generation of AI technologies (Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan).
According to Read words, the National Natural Science Foundation of China is funding people at academic institutions similar to the National Science Foundation and other government organisations awarded funds to US researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower.
At the beginning of this year, the US Department of Defense founded the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, in which partners from industry and science should be involved. Furthermore, the White House announced the formation of a Special Committee for Artificial Intelligence.
DARPA also announced the investment of $2 billion in the AI Next initiative this month.
The National Science Foundation (NSF) currently invests more than 100 million US dollars in AI research annually.
In the meantime, US law on the formation of the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not done anything for months.
Macedonians agree in referendum on a change in the country name
On Sunday, the population of Macedonia voted in a referendum on whether the country's name should be changed to 'the Republic of Northern Macedonia', which would provide a decade-old dispute with Greece, which had blocked Macedonia's applications for inclusion in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that its northern neighbour’s name means that this claim is based on the Greek territory, so Greece has introduced a veto against the inclusion of Macedonia into NATO and the EU.
The two governments signed an agreement in June on the basis of the proposed new name. Nationalist opponents argue, however, that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he would not vote in the referendum. A boycott campaign is in doubt that the election participation reaches the 50 percent required for the validity of the referendum.
The question of voting was: "Are you for membership in NATO and the EU by the adoption of the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the change of name, to which Prime Minister Zoran Zaev belongs, argue that Macedonia, one of the countries resulting from the collapse of Yugoslavia, is worth including in organisations such as the EU and NATO.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, as this means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the result of the vote is not legally binding, enough Members have said that they will adhere to the outcome so that it is decisive.
The change of name would require a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Election Commission said there had been no reports of irregularities by 13.00.
However, voting participation was only 16 percent compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, with 66 percent of registered voters voting.
"I'm here because of my children to vote, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voters in the capital Skopje.
Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko gave their vote in the referendum on the change in the country name that would open Macedonia's way to accession to NATO and the European Union on September 30, 2018.
In front of Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small stage and presented chairs in front of tents set up by people who wanted to boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we would like to join the raised main, not through the back entrance," said Kavadarkov.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the integration between Europe and Asia."
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will result in urgently needed investments for Macedonia, whose unemployment rate is more than 20 percent.
"I believe that a large majority will be in favour, as more than 80 percent of our citizens are for EU and NATO," said Zaev after his vote.
According to his words, a 'yes' result would be a 'confirming of our future'.
According to a survey published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research, between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum.
Another poll conducted by Macedonian TV station found that 57 percent of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
70 percent said they would vote in favour of 'yes'.
In order to ensure that the referendum is successful, the turnout must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failure of the referendum would be the first severe blow to the pro-Western government's policy since its takeover in May last year.
View: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City manoeuvring through the entire Brighton defense to reach goal
On Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling overcame the Brighton defense at the 2:0 victory of Manchester City.
Aguero made his hits look ridiculous in the 65th minute.
At the beginning of the sequence, the Argentine attacker was given a pass in the middle of the field.
He raced between three Brighton defense players and then ran into the open field.
Aguero then saw himself surrounded by four green jerseys.
He played around a defender and then overtook several more defenders at the edge of Brighton's penitentiary.
He then shot a pass to the left of Sterling.
The English attacker used his first ball contact in the penitentiary to play the ball back to Aguero, who overcame Mathew Ryan with his right shoe Brighton-Torhütter and shot it into the right side of the net.
"Aguero fights with problems in his feet," said City Manager Pep Guardiola to reporters.
“We talked about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he got a goal at this moment."
It was Sterling, however, who gave Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League duel.
This gate fell in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball at this train far on the side of Brighton.
He shot a good steep pass along the left flank to Leroy Sané.
Sané needed a few trains to control sterling to the long corner.
The Sky-Blue attacker aimed at the ball in the net just before it slipped out.
City plays in the Champions League game on Tuesday at 12:55 in the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim against Hoffenheim.
Scherzer wants to spoil the rockies game
Since the nationals have left the Playoff competition, there was little reason to force further use.
However, the ever-popular shearer hopes to stand on the hill on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if this is relevant for the rockies that have a game advantage in the NL West in front of the Los Angeles Dodgers, for the playoffs.
The Rockies scored at least one wild card with a 5-2 victory over the Nationals on Friday night, but still wants to secure their first division title.
“Although we don’t play for anything, we can throw at least because we know the atmosphere of the spectators here in Denver and the other team would probably play at the highest level that would meet me this year.
Why should I not want to participate in this competition?"
The Nationals have not yet announced a starter for Sunday, but according to reports, they tend to have Scherzer cast in such a situation.
Scherzer, for whom this would be the 34th bet as a starter, practiced on Thursday in the bull and would throw on Sunday on his normal rest day.
This season, the Washington legal team has a statistics of 18-7, an ERA of 2,53 and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings.
Trump stops rallying in West Virginia
The president referred indirectly to the situation in connection with the board Kavanaugh chosen by him for the Supreme Court when he spoke about the importance of the participation of Republican voters in the intermediate elections.
“All we have done is at stake in November.
Five weeks before one of the most important elections of our lives.
That's one of the big, big ones – I'm not going on, but in reality I'm acting, so I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere," he said.
Trump continued, “You see this terrible, terrible radical group of democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they are determined to take over power again with all means, you see the community, the loathsomeness.
They don't care who they're hurting, who they have to overrun to get the power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we won't give them."
The Democrats, he said, saw their mission to 'do and block resistance'.
"And you see this in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "wrong and mean and disgusting and dishonest."
He called, in particular, the highest-ranking democrat in the Senate Justice Committee, Senator Dianne Feinstein, which triggered loud cow's call from the audience.
“Do you remember their answer?
Did you let the document go out?
Uh, uh, what.
No, no, I'm waiting for you – that was a really bad body language – the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour does not let all opinions apply anymore.
The party is intolerant of those who express their opinion.
When the Momentum activists in my local party voted to blame me, this did not come as a surprise.
Finally, I am the last of a number of Labour Members to whom it is said that they are not welcome – just because we say our opinion.
My colleague Joan Ryan was treated similarly, as she had been energetically opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized with the motion for a plea that I represented a different opinion than Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically on similar issues, about which Jeremy was not in agreement with former top politicians.
The announcement of the meeting of Nottingham East Labour on Friday stated that "the meetings should all include and be productive".
Mostly the Friday evening GC sessions in my eight years as a local Labour Member were exactly that.
Today, unfortunately, most of the meetings are not influenced by this tone, and the promised 'more friendly, prudent' policy has long been forgotten if it has ever begun.
It is becoming increasingly clear that different views in the Labour Party are not tolerated and that any opinion is judged whether they are accepted by the leader of the party.
This began shortly after Jeremy became party leaders. Members, with whom I believed I had previously shared similar political views, now expected me to make a point and take positions that I would never have agreed with, otherwise, with regard to national security or the European internal market.
Whenever I speak publicly – with no role in what I say – a scam in the social media, which calls for my election, urges the political centre and says that I should not be a member of the Labour Party.
And with this experience, I'm not alone.
In fact, I know that I am better than some of my colleagues because the comments I have made are mostly political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of my colleagues, who face a flood of sexist or racist abuses every day and who never give in to it.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political age is that abuses have become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn asked last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we no longer let all opinions apply, and with every distrust request and any change in the electoral rules, the party becomes tighter.
I have often been advised over the last two years to take my head and not express my opinion so clearly, and then I would have no problems.
But I didn't go into politics.
Since 32 years ago as a student, inspired by the neglect of the Thatcher government, because of which my classroom literally broke out in the overall school, which had joined the Labour Party, I have fought for better public services for those who need it most – as a municipal council as well as as as a cabinet minister.
I have never made a hail out of my political views, even at the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could be in any way unclear about my political positions and about areas in which I do not agree with the current leadership.
I would just like to say the following to the supporters of the Friday's motion for a resolution: given the fact that the country is about to race on a Brexit that will harm households, businesses and our public service, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leadership of the Labour Party.
In fact, I am not referring this message to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters, whether they are Labour Members or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that so many threats or political purposes will not prevent me from acting in my opinion best interest of all of you.
Chris Leslie is a MP for Nottingham East
Ayr v. Melrose 38:17: Unspoiled Ayr team rises to the top
Two late attempts may have distorted the final result somewhat, but there is no doubt that Ayr has earned the victory in this extremely entertaining game of the day in the Tenent's Premiership.
They are now the only one of the ten teams unbeated at the top of the table.
Finally, the success of the home team was due to their superior defense as well as to their better exploitation of opportunities, and coach Peter Murchie had every reason to be satisfied.
"We have been tested in our games so far, and we are still unbeated, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "They have used their chances better than we do for Ayr."
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, which was raised by Frazier Clima, led Ayr. However, Melrose was able to speak the numbers due to a yellow card for the Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who had been released for the game from the Warriors, and Jason Baggot caught a non-enhanced attempt.
Climo extended the leadership of Ayr with a penalty step before he hit directly at the half-time and then achieved an increased attempt in the single entrance, so that it stood for Ayr at the break 17:5.
Melrose, however, began well in the second half, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which was increased by Baggot, reduced the distance to five points.
Afterwards, there was a prolonged interruption due to a severe injury of Ruaridh Knott carried by the field. After the continuation, Ayr expanded his lead by an attempt by Climo by Stafford McDowall.
Then, as captain of Ayr, Blair Macpherson received a yellow card, and once again Melrose made the additional man pay enormous pressure at the end of a phase by an unenhanced attempt by Bruce Colvine.
However, the home team came back, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for Tackling without a ball against Climo, MacPherson achieved a touchdown from the runway behind the moving Ayr package.
Climo has been increasing as was almost since the interruption, after Kyle Rowe intercepted David Armstrongs boxkick and sent away flank players Gregor Henry to the fifth attempt of the home team.
“Still Game” star seems ready for new careers in gastronomy
"Still Game" Star Ford Kieran seems to be ready for a change to the hospitality after it turned out to be called the manager of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old is playing Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC broadcast, whose screenplays he writes and in which he plays one of the main roles together with his long-standing comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The two have announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last of the show, and Kirann seems to plan a life after Craiglang.
According to official registrations he is Managing Director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although a source of Scottish Sun suggested that Kirinn was interested in getting into Glasgow's 'floating restaurant business'.
"The sea belongs to us": Bolivia, which is encased by land, hopes that a court will open its way to the Pacific Ocean
Sailors patrol in front of the main marine quarter in La Paz, decorated with dove.
On public buildings a sea blue flag blows.
Fleet bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are the motto: “The sea is our legitimate property.
It is a duty to recover."
The memory of the coastal section lost in Chile in the 19th century in a bloody conflict is still alive throughout Bolivia, as is the desire to go over the Pacific.
These may not be as strong as for decades since Bolivia is waiting for a judgment of the International Court of Justice to be held on 1 October after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, expects the result with a positive attitude," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
A lot of Bolivians are going to follow the IGH’s judgment on large screens, hoping that the Hague court will decide in favor of Bolivia’s claim. According to this, Chile is obliged to negotiate a sovereign access to the sea after decades of sporadic discussions.
For Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president, who is facing a controversial battle for his re-election next year, much is also at stake in the judgment on Monday.
"We are about to return to the Pacific," he praised at the end of August.
However, some analysts consider it unlikely that the court will decide in favor of Bolivia, and believe that this would also make little changes.
The UN body based in the Netherlands is not empowered to address Chilean territory and has determined that it will not decide on the outcome of possible discussions.
In the view of Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law, concludes that the case was "not complicated" six months after the closing plea.
Far from supporting Bolivia's case, the last four years could also be a setback.
"The current Bolivian government has torn the question of access to the sea," Zárate said.
She indicated that Morales' wary rhetoric has suffocated Chile's remaining good will.
Bolivia and Chile will eventually continue their talks, but after these events this will become extremely difficult.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the view that the court's decision had been unusually quick.
On Monday Bolivia has "an extraordinary opportunity to launch a new era of relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "stop 139 years of disputes for mutual benefit," he said.
In addition, Calzadilla disputed that morals – still one of Latin America's most popular presidents – used the subject of the sea as a political crutch.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific," he added.
"The verdict is a chance to realize that we have to overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament takes place only if it can trust the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says that his nation will never be able to disarm its nuclear weapons first if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to implement the promises made during a summit between the heads of state of the rivals in Singapore.
His statements come at a time when U.S. Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo appeared to be about three months after the summit with the North Korean head of state Kim Jong-un in Singapore to bring the fixed nuclear diplomacy back into being.
Ri described the idea that further sanctions and the resistance of the US against a declaration to end the Korea war would ever force the North into its knees, as a "hirkspinst".
Washington is skeptical and does not want to agree to the statement without Pjöngjung taking essential disarmament steps at first.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism that Pjöngjang believes it seriously with the absence of an arsenal in which the country probably sees the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans a visit to Pjöngjang for next month to prepare a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Fashion Shows in Paris show the latest collections for huge headgears that will soon be available in the shopping streets near you
If you want to expand your hat collection or completely shield the sun, you no longer need to search.
Designer Valentino and Thom Browne showed on the runway a range of crazy oversized headgears for their summer collection 2019, which fascinated the fashion world at the Paris fashion week.
Very unpractical hats have flooded Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their spectacular creations across the runway.
The most outstanding piece of Valentino was an extravagant beige-colored hat with a feather-like wide edge, which pushed the heads of the models straight to an extremity.
Other oversized accessories have been shown with jewels of water melons, a magic hat and even an pineapple. However, they are not intended to keep their heads warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a series of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks were fitted with sewn lips and had more similarity with Hannibal Lecter than with Haute Couture.
A creation resembled a diving equipment, including snorkels and diver goggles, while another looked like a melted ice bag.
And if you want to put another huge fashion statement, you're lucky.
Fashion observers predict that the huge headgears could find their way in shopping streets near you.
The oversized hats follow directly to "La Bomba", the straw hat with a width of 60 cm, all of which carry from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the extremely impractical hat, which hit great waves in the social media, sent another great creation over the walkway: a beach bag made of straw, which was almost as large as the one wearing a swim suit that held the bag.
The bass bag in reddish orange with bast francs and a white leather heel was the outstanding piece of Jacquemus' summer-2019 collection "La Riviera" during the Paris fashion week.
Celebrities-Stylist Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: "I expect that large hats and beach bags will be available in the shopping streets for next summer. The designer has caused so much attention that the demand for overdimensional accessories will hardly be ignored."
John Edward: Language skills for world citizens indispensable
Scotland’s independent schools continue to be characterized by academic excellence. This continued in 2018 with further outstanding examination results and is only supported by individual and joint achievements in the areas of sport, art, music and other joint ventures.
With more than 30,000 students from all over Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to care for their students and their parents at the highest possible level.
Independent schools pursue the goal of preparing their pupils for further education and higher education, the profession of their choice and their place as a world citizen.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a tailor-made curriculum, we see that modern languages are still popular and sought after in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to someone in a language he understands, you reach his head.
If you speak with him in his own language, you reach his heart."
This is an impressive reminder that we cannot rely on English alone if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
The current test results of this year show that languages with the highest standing rates are at the top of the rankings of independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of the students who learned foreign languages achieved the grade A during the higher examinations.
The data collected by 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of the students in Mandarin achieved the grade A during the higher examinations, while 72 percent of the students who learned German also achieved 69 percent of the students who were learning French, and 63 percent of the students who learned Spanish achieved the grade A.
This illustrates that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important knowledge that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are considered as elective subjects today as well as STEM subjects (natural sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curriculums of independent schools and elsewhere.
According to a survey conducted by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014, 17 percent of the reasons that employers mentioned for the problems of occupation were related to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly required when it comes to preparing young people for their future occupation.
As more and more open jobs require languages, this knowledge is essential in a globalized world.
Independent of the chosen profession, young people who have learned a second language will have a real advantage through such a life-long ability in the future.
To be able to communicate directly with people from other countries, multilingual people will automatically provide a lead in front of competitors.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak foreign language well enough to have a conversation, and French was spoken of as the only language of a double-digit percentage (15 percent).
For this reason, it is important for the children of today that we now invest in language lessons.
Children who speak several languages, in particular languages of developing countries, will have better opportunities to find meaningful employment.
In Scotland, different languages are taught at all schools.
A number of schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while other languages will teach that are considered most important to the United Kingdom by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Wherever your child's interests lie, in independent schools, a number of languages with appropriate specialised teachers will always be available.
Scottish independent schools are committed to creating a learning environment that prepares the children and equips them with the skills necessary for their success, whatever the future.
At this point in a global economic environment, it cannot be denied that languages are still of fundamental importance for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should actually be regarded as 'international communication'.
Independent schools will continue to offer young people in Scotland this option, diversity and excellence.
Il faut been le faire.
John Edward is head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron before Lakers debut on Sunday in San Diego
For fans who want to see LeBron James joining the Los Angeles Lakers for the first time, the waiting soon ends.
Lakers-Trainer Luke Walton announced that James will be playing against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday's opening game of the pre-season season.
How many minutes it will play, however, is not yet fixed.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on the official website of the Lakers.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James would probably only play a few minutes.
At the beginning of this week James was asked for his plans for the six-game pre-season game plan of the Lakers after the training.
"I don't need pre-season games in this phase of my career to prepare myself," he said.
Time for Trump's rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins this evening in Wheeling, West Virginia, a series of campaign demonstrations.
This is the first of Trump's five demonstrations planned for the next week, including in his well-informed places such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
In view of the floating vote on the confirmation of its election for the Superpreme Court, Trump wants to build support for the upcoming mid-term elections in November, as Republicans are at risk of losing control of the Congress.
When does Trump's rally take place in West Virginia tonight, and how can you watch online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for today, Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 7:00 p.m. (East Coast).
You can track Trump's rally in West Virginia below as a live stream on YouTube online.
Trump is likely to address the hearings of the Board Kavanaugh nominated for the Supreme Court on charges of sexual misconduct held this week in a tense atmosphere. The expected Senate vote on the confirmation remains in the float for up to a week, while the FBI conducts investigations.
However, the main objective of this series is to support Republicans who have to make a difficult choice in November.
Therefore, President Trump's campaign team told Reuters that these five demonstrations will be used in the next week to "mobilize volunteers and supporters while Republicans try to preserve and expand their majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives".
"The control over the Congress is so important for his plans that the President will travel to as many states as possible, while the operational election season is approaching," said a Trump election speaker, who did not want to call his name, to Reuters.
According to the West Virginia Metro News, on this evening at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, there could be "participants of Ohio and Pennsylvania and report media from Pittsburgh".
The visit on Saturday is Trump's second visit this month to West Virginia, the state which he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump tries to support the Republican Senate candidates from West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who are in polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to try to boost him in the surveys," said Simon Haeder, political scientist at West Virginia University, Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team shows a willingness to fight to maintain hope for the individual on Sunday
After three one-sided rounds, the four-parts were possibly exactly what this Ryder Cup needed on Saturday afternoon.
The swinging pendulum of the momentum is a pure invention, but one that players really believe in, especially in competitions like this one.
So where is the momentum of their opinion now?
"They were in the lead with six points, and now it's four, so I think that's a small momentum for us," Jordan Spieth said, leaving the venue.
Europe is of course in favour and is four points ahead, while twelve follow further.
However, according to Spieth, the Americans feel a little wind in their sails and have reason to feel encouraged, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have played together all day and can show three out of four points each.
Spieth was very strong from the trash to the greenery and progresses with good example.
The guttural enthusiasms became louder in the further course of his round when he lowered an important putt to decide the fourth match with four points for both of them after he and Thomas had behind two holes with two points.
His Putt, who decided the match on the 15th hole for her, triggered a similar cry that suggests that the American team is not yet out of play.
"I really have to get in and take care of my own game," said Spieth.
This is all that remains for the individual players.
18 holes to set a sign.
Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days and thus undoubtedly wrote the history of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's uneven but sympathetic duo is four out of four points and can't do anything wrong.
"Moliwood" was not the only couple who had not beaten a Bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they had also avoided on Saturday morning, on Friday afternoon and on the back nine holes on Friday morning, Bogey.
This series and the apparently flowing energy between them and the exhausted amount of energy supporting them that they are the players to beat on Sunday. Fleetwood and Molinari would be the most popular players who won a possible European victory during the sunset of the sun over Le Golf National.
preferably both at the same time on different holes.
However, to speak of European fame would be premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made a short process with Sergio Garcia, the fourth hero of the morning, who played with Alex Noren.
A Bogey and two doubles on the front nine holes brought the Spaniards and the Sweden into a terminal that they could not nearly overcome.
On Sunday, however, no one can help them out of the clamp.
The four and four pairings are so fascinating because of the interactions between the couples, the advice they give or do not give, and the way in which a strategy can change quickly to look so fascinatingly away.
The Europeans have played better as a team so far and are in the lead the last day. However, this four-round has also shown that the U.S. team is ready to fight, which some, especially in the US, had doubted.
Europe is taking the lead on the last day of the Ryder Cup with 10:6
Europe is ahead of the US with 10:6 after the four and four parties on Saturday and goes with a solid lead in the last day of the Ryder Cup.
The brilliant duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari went ahead with two wins over the difficult Tiger Woods and thus scored four points in Le Golf National.
The European team, led by Thomas Bjørn, who wanted to recover the trophies lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the four of them in the morning against the flawed American team and won the series at 3:1.
In the four-parties, the U.S. made more resistance and won two matches, but could not pick up the residue.
Jim Furik's team needed eight points in the twelve on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood won four points in a row, while he and Molinari, who were baptized after a sensational weekend "Molliwood", won four points only as a second duo in the history of the Ryder Cup in their four opening matches.
After beating Woods and Patrick Reed in the four, they harmoniously harmed the enchanted Woods and the American new Bryson Dechambeau with an even stronger 5&4.
Woods, who had towed through two matches on Saturday, occasionally flashed his brilliance, but now lost 19 of his 29 matches in fours and fours and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who had rested during the foursome morning, returned and played the four parties as a partner of Henrik Stenson. They won 2&1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, number one and three of the world.
However, for Europe, this pleasant windy day south-west of Paris did not run everything according to their ideas.
The triple major winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas placed the bar for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They scored a tough 2&1 victory over the Spanish-playing Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter and beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy in the four-parts 4&3 after losing the first two holes.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, it was only twice that a team came back after it had gone into the individual with a back of four points. However, as the title holder for Furyk’s team, a decision is enough to keep the trophy.
After they've been in second place for two days, it doesn't look like they could start a counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea rejects unilateral disarmament without confidence all around
On Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister told the United Nations that continued sanctions would deepen its distrust of the United States and would in no way give up its nuclear weapons on a unilateral basis under these circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho said to the annual General Assembly of the World Organisation that last year North Korea had "taken substantial measures on its own", for example, it stopped nuclear and missile testing, dismantled the nuclear test site and committed itself not to multiplying nuclear weapons and technologies.
"But we do not see a corresponding response from the US," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, there is no confidence in our national security, and under these circumstances we will by no means be one-sided first."
While Ri trusted North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "stage-wise" approach to denuclearisation, in which North Korea would be rewarded for successive steps, his statement seemed significant in that it did not refuse one-sided denuclearisation from the outset, as Pjöngjang had done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first summit between a President-in-Office of the United States and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, in which Kim had agreed to work on the 'denouklarisation of the Korean peninsula', while Trump promised guarantees for the safety of North Korea.
North Korea is seeking an official end to the Korean war between 1950 and 1953, while the United States has said that Pjöngjung must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington also resists demands for a relaxation of the strict international sanctions against North Korea.
"The U.S. insists on "first denuclearisation" and increases the pressure by sanctions to achieve its goal by compulsion, and are even against the "explaination of the end of the war," said Ri.
“The assumption that sanctions can force us into the knees is a brain pain of those who know nothing about us.
However, the problem is that the continued sanctions deepen our distrust."
Ri did not plan for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US head of state had emphasized at the United Nations at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the Minister pointed out three meetings between Kim and the South Korean head of state Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: "If South Korea were the other party in the de-uklearisation question instead of the USA, it would not have been the end of the de-uklearisation of the Korean peninsula."
However, the sound of Ris' speech was very different from his speech last year when he said to the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to target the US mainland with North Korea rockets after "the evil president" Trump Kim had called "racial missiles" on suicide mission.
This year, Trump, who had threatened with the 'full destruction' of North Korea last year, praised Kim with the United Nations for his courage to step up disarmament. However, he said that there was still much work to be done and that sanctions would have to remain in force until the deuclearisation of North Korea.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he has no time frame for it: "Whether it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council must reward Pjöngjang for the steps taken.
However, US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council on Thursday: "In any case, enforcement of the Security Council sanctions must be continued energetically until we have achieved complete, final and verified denuclearisation."
The Security Council has unanimously strengthened sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to financially dry Pjöngjung's nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri on the outskirts of the UN General Assembly and then said that he would visit Pjöngjang again next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not successful.
In July, when he left Pjöngjang, he said that progress had been made only by hours later to be accused by North Korea, that he had made "prior claims".
This month, in a meeting with Moon, North Korea praised the reduction of a rocket base and a nuclear complex when the United States took 'equivalent measures'.
He said that Kim had told him that the 'appropriate measures' sought were security guarantees given by Trump in Singapore, as well as steps to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn in a course, enough to sleep
A new course at Harvard University will ensure that all students get more sleep this year. This is a measure against the expanding macho culture to keep up with caffeine and learn all night long.
A scientist has found that students at the world's leading university are often unnecessary when it comes to paying attention.
The course was designed by Charles Czeisler, Professor of Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School and Specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, and, in his opinion, is the first such course in the USA.
He was inspired to call the course into life after giving a lecture on the effects of sleep withdrawal on learning.
“At the end a girl came to me and asked, ‘Why do I learn about it only now, in my last year?’
According to her words, no one had ever told her how important sleep is. That surprised me," he said to The Telegraph.
This year's course for the first time explained to the students how the basics of good sleeping habits contribute to academic and sporting performance and also improve general well-being.
Paul Barreira, Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Managing Director of University Health Services, said that the University had decided to introduce the course after finding that students had to sleep under heavy withdrawal during the week.
The one hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In a section, the students see the image of a room in a home and click on coffee cups, curtains, training shoes and books. They get information on the effect of caffeine and light as well as the effects of sleep shortage on the sporty performance and the importance of a sleeping routine.
In another section, participants learn that long-term sleep withdrawal may increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes and cancer.
They are then encouraged to think about their daily routine by means of a map of the university site with interactive symbols.
“We know that the behaviour of students will not change immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know this – just as you have the right to know how the decision to smoke affects your health," added Professor Czeisler.
The pride of "moving a night shift" is still widespread, he said, adding that modern technologies and the ever-growing pressure on students made sleep shortages a growing problem.
Sufficient to ensure good sleep, the "secret weapon" of all students should be against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said. Furthermore, a weight gain could be avoided, as sleep withdrawal forces the brain into hunger mode so that they are constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California who studied chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to design the course. Last year, he had completed his first year in Harvard one of his courses.
He said that the course opened his eyes and encouraged him to press on a university-wide course.
He hopes that in the next step all postgraduate students will be invited to complete a similar programme of studies before they start their studies at the competition-oriented university.
According to Professor Czeisler, the students should set themselves an alarm clock for the bedtime and the wake-up time and be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" that originates from electronic screens and LED lighting and can get the circadian rhythm out of the clock. This leads to problems in falling asleep.
Livingston vs. Rangers 1:0: Menga-Tor conquered Gerrards player
The Rangers lost another away game when Dolly Menga's hits for Steven Gerrard's unevenly playing team meant a 0:1 defeat at Livingston.
The Ibrox team wanted to win their first off-off victory at St. Johnstone since the 4-1 triumph, but Gary Holt's team added Gerrard to the second defeat in 18 games as manager, so that his team left eight points behind the Ladbrokes Premiership by far leading Hearts.
Menga met seven minutes before half, and the low-inspiration rangers seemed to have no chance of compensation.
While the Rangers are now in sixth place, Livingston rises third in place and is only behind Hibernian's goal difference.
The Rangers also threatens further trouble after liner Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound by an apparently thrown object from the guest block.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that overtook Ayr and reached the semifinals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, stayed with the same eleven Livingston players who took the Hearts a point last week, and would have to be enthusiastic about how his well-trained team kept their opponent step and step under pressure.
The Rangers dominated the ball, but Livingston reached more when they had the ball.
They should have achieved a goal after just two minutes when Mengas' first bid, Scott Pittman, led to Allan McGregor's goal. However, the midfielder missed his chance and shot at it.
Then a long release from Keaghan Jacobs reached the captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner Alan Lithgow could only shoot at the rear post.
The rangers took control of the game, but in the last third they were more hopeful than convinced.
Alfredo Morelos was obviously of the opinion that after a quarter of an hour of conflict between him and Steven Lawless, he should have had a criminal offence, but arbitrator Steven Thomson did not let the Colombians' complaints apply.
In the first half of the year, the Rangers are only two goal shots, but the former Ibrox tourister Liam Kelly had little trouble with Lassana Coulibaly's headball and a tame shot of Oviedo Ejaria.
Although Livingston's hits may not match the course of the 34th minute, it is not to be denied that they had earned him for their hard work alone.
Again, the rangers could not handle a ball shot by Jacobs in a standard situation.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher shot the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept the rest and chose Menga for a simple degree.
Gerrard acted half-time and exchanged Coulibaly against Ryan Kent. The change was almost immediately effective when the winger put Morelos in position, but the impressive Kelly raced from his line to block the ball.
Livingston, however, continued to lead the guests to play exactly the game they were playing, while Lithgow and Halkett received a long ball after another.
Holt's team could have expanded their lead in the last phase, but McGregor stood up well and refused Jacobs before Lighgow shot a headball out of the corner.
The Rangers exchanger Glenn Middleton also demanded late a criminal offense after a crowd with Jacobs, but Thomson saw away again.
Almanach: The Inventor of the Encounter
And now one page from our "Sunday Morning": On September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for identifying and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as the violin counter.
The violinist has since become a standard element of popular culture, for example in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" with apparently unusual cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What in the world is this?"
Rogers: “This is a violin counter used to search for radioactive minerals like uranium.
If you set up these headphones, you can hear the effects of radioactive radiation in the minerals."
Evans: "Actually, I hear a crack!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
The invention, which bears his name, however, lives on.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" depleted cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" and destroy depleted cells.
In the course of treatment, the vaccine tells the immune system to detect depleted cells.
The method takes out immune cells that are changed in the laboratory to a patient.
These cells can "see" a lot of cancers of common protein and are then injected again.
A test vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
The ovary cancer of a woman who has been treated with the vaccine who is teaching the immune system to detect degenerated cells disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method removes immune cells from a patient that are modified in the laboratory so that they can "see" the many cancers common protein HER2 and then inject the cells again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "promots the growth of various types of cancer", including breast, ovary, lung and colon cancer, as Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar method in which patients are removed and taught to attack cancer cells has helped to treat leukemia.
After his appearance at SNL, Kanye West released a pro-Tirade, wearing a MAGA cap ("Make America Great Again").
It didn't work well.
Kanye West was bred live at Saturday Night in the studio after he had praised profuse US President Donald Trump and said he wanted to join in 2020 as a presidential candidate.
After singing his third title of the evening, "Ghost Town", and wearing a Make American-Great-Again-Cape, he continued with a schmpf canonade against the Democrats and again stressed his support for Trump.
“I’m so often asked by white people, ‘How can you like Trump? He’s a racist.”
So, if I were worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
SNL started the show with a sketch with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywoodstar made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's statement to the Senate's judicial committee on the charges of sexual harassment raised by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although the recording of West's Schimpfirade was not sent, she was uploaded to social media by the comedian Chris Rock.
It is not clear whether Rock wanted to make fun of the West release.
West also complained to the audience that he had difficulties behind the stage because of his headgear.
“They harassed me behind the stage.
They said, “Don’t go out with the cap.”
You harassed me!
And then they say I'm in a sunken area," he said, according to the Washington Examer.
West went on to say, "Do you want to see the sunken area?" He said, "He's going to put on my supermancape, because that means you can't tell me what I have to do. You want it to go ahead with the world?
Try it with love."
At least twice his comments triggered bhuufs from the audience, and SNL agents were embarrassingly touched, Variety reported. One person said the magazine: "It was dead-silence in the studio."
West was forced to replace Ariana Grande, whose former friend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days before.
West confused many with a lecture of the title "I Love it", in which he was dressed as a perrier bottle.
West received support from Candace Turner, the head of the conservative group TPUSA. She thundered: "To one of the most courageous spirits: DANKE, THAT YOU DO THE MASS REVENUE HAST."
The talk show moderator Karen Hunter, however, tweeted that West was simply himself and that was absolutely wonderful.
“But I do NOT want to reward someone who, in my opinion, makes himself and is harmful to my community (by buying his music or his clothing or supporting his ‘art’).
He's free.
The same is true of us," she added.
Before the broadcast, the rapper had announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and that he was now "The being formally known as Kanye West" (the officially Kanye West being).
He is not the first artist to change his name, and follows the footsteps of Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His rapper colleague Snoop Dogg bore the name Snoop Lion, and of course Prince, the late music legend, changed his name to a symbol and then to "The Artist Formerly Known As Prince" (the former Prince).

"Game of Thrones" Star Kit Harington attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as a sword swinging Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series "Game of Thrones".
The 31-year-old actor, however, attacked the stereotype of the macho hero. He said that such roles on the screen would have the effect that boys would often feel like having to be strong to be respected.
In conversation with The Sunday Times Culture, Harington said he believed something had gone wrong and asked how to solve the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo age.
Harington, who recently married Rose Leslie, who was also working with "Game of Thrones", also 31, admitted that the solution to the problem was "very important".
"I personally find the question very important, what has gone wrong with masculinity," he said.
"What have we taught growing men about the problem we are now observing?"
Harington believes that television may be partly responsible for increasing toxic masculinity due to the very masculine characters.
He continued: “What is inborn, and what has been learned?
What is taught on television and on the street that gives the boy the feeling of having to embody this particular side of a man?
I think that is really one of the big questions of our time: How do we change that?
For something has clearly gone wrong with the young men."
In addition, he admitted in the interview that after the end of the series he would not participate in Prequels or Sequels of "Game of Thrones" after the end of the series next summer. He had "enough of battlefields and horses".
From November onwards, Harington is on display in a new edition of Sam Shepard's "True West", the story of a film producer and his brother, a robber.
The actor recently revealed that for him, "Game of Thrones" was best known to his wife Rose.
"I met my wife on this mission, so I have thus received my future family and my life from now on," he said.
Rose Leslie played in Ygritte, the lover of Harington's character Jon Snow with numerous Emmy's excellent fantasy series.
The two married in June 2018 on Leslie's family business in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports increase of 14% in new cases
China has announced an increase of 14°% in the number of citizens living with HIV or AIDS.
According to health officials, more than 820,000 people are affected in the country.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
In contrast to the past, the transmission took place in the vast majority of new cases through sexual intercourse.
Up to now, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, reported Chinese health officials at a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS has risen by 100,000 in China year-on-year.
HIV transmission through sexual intercourse is an acute problem in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT community members is to be widespread.
Based on the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90 % of men who have sex with men ultimately marry women.
Many of the disease transmissions are due to insufficient protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has, among other things, promised general access to HIV drugs to address the problem.
Maxine Waters argues that employees had the data transmitted by GOP Senators, criticises "risky lies" and "conspiracy theories"
Maxine Waters, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, argued on Saturday that a member of her staff had published the personal information of three Republican US senators on the Wikipedia pages of the MEPs.
The Democrat from Los Angeles held that the claims of 'ultra-right' experts and websites would be spread.
"Lying, lying and even more disgusting lies," said Waters in a Twitter explanation.
The information published is intended to include the private addresses and telephone numbers of US Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday. They were published during the hearing of a Senate Committee on the accusations of sexual crimes committed against the Supreme Court Candidates Brett Kavanaugh by an unknown person in the government district.
The release took place after the three Senators had interviewed Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Poundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the contributions was assigned to Waters’ office and published the information of a member of Waters’ staff, reported The Hill.
"This unfounded accusation is completely wrong and an absolute lie," continued Waters.
“The member of my staff – whose identity, personal data and security were threatened by these fraudulent and false accusations – was in no way responsible for sending this information.
This unfounded accusation is completely wrong and an absolute lie."
Waters’ explanation quickly triggered criticism online, including Ari Fleischer, a former press speaker of the White House.
"This dementi is angry," wrote Fleischer.
“This suggests that she does not have the right temperament to be a congressman.
Those who are accused of something they have not done must not be angry.
They must not be defiant.
They must not question the motives of the prosecutor.
They must be quiet and let go."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters’ reaction with the criticism of the Democrats to Judge Kavanaugh, accused by critics, during the hearing on Thursday, to have been too angry.
Also Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is taking part in the mid-term elections to redeem waters, expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great thing, if that is true," he thundered.
Waters said in her statement that her office had informed the competent authorities and law enforcement authorities of these fraudulent claims.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are revealed," she continued, "and they will be held accountable for all their actions which are destructive and dangerous to all the members of my staff."
Criticism of "Johnny English – Man lives only three times" – weak espionage parody with Rowan Atkinson
It is now tradition to search in every British-coloured new film for Brexit references. This also seems to be true for this revival of the action comedy parody franchise "Johnny English", which began in 2003 with "Johnny English – The Spion that ragged it" and came back in 2011 with "Johnny English – Now Right" stuttering again.
Will an ironic self-paradise on the subject, how obvious are we, become a new export chance for the nation?
In any case, the license of the glorious, Grimase cutting and incompetent Johnny English was extended for the second time. His name indicates more than anything else that it is a general comic creation for cinema visitors in non-English-speaking areas.
Of course, he is again the clumsy secret agent who seems to be cool and worldly, while in reality he has contributed to the title melody of "The Hour of the Victor" at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games in London.
In addition, the figure originally based on the chaos behind behind behind travellers and international secret agents, which Atkinson played in the now forgotten Barclaycard television commercials.
The last adventure of Johnny English has one or two nice moments.
I liked Johnny English approaching a helicopter in a medieval armor, and the rotor blades were coming close to his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comic occurs, but the humor seems rather weak and strangely superfluous, especially because the "serious" film series such as "007" and "Mission Immosible" now offer self-confident comediantic elements.
The humor seems more to be aimed at children than at adults, and for me Johnny English's crazy miscarriage is not as imaginative and focused as Atkinson's silent film gags in the role of Bean.
The eternally up-to-date premise is now that Great Britain is in great danger.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the super-secret British spy network and revealed the identities of all British agents in use, very much to the displeasure of the serving agent, an unfortunately small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last straw for the Prime Minister, an inflated and intimidated figure, which is already facing the complete collapse due to her political indifference: Emma Thompson gives her best with this Quasi-Teresa May character, but the script does not produce much with which she can work.
Their intelligence consultants inform them that all the active spies have been detached and therefore have to get someone out of retirement.
This includes Tolpatschige Johnny English himself, who now works as a teacher at a sent facility, but who is officially teaching in working as an undercover agent. There are a few gags, because English offers a spy academy reminiscent of "School of Rock".
English will be brought back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and reunited with his former heavily tested Kumpan Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine commandant, a nervous woman of the higher society, in whose role Vicki Pepperdine is something wasted.
So Batman and Robin, who in the secret service of your Majesty always make everything terrible wrong, are back in action. They encounter Olga Kurylenkos beautiful femme Fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister is dangerously in the spell of a charismatic tech billionaire, the dark Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy, who claims to be able to solve the computer problems of Britain.
English and Bough start their odyssee of the grotesque meats: As waiters dressed they set up a chic French restaurant in fire, they take care of chaos as they smuggle on board Voltas luxury yacht, and English triggers pure anarchy when he tries to familiarize himself with the interior of Voltas house with a virtual reality set.
In this last sequence, all registers are drawn, but as sympathetic and funny as they are, the topic is already being dealt with in detail in children's television.
Pretty moderate substance.
As with the other Johnny-English films, I had to ask myself, "Cann't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really meets his talent?"
Labour contests to work on a plan according to which the British are to be paid four days a week, but for five days
Jeremy Corbyns Labour Party is expected to consider a radical plan that provides that the British will work four days a week, but will be paid for five days.
The party wants to report that business leaders pass on to employees the savings achieved by the AI revolution (artificial intelligence) in the form of an additional free day.
This would give the employees a three-day weekend, but would still receive the same payment.
According to sources, the idea of the party's economic agenda and its plans to shift the balance in the country in favour of the workers is appropriate.
The transition to a four-day week was supported by the Trade Union Congress as the opportunity for workers to take advantage of the benefits of the changing economy.
A high - ranking source from the Labour Party said to the Sunday Times: “It is expected that before the end of the year a policy review will be announced.
"A change will not occur overnight, but a working week of four days is an effort which is consistent with the party's approach to restoring the economic balance for workers and the general industrial policy strategy of the party."
The Labour Party would not be the first party to support such an idea. The Green Party already promised to introduce a 4-day week during the 2017 general election campaign.
At present, however, the Labour Party does not support the approach as a whole.
The Labour Party spokesperson said: "A 4-day week is not a party policy and it is not considered by the party."
In the Labour Conference last week, shadow Chancellor John McDonnell specified his idea of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to regain the power of 'anonym directors' and 'profit-makers' in public utilities.
The shadow Chancellor's plans also mean that the current shareholders of the water supply companies may not be holding back their entire share, as a Labour government could take place due to alleged misconduct of 'deduct'.
He also confirmed the corresponding plans to appoint employees to the board of companies and to set up Inclusive Ownership Funds to transfer 10% of the equity of private companies to employees who cash annual dividends of up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy comment in the newsmagazine "60 Minutes", whether the FBI's investigation in the case of Kavanaugh could change their opinion
The FBI investigation on the accusations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed a final vote on his appointment as Judge at the Supreme Court by at least a week and raises the question of whether the results of the Authority could influence Republican Senators in order to gain their support.
In an interview on Sunday, the 60-minute correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could bring something up, which could eventually change their opinion.
Kennedy seemed to be more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
“I told the trial that I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after that, this allegation was uttered, and asked if he had done it.
He was determined, determined and unmistakable."
Graham's voice, however, seems to be crushed in stone.
"My opinion is firm as to Brett Kavanaugh, and it would have to put a bomb," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know the following: Brett has fought this vehement," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone who called them couldn't confirm it."
It's now 36 years.
And I can't find any changes."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and was involved in reducing poverty as part of this festival?
This Saturday, the Global Citizen Festival will be held in New York to fight an annual music festival with an impressive lineup of stars and an equally impressive mission to combat poverty in the world.
Tens of thousands will visit the Global Citizen Festival, which will take place this year for the 7th time, not only to experience the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the actual goal of the event: the fight against extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which took place for the first time in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project. As part of this project, an international group of interests is trying to combat poverty by encouraging more and more people to participate actively in the fight against poverty.
In order to get a free ticket for the event (the other option would be to buy a VIP ticket), one must complete a number of tasks. These include actions such as volunteering, communication with a leading politician worldwide (by e-mail or telephone) or similar measures to increase awareness of the goal – the fight against poverty.
How successful is the project if you consider that Global Citizens remain 12 years to reach the goal?
Is the idea to look for a cool free concert, a sensible way to convince others that it is time to act, or just another case of so-called clicktivism – if you think you can change something by signing an online petition or sending a Tweet?
Global Citizen announced that since 2011, the project has been able to report more than 19 million actions from its supporters and achieve different goals.
These actions have helped to encourage leading politicians around the world to announce commitments and strategies worth more than 37 billion dollars, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the Group cited 390 commitments and announcements arising out of its operations, of which at least US$10 billion have already been paid out or acquired via fundraising.
The Group estimates that the funds secured have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Among some of the main obligations is The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and implementationists based in the United Kingdom, who have committed to supporting children in their optimal development, and who have promised to help Rwanda fight malnutrition in the United Kingdom with $35 million after receiving more than 4,700 Tweets of Global Citizens.
"With the support of the Government of the United Kingdom, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history," the Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, told the audience during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The Group also announced that after more than 5,000 actions by which Britain was invited to improve the nutrition situation of mothers and children, the government announced the funding of the The Power of Nutrition project, which aims to reach 5 million women and children and provides nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the website, which is the reason why Global Citizens can fight extreme poverty,
replied: “There will be a long and strenuous path with heights and depths.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-partheid movements in front of us, we will succeed as we are together stronger and more influential.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the artists that take place at this year’s New York event. Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman are also presenters.
The US could use the Navy for blockade purposes to hinder Russian energy exports – Interior Ministry
According to Washington Examine, Washington can use the Navy if necessary to ensure that energy from Russia does not reach markets, including the Middle East, told US Secretary of State Ryan Zinke.
Zinke claimed that the use of Russia in Syria is an excuse for exploring new energy markets. Russia is currently operating at the invitation of the legitimate government in these areas.
"I think the real reason for Russia's use in the Middle East is the negotiation of new markets in energy, just as in Eastern Europe," he said.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to deal with this.
"The United States, together with the Navy, can ensure that the sea roads remain open and block them if necessary in order to ensure that the energy from Russia does not reach the market," he said.
Zinc turned to the participants in the event of the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that is considered to be a "voice of electricity users" in the US.
He drew a comparison between Washington's approaches in dealing with Russia and Iran and noted that they are practically identical.
"The use and replacement of fuels is more or less the economic option in Iran and Russia," he said, while calling Russia "One Trick Pony" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements were made when the government under Trump was in the process of extending the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe and thus replacing Russia, the far more cost-effective option for consumers in Europe.
For this purpose, government officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "unreasonable" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump Berlin, became a "capture" Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline worth $11 billion, which is intended to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is an exclusively economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's massive resistance to the project is due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we all believe that energy should not be used as a means of exerting pressure, and that consumers can choose the suppliers themselves," said Aleksandr Novak, Russian Energy Minister, after a meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US has received counterwind from Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industrial organisation, the Federal Association of German Industry (BDI), has asked the US to stand out from EU energy policy and bilateral treaties between Berlin and Moscow.
"It's a big problem if a third country interferes in our energy supply," says BDI Dieter Kempf after a meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren wants to “exact” a presidential candidate for 2020, says the Senator for Massachusetts
The Senator for Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren announced on Saturday that she would "check" a presidential candidate after the intermediate elections.
During a Town Hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she is considering a candidate.
According to The Hill, Warren, it would be time for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, which includes women at the top.
Warren plans to 'exactly examine' a presidential candidate after 6 November.
Warren said during the meeting that President Trump is turning this country in the wrong direction.
"I am extremely concerned about how Donald Trump deals with our democracy," she said.
Warren, in her criticism of Donald Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, candidate for the Supreme Court, took no note.
In a Tweet on Friday, she announced that an FBI investigation was of course necessary before the vote.
However, a survey published on Thursday showed that the majority of Warren voters do not believe that they should be candidates for 2020.
According to the Suffolk University Political Research Center and Boston Globe survey, 58 percent of potential voters in Massachusetts reported that the Senator should not be able to do so.
32 percent of voters supported such a candidate.
The survey showed more support for a candidate of former Governor Deval Patrick; 38 percent who favour a potential candidate, and 48 percent who are against it.
Among the other names of prominent democrats in question in relation to a potential candidate for 2020 are former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator of Vermont, Bernie Sanders.
According to Associated Press, Biden announced that he would make an official decision by January.
Sarah Palin says the Donald Trump-Ralley about post-traumatic stress disorder, suffering from Track Palin
Track Palin, 26, was in Iraq for a year.
He was arrested and accused of domestic violence on Monday night.
"What my son is going through when he returns, other families can feel the effects of PTBS and some of the wounds that our soldiers return with," she told the audience at a ralley for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin described his arrest as "Elefant in Space" and said about her son and other war veterans that they were changed, that they were coming back more brutally, that they were coming back and wondering if there was this respect for what other soldiers and pilots and every other member of the military had given to the country.
He was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska on Monday and accused of domestic violence at a woman, Dan Bennett, a spokesman of the Wasilla Police Department.
18 States and D.C. support a legal remedy to the new asylum policy
18 States and the District of Columbia support an appeal to the new US policy that refuse victims of gang activities or domestic violence asylum.
Representatives from the 18 states and the district submitted a hearing expert statement in Washington on Friday to support an asylum applicant questioning politics, reported NBC News.
The full name of the complainant in the Grace-opposed session complaint filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal politics was not announced.
She announced that her partner "and his violent gang wages" abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her application for asylum on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The prosecutors who support Grace referred to El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where many people apply for asylum in the US, as nations who have to deal with major problems with criminal gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asyl policy raised a decision of the Board of Immigration appeals from 2014, which allowed illegal immigrants to apply for asylum in flight from domestic violence.
In a statement on Friday, the Federal Attorney General of the District of Columbia, Karl Racine, said that the new policy was "to be ignored for decades of legislation at state, state and international level".
"The German Federal Act states that all applications for asylum are assessed on the basis of the facts and circumstances of the application, and that court infringes this principle," was stated in the court expert statement.
Furthermore, the lawyers argued in the statement that the policies that refuse immigrants' access to the country have an unfavourable effect on the economy in the US, as immigrants could be more active as entrepreneurs and provide the necessary labour force.
In June, the Federal Attorney Jeff Sessions ordered that immigration judges who fled from domestic violence and the violence of criminal gangs no longer grant asylum.
"Asyl is there for all who leave their homeland because they are persecuted or for fear of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a particular social group or political conviction," said Sessions in his announcement of June 11 policy.
It has never been the plan to elevate all the problems by granting asylum, even all the serious problems people face in the world every day.
Desperate rescue attempts in Palu, as the number of deaths in the race doubles with time
For the survivors, the situation became increasingly worse.
"It's all very tense," says the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, calming down her little feverish son in a rescue center in the destroyed city center of Palu.
“Every minute a new ambulance comes with the dead.
Clean drinking water is scarce."
Residents returned to their destroyed houses to collect their stuff and wealth and to keep everything they could find.
Hundreds were injured, and the staff of the hospitals, damaged by the earthquake with the strength 7.5, were completely overburdened.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who had a spinal fracture and a broken shoulder, remained outside Palu's military hospital, where patients were treated on the outside because of the persistent strong aftershocks.
With tears in his eyes, he told us how the violent earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and his daughter.
“ Everything went too fast.
I think I was stuck under the invaded walls," he reported to the Associated Press, adding that the reason for staying in the city was a wedding.
“I heard my wife’s calls for help, but then I was calm.
I don't know what happened to my wife and my child.
I can only hope they're in a safe place."
U.S. ambassadors sue China of tyranny with "propaganda ads"
One week after an official Chinese newspaper had posted a four-page announcement in an American daily newspaper in which the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China were announced, the US ambassador in China accused Beijing of exploiting the American press for progaganda purposes.
USA Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to the paid supplement of the China Daily in the Des Moines Register, the best-selling magazine in Iowa, after accusing China of interfering in the US Congress elections on November 6th, a charge that China contests.
Trump's accusations that Beijing has tried to interfere in the US elections corresponds to the announcement from U.S. officials to Reuters; a new phase of an escalating campaign triggered by Washington to pressure China.
While it is common for foreign governments to place advertising on the promotion of the economy, Beijing and Washington are currently involved in an expanding trade war, with customs duties on imports for both countries.
The Chinese retaliation tariffs at the beginning of the trade war should meet exporters in countries such as Iowa, who supported the Republican Party of Trump, said Chinese and US experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former long-standing governor of Iowa, who exports large-scale agricultural products to China, announced that Beijing has damaged workers, farmers and businesses.
China, according to Branstad in a review in Des Moines Register of Sunday, now doubles this tyranny by switching propaganda ads in its own free press in the US.
"With the spread of its propaganda, the Chinese government claims the American-proven tradition of free expression and the independent press by turning the country's advertising into the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"Unlike that, you will only find a limited number of votes here in Beijing and no real reflection of the differing opinions that the Chinese might have on the disturbing economic development of China, given that the media are firmly in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that one of the most famous newspapers in China did not accept the offer to publish its article, but did not mention the name of the newspaper.
Republicans praise voters before the intermediate elections with the debacle around Kavanaugh, warn observers
Since many of the most influential Republicans support and defend the candidates for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, in the face of several accusations for sexual violence, observers have warned against a counter-reaction during the upcoming inter-elections that could be caused in particular by women.
The mood in this context was extremely tense, and most Republicans have already stated that they continue to vote.
"You can't undo such things," said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Reeder said that he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s last-minute advance for an FBI investigation was sufficient to appease angry voters.
"Women don't forget what was yesterday, they don't forget it tomorrow and not in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, first consultant and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, according to the Washington daily newspaper D.C.
On Friday morning, demonstrators called in the hall of the Senate "November is coming!" when the Republicans controlling the Justice Committee decided to hold on to the nomination of Kavanaughs, despite the statement of Dr Christine Blasey Ford, reported Mic.
Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are an extremely important topic, told Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political observer on the news side.
“People say it’s high already, that’s true.
But it could be higher, especially with female voters in the suburbs and with younger voters, people between 18 and 29 who, although they do not like the president, often do not choose."
Even before Ford's public statement, in which their accusations of the sexual attack against the candidates of the Supreme Court are listed in detail, observers indicated that a counter-reaction could be the consequence if the Republicans advance the confirmation.
"This situation is a worse mess for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee at the beginning of last week, says NBC News.
"It is not only about voting on the body, the final vote or the review of Kavanaughs; it is also about the way the Republicans have dealt with it and how they have dealt with it," said Guy Cecil, Director of Priorities USA, a group that supports the election of Democrats, to the news channel.
The Americans, however, seem to disagree with whom they should believe because of Ford's statements and Kavanaugh, with a slightly larger share of the latter's side.
A new survey by YouGov showed that 41% of respondents were definitely or probably convinced of Ford's statement, while 35% said they were definitely or probably giving Kavanaugh faith.
In addition, 38% stated that they considered that Kavanaugh was probably or definitely lying in his statement, while 30% said the same about Ford.
Following the pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the accusations made by Ford and at least another complainant, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford issued an affidavit to the Senate Justice Committee last week that she was attacked by the drunk Kavanaugh at the age of 17 years.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court had rejected his genius when they were at a party during her studies in Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to counter Google and Facebook
Tim Berner's-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is currently launching a market with the aim of establishing a competition with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company based on the open source platform Solid by Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to select where their data is stored and who gets access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berner's-Lee gave the best that the intention behind Inrupt was the "world domination".
"We need to be active now," he said on startup.
'It's a historical moment.'
The app uses Solid's technology so users can create their own personal online data storage or a POD.
It can contain contact lists, to-dos lists, a calendar, a music library and other tools for the private and corporate sector.
Similar to Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, all content is available in a browser and at the same time.
The special thing about the personal online data storage is that the user can only decide who can access which data.
The company describes this concept as personal strengthening and development of data.
According to the CEO of the company John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is that the company uses resources, processes and appropriate skills to make Solid available to all.
The company currently includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, some developers who have been recruited for work on this project, as well as a community of volunteer programmers. Furthermore, a security platform purchased by IBM is used.
At the beginning of this week, technology developers will be able to create their own decentralised apps worldwide with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee informed us that he and his team will not share with Facebook and Google about whether a comprehensive change is to be made, in which their entire business models will be completely reformed overnight.
"We do not ask for their permission."
In a medium post published on Saturday, Berner-Lee wrote that Inrupt has the task of providing commercial energy generation and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new Solid-based web.
In 1994, Berners-Lee created a redesign of the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months Berner-Lee has been involved in the debate on net neutrality.
Even with the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely confident about this new era of the web," he added.
Priest Bernard Vann, bearer of the Victorian Cross in World War I, was honored
The only clergyman of the Church of England, who was awarded the Victorian Cross during World War I, was honored in his hometown 100 years later.
Colonel and Priest Bernard Vann won the award due to his commitment to attack Bellenglise and Lehaucourt on September 29, 1918.
However, four days later he was killed by a sniper and never learned that he had won the highest British war award.
His two grandsons revealed a memorial stone on Sunday at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of the grandsons, Michael Vann, said that this act was full of symbolic power, because the memorial stone was revealed exactly 100 years after the heroic act for which his grandfather was awarded.
According to The London Gazette, Colonel Vann led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin on September 29, 1918, through dense fog and heavy shooting of field guns and machine guns.
Later on, he pushed to the fireline and led the line forward with the "greatest bravery" before moving off three of the military units with a single field force.
Colonel Vann was shot by a German sniper on October 4, 1918; a little more than a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were something he could never achieve, and at the same time something that makes one humble.
Together with his brother, Dr. James Vann, he laid a crown after the parade under the direction of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he felt very honored to be able to participate in the parade, adding that the bravery of a real hero is seen especially by the support of many people.
MMA fans stayed awake all night to see Bellator 206, instead there was Peppa Pig
Imagine you stayed awake all night to see an exciting Bellator 206, and then you can't see the main event.
The bill of San Jose contained 13 fights, including 6 on the main map, and was broadcast live all night in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for their fight, the viewers in the United Kingdom were not surprised to see Peppa Pig suddenly.
Some remained untouched after they stayed awake until early morning hours to see the fight specifically.
On Twitter, a fan described the switch to the cartoon character as a kind of bad joke.
"As a result of a government regulation, this content is not considered to be youth-free, so that it had to be switched to a children's broadcast at 6 a.m.," said Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice President of the Marketing and Communication Division at Bellator, when he was interviewed about the transfer.
"Peppa, the pig, exactly."
The Board of Directors at Bellator, Scott Coker, announced that the company will work on the expiry plan in order to take future account of viewers from the United Kingdom.
"I think the problem might have been solved during the replay," he said.
“But it is 6 a.m. on a Sunday with the viewers in the United Kingdom, and we will not solve the incident until Sunday our time, Monday local time there.
But we're not going anywhere.
There was a lot of communication at the changeover. It was pretty messed up and it wasn't always nice.
We have tried to solve the problem, and have assumed that this is a technical disorder.
That was not the case, it was a problem on the part of the government.
I promise it won't happen again.
We will reduce this to 5 instead of 6 fights, as in the normal case. And we have tried to offer the fans the best possible experiences.
The whole situation is quite regrettable."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels "disputed" on the subject of sexuality
Tom Daley, who took part in various Olympic games as a water jumper, says that he grew up feeling he was underlying everyone else because of his sexuality. But this feeling motivated him to be so successful.
The 24-year-old said that he had only realized at the secondary school that he was different from others.
In the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs with Lauren Laverne, he said that he spoke on the subject of gay rights to encourage others.
He also meant that since he became a father, winning the Olympic Games is no longer so important to him.
The actual moderator of the long-term show, Kirsty Young, pauses as a result of illness for several months.
In the first mission of Laverne, he said that he had previously considered himself inferior to others, as the love for boys and girls was socially totally unacceptable.
He said: "Until today is feeling of being inferior to others and different from the others, reason for my power and strength and ultimately for my success."
He wanted to prove that he was a very special personality to disappoint no one when his sexual orientation became known.
The double bronze medal winner at the Olympic Games is today a prominent LGBT activist and used his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to advance the decriminalisation of homosexuality in other countries.
He said he spoke on this issue because, fortunately, he can live without restrictions and without discrimination and want to make others brave.
The triple world champion fell in love with the US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013. The knowledge of falling in love with a man was an absolute surprise to him.
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner in the previous year, but he shared that the age difference had never been a topic.
He thinks that if you had to go through so much as a child and a teenager – he took part in the Olympic Games with 14 for the first time and his father died of cancer three years later, it is difficult to find someone at the same age with similar experiences.
The couple has had a son since June who bears the name Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley thinks that his whole view has changed since then.
Last year, everything was about gold medals.
But for him there are now more important than Olympia Gold medals.
His son Robbie is now his main win.
He bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 following the diagnosis of brain tumor.
Daley said that his father did not accept the near death, and one of the last things he asked about was the tickets for London 2012, as he wanted to be with him at the front.
"I couldn't tell him he wouldn't be there anymore," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only then did I finally realize that he was not invincible," he continued.
The following year Daley won the bronze medal at the 2012 Olympic Games.
“I just knew it was always my dream to dive in Olympic games before the local audience – that was the madness,” he said.
His first selection of songs – Proud by Heather Small – was also influenced by this. He heard the song in front of the Olympic Games and still provided geesekin.

Mickelson, who is currently not in shape, is sitting at the Ryder Cup on Saturday on the replacement bench
The American Phil Mickelson will record a record on Sunday at his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he has to make a lot of effort so that the whole thing doesn't become a debacle.
Mickelson, who plays for the 12th time at the event, was sent to the substitute bank by Captain Jim Furk for the Fourballs and Foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being at the heart of the event as usual, the five-time major winner spent his day firing and working on his game, hoping to fix the problems that burden him.
Even at the height of his career, the 48-year-old Mickelson was never the most direct golfer and thus no ideal occupation for the narrow Le Golf National Golf Course, where misguided balls are regularly punished.
And as if the place itself were not discouraging enough, in the ninth game on Sunday Mickelson meets the perfectionist British Open Champion Francesco Molinari, who has joined Tommy Fleetwood, newcomer at these tournaments, to win all four games this week.
If the Americans with four points fail to take a hot start at the 12 single games, Mickelson's game could prove absolutely decisive.
Furyk spoke with confidence to Mickelson and could not add much.
"He was fully aware of his role today, gave me a slap on his back and put his arm around me and said he's ready for tomorrow," Furk said.
“He has a lot of self - confidence.
He is one of the world-renowned personalities and he has done so much for these teams in the past and also this week.
I didn't think he was in two games.
I had imagined more, but that's how it went now, and that's what we were expecting.
He wants to be there like everyone else."
Mickelson will achieve the Nick Faldos record for most of the Ryder Cup games performed on Sunday.
It could mean the end of a Ryder Cup runway that never completely match the highlights of his personal record.
Mickelson has recorded 18 wins, 20 defeats had to be inserted and seven half-times reached, although Furyk informed him that his presence alone has enriched the team.
"He's funny and sarcastic, original, and he likes to make a few pieces, and he's a great person who's popular with the whole team," he said.
“I think the younger players were happy to get to know him a little closer this week. It was fun watching them.
He is a really interesting person who gives many impulses."
Captain Thomas Bjørn knows it can soon be over with the lead
Thomas Bjørn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a great advantage that leads to the last single games in the Ryder Cup can quickly become an unpleasant situation.
The Dane debuted in 1997 in Valderrama, where a team led by Seve Ballesteros had an advantage of five points against the Americans, but only came over the finish line and went on the lead with the smallest lead, winning a victory of 141⁄2–131⁄2.
"The thought remains that we had a big advantage in Valderrama, we had a great advantage in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but that's only short," said Bjørn (shown in the photo), after having seen the victory 5–3 of the Class of 2018 both on Friday and yesterday to lead 10-6 at Le Golf National.
Experience shows me and all team members that it's not over.
It's going to be okay tomorrow.
Put yourself in the stuff and do the right thing.
The whole thing is only over when the points are on the scoreboard.
We want to win this trophy, and that's where our focus lies.
I have always said it, I focus on the 12 players on our side, but we are fully aware of what is facing us on the other side: the best players in the world."
Happy about the performance his players performed on a difficult golf course, Bjorn continued: “I would never overburden that.
Tomorrow's gonna be another caliber.
Tomorrow, individual benefits are in the foreground, and this is a completely different thing.
It's great to work with a partner when things are running well, but if you're out there alone, you'll be tested up to the limits of your abilities as golfers.
You have to make this clear to the players: get the best out of you tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind you and he must also get the best out of himself."
In contrast to Bjorn, his match with Jim Furk will ensure that his players cut off better individually than in the team, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Furk himself stood on both sides of those great turnarounds on the last tournament day. He stood on the winner side in Brookline before he stood on the side of the losers after Europe's 'Wunder of Medinah'.
"I remember every damn word," he answered the question as Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, motivated his players before the last day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you would like to withdraw the quick start you saw in Brookline and Medinah.
When the momentum hits in one direction, it puts the middle games under a lot of pressure.
We set up our team accordingly and send out our boys as we feel, you know, we're trying to enchant tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned to take the counter-slaught, he had to compete in the top game against Rory McIlroy, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as another European in the upper half of the rankings.
"I have opted for the boys in this order, as I believe it will cover everything," says Bjorn about his selection of individual meetings.
Germany's new warship again delayed
The latest German fleets should have been put to service in 2014 to replace the warships that have been arrived in the years of the Cold War. However, according to local media, they will be delivered only at the earliest next year due to faulty systems and rapidly growing costs.
The commissioning of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the guide ship of the brand new Fregatts of the "Baden-Württemberg" class, has now been shifted to the first half of 2019, according to the time that called on a military speaker.
The ship should have been put into service in 2014, but the ambitious project of worrying problems after the extradition had been plagued.
The four ships of the Baden-Württemberg-Class, which were ordered by the Navy in 2007, are to replace the old Fregatts of the Bremen-Class.
They are intended to include a powerful cannon, a number of flight defense missiles and marine target aircraft, as well as tar technology such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic reflection.
Another important feature is longer maintenance periods. It should be possible that the latest frigates do not have to return to their home ports for up to two years.
The continuing delays, however, may lead to the fact that the state-of-the-art warships which Germany is supposed to represent as maritime power will already be obsolete at the time of their commissioning, according to Die Zeit.
Fregatte F125, who was persecuted by the accident last year, got into the headlines when the German Navy officially refused to take off the ship and returned it to the Hamburg shipyard Blohm & Voss.
This was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to the shipyard after its extradition.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media called a number of important "software and hardware errors" that the new ship had made unusable in a conflict situation.
Software problems are particularly serious, as ships of the Baden-Württemberg class are operated by a crew of only 120 sailors, only about half as many as on the older frigates of the Bremen class.
It also became known that the ship is far too heavy, leading to performance losses and preventing the Navy from carrying out retrofitting measures in the future.
The 7000 tonnes "Rheinland-Pfalz" was apparently twice as heavy as ships with a similar class used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project, including the training costs of the crew, has also become a problem.
Apparently, the cost rose to a stunning 3.1 billion €, compared to the originally planned 2.2 billion €.
The problems with the latest frigates are particularly significant given the recent warnings that the maritime power is shrinking in Germany.
At the beginning of the year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the German Bundestag's military officer, confirmed that the Navy "is going out of operational vessels".
Bartels said that the problem grew over time, as old ships were taken out of service but no replacement ships had been provided.
He complained that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class could be removed from the Navy.
National Trust is listening to the secret life of bats
New research is being carried out in a Scottish Highland property, which will show how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
It is hoped that the results will allow for further insights into the behaviour of these unique flying mammals, helping to lead future nature conservation activities.
The study conducted by researchers at the National Trust for Scotland will detect dwarf and mosquito bats as well as the brown long-eared and water bats in Inverewe Garden in Western Ross.
Special recording devices are placed at key positions on the property to record the activities of bats throughout the season.
NHS employees and volunteers will also carry out mobile investigations with portable detectors.
In a noise analysis of all recordings by experts, the frequency of the bat calls is determined and determined which species does what.
A map and a report of the habitat will then be prepared to provide a detailed picture of their behaviour at landscape level.
Rob Dewar, nature conservation advisor for the NTS, hopes that the results will show the most important areas of the habitat for bats and how these are used by every species.
These data will help to determine the benefits of measures to manage the habitat, such as the creation of meadows, and to show how to obtain forest areas for bats and other related species.
The bat stocks in Scotland and the whole of the United Kingdom have declined significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects sleeping places and leads to the loss of the habitat.
Wind wheels and lighting can also present a risk, as can fly-catchers and chemical treatment of building materials or also attacks by domestic cats.
Bats aren't really blind.
However, their ears are more useful because of their nocturnal hunting habits than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echo to identify insects and obstacles in their trajectory.
The NTS responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout Scotland takes the theme of bats very seriously.
He has 10 trained experts who conduct regular investigations, bedside inspections and sometimes rescue measures.
The organization has even set up Scotland's first and only bat reserve in the Thrave world in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's 10 bat species.
Manager David Thompson explains that the property is the ideal habitat for her.
"Here in Thrave we have a great area for bats," he explains.
“We have the old buildings, many old trees and an excellent habitat.
But there are many things we do not yet know about bats, so here and at other goods we are doing these works that will help us to learn more about what bats need to feel comfortable."
He stressed the importance of excluding the presence of bats before maintenance in the goods, as it was possible that the involuntary destruction of a single nest spot could kill up to 400 females and young animals and eliminate the entire population on site.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill them, to harass them or to destroy them or their nest places.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish official of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the population to cooperate.
She explains: "We still have a lot to learn about bats, and with many of our species we do not know how it is about their populations."
Ronaldo argues rape accusations, while his lawyers want to sue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo referred to him as "fake news" and said that people want to "be famous" by using his name.
His lawyers plan to sue the news magazine The Mirror, which published the allegations.
The striker of the National Team of Portugal and Juventus Turin was accused of having raped an American named Kathryn Mayora in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He apparently paid her 375,000 dollars to buy her silence to the incident, says The Mirror on Friday.
In a Instagram live video to its 142 million followers, 33-year-old Ronaldo called the reports only hours after their release as "Fake News."
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they reported today: Fake News", said the five-time winner of the balloon d’Or in the camera.
“They want to profile themselves by using my name.
That's normal.
You want to become famous with my name, but that's part of the job.
I am a happy man and everything is good," the player added smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue the mirror on the grounds of the accusations they have made, according to Reuters, as "unauthorised reporting on suspicions in the area of privacy".
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player demanded a compensation for "moral damages at a level that corresponds to the severity of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personality rights in recent years."
The alleged incident is expected to take place in 2009 in a suite of Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After they met in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to the player's room, where he reportedly raped them in writings filed at Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo went on his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was "99 percent a good guy" who was "one percent".
In the documents it is claimed that Ronaldo confirmed that they had sex, but said it was agreed.
Mayorga also claimed that she had gone to the police and had taken pictures of her injuries in a hospital, but had later agreed to an extrajudicial agreement, since she had been "punished for retribution" and was concerned to be "demeaned publicly".
The 34-year-old said that she was now trying to abolish the agreement, as she was still traumatized due to the alleged incident.
At the time of the alleged incident Ronaldo was about to switch from Manchester United to Real Madrid, and this summer he changed his deal to the Italian Grand Juve in a 100 million Euro deal.
Brexit: The United Kingdom would ‘eternally regret’ the loss of car manufacturers
The United Kingdom would "everlasting" if it lost its status as a world's leading manufacturer of cars, said Minister of Economic Affairs Greg Clark.
He continued to say that it was "an alarming" that Toyota UK told BBC that it would interrupt production at the Burnaston plant at Derby on an interim basis, Great Britain should leave the EU.
"We need a deal," says Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer stated that the influence of delays at the border on a no-deal-brexit could lead to job loss.
The plant in Burnaston, where Toyota's product lines Auris and Avensis are produced last year produced almost 150,000 vehicles, of which 90% have been exported to the rest of the European Union.
"I am convinced that at the end of March we will experience production stops in our plant during an uncontrolled Brexit," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's Managing Director in Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also raised concerns about a tough EU exit without agreement and its influence on cross-border trade.
BMW, for example, says that it will close his mini-work in Oxford after the Brexit for a month.
The main concerns, according to car manufacturers, are related to risks within the supply chain at a hard Brexit.
Toyotas production plant is operated on a "just-in-time" basis, which means that the parts are delivered every 37 minutes by suppliers both from the United Kingdom and the EU to manufacture the cars on order.
Should the United Kingdom leave the EU on 29 March without an agreement, there could be interruptions at the borders which, according to the industry, could lead to delays and bottlenecks in the parts.
It was impossible for Toyota to keep a stock of warehouses in Derbyshire that lasted longer than one day, the company explained why production had to be interrupted.
Clark stated that Theresa May's Chequers Plan on the future relationship with the EU "is precisely designed to avoid such border controls".
“We need a deal. We want the best deal, which, as I said, enables us not only to enjoy the current success, but also to take this opportunity,” he said, in the broadcast Today of BBC Radio 4.
"The findings not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers show that we must be able to continue the very successful supply chains so far."
Toyota could not indicate how long production would have to be interrupted, but in the long term warned that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and eventually lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and who is the highest functioner of the Unite Union, explained that his members are increasingly concerned: “My experience doesn’t come back once they are gone.
One government speaker said: "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's planned meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed according to the White House's information
Donald Trump's important meeting with Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein could "be postponed for another week" while the dispute over the candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, continued, it was said on Sunday from the White House.
Rosenstein has been monitoring the work of the special mediator Robert Mueller, who examines the election interference by Russia, links between Trump's advisers and Russia, and a possible judicial obstacle by the president.
The question of whether Trump would fire the Deputy Justice Minister and thus endanger the independence of Mueller has been the subject of rumours in Washington for months.
At the beginning of the month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein addressed the possibility of secretly recording his conversations with Trump and the President's election with the help of the 25th Constitutional Supplement.
Rosenstein demented the report.
However, he went to the White House last Monday, while new reports about his supposed withdrawal became known.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, which was held at the UN General Assembly in New York at that time, was announced for the coming Thursday,
Trump explained that he would prefer not to release Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid colliding with the hearing before the U.S. Senate Justice Committee, in which both Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who had accused him of sexual abuse.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation of the accusations against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the full vote of the Senate.
Trump's press speaker Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
In response to a question about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “A date has not yet been set, but it could be this week, but I can also imagine that it will be postponed by another week, given all the things that are going on with the Supreme Court.
But I always like to keep the press up to date."
Some reporters would object to this claim: Sanders has not held the White House press conference since September 10.
Mover Chris Wallace asked her the reason.
Sanders stated that the low frequency of the press conferences did not give way to the TV reporter's "effect-hashing" but admitted: "I would not deny that they are doing effect-hashing."
She then claimed that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
The President makes more questions and answers than any President before him," she said, without giving precise evidence: "We have considered these figures."
There will still be press conferences, according to Sanders, but if the press has the opportunity to ask directly the President of the United States, it will be much better than to talk to me.
We try to do this often and you have seen that we have done so many times in the last few weeks. This will take the place of the press conference if you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump regularly accepts questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Press conferences with him alone are rare.
In New York, the president may have shown why this is so when he made a bizarre appearance in front of assembled reporters.
Minister of Health writes to EU employees of Scottish NHS because of the Brexit concern
The Minister of Health is addressing people from the EU who work in Scotland's National Health Service (NHS) to express the country's gratitude and to express their desire to remain in the country after the Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter from the EU less than six months before the withdrawal of the United Kingdom.
The Scottish Government has already agreed to bear the costs of applications for residence permits for EU citizens working in the decentralised public service in Scotland.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: “During the summer, the negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU were continued and decisions are expected this autumn.
However, the UK government has also strengthened the preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I'm aware of how troubling times this must be for you all.
That is why I wanted to express once again how much I appreciate the contribution of each and every employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues and colleagues from all over the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills to strengthen and improve the work of healthcare services, thus benefiting the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is full of your home and we would be very happy if you stayed here."
Christion Abercrombie was subjected to an emergency surgery after a head injury
According to Mike Organ of Tennessee State after a head injury, the Tennessee State Tigers Christion Abercrombie was subjected to an emergency operation on Saturday at the 31-27 defeat against the Vanderbilt Commodore.
Rod Reed, chief coach of Tennessee State, explained that the injury occurred shortly before the mid-term break.
"He came to the sideline and just collapsed there," says Reed.
Trainer and medical staff supplied abercrombie on the sideline with oxygen before it was placed on a carrying and transported for further investigations.
A spokesman from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie left the surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "no details are yet known about the nature or extent of the injury" and Tennessee State tries to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a so-called red shirt, plays with Tennessee State in his first season after changing from Illinois.
On Saturday, before leaving the game, he recorded a total of 5 Tackles, increasing his total in the season to 18 Tackles.
Foreign investors will have to pay higher stamp tax for real estate purchase in the United Kingdom
In future, investors from abroad will have to pay a higher stamp tax for the purchase of real estate in the United Kingdom.
This step should reduce the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign for young voters
The increase in the rate of stamp will affect all those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The Ministry of Finance expects additional revenue of up to 120 million pounds per year to help homeless people
Theresa May will announce today that foreign investors will have to pay a higher stamp fee if you buy real estate in the United Kingdom, with the additional revenue of homeless people.
This step represents an attempt to limit Jeremy Corbyn's success with young voters who promise to provide more affordable living space and take top-notch wages into the visor.
The increase in the stamp tax will be applied to individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and additional revenue will be granted to the government campaign against homelessness.
The addition to the current stamp tax and including the increase to second-hand dwellings and to rental residential properties introduced two years ago could amount to up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance calculates by the step with additional revenue of up to 120 million pounds per year.
An estimated 13 percent of newly built properties in London are purchased by investors who are not located in the United Kingdom, making prices higher and making it more difficult for first-time buyers to take a foothold in the real estate business.
Many wealthy areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become 'spirit cities' due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the United Kingdom.
The new strategy follows only a few weeks after Boris Johnson has voted for a reduction in the stamp tax to enable more young people to become the first home.
He accused construction companies of holding up real estate prices by buying up land without using it, and urged Theresa May to give up quotas on affordable dwellings in order to end Britain's "worship damage".
Opposition leader Corbyn announced a spectacular set of proposals for housing reforms ranging from a rental price commitment to a ban on premises without tripartite grounds.
He also wants to give city councils more powers in building new apartments.
May stated: “Last year I said that I would devote my time as Prime Minister to the restoration of the British dream, according to which the life of generation should become better.
And that means repairing our broken housing market.
Great Britain will always be open to people who live and work here and want to build up a life.
However, it can't be right for people who don't live in the UK as well as for companies based abroad to buy real estate as for hard-working British citizens.
The dream of the home has become too far away for too many people, and the indignity of homelessness remains a big problem."
Jack Ross: ‘My biggest goal is to manage Scotland’
Jack Ross, the head of Sunderland, says that it is his ‘largest goal’ to become the manager of the Scottish team at some point.
The 42-year-old shot enjoys the challenge of bringing new lives into the club from the North-East of England, which is currently in third place in the League One and is missing the top three points.
He moved to the stadium of Light this summer, after leading St. Mirren back to the first Scottish league in the last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I managed to get to the bank and that's what Ross told the broadcast Sportsound from BBC Scotland.
“But as a child with my father, I often saw Scotland playing in Hampden and that’s something that always pulls me back.
However, this option would only come if I were successful in the association management."
Ross's predecessors in the role as manager of Sunderland include Dock Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic indicated that he had no fear of entering the footsteps of such established names in such a club after he had previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
The success will be measured at the moment by whether I can bring the club back to the Premier League.
In view of the structure and possibilities in this association, he is without a doubt part of the Premier League," he said.
"It is not an easy task to get him there, but I would only count my time here as a success if I bring the club back there."
Ross can show a three-year management career, after a phase as deputy head at Dumbarton and a 15-month activity as a coach in Hearts.
Then he helped Alloa to recover from the relegation to the third league and helped St. Mirren to win the championship in the following season.
Ross says he feels better now than ever before in his player career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"That was probably a real wasteway," he remembers when he took over the responsibility of Alloa.
“I really think management was the right thing for me, more than playing.
It sounds funny because I didn't feel bad, could live well from it and experienced some very pleasant high-phases.
But playing can be hard.
There are a lot of things you have to go through every week.
I still do this through the stress and pressure in my job, but management feels right.
I've always wanted to manage and now I've done it. I've never felt so comfortable in my skin in my whole life as an adult."

The perfect time for a glass of beer is Saturday at 17:30, so a study
The heat wave in the summer has missed the revenue of UK shrieking pubs, while restaurant chains were under greater pressure.
Public and cash companies recorded sales growth of 2.7 percent in July. However, according to statistics, revenue from restaurants decreased by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of Corporate Advisory CGA, who compiled the figures, said: “Sunning sunshine and England’s longer than expected participation in the World Cup meant that July followed a similar pattern to the previous June, in which pub’s sales increased of 2.8 percent. However, restaurant made it even harder.
The decline of 1.8 percent recorded by the restaurant industry in June continued to increase in July.
Pubs and bars with a focus on beverages showed by far the best performance, with a surface-adjusted revenue development that rose higher than it was at the restaurants.
Pubs focused on food also left in the sun, but not as drastic as the restaurant operators.
It seems people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In the managed pubs and bars, the sales of beverages increased by 6.6 percent per month, while the sales of food decreased by three percent."
Paul Newman, of the analysts for the leisure and restaurant industry RSM, said: “These results continue the trend that we have been able to observe since the end of April.
The weather and the influence of important social or sporting events remain the biggest factors in the out-of-home market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to face problems, but sales losses of 4.8 percent compared to the previous year will be particularly painful in addition to the continued cost pressure.
The long, hot summer could not have come at a worse time for operators of companies with a focus on food and it remains to be seen whether the temperate temperatures in August will provide the urgently needed breathing break."
Total revenue growth for pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent in July and reflected the decline in brand rollouts.
The industry sales monitor Case Peach Tracker for pub, bar and restaurant in the UK collects and analyzes performance data from 47 active companies with a combined turnover of over 9 billion pounds and is the recognized industry benchmark.
One of five children owns secret accounts in social media that hide it from his parents
A study shows that every fifth child, some just 11 years old, has secret accounts on social media that keep it secret from parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 students in secondary schools has shown an increase in so-called 'fake insta' sites
The message fires fears that sexual content will be posted
Twenty per cent of students reported having a 'main account' to show it to their parents
One of five children, some just 11 years old, creates accounts on social media that can keep it secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 students in secondary schools showed a rapid increase in so-called "Fake Insta" accounts, a link to the Photo-Sharing website Instagram.
The news fires fears that sexual content will be shared.
Twenty per cent of students reported having a clean 'main account' that they can show their parents, but also own private accounts.
One mother, who was on the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter, found a teenager, and the other "was calling on me to rape."
The study carried out by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters’ and Headmissesses’ Conference (HMC) of independent schools found that 40 percent of 11 to 18-year-olds had two profiles, with half admitting to own private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, chairman of the HMC, said: "It is disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online rooms where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eilith Doyle becomes 'voice of athletes' in the Scottish Sports Council
At its annual General Meeting, Eilith Doyle was elected non-executive member in the Council of the Scottish athletics-Dachverband Scottish Athletics Association.
Doyle is Scotland's most excellent athlete and president Ian Beattie described the choice as a great opportunity for the sports functionaries to benefit from their far-reaching international experience over the last decade.
"Eilidh is respected in the Scottish, UK and world athletics community and we are sure that the athletics of the world in Scotland would benefit greatly from their choice in the Council," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I am looking forward to acting as a voice of athletes and hope that I can make a real contribution and lead the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the distance of 200 and 400 metres at the Olympic Games in Atlanta in 1996, called a total of four Olympic gold medals his own and today appears frequently as a BBC expert, could no longer run after a transient circulation disorder.
He wrote on Twitter: “I suffered a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk anymore.
The doctors say that no one can say whether or how far I'm going to recover.
It was hard work, but I recovered completely, I learned to walk again and do exercise today!
Thank you for the encouraging news!"
An advertising for milk pumps that compares mothers with cows ensures excitement in the net
A manufacturer of milk pumps provided excitement in the network with an advertising clip, in which breastfeeding mothers are compared to milking cows.
The manufacturer of consumer technology Elvie has published a music video which is not very seriously meant to emphasize the freedom that the pump gives to breast-feeding mothers to the market, according to its own specification "the world's first low-noise, low-noise milk pump".
Four real mothers dance in a hay-filled barn with cows in the background to a song that contains text lines like: "Yes, I milk, but you don't see a cock" or "if you didn't notice, these are not udders but my breasts."
In the chorus it continues: "Pump it out, pump it out, feed the babies, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my ladies."
However, the advertising that was published on the Facebook page of the company has triggered a controversy in the network.
With 77,000 accesses and hundreds of comments, the video encountered mixed reactions among the audiences, many of whom say that the "frights" of the dairy industry are impoverished.
“It was a very bad decision to apply this product with cows.
Just as we do, they must become pregnant and bear a calf to produce milk, with the difference that their boys are taken away within a few days of birth," said one comment.
Elvie's milk pump fits discreetly into a silent bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment said: “Immediately traumatic for mother and baby.
But hey, why don't we use them to apply for a milk pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Another person added: "Such a non-realistic advertising."
Others defended the advertising and a woman admitted that you found the song "urkomisch".
“I think that’s a brilliant idea.
I would have bought one if I were still breastfeeding.
When I was pumping off, I felt exactly like a cow.
The clip is a little crazy, but I'm not trying to overinterpret it.
This is a brilliant product," wrote one person.
Another person commented: "This is a funny advertising addressed to mothers who use milk pumps (often at work or on toilets) and feel like "cows".
This is no advertising for or against the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, the group of women reveals that everyone has danced with the discreet pumps in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the realization that many women who use milk pumps give themselves to feel like dairy cows.
Elvie's pump, however, is completely silent, has no wires or hoses and fits discreetly into a breast-bra, giving women the freedom to move, to keep their babies or even to go out during the pumping process.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother, said: "Elvie's pump is such a revolutionary product that it earned a bold and provocative market introduction.
By comparing breastfeeding mothers with dairy cows, we wanted to focus on milk pumps and all the related challenges while at the same time imagining the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump enables.
This is not the first time that Elvie's pump got into the headlines.
During the London Fashion Week, a twofold mother appeared for designer Marta Jakubowski on the Catwalk, while using the product.
Hundreds of migrants were silently brought to a tent town on the Texan border
The number of interned migrant children is as high as never before, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively similar, including because increased rhetoric and Trump government measures have made it more difficult to accommodate caregivers.
Traditionally, most of the caregivers themselves were illegal immigrants and are now afraid to become even the target for an expulsion when they report to a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential custodians and other adult members of their household would have to print their fingerprints and share this data with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Bonnence, a high official of the customs agency Immigration and Customs Enforcement, announced before the Congress that the authority arrested dozens of people who had applied for the care of unaccompanied minors.
The Authority later confirmed that 70 percent of the arrested had no previous entries in the criminal record.
“Fastly 80 percent of the persons who are either self-employed or a member of a staff member’s household hold themselves illegally in the country and a large proportion of these are criminal foreigners.
That's why we're going to continue following these people," explains Bonnence.
In order to be able to process the cases of children more quickly, officials introduced new rules, which according to the staff of the accommodations in some children, to appear in court within a month rather than 60 days after the detention, which was previously the standard.
Many will appear by video and not personally to enter a immigration judge for their legal status.
In the event of negative decision, the person is moved quickly.
The longer these children stay in custody, the more likely it is, according to the accommodation staff, as well as reports that have been known from the system in the last month, that they are frightened and depressed, which may lead to violent outbreaks or outbreaks.
Defenders say that these concerns are strengthened in a larger institution such as Tornillo, as signs that a child has problems due to size are more easily overlooked.
They also explained that it could strengthen traumata, which many of the children already suffer, if they were brought to a tent city without emotional preparation or sufficient time to say goodbye to friends.
Syria calls upon American, French and Turkish “occupiers” to withdraw immediately
In a speech before the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the civil war in the country is now in the eighth year.
Mr Moualem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, stated that the foreign forces are illegally on Syrian soil with the pretext of the fight against terrorism and are "decidedly treated".
"They have to withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he explained.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more people have been expelled from their homes.
He said that Damascus "will continue to fight this sacred battle until all Syrian territories are cleaned up" both by terrorist groups and "every illegal foreign presence".
The United States has stationed around 2000 soldiers in Syria, who mainly train and advise both Kurdish armed forces and Syrian Arabs who are opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1000 ground troops in the war-torn country.
With regard to refugees, Moualem stated that the conditions for their return were given, and he accused "some Western countries" of "promising irrational fears" that prevent refugees from going home.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to enable return," he said.
"They are politicizing a purely humanitarian matter."
The United States and the European Union warned that no building aid would be granted to Syria until there was no political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
Diplomats from the UN stated that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on a buffer zone in the last major rebel high castle Idlib was the opportunity to advance political talks.
The deal between Russia and Turkey turned a broad offensive of the Syrian forces supported by Russia to the province of which three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had 'clear deadlines' and expressed his hope that military measures against jihadists, including fighters from the Nusra Front, allied with Al-Qaeda, would be carried out.
UN representative Staffan de Mistura hopes to be able to convene the first meeting of a new committee soon, consisting of government and opposition members to design a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem called the conditions of the Syrian government for participation in the committee and stated that his work should be limited to the 'recast of the articles of the current Constitution' and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Win His Re-election
With this logic, Trump would win his re-election in 2020, should not, as many liberals probably hope, end an election or a scandal in advance.
This would undoubtedly be 'the most dramatic finale of a presidency of all time'.
So far, there's no evidence that the viewers were tired.
Since 2014, switching rates at the best transmission time at CNN have more than doubled to 1.05 million and almost tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News reaches an average of 2.4 million viewers at the best broadcast time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago. MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" led the switching rates with up to 3.5 million viewers in the evenings with important messages.
"This is like a fire that attracts people magically, because it's something that we don't understand," says Neal Bear, show runner of the drama series "Designed Survivor" broadcast on the TV station, about a Cabinet member, who becomes president after an attack destroys the capitol.
Nell Scovell, an ancient comedy writer and author of the book "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club" has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he'd choose Trump.
She asked him about the reason.
“He said, ‘because he makes me laugh’” Scovell told me.
The chaos has entertainment worth it.
Of course, Washington's stories, unlike everything that can be found on television, can determine the future of the principle decision on abortions Roe v. Wade, the possible combination of families and the health of the global economy.
Enabling this is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
And yet, it goes beyond being an informed citizen when one becomes aware of having been looking at six hours of a round of experts who use sources from the so-called "Deep Background" for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000 expensive bomber jacket made of rhinestone leather (in Washington Post a "garment rich in self overestimation") or discuss the effects of Stormy Daniel's giant description of Trump's, umm, anatomy.
For my part, Super Mario will never be able to see with the same eyes again.
"A part of what he does makes it feel like a reality show he introduces every evening," says Brent Montgomery, Chief Executive Officer of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the series "The Three of the Pendhaus", about Trump's rotating occupation and daily activities (a dispute with the football league NFL of the fence break, Kim Jong-un praise).
You can't afford to miss a episode, otherwise you won't come along.
When I reached Fleiss this week, it was sunny 27 degrees in front of his house on the north coast of the Hawaiian island of Kaai, but he hid inside and looked at MSNBC while he was recording CNN at the same time.
He simply couldn't get away from the screen, not if Judge candidate Brett Kavanaugh was just standing in front of the Senate Justice Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was at stake.
“I remember when we were doing all these crazy broadcasts at the time and people said, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization’,” Fleiss told me.
"I thought that was kind of a joke, but it turned out they were right."

Donation funds flooded the closest races for seats in the Congress during the intermediate elections
It is little surprising that the 17th election district of Pennsylvania is flooded by donations, thanks to the newly drawn borders of the constituencies, which led to two officials standing in the race around the same seat.
The newly signed suburban district in Pittsburgh has the Democratic Conor Lamb take up his seat in another district in the wake of a special election in the previous spring.
Lamb opposes another official, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is strongly overlapd with the new 17th district.
The maps were new drawn after the Supreme Court of the State of Pennsylvania decided in January that the old districts were cast against the Constitution and manipulated in favor of the Republicans.
The new 17th-century race triggered an exchange of views between the big financial weapons of the parties, Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a short victory in a highly respected special election in March around the 18th election district of the state.
This seat was held over a decade by a Republican and Trump won with 20 percentage points advantage there.
Political experts give the Democrats an easy lead.
The US examined the punishment of El Salvador for its support for China, but then returned
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing without encountering great resistance from Washington.
Trump completed a friendly meeting with President Panama Juan Carlos Valero in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until partner threw out the management team of Trump Organization.
Officials of the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs have decided to withdraw the heads of all U.S. representatives from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the basis of "the recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan any longer", says Heather Nauert, spokesperson of the Ministry in an opinion at the beginning of the month.
However, only in the case of El Salvador were thought about criminal measures that received an estimated 140 million dollars in American aid in 2017, including for drug controls, development and economic assistance.
The proposed sanctions, including cuts in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity, which was to follow a similar meeting in the previous year and was a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from moving towards the US.
In mid-September, however, high government officials made it clear that they wished the conference to take place and thus effectively ended the consideration of criminal measures for El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now scheduled as a speaker at the conference, which was opened in mid-October, in order to set a sign of the importance the government of the assembly gives.
The three American diplomatic representatives have quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new news or punishment from Washington.
A government spokesman from John Bolton rejected an opinion on the details of the debate which were described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed, under the condition of anonymity, to comment on the internal meetings.
Their opinions were confirmed by an external analyst close to the government, who also spoke under the condition of anonymity.
Learn From History
The next major surprise could be the report by the special mediator Robert Mueller on Trump's possible judicial obstacle, for which there is now sufficient evidence to be found in the public.
Mueller is said to also investigate whether Trump's campaign team with Russia has conspired with his attack on the American elections.
Should the Congress change a majority, Trump faced an organ that forces him to answer, right at the time when he passes by to return to the electorate; and possibly before a jury of oaths.
This is a lot of ‘talk’ and I do not want to say that Donald Trump’s case, or that of his European counterparts, is inevitable.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we have to make decisions that will influence how long the battle will take.
In 1938, German officers were ready to execute a coup against Hitler if the West had only resisted him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed, and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of barbarism that followed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points and the unstoppable march of democracy is either accelerated or delayed.
The Americans are facing several such turning points.
What do we do when Trump leaves the Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein, the man who decides about the future of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein in Devil's kitchen since this newspaper last year reported that he proposed to record the president secretly and speculated about what was inappropriate for the office.
Rosenstein demented the presentation of the New York Times.
“How will we answer if the newly ordered FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if it is confirmed despite credible accusations of sexual abuse and misexamination in office?
And above all, will we vote in the intermediate elections for a congress that will force Trump to account?
If we fail in these trials, we are facing a long winter.
But I don't think we're gonna fail because of what I've learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech-Slovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same regime that once occupied my embassies.
She survived, immigrated to America and sent me 60 years later to light Sabbath candles on the table with the crest.
How can I not be optimistic with this heritage?"

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers optimistically before the match against Vienna
The Rangers receive Rapid Vienna on Thursday in the knowledge that a victory against the Austrians after the impressive remis against Villareal in Spain at the beginning of the month will put it in a good position for the qualification of the group G of the Europe League.
Due to a knee injury, Graham Dorrans could not appear up to the 2-2 level against Villareal, but he believes that the rangers can use this result as a springboard for Greater.
"This was an important point for us, since Villareal is very good," says the 31-year-old.
We went to the game with the conviction that we could do something about it and we drove home with a point.
Perhaps we could have won in the end, but overall, a difference was probably a fair result.
They probably dominated in the first half, but we tried in the second half and then were the better team.
Thursday will be another great European evening.
Hopefully we get three points, but this is going to be a heavy game, as they achieved a good result in the last game. But I am sure we can go through with the audience and achieve a positive result.
Last year was definitely difficult, with everything that happened to my injuries and changes in the club itself, but now there is some kind of well-being factor.
The team is good and the boys are really good at it; the training is good.
Hopefully we can look forward now, leave the last season behind us and be successful."
Fear of age benefits leads to sleepless nights in women.
Although the survey participants knew exactly how to care for them, few talked about it with their family members.
About half of the participants in the Nationwide study reported talking to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent claimed to talk to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but don't take the necessary steps to keep the conversation going," says Holly Snyder, Vice President of the National Life Insurance Division.
You should start with this.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to care for you if you do not express your wishes in time.
Work with your consultant and family to discuss where and how you would like to be cared for, as these decisions can be an important factor in determining costs.
Bring your financial advisor on board: Your consultant may also help you find a way to finance these expenses.
Your long-term financial decisions may include traditional care insurance, hybrid capital-building life insurance to help cover these costs or self-insurance with your own assets - as long as they own the money.
Work out your legal documents: Return legal disputes in the last minute.
Establish a preventive authority so that you instruct a trusted person to monitor your medical care and ensure that health professionals meet your wishes, you should be unable to express them yourself.
Consider also a authority for your finances.
You select a trusted person who makes financial decisions for you and ensures that your bills are paid, you should not be able to do so.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your older parent has a medical emergency and is on the way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medication or allergies?
Write down these details in a written plan so that you are ready.
"Not only the financial questions play a role. Who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What is the medical treatment?"
Who cares about the dog?
Have you already completed this plan."

Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a strong earthquake and a tsunami that met the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to the authorities. The number of dead is likely to rise.
Because of the failed communication systems, auxiliary workers were unable to obtain information from the Donggala government district, an area north of Palu, which is located closer to the epicenter of the earthquake with the strength 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a district in the north-west of the island of Sulawesi.
In the district, an administrative unit below the province, in 2017 an estimated 299,200 people lived.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main sources of revenue of the Central Sulawesis economy, in particular the Donggala coastal region.
Nicke construction is also important in the province, but it focuses mainly on Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesis.
According to Indonesia's Civil Protection Authority, Palu and Donggala have been victims of earthquakes and tsunamis several times over the last 100 years.
In 1938, more than 200 people were killed by a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
West Donggala was hit in 1996 by a tsunami in which nine people died.
Indonesia is located on the seismic Pacific Firering, and is regularly visited by earthquakes.
Here are some of the greatest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A strong earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in the north of Sumatras triggered a tsunami on 26 December, which met 14 countries and cost 226,000 people in the coastal areas of the Indian Ocean, almost half of which in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes struck the west coast of Sumatras between the end of March and the beginning of April.
Hundreds of people died on the Nias islands off the coast of Sumatras.
2006: An earthquake with the strength of 6.8 shook the south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island and triggered a tsunami that hit the south coast and claimed nearly 700 deaths.
2009: An earthquake with the strength of 7.6 hit the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake with the strength 7.5 shook one of the Mentawai islands before Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of up to 10 meters, destroying dozens of villages and demanding about 300 human lives.
2016: A slight earthquake shook the district of Pidie Jaya in Aceh and caused destruction and panic when people were reminded of the destruction of the deadly earthquake and tsunami of the year 2004.
This time no tsunami was triggered, but over 100 people died by a crashing building.
2018: Heavy earthquakes hit the Indonesian island of Lombok, popular with tourists, and mainly demanded more than 500 deaths on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily stranded on the island.
Sarah Palin's son arrested for accusations of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former governor Alaska and former candidate for vice president's office, was arrested due to accusations of physical injury.
29-year-old Palin from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested due to the suspicion of domestic violence, the disability of the report of domestic violence and the resistance to state violence, according to a report published by Alaska Police on Saturday.
According to the police report, he picked up the phone for a friend to tell the police.
Palin, according to KTUU, is in custody in the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and a $500 deposit was charged.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where, when asked for his plea, he replied with "Not guilty, quite sure," says the network.
Palin is accused of having committed three class A illegality, which can be punished by up to a year in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.
He is also burdened with an illegality of class B, which can be punished with a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
It is not the first time that Palin has been charged with criminal charges.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently being negotiated before the Veteran’s Court of Alaska.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, disability of reporting a crime and of possession of weapons under stimulants in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of beating her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran organizations in 2016 after returning her son's behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder following his time in Iraq.
Tsunami after earthquakes in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died after an earthquake that shook the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The earthquake with a strength of 7.5 triggered a tsunami that destroyed thousands of houses.
Electricity and communication networks are interrupted and it is assumed that the number of dead will rise in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred just off the coast of Central Sulawesis, which is located northeast of Indonesia's capital Jakarta.
On the social networks, videos circulate from the time the wave hit the country.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami met the coast.
Bundesanwaltschaft demands rare death penalty for suspects in New York's terrorist attack
The federal prosecutorship in New York demands the death penalty for Saykullo Saipov, the defendant in the New York City terrorist attack, who cost eight lives. This is a rare punishment that has not been imposed in the state since 1953 for a federal crime.
The 30-year-old Saipov is accused of having used a rented pick-up of the building market chain Home Depot for a terrorist attack, during which he raced on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan in October, crossing pedestrians and cyclists.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors must prove that Saipov "targeted" the eight of them and caused serious "conscious" physical injuries, according to the statement of intent for the claim of the death penalty filed in the southern district of New York.
Both charges could be punished with death, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a Federal Anti-Fraud Court of Saipov filed a 22-point indictment involving eight charges of the murder against the background of organized crime normally used by state prosecutors in cases of organised crime, as well as an accusation of the violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack requires "found planning and purpose", says the prosecutors who described the way in which Saipov carried out the act as "abominable, cruel and corrupt".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saikov added to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlie, Hern Ferruchi, Hern Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco damage, pain and losses," said the statement.
Five victims were Argentine tourists.
For over a decade, the southern district of New York has no longer pursued a case with the aim of demanding the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was accused of murdering two drug suppliers and finally sentenced to a life sentence in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in New York in the event of a federal offence was in 1953 in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were convicted two years before the conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union.
Both Rosenbergs were executed with the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, witnessed in the days and months after the attack of lack of repentance, according to court documents.
He indicated before investigators that he felt good about what he did, the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to the fact after watching videos of ISIS on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also called for the flag of ISIS to be hanged in his hospital room.
He was not guilty of all 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal defenders representing Saipov, said that they were "of course disappointed" because of the decision of the prosecutor.
"We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty will only prolong the trauma suffered by all those involved instead of a debt confession in exchange for a life-long imprisonment without the possibility of dismissal," says Patton.
Saipov's defense team had asked the charge before not to demand the death penalty.
A Member of the Conservative Party calls for NIGEL FARAGE to transfer the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage swore to mobilise "the power of the people" today during a protest at the Tories Conference.
Ukip's former party leader stated that politicians must "feel the pressure" of the Eurosceptics, whereas a member of Theresa May's party suggested that Farage should lead the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backboneist Peter Bone told demonstrators in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would be "ready to be out" if Farage Brexit were Minister.
The challenge facing May in the reconciliation of its deeply disintegrated parties was reinforced by the fact that members of your party, who are in favour of staying in the EU, participated in a separate demonstration against the Brexit that took place in the city.
The Prime Minister has problems keeping track of her Chequers compromise plan, despite attacks by the Brexit supporters, Brexit opponents and the EU.
Allied that, despite the counter-reactions, it should continue to try to negotiate a deal with Brussels, thus forcing Euroscepticists and the opposition Labour Party to decide between their package and the Chaos.
At the “Leave Means Leave” demonstration in Solihull, Bone explained that “Chequers belong to the waste”.
He suggested that Farage should have been named a peer and transferred responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was responsible, we'd be outside already," he said.
Wellingborough's MP added: "I'm going to stand for Brexit, but Chequers belongs to the garbage."
He stressed his opposition to the EU: "We did not fight in World Wars to be subservient.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Bone rejected allegations that the public opinion had changed since the referendum in 2016: “The idea that the British people have changed their opinion and now want to remain in the EU is completely wrong.”
The Brexit proponent of Conservative Andrea Jenkyns was also at the demonstration and explained reporters: “I’m just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“The compromise is unpopular in the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular in our own party and with our activists who actually go through the streets and make sure that we are elected.
Please give up Chequers and start listening.”
In a keen message to May, she continued: “Premier ministers keep their jobs when you keep their promises.”
In a speech, Farage said that politicians must ‘feel the pressure’, they should be in the process of cheating the decision of the 2016 referendum.
“This is now a question of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” says Farage.
“They are trying to cheat on Brexit and that is why we are here today to tell them: ‘This is not what you are doing’.
In front of an enthusiastic crowd, he continued: “I want you to let our political class, which is just about to betray the Brexit, feel the pressure.
“We mobilise the power of the people of this country, which helped us to win in the referendum and will never come to rest as long as we are not an independent self-regulatory, proud United Kingdom.”
At the same time, Brexit opponents marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city center.
A few activists swirled banners of Tories Against Brexit, a group of Brexit opponents within May's party that was launched on the weekend.
Lord Adonis, peer of the Labour Party, made fun of the Tories who had security problems with a party app at the opening of the conference.
“These are the people who tell us that they can ensure that the IT systems, as well as all the technology for Canada Plus, for the smooth border, are available for free trade without borders in Ireland,” said Adonis.
“This is a farce.
There is simply no good Brexit,” he added.
Warren plans to “exactly examine” presidential candidate
Elizabeth Warren, U.S. senator, said that after the November elections, she would be "examining the presidential candidate in detail".
The Boston Globe reports that the Democrat from Massachusetts spoke about her future at a meeting with voters in Western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, an outright critic of President Donald Trump, is currently in the race for the Senate against the Republican MPs in Massachusetts's Geoff Diehl Parliament, who in 2016 was Vice-Chairman of Trump's campaign team in Massachusetts.
She was the focus of speculation that she could challenge Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke has been her 36th meeting with voters in the so-called Town Hall format since Trump's accession.
One of the persons present asked her if you would like to apply for the presidency.
Warren replied that it would be time for women to "go to Washington and repair our broken government and that includes women at the top."
Arrest after death shots on LSU player Sims
Baton Rouge's police, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that a suspect was arrested in case of fatal shots on LSU basketball player Wayde Sims from Friday.
At a press conference, the Baton Rouge Police Department announced that it had arrested 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at 11 a.m. Eastern Time.
They had released a video of shooting on Friday and asked for help in identifying the man to be seen on the recordings.
Twenty-year-old Sims was shot on Friday morning near the campus of Southern University.
"Wayde Sims suffered a shooting injury on his head and died as a result of this injury," according to the sports media portal 247sports of police chief Murphy J. Paul explained the media on Saturday.
Wayde wanted to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to have been at the crime scene and possession of a weapon and shot on Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without further incidents and detained in the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
The two-metre Sims grew up in Baton Rouge and played in 32 games with 10 starting positions in the last season and was able to have an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Grand prize from Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches the World Championship title after his team has left him the victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the time Valtteri Botta landed in qualifying before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was clear that Stallorder from Mercedes would play a big role in the race.
From the pole position, Bottas managed a good start and it was almost as if he were doing Hamilton when he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his teammates.
Vettel first went into the box and let Hamilton enter the traffic at the end of the driver field, a decision that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes later went into the box and landed behind Vettel, but on a short wheel-on-wheel maneuver, the Ferrari pilot reluctantly released the inside side, with the risk of having to endure two movements in order to defend the third curve.
Max Verstappen began on one of the back squares of the field and was on his 21st birthday after the end of the first round in seventh place.
He was then the fastest for much of the race, as he stopped his tires to quickly finish and overtook Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He finally entered the box in the 44th round and did not manage to take a step in the remaining eight rounds, while Raikkonen finished fourth.
It was a difficult day, because Valtteri had a great performance all weekend and acted like a real gentleman when he was supposed to let me pass.
The team has done excellent work to achieve a double victory," said Hamilton.
A case of really bad body language
President Donald Trump made fun of a election event on Saturday on Senator Dianne Feinstein, who insisted not to pass on to the press the letter of Christine Blasey Ford, in which he proposed sexual abuse to the candidate for the Supreme Court Board.
At the event in West Virginia, President Ford’s statement to the Senate Justice Committee did not directly address it, but commented that the events in the Senate show that people are “general, evil and dishonest”.
"One thing that could happen and the wonderful thing that has happened in the Senate in the last few days is when you see the anger when you see people who are angry and mean and evil and dishonest," the President said.
“Look at the Leaks and then say, “Oh, I wasn’t.
It wasn't me."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, were you responsible for the leak?
Think of your answer... Published the document - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't publish it."
Okay, just a second, please.
No, we didn't publish it," he added by imitating the senator's voice.
Feinstein was played with Ford’s accusations against Kavanaugh in July and he was published in early September. However, Feinstein argues that the leak came from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't publish your story," said Feinstein to the Committee, according to The Hill.
"She asked me to keep the letter secret and I answered her request for secrecy."
Her dementi seemed not to arrive well at the president who said at the election event on Saturday night: “I tell you, that was a very bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
In his continuous defense of the judge candidate accused of sexual assault by three women, the Democrats claimed that they would use the accusations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain power with all means.
One sees the community, the evil, they don't care about who they hurt when they let down the wheels to gain power and control," said the President, according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars made the defeat on Friday in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants by a 5rd victory in the Replay in Dundee on Saturday again.
The Giants went on tour early with two goals, after hits by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the compensation for the home team before Dwyer made the lead of the Giants again.
Francois Bouchard looked like Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen won with two goals.
This was unexpected for the men of Adam Keefe who beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday evening, the third defeat in the Elite League in the season.
This was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, with the Giant winning the three previous games.
Dwyer’s opening door took place in the fourth minute after 3:35 minutes after a presentation by Kendall McFaull. Four minutes later David Rutherford delivered the template when Beauvilier expanded the lead.
In this exciting opening phase, Sullivan brought the home team back to play after 13:10 minutes before Matt Marquardt Cownie helped to compensate for it after 15:16 minutes.
Dwyer secured the Giants' leadership before the mid-term break when he reached his second goal of the evening shortly before the end of the first half.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard looked like it again with a power play hit in the 28th minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the game late in the second half of the season. Nielsen then secured his team victory with a fifth goal after nearly half of the second half-time.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, will play at the Milton Keynes Stadium next Friday.
Flight plots died after he was sure that hundreds of people in an airplane escaped the earthquake
A air traffic controller in Indonesia is celebrated as a hero after he found death in order to safely launch an aircraft with hundreds of people on board.
More than 800 people died and many are missing after the island of Sulawesi was shaken on Friday by a devastating earthquake that triggered a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks are still to be felt in the region and many people are caught under debris in the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues have fled to save your life, 21-year-old Anthonius Guchtan Agung refused to leave his post in the highly varying control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He remained to be sure that the flight 6321 of Batik Air, which was on the runway at the time, could safely take off.
He jumped out of the tower when he thought he was breaking in.
Agung died later in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, spokesman of the Indonesian Air Safety Service, explained that this decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australia's ABC News.
“We have provided a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to bring him a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
We are deeply concerned about this message," he added.
At the same time, the authorities fear that the number of dead could rise to several thousand.The country's civil protection authority stated that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The number is expected to increase as many bodies are still among the debris, while others cannot be reached", says the spokesman of the Sutopo Purwo Nugroho Authority.
Wells up to 6 meters in height have devastated Palu, which will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring relief and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute a new ambulance comes with the dead.
Clean drinking water is scarce.
Supermarkets are looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said: “The Indonesian Red Cross is hurrying to help survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
This is a tragedy now, but it could get much worse."
Indonesia’s President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and said in a speech before the country’s military: “I ask you to work every day and night to carry out all the tasks associated with the evacuation.
Since you've been ready?" said CNN.
Indonesia was already shaken by earthquakes in Lombok, where over 550 people died.
Aviation crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now reports a mistake after plane crash in lagoon
The airline, which carried out the flight that fell into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, now reports a missing one, after initially claiming that all 47 passengers and crews had been safely evacuated from the decreasing aircraft.
Air Niugini stated in a statement that until Saturday afternoon they can say nothing about the stay of a passenger.
The airline indicated working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately answer requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped to rescue the other passengers and crew members after the plane had crashed into the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials reported that seven people had to be taken to a hospital.
The airline stated that six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday, but were in stable condition.
The cause and exact course of the accident remained unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both declared that the plane landed in the lagoon shortly before the runway.
Some Witnesses thought the plane was flying out of the runway.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was flying very flat.
"This is a very good thing," says Jaynes.
Jaynes explained that he and others were able to wash through deep water to the emergency exits on the sides of the sinking aircraft.
He said the flight attendants panicked and screamed, and he suffered a smaller head injury.
The U.S. Navy stated that sailors who were working nearby to improve a mooring site were hurrying with an inflatable boat to help people get to the coast before the plane sank to about 30 meters (100 feet).
The data from the Aviation Safety Network can be found that 111 people were killed in crashes of airlines registered in Papua New Guinea, but none of them concerned Air Niugini.
Analyst reconstructs the end of the night when a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the charge closed her demonstration in the renegotiation of a case in which a man is accused of banishing a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
The analyst of the U.S. Department of Justice Paul Rowlett spent hours as an expert in the field of information evaluation.
He explained to the jury how he reconstructed the movements of the 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on their death night on the basis of cell phone calls.
Rowlett said to have received position data from different mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers on the evening of her death. This contradicts his previous statements, according to Clarion Ledger newspaper.
When the data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers when he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police spoke to Sanford.
Sanford went to the stand on Saturday and said that he had not been to the city on the day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis had said the truth when he said he was going to be in Sanford's pick-up that night, Sandford said he had lied, "because my pick-up was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was that Tellis indicated that he had known Chambers for two weeks at the time of her death.
Mobile phone records pointed out that they knew each other for a week.
Rowlett explained that Tellis was able to get out of his cell phone some time after Chamber's death.
"He removed them from his life," said Hale.
Defense is expected to start their pleas on Sunday.
The judge assumes that the trial will be followed by the jury on that day.

Another black one?!
New York girl sued couple for a release to "racist" SMS
A New York girl sued a couple for a discriminatory release after receiving a misguided message from the mother who complained that she was still a black man.
The couple fought to be racist and compared the dispute with an "expression".
The two-time mother Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman expressed her predicament when she found out that the new mother of the day, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived her first working day in 2016.
"NEEEEEEEEEINE, NOT A SCHWARZE", Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
Instead of sending them to her husband, she sent the message to Maurice.
After she recognized her fauxpas, the "mercifully touched" Plasco-Flaxman Maurice released and claimed that the imprisoned Afro-American daymother had done bad work and expected her instead a Philippine, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for her work day and then sent home with an over.
Now Maurice sues the couple for compensation for the redundancie and claims a claim of compensation for the $350 a day, which she would have been booked for over six months, for which she had been originally, but without a contract, and for whom she would have lived with the couple.
"I want to show them, look, you don't do that," she told the newspaper on Friday, "I know that discrimination is."
The couple rejected the racism accusations, and argued that the release of the reasonable step was because they feared Maurice, after insulting them, could no longer be trusted.
"My wife sent her something that she didn't want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists," said husband Joel Plasco of the Post.
"But would you trust your children to a person who was rude to them, even if it was by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
Plasco compared the dispute to an "expression" and explained that his wife was expecting a baby in just two months and was "in a difficult situation".
“You want to interest such a person?
This is not very nice," added the investment banker.
While the dispute continues, the couple were quickly sentenced to social media, where they were criticised for their behaviour and logic.
Padington publishers feared that readers would not identify with a talking bear, revealed a new letter
Karen Jankel, daughter of author Michael Bond, who was born shortly after the book was adopted, said about the letter: “It is difficult to translate into someone who reads it for the first time before it was published.
Today it is very funny with our today's knowledge of Paddington's huge success."
She said that her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired by a small toy bear to write the children's book, had no problem with it, his work would have been rejected and added that the 60th anniversary of the release after his death was "bitter fruit".
She explained that her father was secretly proud of the success of Paddington, whom she described as "very important family member".
"He was a very quiet man and did not boast," says Jankel.
“But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost as if you had a child who made something special: you’re proud, even if it wasn’t really your own performance.
I think he's seen Paddington's success like this.
Although he invented and created him, he always gave Paddington himself responsible for his success."
My daughter died and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where the doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"Nad regularly called to say it looks really bad and the doctors gave her little chance," said Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I received the call from Nad, in which he told me that she would die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And that's what I did.
I told her, "Tashi, I love you so much, my dear."
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications that the doctors gave her to keep her heart on the pump slowly sounded off and left her body.
She had died shortly before and this was the moment when everything went down.
I couldn't do anything but wait while I knew what was going on.
I could not scream or howl, as I was in a situation surrounded by families and other people.
I really had to get together."
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, who now mourned for the loss of her daughter, went along with the other passengers who did not get any of what she was going through on board the plane.
"No one knew," she said.
I had lowered my head and tears ran over my cheeks all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight when I felt this overwhelming feeling of sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and my understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Griefing women hang up cards to prevent suicide on bridges
Two women who have lost their family through a suicide try to stop others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelley Humphreys hung on a bridge in Wales maps with inspiring messages and telephone numbers for consulting agencies.
Davis son Tyler was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and was just 18 when he started suicide.
"I don't want parents to feel the way I feel every day," she said.
The 45-year-old Davis, who lives in Lydney, explained that her son had a promising career as a cook and had an infectious smile.
“Everyone knew him for his smile.
Everyone said that his smile could brighten a room."
However, he announced his job before his death, as he was "in a really dark place".
In 2014, Tyler's body was found after the suicide of his then 11-year-old brother.
Davis said, "I'm always afraid this could have an effect."
Davis designed the cards, “to show people that there are people you can go to and talk to, even if it is a friend.
Don't stay quiet: you have to talk about it."
Humphreys, who has been friends with Davies for years, lost her partner Mark, with whom she had been together for 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say he felt depressed or depressed," she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
On Christmas he was at the lowest point. When the children took out their gifts, he didn't see them in his eyes or anything."
She said his death was a big trauma for her, but that it had to go through: “It tears a huge hole into the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we all have to move on and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future in the float while the FBI starts investigations
"I thought that if we could actually get something like that he asked for, that is to say, a time-limited investigation, then perhaps we could get a little effort," said Flake on Saturday.
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want to investigate the FBI?
Your indifference can be traced back to timing alone.
The intermediate elections on November 6 are only five weeks away. If Republicans were to cut off badly as expected, they would be significantly weakened in their attempts to choose their husband in the highest court of the country.
George W. Bush grabbed the phonephone receiver to call Senators and convince them to support Kavanaugh, who had worked for Bush in the White House and met his wife Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI submits its report?
There is a vote in the Senate, in which currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats sit.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can unite at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the Vice-President, to decide on an equal footing and to confirm him to the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean transverses “sinkt” under Kim
The number of North Korean crossings to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un seven years ago, such as a South Korean politician.
Park Byeong-seug, who calls for data from the South Korean Ministry of Reunification, stated that 1127 overflowers were registered last year compared to 2706 in 2011.
Park called more stringent border controls between North Korea and China as well as higher prices of people smugglers as main factors.
Pjöngjang did not express himself publicly.
The vast majority of the crossings from the North are finally offered the South Korean citizenship.
Seoul states that since the end of the Korea war in 1953, over 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border.
Most flee across China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Korean states.
China regards the transitioners as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often leads them back with violence.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still technically in the state of war, have improved significantly in recent months.
At the beginning of the month, the two heads of state met in Pjöngjang to discuss the denuclearisation negotiations that were suspended.
This was the result of the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in June in Singapore, where they agreed to work towards a de-uklearized Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the American sanctions for the lack of progress.
"Without being able to trust the US, we have no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances it is impossible for us to disarm ourselves at first," said Mir Ri in a speech before the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh 'hysterical' and says that he is not appropriate for the Office at the Supreme Court
The minority leader in the Nancy Pelosi House called Judge candidate Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said that he was characteristic of the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t deny the impression that a woman who had acted like this would have been called ‘hysterical’,” said Pelosi about her reaction to Kavanaugh’s statement to the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh, emotionally demented all accusations that he had abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford sexually when both teenagers were.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional. Sometimes he almost cried out and was about to break out in tears when he spoke about his family and his high school time.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the Committee and called the allegations against him a "great and coordinated murder" organized by liberals, which were angry with Hillary Clinton's lost presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said that she believed that Kavanaugh’s statement proved that he could not serve at the Supreme Court as she showed that he was prejudiced to democrats.
"I believe he has declared himself inappropriate with these statements and the way in which he was referring to the Clintons and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked if she would try to abolish Kavanaugh from the office, he should be confirmed and the Democrats should win the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I will say so much: if he doesn't tell Congress or the FBI the truth, he's not only inappropriate for the Supreme Court, but also for his current judge post," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington, D.C.
Pelosi continued to say that as a democrat, she was concerned about the possible decisions made by Kavanaugh against the Affordable Care Act or the abortion principle decision Roe v. Wade because he was considered conservative judge.
In his hearings Kavanaugh asked whether he would revise certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"We don't need a hysterical, biased person who goes to this court and expects us to say, "Ah, that's not wonderful," says Pelosi.
Women have to use it as a weapon.
It's a sincere hate speech, months and years of overcooking anger and she doesn't get it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's rare, and you?"
She continued: “I was helped a lot by a woman who was a manager somewhere and said that she was also crying when she got angry but developed a technique. If she gets angry and starts crying, she says to the person to whom she said, “They may think that she’s sad because I cry.
I'm angry."
And then she just goes on speaking.
I found the genius."
Tears are allowed as a valve for anger, partly because they are completely misunderstandingd.
One of my clearest memories is of a former job, in a man-dominated office, where one day I cried because of an indescribable rage and was packed by an older woman, an undercooled manager, before whom I was always a little afraid, and pulled into a stairwell.
"Never let her see that you cry," she told me.
"They don't know you're mad.
They believe that you are sad and will be satisfied because they believe you have gone to the substance."
Patricia Schroeder, then a congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidates.
In 1987, when hard on board a ship named Monkey Business was caught in an extramarital affair and then withdrawn his candidate, the deeply frustrated Schroeder considered that there was no reason not to consider for himself the idea of the presidential candidate.
"This was not a well thought-out decision," she told me 30 years later with a laugh.
There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called the situation: “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs”.
Since the election was already advanced, she was lying behind the middle and she vowed not to run if she didn't get two million dollars together.
It was an insidious fight.
She found out that some of her supporters, the men donating $1,000, only supported her campaign with $250.
"Do they think I'm going to get a discount?" she asked.
When she spoke about not starting an official campaign, she was so grateful for her emotions, gratitude for her supporters, frustration about the system that made the medium and direct address of the voters so difficult instead of the delegates, as well as the anger over sexism that she was so close to tears.
"One could have assumed that I suffered a nervous breakdown," Schroeder recalls the press reactions.
“You could have believed that the handkerchief manufacturer Kleenex had been my sponsor.
I remember asking myself what they would write on my tombstone.
"She cried?"
Why Beijing could benefit from the trade war between the US and China
The opening salts of the trade war between the US and China were ear-depriving. Although the battle is far from over, Beijing could benefit from a long-term grave between the countries, my experts.
Donald Trump, the American President, fired the first warning at the beginning of the year, when he imposed fines on important Chinese export goods, including solar cells, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation took place this week with new tariffs on goods worth $200 billion, effectively affecting half of all imports from China into the US.
Beijing each time returned in the same way and recently raised fines of five to ten percent on American goods worth 60 billion dollars.
China has sworn to answer any action taken by the US and it is unlikely that the world's second largest economic power will soon stumble.
To move Washington to incline would mean to give up. However, a public sting towards the US would be far too tasty for China's president Xi Jinping.
Nevertheless, experts believe that if Beijing is playing its cards well, China can benefit from the effects of the trade war in the long term by reducing the mutual dependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a rapid political decision could create the conditions for economic turbulence in both countries in Washington or Beijing is actually far more dangerous than many observers have previously recognized," says Abigail Grace, a research assistant who focuses on Asia at the Denkfabrik Center for New American Security.
Syria is 'ready' to return, says the Foreign Minister.
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help to rebuild the country that has been devastated by the war that lasts over seven years.
In a speech before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem stated that the situation in the country improved.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safer thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government rebuilds the areas destroyed by terrorists to allow normality to return.
All the conditions were now given for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their everyday life and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that over 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Other six million people still living in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian government welcomed aid in rebuilding the deserted country.
However, he stressed that it would not accept any support from countries that had supported the uprising.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europa won the Ryder Cup 2018 and defeated team USA with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 in Le Golf National near Paris.
The USA has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the crown back after the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 points needed to defeat the USA.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who had problems over a large part of the tournament, lowered his impact on 16th train (Par 3) in the water and lost to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari could shine in all his rounds and became one of 4 players who scored a 5-0 since the tournament started in his current format in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was beaten 5:4 by the player with the lowest ranking in the team Europe, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The player with the world's best ranking, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 to 1 against the Englishman Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
The Spaniard Sergio Garcia, Veteran from eight Ryder Cups, became the best European Ryder Cup player of all time with 25.5 career points.
“ I don’t usually cry, but today I couldn’t hold back.
It was a difficult year.
I am so grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I am so unendingly happy to win back the cup.
It's about the team and I'm glad to have made a contribution," said the emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He passed the torch to his countryman John Rahm, who won against the American golf legend Tiger Woods on Sunday 2:1 in the individual encounters.
I am so incredibly proud to have beaten Tiger Woods, whom I have persecuted on television since my childhood," says the 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all his four games in France and now has a Ryder Cup balance of 13-21-3.
A strange statistics for one of the biggest players of all time, who won 14 important titles and is only exceeded by Jack Nicklaus.
The team USA had problems finding the fairways all weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who have completed top performance throughout the tournament.
American captain Jim Furyk said after a disappointing performance of his team: “I’m proud of the boys, they fought.
There was a time this morning when we put Europe under pressure.
We didn't do anything about it.
Hat off for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players had a good performance.
We will regroup, I will talk to the PGA America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we will look forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to pull the hat.
We were defeated."
