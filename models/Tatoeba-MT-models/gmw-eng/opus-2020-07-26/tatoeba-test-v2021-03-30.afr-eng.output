On Saturday, Father is open.
What he said made us angry.
He not only speaks French, he speaks Spanish as well.
I don't think anything has come to mind what you did.
That's a nice couple of legs.
One, three, and five are uneven numbers.

Does Tom know about Mary?
I'll be here when you come back.
When does Tom eat breakfast?
You have wine.
I forgot him cleanly.
The horse is in the woods.
More coffee, please.
Who is that woman?
I'll accept your offer.
Do you understand what he says?
My wife is a vegetarian.
Where does Tom eat breakfast?
We carried out that plan.
You must have attended the meeting.
Can you read my letter and correct the mistakes if there is.
My conscience bothers me.
Many houses were washed away with the flood.
Why should I care about them?
Does your friend like tea?
I had to rent a car.
What should I do about her?
If a sick person folds a thousand cranes of paper, her wish will come true.

If the idiots were to compete, you'd come second because you're too dull to come first.
I wouldn’t be surprised if Tom hadn’t come.
I don’t want to remember.
Quickly!
They are in the library.
Tom better didn’t do that.
She's very beautiful.
I don't want to meet her.
I don't know where we'll end up.
Tom got up early.
It's life.
I couldn't stop Tom.
He did not feel sorry for me.
What are your favorite winter sports?
The girl in the blue coat is my daughter.
Our teacher started singing a song well.
We're not going to eat everything.

From now on, be more careful.
Please go faster.
Where's the PowerPoint presentation you promised me?
I don't want to lie.

Do not believe everything that people tell you.
I don't speak good enough French!
I'm not going to come and visit for a while.
I don't want to be late.
There was a cat on the table.
It was a moist, growy summer day at the end of June.
Why would I lie?
Go inside.
I'm going back to my office.
I don't speak Japanese.
I'm out of work too.

Do not waste your money by buying things you do not need.
Congratulations!
Tom told me to do that.
She had a house by the sea.
Have you ever been to Paris?
It's the last straw.
We know each other quite well.
Thank you so much!
She looked beautiful.
All of us go.
Open your mouth!
It depends on the weather.
He not only speaks French, he speaks Spanish as well.
I went back to my seat.
Close the door behind you if you leave the room.
There's always something to do.
I'm going to be on the next bus.
Money cannot buy happiness.
Who said that?
Your name is on the list first.
Is that necessary?
Can you wait that long?
Were you busy yesterday?

My sister is beautiful.
With the sun falling, they left their job.
Who knows where Tom was born?
She runs.
The factory produces toys.
Did she hurt that kitten?
He was a good king.

I'll have to come back to you.
Tom will stay for three days.
I wouldn’t be surprised.
It rains.
In the past, the boys had been taught to defend themselves while they were very young.
Tom would never have done so.
There's a bird here.
Wait, don't shoot!
I wouldn't blame Tom.
That was his decision.
I didn't really want to win.
I am no longer afraid.
I was hoping we could become friends.
Tom trembles.
Grandfather made his own furniture.
He does not like to travel by plane.
We really have nothing to lose.

His music is well - known.
It's all yours.
He belongs to the Catholic faith.
I don't want to go home.
I don't want to see you.
Tom was disturbed by the direction of his thoughts.
I'm not going to change my choice no matter what you say.
That is quite normal.
I love your son.
Tom is not going to appear at all.
I must have imagined myself.
Let's practice.
It was difficult for him to hide his pride , which he felt as he was successful .
I want to know who broke this window.
Tom said that he did not kiss Mary.
The clock is ringing.
I'm not going to get out of this cell.
I have no time for you.
They said that they had always done so.

I'm a friend of Robert's.
I want to be her friend.
Do not move.
I heard about him.
Peter loves Jane.
I remember hearing about her.

That's what you're getting!
Is Tom going to die?
A dog ran after the cat.
I also kissed Tom.
Why not join us for dinner tonight?
It's a horse.

You're not a dog.
What would you have done if you were in my place?

I think I might be out of a job.
I told Tom I'd be-now.
My son still believes in Santa Claus.
I hate to drive.
Sami must wait a bit.
Are they friends?
Tom knows everything about them.
It is dangerous to enter that area on your own.
Sami did not notice that.
Do you wear gloves?
Can I shake your hand?
You don't know my father, do you?
I'm now back with refreshments.
That's why I'm here.
He is my neighbor.
Tom thought it was unfair.
The hotel looks out on the lake.
Tom’s hands were cold.
She is able to read.
It seems that he knows the secret.
Do you have a cell phone?
Mr. Mitchel admitted that I paid over the rest of the money before the end of the week.

You're not a doctor.
I know how you felt about us.

I wouldn't be so sure.
I dream about her constantly.
Tom did not wear socks.
Tom will say no.
I'm a fireman.
There are islands in the sea.
Where is it now?
We are not so hungry yet.

We should start doing this.
Living in Japan is expensive.
I know how you feel about her.
I drank two cups of coffee.
I forgot about her cleanly.
Tom thought it was unfair.

We are his sons.
Birds are beautiful.
The fight lasted a week.
When did you last laugh?
Tom's not going to give a talk today.
Why did you join the army?
I wouldn't blame you.
Flowers and trees need clean air and fresh water.
You're too late.
What we know about health has taught us through the study of diseases.
Tom sat at window reading a book.
We're not going to be here at 2:30.
I like eating meat.
I thought we could make it by 2:30.
He was jealous of my success.
Does Tom know how to dance?
Did you call him?
He kicks me!
She reads the newspaper every morning.
The bakery is slowly the slaughterhouse.
Please forgive me.
"Thank you." "You're welcome."

I eat rice.
May I open a window?
This wall is higher than that one.
It rains.
Tom will be late.
I venture you to bridge that river.
I bought only a new pair of shoes.
We want it back.
The contest begins tomorrow.
They can conquer their fear.
This cannot be a genuine diamond.
Tom moved away.
Was Tom there?
Father recently returned to Japan.
This is my friend.
I know how you feel about him.
Please share my umbrella.
Tom will win you.
Can you open this door?
Her story brings back memories of my parents.
Tom is no longer getting help through Mary.
I am saving so that I can go to Australia.
I know everything about her.
I'm falling in love with you.
Tom and Mary are very busy.
No matter what he says, do not trust him.
You should have visited Kyoto.
I got up when it was still dark.
Find out everything you can about her.
I came to talk to you.
I wonder what happened to Paul.
If God did not exist, we would have to have considered him.
Can you help me with this?
We met in 2008. A year later, we got married.
She's not here.
He asked Mother.
In autumn, when the weather was rough, windy and wet, and the cold could penetrate the thickest garment, especially at sea, a poor boat with only two men sailed into the sea.
At night all cats are grou.
Quiet!
This is my house now.
A bird flies.
He arrived 30 minutes late.
He extends to an English-Japanese dictionary on the desk.
Whatever a man sows, that he will also reap.
I wish you had said that before.
I love my mother.
Tom will not object.
I'm much bigger than you are.
Tom looked closer.
I'm your father.
You will pay for it.
I've got a place to keep looking.
Tom's got a lot on his plate.
Do you prefer red or white wine?
This is the next!
I want to see your boss.
He was very tired.
How do you feel about them now?
We forgot her cleanly.
Japan is full of beautiful cities, such as Kyoto and Nara.
I'll make it back for dinner.
I never thought it would be so easy.
Whose books are these?
Welcome to Australia.
He found his parents.
You can eat what you want.
That's really good!
The river flowing through Parrys is called the Seine.
I'm glad you finally came back.
