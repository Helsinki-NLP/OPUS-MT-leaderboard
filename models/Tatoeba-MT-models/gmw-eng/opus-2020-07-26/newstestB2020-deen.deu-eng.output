Fire in French chemical work deleted
The big fire in a chemical plant in the northern French city of Rouen is now removed. This was reported by the prefecture of Normandy on Friday. The fire was broken out at night on Thursday. No one was injured in the incident. The fire brigade was in use with about 200 extinguishing vehicles.
It was possible to stop the fire
Anrainers were called upon not to leave their homes. Buildings around 500 meters were evacuated, schools and kindergartens were closed on Thursday. In the chemical plant on the banks of the Seine, additives for lubricants are produced. The factory belongs to the company Lubrazole of US-billionary Warren Buffett and is subject to the so-called Seveso Directive, which prescribes particularly strict safety requirements.
About 400 people are working in the factory. The chemical factory has already provided headlines in the past - for example, when a leak of gas detonated methane and the surrounding area largely after lazy eggs smoke. In 2015, some 2,000 litres of mineral oil flowed into the city's wastewater system after an accident.
Woman announces her job to look for 57 days after her disappeared bitch
For two months, a woman from Washington searched for her missing dog - and announced her job for it. The seven-year-old Border Collie had left the hotel room for a short break in Montana. 57 days were missing from the bitch every trace - but Carole King did not give up.
"It was terrible. I got sick," Carole King told the "Daily Inter Lake". She and her husband had left Hundin Katie in the hotel room while they went to dinner. When they returned to the hotel, Katie had disappeared. They were looking for the animal, but without success.
Donner had put dog in panic
In the hope that Katie could still stop somewhere in the hotel, Carole King went to the reception. "The employee says, "She left about four and four and a half hours ago," Carole King remembers to "Daily Inter Lake". When the automatic entrance door opened, Katie was straight out. Probably a loud thunderer had put the dog into panic.
With flyers and calls to Facebook groups, the Kings were looking for their beloved dog. But from days to time were weeks. "I never gave up. I never lost hope," Carole King said to the "Daily Inter Lake", who announced her job as a postal worker to continue her search for Katie.
"The tears flowed"
57 days after Katie's disappearance Carole King got a call: A man answered and said that Katie was in his yard. But when King arrived there, Katie had already disappeared again. She looked for the neighborhood and suddenly stood her bitch under a tree. "I just hugged her. I didn't want to let her go," King said "Daily Inter Lake". "The tears flowed. People stopped in their vehicles, got out and hugged us. I think the whole neighborhood knew we had found them."
Losses at the Bundeswehr: Machine guns disappear without any trace
Friday, September 27th, 2019
Six MG3 machine guns are still gone.
In recent years, the Bundeswehr has lost many weapons and tens of thousands of shots of ammunition, including three machine guns. Staying in most cases is unclear. The opposition speaks of a "fearing" scale.
With the Bundeswehr, weapons and ammunition disappear again and again - many of them so far without any trace. Since the beginning of 2014, the troops have been accounting for the loss of 39 weapons, 39 parts of weapons and nearly 20,000 shots of ammunition. This is due to a list of the Federal Ministry of Defense, which the editorial network Germany reports.
According to the paper from the Office of Defense Secretary Peter Tauber of the CDU, so far, two weapons, one weapon and 3474 shot ammunition have appeared again. The weapons and parts of the weapon are still missing, among other things, six MG3 machine guns, eleven G3-type rifles, four G36 rifles, six signal guns and two P8 pistols. In addition, 30 MG3 machine gun guns are missing.
The volume of arms and ammunition losses at the Bundeswehr was "frightful", said the left-wing member Martina Renner. This was all the more true, as in the course of investigations there was hardly any recovery. The left-wing politician spoke of a "needy balance". Renner criticised that on the list it was not clear whether under the disappeared ammunition there was also the one found in connection with the investigations against the terrorist officer Franco A. "And that, although a supporter of Franco A. was recently condemned because of the possession of this ammunition," says Renner.
Stena Impero oil tanker left Iranian port
More than two months after its establishment by the Iranian authorities, the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" left the port of the city of Bandar Abbas on Friday. The tanker was moving and left the Iranian port. Port Rashid was stated as the destination port in the United Arab Emirates.
The tanker had actually been released by the Iranian government on Monday, but at first he remained in Iranian waters. According to the shipping company, one wanted to wait for an official notice from Tehran.
On 19 July, the "Stena Impero" had been accused by the Iranian revolutionary Guards on Hormuz's sea road to have infringed security regulations. However, it was suspected that Iran would react to the controversial, temporary establishment of an Iranian oil tanker in front of Gibraltar, which belonged to Great Britain.
Hormuz is one of the most important sea roads in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Most of the global oil exports are being shipped through the seas. The tensions in the region had become enormously aggravated in recent months. Commercial shipping has been drawn into the conflict between the USA and Iran. There have been several incidents with tankers and drones.
Merkel appreciates people's courage in the Fruitful Revolution
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel appreciated the commitment of the people in the GDR, who went to the streets 30 years ago during the early revolution. In the fall of 1989, courageous citizens had brought the then GDR regime to the fore, said Merkel at a celebration of the Thuringian CDU Group for the upcoming day of German unity in Erfurt. The chancellor reminded, among other things, of the occupation of the Stasi headquarters. "The state security was taken the terror," she said.
Musk Seeks Delivery Record
Teslas quarter may be holding record. Despite the extradition boom, there were last losses at the electric car company.
New York.Tesla CEO Elon Musk has given his electric car group a strong boost to the stock market with the prospect of new record figures. "We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 extraditions," Musk wrote in an email to Tesla employees published by the industry blog "Electrek".
The demand was strong so that Tesla could book 110000 orders, it was continued in Musk’s newsletter. The challenge was to bring the cars to the customers quickly. Tesla had to offer as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked this: Teslas shares went out of trade with a plus of over six percent. So much the price has not increased for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered about 95000 cars and thus reached its previous best value.
Musk needs records to achieve its high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360000 to 400000 cars. Six-digit figures have to be achieved in the current and coming quarter years. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is required, but here the profit margins are small. Despite the boom there were last losses.
Puzzle solved: That's why we can't tickle ourselves
A kind of brake in the cerebral brain prevents people from tickling themselves. This was found by scientists from Humboldt University in Berlin with the help of experiments on rats as they reported on Thursday evening. Progress on the question was also made as to why children were so fiercely opposed to the tickling, just to ask for more.
Finally, it was also shown why only the approach of a tickling hand would cause laughter before the touch. This was due to a deep layer in the cerebral brain, which already caused laughter in the expectation of the tickling.
According to the data, earlier research showed that rats react with "Laughter" in the ultrasound area when they are tickled by people. This "Laughter" is mediated by the part of the cerebral cortex, which serves the central processing of haptic perception.
Laughing is suppressed during self - touching
So far, it has been assumed that the brain can distinguish between self-contact and contact by others - so people cannot tickle themselves. However, the Berlin researchers found in the experiments at the rats that the laughter as well as the activity of the area of the cerebral brain in question is suppressed during a self-contact. This is also true if living beings themselves are washed. During the external contact and tickling by the scientists, however, the activity in the brain and impulse has been increased.
But if you pass the touch of yourself and the touch of others at the same time, the laughter has also been suppressed. This indicates that the brain of the rat cannot distinguish between self-contact and contact by others. The new findings suggest that people cannot tick themselves because the self-contact activates a brake in the cerebral brain.
The rats had also been trained to tickle themselves. They broke this initiation in the experiment sometimes in advance, showed flight behaviour or terror. This ambivalence is similar to the behaviour of the children. The ambivalence of the kitzel is a behavioural reaction that is the same in rats and humans.
Rejected disaster: Big fire in French chemical work deleted
The big fire in a chemical plant in the northern French city of Rouen has been removed. This was reported by the prefecture of the Normandy of the news agency AFP on Friday. The fire had broken out in the night to Thursday.
According to the authorities, no hazardous substances should have occurred. The samples taken do not give cause for concern, as Prefect Pierre-André Durand said at a press conference on Friday morning. No one was injured in the incident. The fire brigade was in operation with about 200 extinguishers.
Schools and kindergartens were closed
Residents were called not to leave their homes. Buildings around 500 meters were evacuated, schools and kindergartens remained closed on Thursday.
Factory belongs to the company Lubrazole of U.S. billionaire Warren Buffett
The chemical plant on the banks of the Seine produces additives for lubricants. The factory belongs to the company Lubrazole of US milliardary Warren Buffett and is subject to the so-called Seveso Directive, which prescribes particularly strict safety requirements. Around 400 people work in the factory.
Already in the past, the chemical factory provided headlines - for example, when a leak took off the gas methanthiol in 2013 and the surrounding area largely after lazy eggs smoke. In 2015, after an operating accident, about 2,000 litres of mineral oil flowed into the city’s wastewater system.
Brexit: Johnson criticised by her own sister
The Prime Minister’s sister commented on Boris Johnson’s speech at the first session in Parliament after the suspension of the forced break on Wednesday evening. The Prime Minister threatens to lead the country out of the EU without agreement on 31 October should not accept Brussels’s demands for changes to the Brexit Agreement. However, as he wants to achieve this, it is unclear.
About Cox, who had been in favour of Britain's residence in the European Union, the Prime Minister said: "The best way to honor Jo Cox's memory and reunite this country would have to do the EU exit."In 2016, Cox was murdered by a right-wing extremist during the referendum election.
Monument to attacks by Oslo and Utöya is revealed
More than eight years after the attacks in Oslo and Utöya with 77 dead, a memorial will be revealed on Saturday in Norway in honor of the victims. The monument "Jernrosene" (German: the iron roses) consists of about 1,000 iron roses. They recall the roses that had taken place by thousands of people in the days and weeks after the attacks before the Cathedral in Oslo.
In the same place, the project of the artists Tobbe Malm and Tone Karlsrud will be revealed - the roses were forged by people from all over the world, including survivors and victims. The opening will include Kronprinz Haakon and Kronprinz Mette-Marit.
On July 22, 2011, the legal terrorist Anders Behring Breivik had first set a car bomb in the government district of Oslo and then shot dozens of participants in a holiday camp of the youth organization of the Social Democratic Workers’ Party, killing 77 people in the attacks.
Iran Releases UK Tankers
The UN General debate brought no solution in the Iran conflict. But now there is a problem less. The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" held in Iran could get back into the sea. It could be a puzzle piece in the peace plan of Iranian President Ruhani.
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero", which has been held in Iran since mid-July in Hormus, is back in international waters. After the release by Iranian authorities, the ship is on its way to Dubai, as the Stena Bulk shipping company announced.
The "Stena Impero" has left the port of Bandar Abbas and the crew is now traveling, among other things, to Dubai for medical examinations, stated Reedereichfüll Erik Hånell. At midday the ship had left the Iranian waters. "Well that it is over," he said to the Swedish television station SVT.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in London called the establishment of the ship illegal. "This is part of a pattern of attempts to undermine the freedom of the seas. We are working with our international partners to maintain shipping and international law," said a communication on Friday.
On 19 July, the Iranian Revolution Guards had charged the tanker with disregarding the rules of the Persian Gulf Sea Law. Seven of the 23 crew members had already been released at the beginning of September. The 16 remaining crew members were doing well according to the circumstances, said Hånell. They had behaved professionally in the face of the difficult and tiresome situation over the past ten weeks. The shipping company is now working to bring them back with their families as soon as possible.
The British government suspected that, following the establishment of the "Stena Impero", a response to a similar incident in the British Gibraltar was made: in early July, a super-tanker with Iran oil intended for Syria had been placed on the chain. According to the authorities, the delivery stopped against EU sanctions against the war country of Syria. The British had received reference to the ship from the United States.
Iran spoke of "piracy" and threatened with consequences. In mid-August, the "Adrian Darya-1" was finally released. Supposes that it was a business of exchange to free the "Stena Impero", left London vehement back.
The road of Hormus is one of the world’s most important sea roads, connecting the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Most of the world’s oil exports are being shipped through the seas. The tensions in the region had been greatly aggravated in recent months. Commercial shipping has been drawn into the conflict between the USA and Iran. There have been several incidents with tankers and drones.
It is behind the tensions between Tehran and Washington that the nuclear conflict between the two countries stands. The Americans accuse the Iranian leadership of wanting to build nuclear weapons. Iran rejects this. In 2018, the United States had left the international nuclear agreement alone, which should prevent Iran from building a nuclear bomb and at the same time end its political and economic isolation. Since then, the U.S. government has put pressure on the leadership in Tehran with massive economic sanctions against the country in order to force a more stringent agreement extended to other areas. Iran has been resisting the pressure so far.
Due to the dispute over the "Stena Impero" and other incidents with tankers in the Persian Gulf and oil plants in Saudi Arabia, the US is working on a coalition for military protection of the merchant ships in the region.
Iranian President Hassan Ruhani had presented a plan for security and peace in the street of Hormus at the UN General Assembly in New York. With the "Coalition of Hope" initiative for the Persian Gulf, Iran, together with the Arab Gulf States, and without foreign protective powers, wants to ensure the security of shipping in the Persian Gulf.
India is building a better future with its protectionist economic policy.
India would actually be predestined as a "war-winner". Given the customs duties imposed by America's President Donald Trump on Chinese producers, foreign producers in the People's Republic of China are forced to dissociate themselves. Chiefs of Asian companies who are considering moving their production from China to another country call India in a survey of the UBS as one of the preferred alternatives. This has, of course, not only to do with the indescribability of the Chinese-American trade war. With a giant pool of young workers and a single market of 1.3 billion consumers, India seems to play a more important role in the globally far-off production chain.
But now India itself is in Trump's focus. From the Haudegen in the White House labeled "Kingdom of Customs", America removed the marketing advantages for 2000 products from the emerging country at the beginning of June. The United States prohibitively observed high tariffs and demanded better market access for agricultural goods, mobile phones, spirits, motorcycles and more.
On the world map of the trade wars, the riding armies with India are, of course, a side view. America also considers the world’s largest democracy through security glasses. Delhi and Washington joins the concerns about China’s power claims in the South Indian Ocean. Against this background, a balance of American tariffs against India is unlikely. India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has just entered a second five-year term of office, is therefore likely to be in security.
However, the problem lies in another place: the empirically hardened thesis that open markets are accelerating economic development, has a heavy standing in the socialist Republic of India. Also under modes. Its reform is mainly aimed at the bureaucratic madness that has suffocated all too long-round entrepreneurial spirit. Companies now receive fast building permits for buildings. They benefit from a better energy and transport infrastructure, and a more aggressive insolvency and bankruptcy law creates conditions for making it seem to liquidate lot companies with high debts more quickly.
The success of these efforts can be seen and measured in the relevant rankings. In India, in the first five modes years, a lot has been done to improve. However, this is not true in trade policy. The national conservative government even established new barriers to protecting internationally undercompetitive companies from foreign suppliers.
In the West, the Nimbus of the energetic reformer, who radically renews his country, is due not least to the fact that the charismatic Prime Minister knows only too well what vocabulary western managers like. In the core, however, the Indian First Advocat never turned away from a protectionist economic policy, preventing Indian companies from becoming anachronistical managers and thus fit for global competition. Businessers, who survive thanks to the deterrence of their industries, are among the root electorates of modes of nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party and complain this short-sighted policy.
Succession of Jacques Chirac on Monday in Paris
According to former French President Jacques Chirac, the report will be buried in Paris in the coming week. The former head of state will be buried on Monday at Montparnasse cemetery in the south of the French capital, reported the news agency AFP calling on the Chiracs family. The burial will take place in the close family circle. For Sunday, a public funeral in Paris's disability was held, as media reported.
Carrying the competitor to the finish: Dabo is the first secret hero of the athletics world championship
The top of the world had long been in the finish when the cooled Khalifa International Stadium was playing heart-warming scenes. In the first advance of the men over 5000 meters Jonathan Busby from Aruba started to wander dangerously. He could hardly hold himself on his feet about 300 meters before the finish, ran in an unsaturated attitude when Braima Suncar Dabo from the West African country of Guinea-Bissau suddenly interrupted him and supported him to the final half of the stadium round. However, the forces were still enough to stop the running watch after the finish. As if the scene had not already been curios enough.
"I just wanted to help him. Everyone in this situation would have done the same," Dabo said after the race in Mixed Zone, when he was totally unexpected in drawing the attention of the assembled journalists. He was only shy, he didn't want to talk about his heroic act at all. After all, he wanted to set up his personal best time and when he noticed that this would be difficult, he only wanted to help a companion of suffering. And anyway he would only be proud to represent his country, which was invited to the World Cup. He shouldn't have even started under normal circumstances. "That's why I'm proud to run here for my country," he said.
That's what he did in the evening with emphasis - and much more intense than he might have thought. For this heroic act will remain in memory. In fact Dabo even left his rival Busby to take the lead and voluntarily took the final place - by the way, about five minutes after the Ethiopian Selemon Barega, who won this lead. In the end, it had nothing to do with it, because the only busby came to the finish with much help was disqualified precisely because of the world's light athletics band.
Dabo, who lives in Portugal and studied there in Lisbon, was on his way to create a personal best time at the Doha World Cup. According to official data, this was possible at 18:10,87 minutes, but he himself was still disappointed: "I wanted to run 17:55 minutes. Under 18 minutes I was already there". However, only in training, there are no best times.
Millionsasch: Egyptians are preparing for wild protest
In Egypt, security measures have been reinforced in advance of possible government-critical protests. In the centre of Cairo a strengthened police presence was observed on Friday. Several subway stations remained closed, roads around the central Tahrir square were blocked.
In recent days, the police had strengthened their street controls and some pedestrian cell phones searched for news and photos related to the protests. Hundreds had been arrested, according to two NGOs.
Enemy of Al-Sisi
Last weekend, in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura, hundreds of participants were protested against the government of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, the critic of corruption and mismanagement. There had been no such open protest against the political leadership in Egypt for years. Egyptian builders and actors in the Spanish exile, Muhammad Ali, who put the demonstrations with video messages on Facebook, called for a "million march" in central places for today's Friday. Ali calls for a "Volksrevolution". For most young Egyptians, the man is not a "good guy, because he is the subcontractor for the army's millions but his messages arrive.
According to two groups of observers, the number of arrests related to the protests continued to increase. The Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF) counted more than 1,570 arrests by Friday. The Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights (ECESR) as well as the Human Rights Watch (HRW) spoke of more than 2,000 arrests. The figures were not confirmed at first.
Arrests
Many people have been "accepted arbitrarily", "only because they were in the wrong place at the wrong time," told HRW, in appeal to lawyers. According to their lawyers, the accusations against the arrested range from "proliferation of false information" to membership in a "terrorist association". In Cairo, Alexandria and other cities, and searched security forces in uniform, but also in civilian clothing, according to HRW statements also arbitrarily passersby.
HRW also criticised censorship in the North African country. According to that, the government blocks websites and online services in Cairo to stop further protests against Sisi.
Online dealer: Dealers should be able to donate returns more easily
For online dealers, many returned packages are lost goods. Around 20 million returns land on the garbage. However, there is an alternative.
The Ministry of Finance has shown online dealers such as Amazon and Zalando a way of donating returned products instead of destroying them.
Although it was not possible to exempt companies from the tax on property donations, the Ministry stated on a question of the Green-Bundestag Group, which the newspapers of the Funke-Media Group reported on Friday, but the traders could lower the market value of the unsaleable returns in such a way that they would not have to pay any or little VAT.
Scientists at the University of Bamberg had determined that the citizens would return every sixth package in the event of orders on the Internet. About four percent of the goods - some 20 million products - then landed in the waste. According to current legislation, they would also cost the companies money, because the financial authorities would rate amounts such as a turnover, on which turnover tax would then apply.
Mr. Katrin Göring-Eckardt, Minister of Finance, asked Minister of Finance Olaf Scholz (SPD) to make it clear with a decision that companies can't evaluate products in accordance with the rules and donate them free of charge to non-profit organisations. Companies would have to be able to rely on not being punished for donation. This was not only true for online commerce, but also for other shops from the fashion shop to the construction market.
Banksy art for auction: There was never a better time to sell this painting
The well-known work by Streetart-Star Bankssy, "Deved Parliament", will soon be auctioned.
For Branczik, Banksys's work "emphasizes the world's oldest parliamentary democracy into the basic attitude of animals and tribes". Starting on Saturday, the painting will be exhibited at Sotheby's in the British capital until it will be auctioned on October 3rd. It is estimated to be 1.5 to two million euros.
The work was first exhibited in the Museum of Bristol in the southwestern United Kingdom, where Banksy lives. This year, the artist had again exhibited the painting - at the same time as the original Brexit date on March 29. On this occasion, the work, which was called the "Question Hour", was renamed "Delived Parliament" ("Delegated Parliament").
The picture could change the owner for a million amount.
Last Wednesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had delivered a hard exchange with the opposition at the first meeting of the House of Commons after a forced break imposed by Johnson by the Supreme Court. Johnson intends to carry out the twice postponed Brexit on 31 October, if necessary without agreement with the EU.
It is not the first time that Banksy, whose identity is still unknown, is interfering in the Brexit debate. In Dover in the southeast of England, he painted a picture that represents a man who breaks a star of the European flag with a chisel. The factory sees thousands of truck drivers and other visitors daily on entry to the United Kingdom.
Brexit debate is like a "walk in the park"
The violent verbal attacks of British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Brexit opponents in Parliament do not contribute to a climate of hatred. Compared to the election campaign in front of the Brexit referendum in 2016, the current controversy was a "walk in the park", Dominic Cummings said on Friday at a book presentation. "We will enjoy this. We will quit (from the EU) and we will win."
Johnson had attacked all the people in Parliament in recent days and accused them, among other things, of "betraying" them. Claims that he could put Members at risk, because they could become the target of threat of murder, he turned off as "humbug".
Cummings said that the only way to get back to rest was if Members were finally to respect the British decision to leave the EU, and it was not surprising that the people were forced to say that the United Kingdom had not yet left the EU for three years after the referendum.
In the face of the charged mood on Friday, even the bishops of the Anglican Church called for restraint. "We should talk with each other with respect," said one statement. "And we should listen too."
Pakistan's Prime Minister Khan requests Uno intervention in Kashmir
With an emotional appeal, Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan again invited the United Nations to intervene in the Kashmir conflict at his first appearance before the UN General Assembly.
Otherwise, a new war between the nuclear powers of Pakistan and India would be likely, Khan said on Friday at the Uno-General debate in New York. "If it was bad, one would hope for the best, but be prepared for the worst."The United Nations would have a responsibility for Kashmir. "You should have prevented it."
India and Pakistan have led three wars since their independence from British colonial rule in 1947, two of them around the divided region of Kashmir. Both nuclear powers each dominate part of Kashmir, another part belongs to China. At the beginning of August, India had withdrawn the Indian Kashmir region from the autonomy status and thus thereby increased tensions in relation to Pakistan so strikingly.
Not even a bottle of water
The demonstrators in Cairo demand the overthrow of Egyptian President al-Sisi.
The government reacts with a strong hand against the current protests in Egypt. With a sharp ammunition, the government has taken over 2,000 prisoners in prisons to the 60,000 political prisoners who have already sat there. It has never been protesting in Egypt before. However, since the takeover of General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi in 2013, the state apparatus has done everything to prevent a scenario such as at times of Arab spring.
But one of the triggers for the 2011 protests was the bad economic situation. Poverty, perspiciousness and the feeling of being suffocated by one’s own government drove millions to the streets. And that’s a problem that the el-Sisi regime does not get under control, no matter how hard it is against opponents. The situation has even deteriorated.
Today, every third party lives under the poverty line in Egypt. Since 2016, the currency has lost more than half its value, the inflation rate is ten percent. Anyone who wants to buy a bottle of water in the supermarket has to decide who to finance: Nestlé, Coca-Cola or the military. The latter is not only responsible for oppression but also the largest economic player. The military builds streets, houses, football stadiums, produces food and much more. That was already before el-Sisi. With authoritarian regimes, the Egyptian people have a lot of experience, even the dilemma in the supermarket is an old one. Critically it always becomes when large parts of the population have trouble to afford themselves a bottle of water at all.
Tüv testing in terminal: BER-Chef: No "showstopper" anymore for capital airport
Two months, it was examined whether the complex plant conflict in BER fire protection works in interaction. The operators are satisfied with the course. However, the Tüv is not yet finished at BER.
According to large-scale Tüv tests in the terminal of the future capital airport, the operators confirmed the planned opening in October next year. This was certain, said Supervisory Board Chief Rainer Bretschneider after a meeting of the control panel.
Airport head Engelbert Lütke Daldrup spoke of a successful examination, but also said it was still faulty to work out in the terminal. "We have many detailed topics, but we don't have a real show stopper." He assured the schedule until commissioning still contained buffer.
However, there is evidence that the time reserve should no longer be too large.The building ready-to-use indicator is now to be submitted to the construction office during the first quarter of 2020, and this was planned for this autumn.
Hundreds of power cables still have to be repaired, and the Tüv wants to examine them until February. "In order to create the conditions for the reception of the operation, it is still necessary to work intensively on the processing of the deficiencies," said a written statement.
Lütke Daldrup said that in many cases there are missing proofs, less about new cables. There is no release for all dowels on which the cable tracks hang. The airport boss expects them to be available by the end of the year.
In addition, fire protection at the transition to the station under the terminal is still not satisfactory. The problems had led the project to another crisis three years ago. This time it is about smoke shocks that run down on a fire like a canvas so that the smoke does not spread out. They drive too far. Therefore, 36 engines have to be exchanged, and then there should be new attempts with hot gas smoke at the beginning of the year.
Problems with fire protection and further tree failure as well as planning errors have delayed the opening of the airport for years. Originally, it should go into operation in 2011. Costs have risen from two billion to about 6.5 billion euros since construction began in 2006 to opening next year.
Since passenger numbers have increased significantly since then, the passengers responsible are planning to expand the airport. That is why a special meeting of the Supervisory Board is scheduled to take place on 18 October, as announced by the chairman Bretschneider.
The airport company is now looking for two new managers. Chief of Finance Heike Fölster turns to Deutsche Bahn at the end of the year, staff manager Manfred Bobke-von Camen will retire next year, as Bretschneider said. He thanked Fölster. She has placed the airport finances on firm feet.
Chemnitz: Drifting Machines for Drugs - Police Arrests Man
He needed money for drugs - and he put some machines in the city of Chemnitz in the air! Now the perpetrator is finally in custody!
Over the past two years, the number of cigarette and parking ticket machines in Chemnitz and the region has increased considerably.
After two demonstrations at the end of May, the police took a 33-year-old German at Further Straße in Chemnitz.
Police spokesman Andrzej Rydzik: "In the course of the investigation of the production of explosive explosions in crime unit with a particularly severe case of theft conducted by the Chemnitz criminal police, not only this suspicion against the 33-year-old confirmed itself."
Confronted with the new evidence, the 33-year-old Chemnitzer now stated eight deeds in total.
The police spokesman: "With the prey, he apparently financed his stupendous dependence."The bomber had just sprung parking machines on the Bürgerstraße between August 20, 2018 and May 31, 2019.
The overall damage is at least EUR 60 000!
The Automate Bomber is now in custody, and the police investigations against him are continuing.
It can be thought that he was also responsible for further automaton jumps in Chemnitz and adjacent districts.
AUA takes over Eurowings flights from Vienna
The Lufthansa Group is repressing its strategy for the Vienna airport. In the midst of the price struggle with cheap flyers such as Lauda, Wizz Air, EasyJet and Level, Lufthansa subsidiary AUA takes over "the commercial control of all Eurowings flights from Vienna", confirmed on Friday a press speaker from Austrian Airlines to the APA. Previously, "AviationNetOnline" had reported on it.
The Vienna base of the Lufthansa billigligflieger Eurowings will thus be dissolved de facto. Of the currently seven Eurowings aircraft, four will remain in Vienna. This will be taken over by AUA from January 2020 in the "Wetlease", including Eurowings personnel. Three Eurowings jets will be stationed in Salzburg, which will fly from Salzburg and Innsbruck as charter machines for holiday destinations.
The speaker explained that the Eurowings base in Vienna will be integrated into the AAUA-Trehkreuz and network planning. The flight times are to be adjusted to connecting flights. The aim is to strengthen the Vienna hub and, on the other hand, to develop decentralised traffic from the federal states.
As AviationNetOnline writes, Eurowings in Vienna will only serve as a "production company" for the AUA group. For example, Barcelona and Rome would be used with AUA flight number, but mainly with Eurowings device. Although the board product should be adapted to that of Austrian Airlines, the pilots and flight crews are from Eurowings. According to the report, the Eurowings flights launched under AUA flight number are no longer completed in Terminal 1, but the AUA in Terminal 3.
At Vienna Airport, a price struggle broke out after the Niki race. The Ryanair subsidiary Laudamotion announced that the fleet in Vienna will be raised to 16 aircraft next summer. The Irish low-cost flyer will send four Ryanair machines, including crews, to Vienna, also in the so-called "wetlease", which criticised the trade union as a circumvention structure for the collective agreement.
On Friday, Mr. Michael O'Leary's campaigning that Lauda will have overtaken the AUA over five years replied, "We will remain the number one at the site, in five, six or ten years".
Queen-Ekelin Princess Beatrice is engaged
Beatrice, Eugenie, William and Harry: As children, the cousins were the best friends. Now they marry the last of the four. Beatrice is engaged!
Wonderful news from the British Royals: Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi (34) should have stopped at the beginning of the month around his girlfriend Princess Beatrice (31) who announced this to the palace on Thursday.
"We are extremely pleased to announce our engagement. We are both so pleased to begin this adventure together and can hardly expect to be married," said the couple, who have been together since October 2018 in the official announcement.
And further: "We share so many similar interests and values and we know that this will be very helpful in the coming years with love and happiness".
Sister Eugenie cut the pictures
The official engagement photos have taken up her sister, Princess Eugenie (29), and also published immediately on her Instagram account.
A royal festival
The wedding will take place in 2020. More information about the date, place and everything else will be announced to the palace in the coming months.
However, it is certain that the marriage of the number nine of the British throne order and the real estate mogul will become a similar great feast to the wedding of Eugenie on 12 October 2018 with Jack Brooksbank (33).
Study on causes of heart disease
Smoking, overweight, unhealthy nutrition - there are risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. But what really causes heart failure or infarction? Hamburg researchers now want to see exactly the heritage of 9000 healthy and sick people.
About the analysis of the inheritance of 9000 people, Hamburgers and Swiss scientists want to trace the causes of cardiovascular diseases in more detail.
The research project is the largest of this kind in the German-speaking area, the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) announced on Friday. The Kühne Foundation supports the project with 12.5 million euros. From Switzerland, the Hochgebirgesklinik Davos, which belongs to the Foundation, and the University Hospital Zurich, are involved.
Overweight, smoking and unhealthy nutrition are among the essential risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. Genetic factors determine the risk. However, the interaction between genes and external influences is not known enough. Now the scientists want to compare the complete inheritance of 8,000 healthy people with that of 1,000 former patients of the University Heart and Vascular Center at the UKE.
At present, more than 4000 of the approximately 20,000 relevant human genes were known to cause possible disease-related changes in DNA - so-called mutations - by the clinic. About 200 were added each year.
The aim of the five-year project is to develop new options for the prevention, detection and treatment of cardiac arrhythmias, heart weakness and heart infarctions. Data could also be used in researching other common diseases, according to Stefan Blankenberg, Head of the University Heart and Vascular Center. New findings on the interaction between heart and brain, heart and kidney as well as cancer can be achieved.
The chairman of the Kühne Foundation, Klaus Michael Kühne (82), also stressed that there is a strong desire to use the data to investigate other diseases as well. So far, the Foundation's hospital in Davos is mainly dealing with allergies. Now a Center for Cardiovascular Precision Medicine should be created at the medical campus and a professor of bioinformatics will be created. For the reasons of his commitment, the logistics contractor living in Switzerland said that he had been open-minded in Hamburg three years ago and was very grateful.
The bio-probes of healthy participants are from Hamburgers, who also participate in the Hamburg City Health Study. According to the Klinikum, this is the largest local health study in the world, with 45.000 subjects. During the genetic encryption, strict attention is paid to the protection of anonymized data, the scientists assured. It is about a petabyte (1000 terabyte) of data, said Holger Moch of the University Hospital Zurich.
Today, according to UKE, human inheritance can be deciphered within 24 hours. The pure cost of property for this is 1300 euros. The first gene-sequencing worldwide, the results of which were published in 2001, have cost several hundred million euros. The study is scheduled to begin on 1 October, all 9000 samples are expected to be analysed at the end of 2020. The following year, the first results are expected.
Nigerian Police Releases Hundreds of Mistreated Boys
In Nigeria, the police freed more than 300 tortured and abused boys from a Koran school. According to information from residents, security forces searched the school in the northern Nigerian city of Kaduna and discovered some of the still minor victims, as police officers Yakubu Sabo reported. "The victims were abused. Some of them reported having been raped by their teachers," said Sabo.
The boys had been held under the pretext of being taught in the Koran and "improved". In fact, the shooters had been held by their teachers under "most worthy and inhumane conditions", said Sabo. About one hundred students, including children at the age of nine, had been chained in a small room.
According to the Koran School, the information had existed for about ten years. Inhabitants would have alerted the authorities to repeated irregularities in the institution. Parents would have been shocked when they were informed about the conditions in the Koran School, said Sabo. They had not anticipated the suffering of their children. The operator and six staff were arrested according to police.
In the mostly Muslim north of Nigeria there are many private Koran schools. They replace the often inadequate state institutions. People in the region suffer from frequent attacks of armed gangs. According to the UN refugee relief plant, therefore, over the past ten months more than 40,000 people have fled across the border in the neighbouring state of Niger.
Chained and tortured: Nigeria's police free 400 children from school
In a school in northern Nigeria, police officers have liberated almost 400 students from terrible conditions. "Many of them were chained and some had visible injuries that indicate torture," said police spokesman Yakubu Sabo in Kaduna City.
On Thursday, the children had been discovered in a school marked in Islam, where the conditions there were "humanely unworthy". The officials arrested the headmaster and six teachers after the liberation action.
The children, all of them boys, had been kept in their school like slaves and laid on chains. Some had been sexually abused. TV images showed debilitated and injured students in a clearly bad health condition.
World football election: Other accusations after Messis and Klopps Kür
Football "Signature not valid"
Jürgen Klopp, Lionel Messi and Megan Rapinoe excellent
With a gala in Milan, the world football association Fifa is the best player, the best player and the best trainer of the year. For Lionel Messi it is the sixth honor and thus record.
After Nicaragua's captain declared that he had never voted in the World Football election, accusations to the FIFA came from other countries. Egypt was not valued at all - with a curious reason.
Over the past few years, many of the Fifa's plans for the World Cup, dubious plans of its President Gianni Infantino, have proved to be an obstacle to the general behaviour of various corrupt officials. However, the Fifa World Cup election has not yet been suspected of being unfair - when one looks at the fact that the national trainers and national team captains of the member associations often vote for sympathy rather than objectively.
However, after Nicaragua’s captain had complained that he had not voted at all, there are now other inconsistencies: Egypt complains that the votes of National Trainer Hossam El-Badry and Captain Mohamed Salah were not taken into account. In fact, they do not appear in the official and publicly available voting list.
Fifa apologizes in that "the signatures on the electoral forms were in capital letters and therefore not valid". One has contacted the Egyptian association several times in order to clarify the situation - without an answer.
Sudan’s Trainer also marvels
There is also a cry from Sudan regarding the election. While the situation in the case of Egypt is understandable, the Sudanese association indicates that trainers Zdravko Lugarisic did not vote as it was finally appreciated: with Lionel Messi in place one, Virgil van Dijk on two and Sadio Mané on three. According to Fifa, however, the vote was received as well, with signatures and official stamp of the Sudanese Association.
Even Nicaragua's captain Juan Barrera also raised accusations: "Did not vote for the #TheBest2019 Awards. All information about my voice is wrong, thank you," he wrote. In his case, it was suspected that the Mexican football association simply voted in his name.
On Friday the association came up with the announcement: Voiced, but of course it was not intended. However, the completed election documents were "unfortunately" with the name and signature of Juan Barrera, the captain of thenicaraguan election, said it in a statement of the association. However, the second captain Manuel Rosas chose. "We take responsibility for the administrative error," it said in the communication. However, both Rosas and team coach Henry Duarte had voted for Messi, "just as it is in the official list of FIFA."
The other cases now allow Fifa to examine in an investigation, but emphasizes that the election was externally supervised by the consultancy firm PriceWaterhouseCoopers. As long as Lionel Messi remains only undisputed winner of the world football election - and Jürgen Klopp world trainer of the year.
Ukraine-Affairs: Ranghohe Republicans speak for official investigation
Two high-ranking Republicans have openly advocated an official investigation against the US President and Party Friend Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important," said the Republican governor of the U.S. state of Vermont, Phil Scott. "Where this leads from here, it is determined by the facts that are determined." He wants to know more about the Whistleblower affair before taking action. An impeachment procedure can lead to the deposition of the President.
Scott said that he was not surprised by the revelations, which had shown that Trump had repeatedly asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyj in a telephone call to investigate the activities of the democratic candidate and former vice-president Joe Biden in Ukraine. Scott said Trump Biden observed "since years".
The Republicans have held back so far with criticism of Trump because of the Whistleblower affair, but few have shown unhappiness. Scott’s comments are now a first sign of this in Trump’s party. In doing so, the moderate governor of Virginia had already opposed Trump’s policies several times, for example, against the easing of environmental protection regulations and the strengthening of immigration rules.
As another senior Republican, Charlie Baker, Governor of Massachusetts, also spoke out for the investigation. "It is a profoundly disturbing situation," said Baker. "The right approach and responsibility for the Congress is now to investigate the matter and to get to the bottom of it."
Scott and Baker, as governor of the U.S. states, have not formally participated in the trial against Trump, which is decided in Congress. Therefore, their statements are mainly symbolic. Nevertheless, the first senators of the Republicans have also expressed their criticism of the situation. Mid Romney, for example, who represents the state of Utah in the second Chamber of Parliament, said that the case is "extremely disturbing, deeply disturbing". US media also report that the Republicans had their first internal cracks.
The affair could lead to the launch of an official investigation against Trump, and the Democrats in the House of Representatives announced an investigation. They accused him of abuse of power for the purpose of foreign influence for his own political benefit.
There is no precise timetable for the investigation procedure. With its majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could try a so-called impeachment. However, the decision to collect an actual office fell in the Senate where Trump’s Republicans have the majority. Therefore, the prospects for success of such a procedure are small. So far, no US President has been removed by an impeachment procedure of the Office.
Were torturers on board of Rickete's "Sea Watch"?
Three men have been arrested in Sicily; they should have raped and murdered in Libyan refugee camps.
The German captain Carola Rackete (31) had been arrested in June after she had unauthorisedly controlled the port of Lampedusa with the rescue ship "Sea Watch 3" and 53 Libyan refugees on board. After violent protests and international criticism - also by Austrian President Alexander van der Bellen - her house arrest was lifted after a few days by an Italian judge.
Now new serious accusations against rockets are going on. Thus, three men who are accused of torture in Libya's refugee camps could have arrived with the "Sea-Watch 3" in Italy. The suspects have been captured in a reception camp in Messina (Sicilies) after migrants recognized their tormenters in Italy. "We can't exclude this, but we don't have any secured information about it," said "Sea Watch" spokesman Ruben Neugebauer of the German press agency.
The police said in mid-September that the suspects in the North African country had raped, tortured, and even murdered. It was Muhammad C. (27) from Guinea, and the two Egyptians Hameda A. (26) and Mahmoud A (24). "The migrants were systematically harassed and brutalized by repeated and constant physical violence," said the communication.
NGOs and aid organizations now point out that they cannot know exactly who is coming to the ships. "We can't scan who the people are. They are coming without passports," said Neugebauer. Torture is one of the main reasons why people flee Libya. It is therefore quite likely that even perpetrators are on the ships. "It is therefore very important that they are followed."
Italy's Minister of Justice Matteo Salvini demanded that rockets, which are still found in Italy for aid to illegal immigration, be excused immediately.
Musk strives for delivery record at Tesla
Tesla-Chef Elon Musk has given a strong boost to his electric car group with the prospect of new record numbers on the stock market.
"We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 extraditions," Musk wrote in an email to Tesla employees published by the industry blog "Electrek".
The demand was strong so that Tesla could book 110,000 orders, it was continued in Musk’s newsletter. The challenge was to bring the cars to the customers quickly. Tesla had to offer as much resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked this: Teslas shares went out of trade with a plus of over six percent. So much the price has not increased for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered about 95,000 cars and thus reached its previous best value.
Musk needs records to achieve its high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars. Six-digit figures have to be achieved in the current and coming quarter years. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is required, but here the profit margins are small. Despite the boom there were last losses.
U.S. budget dispute: Renew only a bridge financing
The new financial year will begin in the US on 1 October without a proper budget. The Senate followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and decided on a transitional financing until 21 November.
Although the US Congress and President Donald Trump agreed in August to increase the spending limits for the financial years 2020 and 2021, the United States will be standing before the new Fiscal Year beginning on 1 October without expenditure plans. The Senate followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and decided on a transitional financing (continuing resolution, CR) until 21 November. Without such a decision, a shutdown would have come to a close on Monday at midnight, a partial closure of the Federal Government. President Trump must still put the decision in force.
Shutdown turned off
The Federal Government will now be financed in advance at the level and in accordance with the priorities of the expenditure plans for the financial year 2019 to the end of Monday. This is because the Congress has not agreed in due time on the 12 expenditure laws that assign the funds to the various departments and authorities. Therefore, the Federal Government cannot, for the first time, benefit from the expenditure framework extended for the new financial year from 1.3 Bio. to 1.4 Bio. $.
The Democrats have completed ten of the twelve laws in the House of Representatives, where they have the majority. However, the expenditure laws reflect the priorities of the Democrats, who have little chance in the Senate dominated by the Republicans. Conversely, the Senate has also more or less prepared ten out of the twelve spending plans, which are hardly multiplicityable.
In the Senate, Republicans apparently try to force $12 billion for the construction of walls, one of the major priorities of President Trump, one of the biggest priorities. The Democrats interfered with the plans for the construction of walls and their financing, which is actually intended for other military buildings and projects. The struggle over the construction of the wall was already escalated in December 2018 and had led to a 35-day shutdown.
The ghosts separate from the building of the wall
At present it is unclear how the parties want to come closer to this question. More likely than an agreement on all twelve expenditure laws over the next seven weeks is an extension of the transitional financing beyond 21 November.
Against the background of the continuing inability of the Congress to agree on the twelve expenditure laws in due time, and the associated danger of a shut-down gain ideas for the automation of the process of popularity. Template S. 1877 to avoid Shutdowns would automatically continue the financing of the federal administration at the level of the previous year, stop Parliamentarians' travel activities and stop their wages until the new annual spending plans appear.
France allows artificial fertilization for lesbians and singles
In France, artificial fertilization is expected to be open to women and lesbians living alone: the Paris National Assembly voted by a large majority in favour of a government bill that allows all women to use in vitro fertilization, which is likely to significantly increase the demand for anonymous seed donation.
In the three-day emotional debate, critics in the right camp warned that in the future many "children without father" could grow up. The French Bishops' Conference is also against the innovation.
The new regulation is the core component of a bioethics law, which defended Health Minister Agnès Buzyn as a "chance" for society. It is the modern family in which there are children with only one parent or with homosexual parents. According to her idea, the cost of artificial fertilizations for all women is to be borne by social insurance.
Fertilization with sperm from dead husband
The National Assembly, on the other hand, rejected an amendment designed to give widows access to the sperm of their dead husband. In Belgium, Spain and the United Kingdom, artificial fertilization was permitted "post-mortem". In Germany, there have been cases in which women have in vain complained of the release of the sperm of a deceased. The opponents of the incident in Paris argued that such a child was "very serious".
Many members of the government party La République en Marche (The Republic of Movement, LREM) of President Emmanuel Macron and members of the opposition had, on the other hand, expressed their support for the artificial fertilization with the sperm of the deceased partner. They stressed that a widow would impose a "double grief" if her husband’s death had not yet fulfilled her child’s desire.
The initiators of the amendment that has now failed consider it unfair that a widow can in future be fertilized with the sperm of an unknown person, but not with that of her own partner.
So far, artificial fertilization in France is allowed only heterosexual couples who can’t bear children. They must be married or live together for at least two years. Buzyn had already announced in summer that the maternity continues to be forbidden.
In Germany, artificial fertilization is theoretically open to all women - it is often difficult for single or lesbian couples.
Reimbursement for the climate: calls for airport charges are becoming louder
In the future, the country will also be able to pay climate taxes in the future, and the rectors say they have no money for it. But now they are also under pressure internally.
The universities should also limit themselves to flying. Photo: dpa/Julian Stratenschulte
The debate about climate taxes on flights from universities and universities before the summer break comes into effect again. After the Land Rectors' Conference has responded sceptically to a corresponding advance from the Green-Black Coalition, the plans are now receiving support from the universities. In a joint declaration the doctoral students from six Baden-Württemberg universities and a educational university for a compensation of service flights. This is the first step "necessarily necessary", at the same time there must be a broad debate on the avoidability of flights, according to their opinion. The Cabinet decision, originally planned in July, is now still on ice because the CDU has still not approved the presentation of the Greens.
Russia Retains North Korean Fischer
According to the FSB intelligence service, the arrested were supposed to have fished illegally in Russian waters. Ten days earlier, 161 fishermen from North Korea were arrested. At that time there was an exchange of shots between the border guards and the boat crew. Three Russians and a North Korean were injured, the fishermen later suffered his serious injuries. This time, however, there were no injured people, it was said.
The Communist North Korea suffers from chronic food shortages. North Korean fishermen were therefore on their way into Russian territorial waters. Russia’s Coast Guard is heading for the protection of its marine biological resources.
30,000 squids seized
During the re-checking, 30,000 squids were discovered and confiscated on the boats. In addition, the data were confiscated after three fishing and two motor boats and taken to Naodka and Posjet at Vladivostok.
Russia’s fisheries authority had not issued any fishing licences to North Koreans this year, even after the complaints of local entrepreneurs. According to thousands of fishermen from North Korea, media have been temporarily arrested there this year.
The head of the association of Russian fishing companies in the Far East region of Primorje, Georgi Martynow, recently also complained of high ecological damage caused by North Korean fishermen. They fished with narrow synthetic nets banned in Russia. With them also small creatures would be taken out of the sea. In addition, the nets would simply be disposed of in the sea where they needed 200 years to be destroyed.
In future only 18,000: United States reduce the upper limit of asylum
The "greatest nation in history": Donald Trump, here at a meeting with elected police representatives in the White House.
The richest country in the world is turning its attention to those seeking protection: as Foreign Ministry confirms in Washington, the ceiling for the legal entry of refugees is further reduced. In the future, mainly threatened believers and Iraqi asylum are to be preserved.
The US government wants to reduce the already historically low limit for the reception of new refugees once again. In the 2020 marketing year, which runs in the United States from October 2019 to September 2020, a maximum of 18,000 people are to be left in the country, as the US Foreign Ministry stated. In the now almost finished marketing year, the limit is still 30,000 people.
President Donald Trump’s government has drastically reduced the willingness to take up the asylum for those seeking protection from all over the world in recent years. Under the previous Government of Barack Obama, far higher limits of admission had been applied.
The target limit of 18,000 refugees would be the lowest since the US refugee programme was introduced in 1980. Nevertheless, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs called the US "the most merciful and generous nation in history", a formulation that is strongly reminiscent of the language use of the U.S. President.
A "responsible dealing" with refugees is aimed at allowing refugees to return to their home countries to help rebuild them, Trump explained. For his hard course in migration policy, he receives much encouragement from supporters, but there is also massive criticism.
A major dispute is the border with Mexico that Trump wants to lock off. In order to be able to finance the construction of a border wall, Trump had imposed the national emergency. Whether there is a time-consuming relationship between the current measure and current domestic policy developments in the U.S. capital is unclear. Trump is currently under pressure because of the Selenskyi affair and a potentially threatening investigation procedure.
In the future, the US government intends to focus on the inclusion of two refugee groups after presentation from the Foreign Office: people persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the US military in the country and are thus in danger as the declaration of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs shows. A maximum of 1500 refugees are to be taken up from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador.
The US wants people from this "northly triangle" of Central America to apply for asylum in other countries. Against this background, the United States has only signed migration agreements with Guatemala and now also with El Salvador and Honduras in order to reduce immigration at the US southern border with Mexico.
Court ordered release of Orang-Utan from Zoo
At the request of Argentine justice from the former zoo of Buenos Aires, an Orang Utan female has been transferred to a pick-up station for human monkeys in the United States. The "Sandra" born in the Rostock Zoo in 1986 was given the rights of a "non-human person", so their release is imperative. The animal was brought to Dallas by direct flight on Thursday evening – but not as a passenger, but in the cargo room, as lawyer Andrés Gil Domínguez explained.
Since the 53-kilogram human monkey is unable to adapt to life in the wilderness, she is expected to live in the open air of the Center for Great Apes in Florida. There, 21 other orangutans and 31 chimpanzees have already been accommodated, among them "Bubbles", once pet by Popstar Michael Jackson. However, before entering Florida, "Sandra" has to endure a 40-day quarantine in the Sedgwick County Zoo in Wichita in Kansas.
After her birth in Rostock, Sandra spent several years in the former Ruhr Zoo in Gelsenkirchen, before she was transferred to Buenos Aires in 1995. The process of "Sandras" by animal protectors in 2014 contributed to the conversion of the Zoo of Buenos Aires into an eco-park. By 2023, a research and educational centre is to be created to preserve biodiversity.
Record for Swiss Extremberg climber: 550 meters in 46 minutes
The extreme mountain climber Dani Arnold has succeeded in a new Husar ride on the large tin in the Italian Alps, almost 3,000 meters high.
Without the net, double floor or other tools, the Swiss forced the 550-metre-high north wall of the Great Tinne in a new record time.
Dressed with jeans, T-shirt and only supported by absolute dizziness required Arnold 46 minutes and 30 seconds for the ascent. Thus, he undercut the old best brand by almost 19 minutes.
Arnold is now record holder in Free Solo Speed on four of the six most important European north walls.
Nike benefits from new online marketing strategy
Despite the trade conflict with China, the US sports goods manufacturer Nike has had a significant increase in profits. Net profit increased in the last quarter to $1.4 billion (just under €1.3 billion), which is 25 percent more than in the previous year, as reported by the Group on Tuesday. The main reason for this is the new marketing strategy "Nike Direct", with which the Adidas competitor directly turns to its customers.
Sales rose to 10.7 billion dollars in the three-month period until the end of August. The most powerful increase in Nike sales was 22 percent in China. This led the Group to benefit from Beaverton in the U.S. state of Oregon as well in the People's Republic of China from its approach to direct contact with consumers via the Internet or smartphone apps.
Chief of Finance Andy Campion announced that Nike would continue to push forward the "digital transformation" of the sports goods manufacturer with strategic investments, thus expanding its competitive advantage. Investors responded to the quarterly figures - the shares of the sports product manufacturer increased by more than five percent.
Lifelong Stadium Prohibition for Racism in Italy
Because of racist comments about football pro Juan Jesus of AS Rome, the club from the Italian capital imposed a lifelong stadium ban against a fan. The Brazil-based defender Jesus had been insulted by the fan on Instagram. Jesus then published the private news and asked his club to take action. "@officialasroma You already know what to do with such a fan. #NoToRacism. Pride to be who I am", wrote the 28-year-old who has been playing with AS Rome since 2016.
The club responded on the late Thursday. He reported the account of the fan at Instagram and the police. Furthermore, if the Roma followers could never again visit a game of the club, the club wrote on Twitter.
Racism is a problem in Italian football. Regularly, Italian fans are scandalizing racist abuses against black players rival teams. "We can't have racism in society or in sports. In Italy the situation has not improved, and this is very serious. You have to identify the responsible ones and throw them out of the stadiums," said Fifa President Gianni Infantino on the weekend. Reason for the presentation were racist singing at the First League Party between Atalanta Bergamo and the AC Florence last Sunday.
However, there had also been discussions about Juventus Turin’s followers. The Italian authorities now have 38 peripheral fans of record champion Juventus Turin with stadium bans. Four of them should no longer enter the stadium for a period of ten years, the police told us. Therefore, there are bans from four to seven years.
The fans are in conjunction with ongoing investigations against twelve leaders of ultra-fan groups in the area of Juventus. The twelve are accused, among other things, of severe extortion, money laundering and private violence. The club had put the investigations in place with an advertisement last year.
The ultra-leaders are supposed to put tickets behind the black trade after Italian media reports. They would have controlled the ticket trade for the fan curve "militaryly" and should have extorted Juventus employees to get to cheaper tickets.
Generation Z: Are they really different from Generation Y?
Millennials are narcissistic, the generation Z is political - entire vintages are conceived with gripping names. Looking more closely, the awards are full of contradictions. So how well do these labels describe the respective lifestyle of young people?
"The crabbs are coming!" On September 21st, this call officially launched the crab catch at the Gucheng lake in Gaochun, which also initiated the opening event of the 19th China Gaochun Gucheng Lake Crab Festival, as announced by the Department for Public Relations of the Nanjing-Gaochun District Committee.
Gaochun, which forms the southern foothills of Nanjing in Jiangsu Province, is one of the national environmental zones. The city is the first international "Slow City" in China and here is also the Chinese seat of the international "Slow City" movement. The city has in environmental terms ideal conditions with a mixture of "30 percent mountains, 20 percent water areas and 50 percent fields". The great natural environment of Gaochun offers its inhabitants all conditions to become rich.
In the early 1990s, the people in Gaochun started the crab breeding industry. Over time, the crab industry has developed into a shaping industry that has created high incomes and has become an important part of the economic development of Gaochun. Over the past years, Gaochun has actively pursued a large-scale, ecological and scientific development of crab breeding as well as a technology-based crab breeding effort. And the city has taken care of the promotion of more efficiency in agriculture and the income of farmers.
Over the past few years, Gaochun has promoted a reform for the distribution of power, optimization of the administration and of government services, and has carefully established the service network for "allowments under one roof, a team for prosecution, a network of services, a platform for lending" with the aim of fully optimizing the environment for permits, services and development.
Gaochun takes full advantage of the local benefits of connecting to southern Jiangsu and southern Anhui and uses the development zone and its position as an international "Slow City" as a signpost to provide intelligent high-end production companies, companies for biomedical and medical technology, for energy storage and environmental protection, from the cultural and health sectors, as well as companies for ecological agriculture, which are leading in the "3+2" area. At the same time Gaochun has encouraged the construction of a national, all areas of comprehensive tourism zone and tourist resorts of national importance. In doing so, the ecological and cultural resources of the landscape of Gaochun have been involved, the state of the buildings for civil services and for the public service fully improved, the areas "Tourism +" and "+ Tourism" and the development of cultural tourism to a high level of quality. It is worth looking forward to the future of Gaochun.
Conflict between Iran and the USA: Ruhani speaks of the end of sanctions - Trump contradicts
Following his return from the United Nations General Assembly, Iranian President Hassan Ruhani spoke of an alleged US offer to abolish sanctions, and the United States had put an end to all sanctions in return for talks with the Tehran leadership, Ruhani stated on its official website.
US President Donald Trump, however, contradicted the Iranian counterpart on Twitter: " Iran wanted me to lift the sanctions imposed on him so that there was a meeting. I said, of course, no."
Ruhani describes this: Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron had been present in New York and had insisted that a meeting would take place. "And America says that I will lift the sanctions," Ruhani added. The nature of the fines that should be terminated has been a debate. "And they clearly said that we are lifting up all sanctions".
However, this advance was not done in an acceptable manner, Ruhani criticised. In view of the current criminal measures and "the poisoned atmosphere of maximum pressure", no one could predict the outcome of negotiations.
At the beginning of the week, Chancellor Angela Merkel met with Ruhani in New York. Background was the hope of the Europeans to save the nuclear agreements with Iran negotiated with Russia and China, which should prevent the Islamic Republic from developing nuclear weapons. France’s President Emmanuel Macron, like Merkel on the outskirts of the UN General Assembly, expressed the hope that Ruhani would meet with US President Donald Trump.
Heavy Earthquake near Istanbul - Almost 200 Postquake
After the Western Turkey has been shaken by two earthquakes within a short period of time, the fear of a disaster grows. 34 people have been injured during the earthquake on Tuesday. Since the earthquake the previous day, almost 200 survivors have been killed, the Turkish Vice President Fuat Octay said on Friday.
Thus, 14 schools in Istanbul had been closed for security reasons. Hundreds of buildings were damaged. On Thursday, the earthquake of strength 5.8 had shaken the Marmara region before Istanbul and caused panic in the million metropolis. Now, the government wants to use a Commission to prepare the country better for earthquakes in the future, Octay announced.
Over the past 20 years, Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for earthquakes, said Istanbul’s mayor Ekrem Imamoglu. In the city itself, the latent danger is repeatedly ignored. Every year, badly built houses fall into a pit - including the many smaller earthquakes that regularly shake Istanbul.
Town planners like the well-known architect Mücella Yapici have been warning for years that large open spaces registered in the centre as places of refuge have long been built. Only on the 20th anniversary of the Gölcük River in August had the Istanbul Building Chamber warned that an estimated one million buildings in Istanbul were not safe from earthquake.
The epicenter of the earthquake from Thursday was located in the Marmara Sea in front of the district of Silivri and at about seven kilometers deep, as the disaster protection authority Afad reported. A smaller afterlife caused even greater panic on the streets a few minutes later.
Istanbul’s mayor Ekrem Imamoglu told us on Twitter that injury or damage had not been reported at first. TRT showed people who ran out of the homes in panic. Students were brought out of the buildings for security reasons in the district of Silivri. Some students cried as seen on pictures.
Istanbul is considered to be particularly endangered. Below the Marmara Sea lies a section of the so-called North Anatolic disorder that marks the border between the Eurasian and the Anatolic Earth plate. Turkey is repeatedly shaken by earthquakes. One of the most deadly was the earthquake in 1999 near Istanbul. At that time more than 17,000 people were killed.
Researchers fear that an earthquake of strength could threaten 7.1 to 7.4, but when the earthquake comes, it is unclear. During the earthquake on Thursday, the West of the country and Istanbul were hit again.
Companies design emergency plans, private people have so-called go-bags ready to stand next door with all the necessary needs, and schools teach children how to behave when the earth is waving. When the next great quake comes, be unclear.
After his return from New York, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said that eight people had been injured. Some buildings had suffered minor damage. Istanbul’s mayor Ekrem Imamoglu persecuted the developments of Istanbul’s disaster coordination centre (Akom). According to this, two minarettes of mosques fell into the districts of Avcilar and Sariyer.
Warning of post-surveying in Istanbul
In the social networks, many people report panic. Buildings were waving. Schools and hospitals were evacuated. Telephone lines were interrupted. It was more fierce than Tuesday’s, writes a user. Turkish Red Half Moon’s boss, Kerem Klinik, warned about post-surveying via Twitter. He called people to stay away from buildings that had suffered visible damage.
According to CNN Turkey, the time of the earthquake is stated to be 13.59 a.m. (local time). According to CNN Turkey, only a few minutes after the first earthquake, there was a post-survey that was given with a strength of 4.0 on the judge scale.
Only on Tuesday had an earthquake of strength 4.6 shaken the Turkish Marmara region - it was to be felt until Istanbul. Also its epicenter located in the Marmara Sea west of the million metropolis, the disaster protection authority Afad already announced on Tuesday.
It was not the only earthquake that caused headlines this Tuesday: Pakistan too was hit by a severe earthquake.
Researchers assume that sooner or later there could be a catastrophic earthquake in Istanbul - the tension between the tectonic plates is extremely high. Scientists believe that it will eventually be discharged - and cause massive damage.
Earthquake researcher Sükrü Ersoy expects the earthquake to be a warning now. This has made it more likely, he said to CNN Türk. "This could be the signs of a larger earthquake," said Ersoy. "Before or later the great earthquake will come."
A few weeks ago, there had been an incident - the earthquake caused great concern also in Istanbul. In Albania there had been a severe earthquake only a few days ago - there were 68 injured. Also on Lake Constance this year, the earth had trembled.
Parliament: New ignition in Ukraine-Affair
Two bristling documents provide new ignition in the Ukraine affair for possible abuse of power by US President Donald Trump. On the way to a possible investigation procedure, the U.S. democrats see themselves as strengthening: the complaint filed by an anonymous notifier about Trump and his controversial telephone call with the Ukrainian president Berge important points for investigations against the President. Trump himself once more sees himself as a victim of a "hex hunt". He also doubted the credibility of the Whistleblower.
USA: Passenger locked in toilet by United Airlines - Flyer rerouted
Because a passenger was locked in the board toilet, a flight was rerouted by United Airlines. The WC door had been blocked during the flight from Washington to San Francisco in 1554, according to US media.
In the event of an extra-planned stopover on Wednesday evening (local time) in Denver, the woman could finally be released from the narrow cabin. About an hour had she been locked in, U.S. media wrote on call to other passengers. For the flight to San Francisco, the passengers had to switch the machine.
In a video that is spread on the Internet, according to US media of Flight 1554, you can see how several people are trying to free the woman. "We are currently working on opening the door, Ma'am. We are getting you out soon, OK?" says one man. The airline has apologized for all passengers. Open was initially whether the woman receives compensation.
The cockroach: inspired by Kafka: Ian McEwan writes Brexit-Roman
How does a writer like Ian McEwan deal with all of the Brexit chaos? He writes a book about it - and his protagonist is unmistakable.
Inspired by Franz Kafka's famous story "The transformation" the British success author Ian McEwan (71) wrote a book on the Brexit Chaos in Great Britain.
The novel "Die Kakerlake" (Original: "The Cockroach") will be published in German on November 27th, the Diogenes Verlag (Zurich) announced. It is about the transformation of a man named "Jim Sams", who was ignored or hated in his previous life, but now is at once the most powerful man of Britain. He sees it as his mission to implement the will of the people and is determined to stop from nothing and no one.
McEwan was quoted with the words: "If Parliament is closed so that the government cannot be challenged in a critical moment, if ministers lie shamelessly like the Soviet leaders once, when Brexites in high positions appeal to the catastrophe of a no-deal - then a writer has to ask himself what he can do. There is only one answer to it: write" by McEwan only appeared in the spring of the novel "Machine Like Me" about artificial intelligence.
Kafkas 1915 published for the first time is about Gregor Samsa, who wakes up one morning and sees himself "to be transformed into a tremendous inconceivable" and is gradually excluded by family and society, and ultimately perishes. "Ian McEwan bows down to Kafka to describe a world that stands his head," said the Diogeness publisher.
EU invests 9.5 million euros in Austria's railway infrastructure
11.200 Wagons in Austria and Hungary receive fluid brakes to reduce noise from freight trains. In addition, sections of railway connections between Graz and Györ and Wiener Neustadt and Sopron are modernised and electrified.
According to the EU authorities, this should make travel more comfortable and reduce CO2 emissions.
Thomas Cook: All travels to October 31 cancelled
The German tour operator Thomas Cook has cancelled all travels up to and including 31 October 2019 one day after his insolvency notice. Travels could not be started for insolvency reasons," the company announced on Thursday evening.
Also affected are the bookings of the brands Thomas Cook Signature, Thomas Cook Signature Finest Selection, Neckermann Reisen, ÖGER TOOURS, Bucher Reisen and Air Marin, which are already paid or paid in full. As is about travelling with start-up from 1 November 2019, the company left open. In agreement with insolvency insurance, the further procedure was examined, said.
Thomas Cook in Germany had been in the run of the British parent company and had filed insolvency requests on Wednesday. The company, including Neckermann Reisen, Öger Tours and Bucher Reisen, employs about 2000 people in Germany.
Insurers want to transfer money to hotels from now on
On the other hand, from this Friday hotels abroad, which are still home to Thomas-Cook holidaymakers, will receive money from Zurich insurance. According to Zurich, payments to the hotels are subject to the condition that holidaymakers will no longer be asked for extra payments.
Based on the booking information and without the presentation of separate invoices, hotels in the resorts are now expected to receive 50 percent of outstanding payments, as a Zurich speaker of the German Press Agency said. "This applies immediately and on condition that Thomas-Cook travelers from these hotels are not immediately asked for the individual payment of hotel bills or are otherwise required," continued Spokesperson Bernd Engelien.
The insurance responded to reports by hotel guests, who according to their own information had been forced to pay their accommodations on site. Some therefore had to put more than 1000 euros on the table. The German Travel Association (DRV) and the Federal Association of Consumer Centres had severely criticized this.
How many hotels are affected will be matched by the insolvent travel provider on Friday, the insurance speaker said. According to information from Thursday, 70,000 Thomas-Cook-Pauschalführers were on their way from Germany. Zurich Germany has secured vacation and return to Thomas-Cook customers.
Insolvency administrators want to try to continue the three Thomas-Cook companies in Germany and find a future solution.
However, the now announced payouts to hotels by Zurich Insurance only help travellers who are still on the move. For Thomas-Cook customers who want to fly on vacation, it looks bad. On the late Thursday evening, the company announced that all travels by October 31, would be cancelled. This also applies to such bookings that have already been paid.
The company left the company open as of 1 November 2019 to travel with start. In agreement with insolvency insurance, the further procedure was examined, said it. In principle, insurance Zurich is also responsible for these cases. The sale of new travel is stopped. dpa
The company refers to the insurer Zurich, which can be represented by Kaera. Customers could inform themselves on the Kaera website about the possibilities of refunding the travel price and claim their claims via a web form.
Prince Harry destroyed detonating mine in Angola
For a long time Prince Harry has continued the engagement of Lady Diana. In Africa, he is now moving directly to his mother’s footsteps.
Dressed with a blue splitter vest, British Prince Harry set fire and destroyed an explosion mine in Angola.
Near a camp of the British Halo Trust in the town of Dirico, on Friday morning, he put in front of running TV cameras the Zündkreis. In a safe way, the explosives exploded in the savanna landscape, without harm. Although the Halo Trust alone has destroyed more than 100,000 relics of the bloody conflict in the African country for decades, there are still more than 1000 mine fields that threaten the population.
On the fifth day of his African journey, Harry wanted to walk directly to the tracks of his mother Diana (1961-1997). With the same detonator, who once accompanied his mother, he wanted to take the road she was going back then. The pictures on which Princess Diana went through a spacious minefield in 1997 had gone around the world. She had also demonstrated support for the Halo Trust.
Harry (35) and his wife Meghan (38) have been on a ten-day trip since Monday, which began in the South African tourist metropolis Cape Town.
Stocking Brexit negotiations: The danger of a no-deal remains acute
In fact, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had decided clearly: he is not going to guarantee a third delay in the Brexit negotiations. But what statements have been made by the polarizing British already of eternal duration. The recent judgment of the Supreme Court in Great Britain floats like a Damocles heavy over the Blondschop. His suspension of the Parliament, in order to be able to carry out its Brexit course until the expiry date, was cancelled at the beginning of this week. And a law passed by Parliament obliges Johnson to enter into an extension of bilateral talks with the EU until 31 October in case of failed negotiations. However, Johnson had repeatedly excluded that.
Boris Johnson thinks Deal is still possible
But the pressure seems not to pass Johnson at all. In the meantime, when visiting a hospital, he made indications that, in the event of a non-unification, he would support an extension of the negotiations by the end of October:
You know, we're gonna comply with the law.
At the same time, however, we are confident that we will leave the EU on 31 October.
And best of all with a deal. I'm cautiously optimistic that this works.
And the time is running out of it for the Brexit negotiators in Brussels. About six weeks, the EU and the British negotiators have time to prevent Britain from leaving the European Union without agreement. However, the recent talks have failed again. An agreement by the end of October currently appears rather difficult to imagine. If the British Prime Minister does not break the law, a new departure date is in force. However, the opposition does not trust the Prime Minister’s words. She fears that Johnson could somehow enforce the Brexit in the case of a no-deal.
U.S. Authority: Other deaths by e-cigarettes
The number of deaths related to the use of e-cigarettes in the US has risen to twelve. In addition, there have been now 805 confirmed and likely injuries in this context, the US Health Authority told CDC. According to a study in the "New England Journal of Medicine", there have already been more than 900 affected, around 500 of them confirmed. The cause of lung damage is still completely unclear. No similar increase in lung damage has been known in Europe so far. The complaints seem to be limited to users in the US.
Fear of New Protests in Egypt Grows
Millions of times, Muhammad Ali’s videos have been shared into online networks, and the Spanish-based builder and actor is calling for a “popular revolution”. For today’s Friday, he has called for further protests against President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and the Egyptian military, who are accused of criticisms of corruption and mismanagement. Ali hopes for mass demonstrations with a million participants in central places in the country.
The security authorities are in any case alarmed. In the center of Cairo an enhanced police presence was already observed. Several subway stations remained closed, roads around the central Tahrr square were blocked. Already in recent days the police had reinforced their street controls and the mobile phones of pedestrians partially searched for news and photos related to the protests.
On 20 September, the demonstrators also gathered around the Tahrir Square.
In Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura, there had been protests last weekend with hundreds of participants. There had not been such an open protest in Egypt for years. According to the Human Rights Organization Human Rights Watch (HRW), the security forces responded strongly. Since last week, nearly 2,000 people have been arrested. Many of them have been arbitrarily arrested - only because they were "in the wrong place at the wrong time", HRW reported with appeal to lawyers.
The organization also criticised the censorship in the North African country. According to the government in Cairo, it blocks websites and online services to stop further protests against al-Sisi. Since 2013, the country has been governing the country since it had fallen down the democratically elected Islamic president Muhammad Mursi. Thousands of Islamists, opponents of government, bloggers and activists have been detained and partially sentenced in recent years.
"Ocean Change": Arved Fuchs von Greenland-Expedition back
The Polar researcher Arved Fuchs returned from his Greenland expedition on Friday. On arrival at the port of Hamburg he was welcomed by, among other things, the skipper Boris Herrmann, the climate activist Greta Thunberg with the race yacht "Malizia" over the Atlantic.
With a team of scientists, Fuchs had examined and documented the consequences of global warming on his sailing ship "Dagmar Aaen" on the coasts of Iceland and Greenland over the past few months.
The Fridays for Future movement is a blessing, said the Polar researcher. He has waited for years for the young generation to come up with a speech. One has known for decades that the earth is warming up. Nevertheless, many were acting like a planet B.
"What happens on the sea often takes place under the exclusion of the public," said Fuchs. He and his team wanted to inform people about the effects of global warming and the waste of the seas. In the expedition, among other things, was measured with a drone Greenlandic glacier ice and fished with nets after microplastics, it was said.
The Polar researcher from Bad Bramstedt was awarded the "Seadevcon Maritime Award" in the context of the Hamburg climate week. "For all of us, the survival of the oceans is a great example," said Skipper Boris Herrmann at the award ceremony. "He is a witness of the changes that have taken place in the Arctic over the last decades."
Teure Spaghetti in Rome: Tourists paid 430 Euro
430 Euro for two plates of Spaghetti with fish in a simple restaurant near the Engelsburg in Rome: this seemed to be too much for two Japanese tourists. The bill with 80 Euros drink was paid by the two women, but they posted the receipt on Facebook, which triggered hot reactions.
"Such cases harm Rome's reputation. We ask the police to consider whether this is a fraud," demanded a spokesperson from Federagit, the association of the travel guides in Rome, according to the Roman daily Il Messaggero (Friday edition).
Prompt’s reaction came from the owners of the restaurant. The Japanese not only ordered Spaghetti but also fresh fish, the local owner justified himself. However, this cannot be taken from the invoice. A tipping fee of up to 20 percent of the invoice was also normal, said the host.
A call in Ukraine, and everything is broken? US President Donald Trump, after the turbulent revelations of the past days, could actually be confronted with an official investigation procedure, the Democrats want to examine it with their investigation in the House of Representatives as soon as possible - the speech is from weeks to a decision would fall.
At the beginning of the scandal is said to be the telephone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyj. The accusation of the Whistleblower, who finally made the conversation about national security and about the democracy of the United States with his complaint to the public, is crucial: The President has abused the power of his office to instrumentalise the government of another country for an influence on the election 2020. He has used Ukraine’s dependence on it and thus forced them to take action against a political opponent.
The core of this project is also to be understood in the post-published collaboration with Selenskyj, although it does not reflect the full text. However, the telephone call of 25 July is only an episode of a much larger story, in which the center of which, besides Trump, is above all his personal lawyer: Rudy Giuliani.
The story begins from the public's point of view in May 2019 when the New York Times of Rudy Giuliani's travel plans to Ukraine reported. He wants to meet with the elected president Selenskyj in Kiev, and the lawyer himself knows very well that his intentions are delicate. "We do not interfere in a choice, we are involved in an investigation into what we have the right to," says the newspaper. One can think that it is inappropriate, but "this is nothing illegal." Giuliani wants investigations in Ukraine to be conducted for which there is hardly any basis - "because this information will be very, very helpful to my clients and can prove itself helpful to my government".
The lawyer and former New York mayor seems to have infected himself with right conspiracy fantasies, which are fixed on Trump's opponent at the 2016 election: Hillary Clinton had conspired with actors in Ukraine, said critics at that time to construct an occasion for the Russian investigation in the US. However, this accusation was never serious.
It is about exactly the investigations that Trump will speak so prominently on the phone with Selenskyj in July. The version of Giuliani and the President is: The former Vice President and currently prospective candidate for the presidential candidate of the Democrats, Joe Biden, as Ukraine representative of the Obama government, has urged the release of the then Ukrainian prosecutor Wiktor Schokin. In order to stop the investigation of the gas company he was responsible for in whose Supervisory Board his son Hunter Biden was active. Biden senior had pressed Ukraine financially to cover the corrupt operations of his family.
In fact, the process was somewhat different. When Joe Biden demanded that the Ukrainian general prosecutor go, the investigations against the gas company had already been completed, Hunter Biden had never been directly affected by it. Schokin himself was deeply accused of corrupt gestures, the U.S. government was not the only Western partner in the case of Weitem, who was pushing for his release. Furthermore, the Obama government even explicitly supported the investigations against the company.
Disorders on Instagram Facebook and Whatsapp: Social media are down
Users worldwide report massive disturbances with Instagram and Facebook. Germany, Great Britain and Spain are therefore particularly affected. On the website allerbereichen.de users report that Facebook has not been inviting again and again since about 15.30 p.m. Instagram also reports the error message that content could not be loaded. Whatsapp also seems to be affected by the disorder, though not to date in the same extent.
Instagram and co. more often affected by disturbances
It is not the first massive disorder this year. Already in March and July, the services had failed for several hours. And as in previous cases, users also use Twitter this time, especially to make their anger air.
Polish Scientists in Antarctica Saved
Three Polish scientists have been rescued from the Chilean Air Force from Antarctica’s ice. They were on their way with a hose boat and several miles from their base when their engine failed. They had luck in disaster - less than an hour the Chilean rescue helicopter needed for the recovery.
Eduardo Mosquera, Commander of the 4th Chilean Air Brigade:
"At 9:30 a.m. we received the message, at ten a.m. we started, and good 20 minutes spàter we were over the boat."
Poland has operated the Henryk Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station on King George Island since 1977, 19 scientists are working there. The frozen researchers were safely brought back to their research station.
Attention: Smartphone NOT charged wirelessly
Practical but Harmful
Inductive technology via Qi standard is extremely practical, but should not be used.
Since several new smartphones have recently arrived on the market, which support wireless charging and sell themselves very well - first of all the new iPhone-11 models, we would like to recall a study from the beginning of July. The wireless charging of mobile devices is extremely practical, but not necessarily recommendable.
Higher temperature applies to battery
Researchers warn against the wireless charging of smartphones. According to the findings of the University of Warwick, this is extremely harmful for the devices. Because of this, the significantly larger heat development is. If you store a mobile phone normally by cable, the battery is heated to 27 degrees within three hours. In the case of wireless charging, however, even when the smartphone is perfectly aligned on the charging path, the researchers have always measured more than 30 degrees. If the mobile phone is slightly in addition to the coil, the temperature increases even higher. In addition, the watt strength of the charging path increases, which in turn drives the power consumption to the height.
Capacity and lifetime
According to the researchers, the temperature for the durability of batteries is a decisive factor. Every single degree plays a role. When charging with higher temperatures, the battery not only loses capacity, but also does not last for as long as possible. Thus, the researchers recommend that the smartphone always be charged by cable. As a battery exchange for modern smartphones is always connected with high costs, this should be a helpful tip. Apple has, last but not least, increased the cost of a battery exchange even once again - for all iPhones.
Practical
The technology is extremely comfortable: simply put the device on a charging path - these are already installed in many restaurants, airports, hotels and cars - and the battery is charged without a dirty cable salad and a laborious plug-in fumig. As Qi (standing for inductive energy transmission) has a worldwide standard, with exceptional even Apple, there are hardly any restrictions. However, according to the researchers, the technology should be applied only in exceptional cases.
Everest-Stau photographer: 13 eight-thousanders in six months
According to his own information, a Nepalese climber has climbed 13 of the 14 highest mountains in the world within just six months. Nirmal Purja (36) has reached the top of Manaslu in Nepal, thus setting a record, his expedition operator announced.
The former soldier wants to climb all 14 eight-thousanders in seven months. Purja calls his project "Mission Posible". He has already made international headlines: a photo of climbers who are standing on Mount Everest Schlange, which was viralized in spring.
The image of the mass exodus triggered a debate on stronger security measures on the 8848-meter-high mountain and highest peak on earth. In May, eleven climbers died during the climb within a few days.
A problem for Purja could be the climb of the 14th eight-thousander: Chinese authorities are currently blocking the Xixabangma mountain in Tibet. As a reason for this, among other things, is called bad weather. At the beginning of the week, Purja wrote on Twitter that Nepal’s government wanted to speak to China to enable it to climb.
Four dead elephants discovered on Sri Lanka
Among the dead animals was also a pregnant elephant cow, a police officer told us on Friday. "We suspect the elephants were poisoned."
The four cadavers were found in a protected area near the famous rock fortress Sigiriya, visited by many tourists. The animals were probably between 15 and 25 years old, according to the police officer. An autopsy was ordered to determine the cause of death.
In Sri Lanka, almost 200 elephants are killed every year. The perpetrators are often farmers, on whose land the animals had previously held themselves unscathed. At the same time, about 50 people are killed by elephants every year. This usually happens when the animals move through villages built near their habitat.
According to estimates, only about 7,000 elephants live in Sri Lanka. Their killing is theoretically the death penalty.
Fixed British oil tanker leaves Iran
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" leaves the port city of Bandar Abbas more than two months after its arrest by Iran. This was announced by the Bandar Abbas Maritime Office, according to the news agency IRNA. On 19 July, the Iranian Revolution Guards had set the tankers under British flag under the charge of having disregarded rules of maritime law in the Persian Gulf.
Management by Thomas Cook in the critique
The responsible business committee of the House wants to examine in detail the meeting of the travel giant Thomas Cook. It is about the salary packs of the board of directors as well as the question of why the British government did not want to go financially to the company that was fighting for survival. "Our interest is the supervision of the company as well as the control by external auditors," said the committee president Rachel Reeves in London. "We are obviously dealing with a bad example of management."
According to experts, genes are overestimated in the risk of colon cancer
The role of genes in the family-enhanced risk of colon cancer has apparently been overestimated so far. Researchers of the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) Heidelberg come to this conclusion in a recent study. Other risk factors such as family nutrition habits are therefore more likely to weigh than previously. This has consequences for calculations of individual cancer risk, the DKFZ scientists emphasize.
Elon Musk lets Tesla share rise
This was written by Musk in an e-mail to Tesla employees published on Thursday (local time) by the industry blog "Electrek". The demand is strong, so that Tesla could book 110'000 orders, it continued in Musk's newsletter.
The challenge was to bring cars to the customers quickly. Tesla had to offer as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked the information: Teslas shares went out of trade with a plus of more than six percent. So much the price has not increased for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered about 95'000 cars and thus reached its previous best value.
Musk needs records to achieve its high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars. Six-digit figures have to be achieved in the current and coming quarter. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is required, but here the profit margins are small. Despite the boom there were last losses.
Will British Government U.S. U.S.
The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson considers whether he is looking for ways of circumventing the last law adopted by Parliament against an irregular Brexit. On a question like this, he simply told journalists on Friday that his government would adhere to applicable law.
The law provides for the government to request a postponement of the date of withdrawal, should not have reached an agreement with the EU until mid-October. Johnson criticises this as a "capitulation law" which makes negotiations with the EU difficult.
The former British Prime Minister John Major had said on Thursday that Johnson could try to use "political schicane" in order to circumvent the law. Johnson could use a procedural trick that would delay the entry into force of the law to the time after EU withdrawal.
Johnson said he founded a treaty with the European Union. "We are confident to leave the EU on 31 October, and the best way is by agreement".
Iran seems to drive high uranium enrichment
Iran's President Hassan Rohani has increased pressure on the European parties in the dispute over the rescue of the historical nuclear agreement. "Unfortunately, the European states show inability or lack of willingness to act on concrete actions," said Rohani on Thursday at a press conference on the margins of the UN General Assembly in New York. In the event that they are not in the course of their promise, he put forward "further steps" away from the 2015 agreements of the tiresomely negotiated agreement.
The background is the conflict over the international agreement to prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb that, as a counter-end, contained the commitment to Tehran to normalize economic relations. In 2018, the United States launched from the agreement alone to force Iran to change its course in the aggressive Middle East policy. President Donald Trump’s government intends to negotiate a new agreement with tougher conditions and is now re-establishing harsh sanctions against Tehran. Iran has recently responded to the re-examination of the Uranian empire, which is limited in the Treaty.
The International Atomic Energy Authority (IAEA) confirmed in a report that the Islamic Republic now also uses or at least prepared for use the centrifuges installed at the beginning of September. Iran also prepares for the construction of more than 300 additional centrifuges, according to IAEA data.
Perhaps the Europeans are not willing to carry their part of the deal and therefore allowed the Iranians, with the costs and burden of US sanctions alone, to assume Rohani. However, there will still be further discussions that hopefully broke a solution.
Rohani continues to challenge Iran's attack on Saudi Arabia
However, following an attack on an important oil plant in Saudi Arabia in mid-September, the quantity situation changed: Germany, France and the United Kingdom followed on Monday the U.S. assessment that Tehran was responsible for the attack. Originally, the Huthi rebels in Yemen supported by Iran had become aware of the attack, which the US valued as false confession. "We have nothing to do with it," Rohani confirmed his position on Wednesday.
"Those who make such accusations must present evidence for this," said Rohani. However, the European leaders in the talks with him during the UN general debate would not have been able to do so. Instead, they would only have called for the rebels in Yemen to make an attack like this one. Rohani had met in recent days with Chancellor Angela Merkel, France's President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson.
Before possible talks with U.S. President Trump first needed to abolish the far-reaching sanctions of the US administration, Rohani demanded. He called on the government in Washington to shift to a policy of "dialogue and reason".
Comes through the solar system by other star
Astronomers are currently observing a comet from the depths of space. This was done before. The comet allows conclusions on other solar systems.
What at first was just a presumption is now confirmed: an interstellar guest crosses through our solar system. The comet from the depth of space was baptized after his discoverer to 2I/Borisov and has aroused the interest of astronomers around the world.
The far-reaching comet was discovered on August 30, by the amateur astronomer Gennadi Borissov at the Margo Observatory in Crimea - with a self-built telescope of 65 centimeters in diameter. The observations of various observatories not only confirmed that it was an unknown comet, but also showed that it was not from our solar system.
After 1I/'Oumumamua from 2017, 2I/Borisov is the second interstellar object, which was sighted at a passage through our solar system.
2I/Borisov offers astronomers the rare chance to get out of the vicinity insights into a foreign solar system before he disappears on Negro Respect. First observations show that the interstellar comet resembles those of our own system, as the astrophysical institute of the Canary Islands reported. "The current speed of the comet is high, about 150,000 kilometers per hour, which at this distance is clearly above the typical speeds of objects that orbit the sun," said Davide Farnocchia of the US Space Agency Nasa in a communication.
The comet, according to the analysis, is on a so-called hyperbole track that leads him out of our system - and clearly interstellar origin, as the International Astronomic Union (IAU) reported. It is also responsible for the designation and categorisation of celestial bodies. In honour of its discoverer, the interstellar tail star, which was first led by the catalogue number C/2019 Q4, was named 2I/Borisov, with the first part of the name indicating that it is the second interstellar object discovered in our solar system.
The astronomers are lucky: unlike 1I/'Oumuamuamua 2I/Borisov was already on the verge of approach. So the researchers stay for many months for research. "The object will reach the greatest brightness in mid-December and then be seen with medium-sized telescopes by April 2020," Farnocchia explained. "Then it will only be observed with larger, professional telescopes until October 2020."
Several observatories have already taken the visitor into sight. Thus a team around Karen Meech from the University of Hawaii, which had already guided the characterization of 1I/'Umuamua, in a first study the diameter of the celestial object at 2 to 16 kilometers. Recordings of the Gemini Observatory in Hawaii show a clear silence of the comet.
Researchers from the astrophysical Institute of Canarys (IAC) have already obtained a first so-called spectrum of interstellar tail stars, which provides a kind of fingerprint of its chemical composition. "The spectrum of this object is similar to that of comets of our solar system, and this indicates that its composition must be similar," said IAC researcher Julia de León. This observation suggests that comets in other solar systems could form through similar processes as in our, complementary de León's colleague Javier Licandro.
The discovery of two interstellar visitors within just two years, according to the IAU, suggests that these objects could open up a new way for research into certain processes in other solar systems. However, as often as such are, it is still difficult to estimate. One of the next interstellar visitors could perhaps intercept a planned satellite mission from the European space agency Esa.
The agency wants to station the three-part space probe "Comet Interceptor" (German, for instance, Comet Absatzachäger) at a waiting position of 1.5 million kilometers from the earth. According to Esa science director Günther Hasinger, it is either looking for an unspoiled, fresh comet from our own solar system, or for an interstellar visitor like 1I/'Oumumamua.
First landing on Beijing's new mega-airport daxing
It is true that it is due to the 70th birthday of the People's Republic of China: a first passenger engine of China United Airlines landed on the new mega-airport in the south of China's capital city, a special honor for captain and crew.
By 2022, around 45 million passengers are scheduled to be finished each year at the new airport, and 72 million are expected to be in 2025. China’s President Xi Jinping personally announced the opening of the 450 billion expensive project. China’s latest prestige project is also called “Seastar” because of its six-arm building structure.
The complex has four runways and runways, which are to be extended later to seven and is equipped with the world's largest automatic air traffic management system. A new U-Neu-Bahn transports passengers to the city centre of Beijing in just 20 minutes.
The Chinese had already announced several times that Berlin was able to learn from Beijing during the construction process. The opening of the capital airport in Germany, which had been under construction since 2006, has been postponed again and again. In Beijing, on the other hand, a first passenger machine had already landed after four years.
New overshadow aircraft is scheduled to fly 2030: In four and a half hours from London to Sydney
From London to Sydney in just four and a half hours - the UK Space Agency is dreaming of this. The UK Space Agency is to make it possible, for the 2030s, to provide a special drive (Synergetic Air-Breathing Rocket Engine, Sabre), which the company has developed Reaction Engines from Oxfordshire, the U.S. station CNN cited the agency. "This is the technology that could definitely achieve this," said Agency head Graham Turnock. "We are talking about the 2030s for commissioning, and the work is already very advanced."
In order to advance the project, the British Space Agency wants to work closely with the Australian capital. A flight from the British capital to the Australian metropolis is currently about 20 hours. As the only overshadow aircraft for passenger transportation, the Concorde had covered the New York-Paris route from 1976 to 2003 and needed three to three and a half hours for this. In 2000, an accident occurred at the start of a Concorde at Charles de Gaulle Paris Airport, where all 109 passengers were killed. Last year, the US aircraft manufacturer Lockheed Martin announced plans to develop an overshadow aircraft together with the US space travel agency Nasa, the "X-Plane".
"Sabre will make the world smaller with its high-speed point-to-point transport," says Reaction Engines, among other things, on his homepage. Sabre drive could be used for efficient travel at a speed of Mach 5 - which means five times as fast as the sound. In addition, such aircraft can also be used outside the earth's atmosphere and thus enabled the "next generation of truly reusable Rahmfahrtgeräte".
Callback in Washington: Trump wants to track down anonymous tipper in Ukraine's affair
In the Ukraine affair about possible U.S. President's abuse of power Donald Trump wants to track down possible dense places in the White House.
"I want to know who gave the information to the Whistleblower," said Trump on Thursday before U.S. Embassy staff at the United Nations in New York. The person concerned was almost "a spy" and with this one was "a little different" in the past than today.
This was regarded as an intimidation attempt against typists. The event was not actually public. However, several US media spread audio recordings from the speech on Friday. Democrats responded in an outraged way to the president’s statement.
On Tuesday, the Democrats in the US House of Representatives had announced preparations for an official investigation against Trump. Their allegations were based mainly on the written complaint of an anonymous intelligence officer, who made serious accusations against Trump and his headquarters.
As part of his work, Whistleblower wants to have received information from several government staff, according to which the US President "uses the power of his office" in order to achieve that another country is interfering in the U.S. election 2020.
At the heart of the accusations is a controversial telephone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyj at the end of July, in which Trump encouraged his colleagues to investigate that could harm his political rival Joe Biden. This is about former business of Biden’s son Hunter in Ukraine and supposed efforts to protect his speaker from Ukrainian justice. Biden is in the race for the democratic presidential candidate for the 2020 election.
The Whistleblower also accused the White House, with a view to the Ukraine telephone, of hiding: executive government staff had tried to keep the exact wording of the conversation under the ceiling. As usual, an electronic text protocol had been produced. However, this was removed from a database normally provided for by lawyers from the White House after the interview, and was stored in a particularly protected system instead. So far only a gross discussion protocol has been published.
The "New York Times" reported that it was supposed to be an employee of the CIA foreign intelligence service.
Trump once again questioned the credibility of the source on Friday. In a series of Tweets on the topic, the president wrote, among other things, that the "so-called Whistleblower" had distributed information from second hand, which would have turned out to be inappropriate.
As Trump said in New York about those who were supposed to have played the Whistleblower information, however, outraged. The president of the U.S. House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, responded with anxiety and lamented, Trump's statement once again undermined the integrity of the government.
In the House of Representatives, several committees have been conducting various investigations against Trump and his environment for months. In view of Ukraine’s accusations, the Democrats are now making new investigations in order to launch a possible investigation against Trump.
"The Whistleblower gave us a roadmap for our investigation," said the head of the Security Committee in the House of Representatives, Adam Schiff. Trump attacked ship sharply, threw him a false presentation of things and again called for the chairman of the Committee. Trump insulted ship regularly and had requested withdrawal months ago.
More than 300 former U.S. government officials from the security and external policy sphere, who were mostly working under democratic but also under republican presidents, went to a statement published on Friday to investigate possible administrative withdrawal procedures initiated by the Democrats. If the accusations were true, the "a sharp abuse of power" by Trump, said it.
There is no precise timetable for the further process. With its majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could try a so-called impeachment procedure. However, the decision on an actual withdrawal of office fell in the Senate, where Trump’s Republicans have the majority. Therefore, the prospects for success of such a procedure are small. So far, no US President has been removed by an impeachment procedure of the Office.
VW works council: jobs are reduced "slaughting"
The plans of the VW brand, in which production continues to reduce costs, could be at the expense of manufacturing in Germany and Europe. This concerns the Autobauer's works council. The brand wants to reduce its annual factory costs by EUR 10 billion by EUR 2 billion by 2023, of which EUR 500 million will be saved this year.
A key to this is the personnel costs. The "future Pact" negotiated between companies and works councils in 2016 already provides for the reduction of 14,000 jobs in Germany alone by 2020. In principle, a job can only be reduced by the automaker if it is demonstrated that the related activities are no longer necessary. In addition, employment insurance applies until 2029.
However, as our newspaper now learned from works councils, jobs in production, which are not actually for the disposition, are "slaughting" over a different route - that is, at the official course. Thus, free-coming regular posts would often not be re-occupied.
In these cases, the Works Council has no option to force the re-establishment. Meanwhile, in many places staff are failing to increase the work compression, the concerns about a gradual bleeding out of the vehicle plants would be greater. Thus, the fear that vehicle production could gradually be deducted from Germany and Europe, because it is more favourable in other parts of the world. VW said: "Adaptation of the volume of employment is done as agreed socially sustainable along the demographic curve".
The VW brand wants to further standardize production worldwide and centralize new projects. This will also reduce costs and accelerate decisions - the aim is to increase productivity and therefore competitiveness. Production Board Andreas Tostmann said at a manager conference in Berlin: "In uncertain times, we are well advised to make ourselves crisis-resistant in the face of unsecured trade war between the US and China."
In this way, there have already been successes: for example, production costs per vehicle would fall for the first time since 2013 compared to the previous year. Before journalists, Tostmann said that the production time for the golf 8 to be presented in Wolfsburg on 24 October would be reduced by 1.1 hours. Exact figures for the production period do not mention VW, according to information from our newspaper is at Golf 7
20 hours.
In our region, Wolfsburg is the only VW factory in which vehicles are produced. Braunschweig and Salzgitter-made components are manufactured. For Wolfsburg, VW-internal is the rule that 800,000 cars need to be built there every year to ensure that the plant is profitably profitable. In 2018, however, the utilization in Wolfsburg was only about 700,000 vehicles - due to the sinking diesel demand and the problems in converting to the new WLTP consumption and exhaust gas test process.
However, as Tostmann has announced last year, Wolfsburg's "perspective" team is expected to roll a million cars off the band. This is supposed to make it possible to merge the golf production in the main plant - because the Zwickau plant will deliver the golf production by refitting it to the site for e-auto production.
Furthermore, the SUV Tiguan and Tarraco (Seat) are produced in Wolfsburg. However, the sales figures of Golf and Tiguan have recently developed. Therefore, the expectations are now on the Gulf 8. Despite all efforts to build e-mobility, the Wolfsburger's bread and butter car is supposed to remain for the first time.
Forced to Prostitution with Voodoo: Human Merchants Condemned
Young women from Nigeria have been pushed into the Ruhr area and forced to prostitution. Six alleged traffickers have to go to prison for this.
Six alleged traffickers from Nigeria were sentenced to imprisonment and imprisonments of up to eight years and three months in Bochum on Friday. The defendants had thrown young women from Nigeria into the Ruhr and forced to prostitution. To force their obedience, the foreign Nigerian women still had to put a ritual in their homes in front of a voodoo priest.
The victims were between 17 and 22 years old. They were brought to the Mediterranean via the Mediterranean using Libyan sluices. However, the dream of a better future was not fulfilled. Arriving in Germany, they were distributed to various brothels to deal with the alleged sluice costs of an average of 25 000 euros.
The defendants - four men and two women - had admitted the inclusion and subsequent distribution of the young Nigerian women on Bordelle in the trial. "The work made women physically and psychologically difficult to create," said Richter Isabel Hoffmann at the verdict. "Some were rightly opposed."
The judgments are based on commercial and tiresome inclusion of foreigners, trafficking in human beings, detention and severe forced prostitution.
Ufo calls for negotiations with Lufthansa
FIm's ongoing dispute with the Lufthansa Group has once again threatened Ufo's flight attendants with strikes.
If the company does not return to the negotiating table, the trade union "will inform on 14 October about the labour struggle measures in the LH Group", informed Ufo-thenman Daniel Flohr on Friday. Lufthansa and her daughter Eurowings have refused to conduct collective bargaining with the UFO for months. This is also about whether the trade union has legally terminated collective agreements with Lufthansa.
In this regard, Ufo is now looking forward to a decision of the Frankfurt Labour Court. Lufthansa wanted to make it clear that the collective agreements were not terminated. The court rejected the applications. The company confirmed the decision and examined the appeal against it. "I think that a second court sees the matter quite differently," said Ufo-Chairman Flohr.
In August Lufthansa also filed an application at the Landes Arbeitsgericht Frankfurt to review Ufo’s status as a trade union. The company argued that the trade union had not set up a representative board for months and was therefore unable to complete its role as a collective partner.
Prior to this, a fierce leadership dispute in the divisional union, during which numerous members of the Board of Management and the Advisory Board had resigned, including long-standing trade union chief Nicoley Baublies. Ufo had, because of its doubts about its leadership, exposed a pre-started original vote on strike by the cabin staff at Eurowings at the end of July.
Easier entry: Saudi Arabia announces new visa system
Until now, Saudi Arabia has not been known as an international tourist magnet, but that is now to change. The country on the Persian Gulf wants to introduce new visas.
With a new visa system, Saudi Arabia will attract more international tourists in the future. By 2030, the Tourism Commission announced that the number of international and domestic visitors would increase to 100 million per year.
"The opening of Saudi Arabia to international tourists is a one-historical moment for our country," said the chairman of the Tourism Commission, Ahmad Al-Chatib.
Saudi Arabia is currently difficult to reach for tourists. Visas usually only become available for short business trips, religious pilgrimages or visitors with members of the desert state forgive. With the new rules, the ore conservative kingdom hopes more revenue from the tourism business. According to its own statement, Riad wants to reduce its dependence on oil trade.
In mid-September, several rockets and drones had hit two of the most important oil plants in the east of Saudi Arabia: the largest oil refinery in Abkaik, as well as the oil field of Churais. In the following, national oil production broke dramatically, oil prices to the height. It is expected to take several weeks until the kingdom’s oil production again reaches its old level.
Justin and Hailey Bieber put in preparation for wedding
Singer Justin Bieber (25) and his wife Hailey (22) are preparing for her wedding feast. On Thursday (local time) the model posted several party photos in her Instagram Stories, on which she can be seen in the white wedding look. Reality-Star Kendall Jenner (23) and others had organized a young girl's leave in Los Angeles according to the People magazine.
Justin posted several colorful suits printed with bananas on Instagram and asked his followers: "Helps me to choose my tuition for the wedding". According to media reports, the Promi-Paar wants to marry ecclesially on the following weekend.
A year ago, in a New York State Office, the beavers gave themselves the yes word. There was no larger festival at that time.
In an interview with the Australian Vogue, Hailey recently stated that the two had found a common level after initial problems: "If you don't want to compromise, you can't have a relationship."
Two dead in aircraft crash in the Czech Republic
Two people died in the crash of a small plane in the west of the Czech Republic. The wreck had been discovered on Friday in a forest area near the city of Mecin (Metzin) the police told us. The dead were a 38-year-old woman and a 64-year-old man.
The authorities had been looking for the machine since Thursday evening after the crew had issued an emergency signal via GPS. In the search a military helicopter was also in use. The accident cause still needs to be determined. The crash type is located about 30 kilometers south of Pilsen (plzen) and 100 kilometers northeast of Regensburg.
Half of the European tree species are threatened with extinction
In addition to pests, diseases, non-territorial species, non-sustainable logging and the growth of cities causes the threat, the World Nature Conservation Union IUCN reported on Friday in Brussels. It has examined the stocks of all 454 species known in Europe. 265 of them do not occur on any other continent. Of these 265, 58 percent were threatened. 66 were already at the highest level of danger and thus before extinction.
The IUCN divides endangered species into six categories: from "potentially endangered" via "hazard", "hazardly endangered", "at risk of extinction" and "decomposed in nature" to "decomposed".In total, it lists more than 28,000 species of animals and plants as endangered worldwide.
Ebercian and Wild Roskastanie Threatened
One of the authors, David Allen, the German Press Agency, said, "Most of them are threatened because the populations are anyway small or because of the transformation or weakening of their habitats".
It also looks bad for the wildly-popular Roskastans. They have been considered "hazarded" since 2017, level two of the IUCN scale. The biggest threat is the Balkan miner moth next to a mushroom. Since the 1980s, they have spread from south-eastern Europe across the continent and have hardly any natural enemies. IUCN estimates the number of wild Rosskastania (Aesculus hippocastanum) in Europe to less than 10,000 specimens. Not taking into account in this assessment are the trees in cities, parks and alone.
Shower species and moose also in danger
At the same time, IUCN scientists created new European red lists for molluscs, shrubs and moss. More than a fifth of molluscs and moss and nearly half of all shrubs are threatened, according to the IUCN. This was mainly due to the destruction of the wild, to introduced species, agricultural practices, and to climate change. molluscs such as snails played a key role in recycling nutrients in the soil and are an important source of food for birds and other animals.
"This report shows that the situation is precarious for many overlooked and underestimated species, species that form the backbone of the European ecosystem and contribute to a healthy planet," said Luc Bas, IUCN director of the Europe Bureau. "We must limit the human impact on our ecosystems and make the protection of these species a priority."
Earthquake prior to Istanbul: 34 injured reported
In the recent earthquake in Turkey, 34 people were injured. According to the information, dozens of people had to leave their homes, 14 schools in Istanbul had been closed for security reasons, said Turkish Vice President Fuat Octay on Friday.
Thus, hundreds of buildings were damaged. Since the earthquake the day before, there have been almost 200 earthquakes. On Thursday, the earthquake of strength 5.8 had shaken the Marmara region before Istanbul and caused panic in the millions of metropolis.
Now, the government is planning to set up a Commission to better prepare the country for earthquakes in the future, Octay announced. Turkey had not been prepared enough for earthquakes in the past 20 years, said Istanbul’s mayor Ekrem Imamoglu.
Istanbul is considered to be particularly endangered. Below the Marmara Sea lies a section of the so-called North Anatolic disorder that marks the boundary between the Eurasian and the Anatolian Earth plate.
One of the most severe earthquakes was one of the strongest 7.6 in 1999 near Istanbul. The epicenter was in Gölcük southeast of Istanbul at that time. More than 17 000 people were killed.
On Tuesday a earthquake of strength 4.6 had shaken the region around Istanbul. The authorities called the inhabitants to stay away from damaged buildings.
Super Bowl 2020: Jennifer Lopez (JLo) and Shakira perform in the mid-term show
The Latin-pop singers Jennifer Lopez and Shakira will present the mid-term show of the next American football final Super Bowl. This was announced by the singers at Twitter. "The greatest thing will not be," Shakira wrote for a photo of herself and Lopez. She is madly excited to be on the super bowl stage. On February 2, 2020, it will be ready in Miami.
Jennifer Lopez said that she had dreamed since 1996 of being on Super Bowl - at that time she saw Diana Ross flying in the sky at the mid-term show. "Now it is even more special because the NFL is 100 years existing and I will perform with another Latina". She could hardly expect to "show what we girls can do on the largest stage of the world."
Shakira pointed out in a statement that she felt honoured to stand on one of the largest stages in the world, representing Latinos and Latinas from the USA and the whole world. "And then on my birthday!" The main sponsor of the event wrote on Twitter that it is the first time that the two "kings" are on stage together.
Shakira is from Colombia. Jennifer Lopez was born in New York, her parents come from Puerto Rico.
Fight against sinking viewer numbers
The Super Bowl is the highlight of the American football season. The game and the half-time show are among the most popular TV transmissions in the USA. Even though you have recently dropped viewer numbers: This February, the spectacle in the USA attracted the least audience for more than ten years. Nevertheless, it was still almost a hundred million people on average.
In the run-up to the mid-term show of the last Super Bowl, there was an uproar: in the fight for the treatment of quarterback Colin Kaepernick last February, media reports said that top stars such as Rihanna, Pink and Cardi B did not appear. Finally, the pop group Maroon 5 led the mid-term show - the reviews were not very friendly.
Kaepernick, then quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers, was on his knees in the season 2016/17 before NFL games in the national anthem of protest against police violence and racism. With his protest, Kaepernick triggered a movement, many players took over the gesture. This caused great excitement, US President Donald Trump attacked the mostly afro-American football stars. Kaepernick himself has been unsolicited since March 2017 and has no more NFL parties. He accuses the clubs not to hire him for political reasons.
Cook route: Hotels get money from the insurance
According to a press report, some banks are likely to be expensive in terms of travel provider Thomas Cook’s staff. High depreciations are threatened with outstanding bonds and loans. The credit Suisse is also affected, writes the “Financial Times” in its issue of Friday.
Banks such as Barclays, Morgan Stanley, UniCredit or Credit Suisse would probably have to make a total depreciation of up to 1.8 billion pounds (about 2 billion euros) on their books, according to the report, which would have been estimated by the consulting firm AlixPartner.
The creditors of bonds would have to purchase depreciations from 900 million to 1 billion pounds and the creditors between 550 and 825 million pounds. The actual amounts to be written would be more likely to be at the top of the margins, said an expert on the sheet.
In the end, the losses of the creditors will show up after the expiry of the insolvency proceedings. One person close to this procedure did not have too much hope. For example, Thomas Cook’s 40 aircraft in the UK were "old" and many of the properties were in bad locations. Most of the money could be obtained with the sale of the airport slots as well as Thomas Cook brand, it was said.
Rackete is said to have brought suspected murderers to Italy
Sea Watch Captain Carola Rackete may have brought men to Italy who have tortured and killed people in Libya. "We cannot exclude this, but even have no secured information about it," said the spokesman of the refugee organization Sea-Watch, Ruben Neugebauer, the news agency dpa.
Other migrants would have recognized the three men in Italy. They were accused of raped, tortured and killed in Libya. The suspected perpetrators had been arrested in the reception camp in Messina. Neugebauer stressed that refugee organizations could not verify who they had left on their ships. "They come without passports."
On June 29, Carola Rickete had brought illegal migrants to the port of Lampedusa and had rammed a ship of the Italian financial police. On that day, the three suspects were also supposed to have arrived there, and investigations against the captain were under way for aid to illegal immigration.
USA warn Federal Government of Huawei
The head of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Ajit Pai, warned the Federal Government against trusting Huawei in the Chinese network equipment company.
We believe that the risks are too large," said Pai to the "Trade Sheet" in view of the construction of the new 5G mobile network.
China has a "national security law" which requires each company to follow instructions from the security bodies "under Chinese law".
The law in force also prohibits companies from informing third parties of such requests", continues the FCC CEO. This makes it very difficult to have confidence in the integrity of technical equipment and services.
The Federal Government has now agreed to demand from suppliers a "reliability declaration".
Berlin wants to try to control the risks, for example with technical solutions, reports the "handelsblatt" on its own information.
Pai doubts that this is possible. The 5G technology is not just from the hardware:
Especially the software is important to keep the devices up-to-date. This software consists of billions of lines of program code that change over time," said Pai.
It is "very difficult to imagine" that a government authority "whereever it would be able to check each single update in real time to detect security risks," continues the FCC chief.
The Chinese company Huawei has made close contacts with the Chinese state apparatus:
The property is opaque. The employee company, which is said to belong to the company, is not necessarily independent of the government," said Pai, the "trade sheet".
The US suggested that government employees should be placed within the company. Pai was recently for talks in Berlin to advertise for the US position.
Chemicals factory in Northern France burns: schools closed
At night residents hear explosions. A gigantic fire wall illuminates the sky over a northern French chemical factory. The fire is removed after hours - the cleaning work could now take days.
After a fire in a chemical factory in the north-eastern city of Rouen on Thursday, the schools and crèches in the region remain closed.
In twelve municipalities the facilities would not be opened carefully on Friday, the responsible prefecture told the public. The Ministry of the Interior had asked the citizens to stay in buildings as far as possible and not put themselves out of the smoke. There was no harm. Farmers and breeders were called on to bring their animals inside, to protect their food and to plant the harvest for the first time.
The fire could be completely erased on Thursday evening, as the prefecture reported. There is still a risk that after the extinguishing smell spread, so the prefecture on Twitter. According to the prefecture, 240 firemen and 90 policemen and gendarmen were in use at the fire site.
A giant black smoke column had risen from the chemical factory before. French media reported huge flames and explosions in the Lubrizol factory, which repairs additional oil resources. The production plant is located a few kilometers from the city centre.
The Normandy factory, according to the authorities, belongs to the so-called Seveso category of dangerous sites, which are particularly monitored. In the Italian Seveso at Milan, a devastating chemical accident occurred in 1976.
The prefect of the Normandie region, Pierre-André Durand, told the news station BFMTV that no "high toxicity" was initially found in samples. However, a pollution of the nearby Seine could not be excluded. In the river, dams had been built against pollution, explained the prefecture.
The fire broke out early in the morning at 0240 p.m., reported the authorities. The cause remained unclear at first. Rouen is a regional metropolis and lies on the Seine between Paris and the port city of Le Havre.
French Minister of Finance: "Germany must invest and now"
French Minister for Economic and Financial Affairs Bruno Le Maire has called on Germany to make major investments to stimulate economic growth in the euro area.
Germany must invest, and now, the better the earlier," said Le Maire on Thursday evening at the presentation of the French budget for the coming year.
The economy in the eurozone was weak, the minister warned.
We must not wait until the economic situation worsens to make the necessary decisions".
The countries that would have room for more investment would have to act, said Le Maire, among other things, with a view to Germany.
France did not have these spaces, the Minister added and referred to the high government debt of its country, which is more than 98 percent of the gross domestic product. The French government debt had to be "stabilised" and "reduced", said Le Maire.
Over the past few years, France has repeatedly called on Germany to make more public investments to stimulate the European economy. In return, German politicians have repeatedly called on France to tackle its budget deficit.
The French budget for 2020 presented on Thursday provides for tax reliefs of more than nine billion euros for households.
The French government is therefore responding, among other things, to the protests of the Yellowwest movement. New debt is expected to fall to 2.2 percent, expected 3.1 percent this year.
Does he still try to trick?: Johnson deviates question about Brexit tactics
British Prime Minister Johnson strongly criticises the "capitulation law" adopted by Parliament.
Parliament is back, a law tells the British Prime Minister to avoid chaos. However, critics fear that Boris Johnson could still use a loophole. However, on this occasion, the Tory politician differs.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson considers whether he wants to enforce an irregular Brexit - despite the last law adopted by Parliament, which should prevent this from happening. On a question of this, Johnson simply told journalists that his government would adhere to applicable law.
The law provides for the government to request a postponement of the date of withdrawal, should not have reached an agreement with the EU by mid-October. Johnson criticises this as a "capitulation law" which makes negotiations with the EU difficult.
On Thursday, former British Prime Minister John Major had said that Johnson could try to use "political shanks" in order to circumvent the law. The prime minister could use a procedural trick that would shift the entry into force of the law to the period after the EU withdrawal. Johnson said he was calling on a treaty with the European Union. "We are confident to leave the EU on 31 October, and the best way is by agreement".
Johnson's Chief Advisor Dominic Cummings said that he felt the political struggles about the Brexit as "the way out of the park" and was confident that the EU's desired exit would still be possible: "We enjoy it, we will win, we will leave (note: from the EU) no concern", said Cummings of the British newspaper "Telegraph" in a book presentation.
Cummings, who led the Brexit campaign "Vote Leave" in front of the 2016 EU referendum, is now the head of the British government seat downing Street. He is expected to be behind the uncompromising policy that led the premiere into a absolutely lost situation.
"The Polaroid Diaries" by Linda McCartney
Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan or Janis Joplin - they all stood in front of Linda McCartney's camera, which has become one of the very large rock photographers. But it doesn't always have to be the big glamour. The photo book "The Polaroid Diaries" (Doses) dives deep into the very private world of the McCartney family.
Paul McCartney, who was married to her from 1969 to Linda's death in 1998, was visibly proud and touched when he presented the book "The Polaroid Diaries" in mid-September at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. Among the illustrative guests were Ringo Starr, Stella McCartney, Olivia Harrison and Pretenders-Frontwoman Chrissie Hynde.
After the launch event, McCartney wrote to Instagram: "#ThePolaroidDiaries is a fleeting look into the life of an extraordinary family from before Instagram, a celebration to the legacy of LindaMcCartney as a dedicated artist and the immediatemagie of the Polaroid film".
At Linda McCartney, who studied art history at the University of Aizona until she found it for photography, the camera was always there. Thousands of Polaroids made it, some hundred of which are now released for the first time in "The Polaroid Diaries".
They are portraits, still life, landscapes, several hamsters, a sheep in the kitchen and other interiors from the early 1970s to the late 1990s. "She wanted real moments," writes the art critic Ekow Eshun in his foreword. And, of course, one is always in the center again: her husband Paul - as one may have never seen him before.
As he dances with his daughter Mary on his shoulders, he calls in the bathrobe with a bag on his head or wears unshaped moonboats. Sure, the McCartneys were an extraordinary family, but they also led a normal life beyond the headlight light on their farm in southern England or Scotland. According to BBC, Mary McCartney said she had slept as a baby in a bed that her father had crafted out of old potato boxes. And it hasn’t always been clean with the McCartneys.
Like hardly any other medium, the polaroid camera catchs the immediate moment. Linda McCartney’s recordings are certainly a kind of family diary, but they are much more than pure snapshots.
It's about the decision Click: You have to recognize if a great picture happens before you. And then you have to cut it at the exact right moment," said Paul McCartney. "If you get two seconds later or two seconds earlier, it can be a completely different photo." And Linda would have had the gift of getting the right moment at all times. "She just knew she had it," said Paul in the Eshun essay.
That's true of the light, the composition, the image-out and the colors, which makes "The Polaroid Diaries" not only an entertaining picture book for Beatles fans, but besides everything anecdotic is also a great aesthetic pleasure, where landscapes have been acting like abstract paintings.The perfect complement to the newly published Beatles album "Abbey Road", which appeared exactly 50 years ago.
"We will continue to buy oil and gas from Iran"
Despite the US sanctions imposed on Iran, Turkey wants to continue to import oil and gas from neighbouring countries. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in an interview published on Friday that Turkey could not stop its imports of oil and gas from Iran.
We will continue to buy our natural gas from there," said Erdogan in New York, where he participated at the UN General Assembly.
However, Erdogan admitted that Turkey had problems with imports of Iranian oil, as some companies had "reduced because of US threats".
Nevertheless, Turkey "will continue our relations with Iran in particular on this issue and on many other issues," said the Turkish President, who repeatedly criticised US sanctions against Iran in the past.
The United States has been pursuing a policy of "maximum pressure" towards the Islamic Republic since its exit from the international nuclear agreement with Iran. According to the United States, Iran is pursuing an nuclear programme in secret and does not comply with the agreement.
Their sanctions have led to the collapse of Iranian oil exports and a severe economic crisis in Iran, and over the last few months the tensions in the Gulf region have increased considerably.
US government wants to restrict reception of refugees
The US government is trying to drastically restrict the reception of refugees. On Thursday, the US Department of Foreign Affairs declared that the annual ceiling of a resettlement programme should be reduced from currently 30,000 to 18,000 refugees, corresponding to a 40 percent reduction.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that while the US would continue to see the support of refugees, the main task was to protect and serve US citizens, currently the US immigration system was overburdened.
In the future, the US government intends to focus on the inclusion of two refugee groups: people persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the US military in the country and are thus at risk as the declaration of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs shows. A maximum of 1500 refugees are to be received from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador.
The 1980 programme will be used to select refugees from UN camps around the world and relocate them to the US. The ceiling of 18,000 refugees for the 2020 budget year would be the lowest in the history of the program. Already the current ceiling of 30,000 is a low level. As the predecessor of US President Donald Trump, Barack Obama, the White House, the number was about 85,000.
Aid organisations responded horrifiedly to the announced reduction of the ceiling. "This is a very sad day for America," said the head of the International Rescue Committee, David Miliband. USA would continue to damage its leadership role in protecting the most vulnerable people in the world.
Trump is trying to strictly limit immigration to the United States - legally and illegally - and according to his own figures, the U.S. government expects 350,000 asylum applications for the next budget year. These figures are separate from the resettlement programme.
Donald Trump - "Come to a Spittle"
U.S. President Donald Trump has called for notice in the Whistleblower affair of espionage. Whoever has always given the informant who accuses him of abuse of power, "is approaching a summit," said Trump, according to a recording of a private event in New York on Thursday. This is reported by several U.S. media.
After that, Trump spoke before U.S. employees. When he was asked about the person who informed the Whistleblower about controversial operations in the White House, he replied, "It's coming close to the top." Trump added, "Do you know what we did in old times when we were smart? Right. The spies and betrayal, we used to deal with it a little differently than we do now".
The last observation to a possible charge of the death penalty was that the Democrats had strong criticism of Trump’s statements and intimidation of witnesses. Furthermore, it was an attempt to hinder a congress investigation against him in a possible investigation of his office, wrote the chairmen of the committees for foreign affairs, secret services and supervision in the House of Representatives.
The Whistleblower accuses the President in a complaint which has now been published to misuse his office in order to ask for a interference of another country into the U.S. election 2020. In concrete terms, it is about his controversial telephone call with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Selenskyj in summer: In the conversation Trump encouraged him to initiate investigations against his possible democratic challengeer Joe Biden and his son Hunter in Ukraine. Trump contests any misconduct.
It is still unclear who are both the Whistleblower itself and its informants. However, as reported in the New York Times, the Whistleblower is supposed to be an analyst of the CIA foreign intelligence service.
Refugee boat known: Baby and young children drown in Aegean
Time and again, people try to get over the Aegean Sea from Turkey to Greece. The often too small boats are often known. Seven migrants have now died during the downfall of a slugboat - including five children.
In front of the Greek island of Chios, seven migrants were killed in the downfall of a boat. Among the death victims were also a baby as well as four other children, reported the Greek Coast Guard. Four children, three women and five men could thus be saved from the floods of a passing ferry.
Among the victims is also a locker, reported the local news portal of Chios, Alithia.gr. The migrants had broken up from Turkey in the morning. They had tried to reach the small island group Inouss in the northeast of the island of Chios. Inousses lies between Chios and the Turkish mainland.
The countries from which migrants come are not yet known. At present hundreds of migrants from Turkey are transferring to the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean, mostly in far too small boats. Last year, according to the United Nations Refugee Help Force (UNHCR), 174 people were killed on this route.
The Who Stops Concert
A U.S. concert of the rock band The Who has found a tough end because of an inconsistency of lead singer Roger Daltrey. In the middle of the show on Wednesday evening (local time) in Houston his voice failed. At the eighth song Daltrey told the audience: "I think I should leave it as long as it is still running."
Lead guitarist Pete Townsend asked for an apology and added that Daltrey could "not speak at all". Townsend promised to come to his expense at a reparation concert, but an appointment is not yet fixed.
For Friday in Dallas and Sunday in Denver planned performances said The Who. They should be picked up at a later time. The 75-year-old Daltrey and his 74-year-old bandmate Townsend are the only remaining founding members. The British cult band formed 55 years ago.
Suddenly leased: WeWork allows real estate markets to sit down
In New York, weWork has risen to become the largest office rental company.
Within a few years, from a small start-up, weWork rises to the driving force on the most expensive real estate markets in the world. But now the company is in the crisis. Owners have to fear billions of revenue.
The crisis of the office rental company WeWork threatens to disrupt the balance on the world's largest real estate markets. The company had set off founder Adam Neumann as the head of the stock exchange a few days ago, moved the planned stock exchange and started selling subsidiaries and assets such as the private jet for the executives to win financial space for the coming weeks and months. Furthermore, the British Financial Times, WeWork, among other things, reported the conclusion of new rents with immediate effect. Thus, in New York and London, the biggest tenants of office space suddenly get out of the market.
WeWork rents large office spaces in the long term and rents them in part small units of members in the short term. This can be individual freelancers, small startups or entire departments of large corporations. So far, weWork burns money at breathtaking speed with this business. Last year, the company went down a loss of 1.6 billion dollars, with sales of 1.8 billion dollars. This year alone, the rental costs of new large areas are expected to have increased to an estimated 2.5 billion dollars. To limit the loss, the new corporate management is now supposed to have hit the emergency brake and stopped renting new areas with immediate effect.
According to the "Financial Times", weWork has now concluded leases with periods of up to 15 years, of which more than 40 billion dollars are committed. These huge liabilities could not only become a problem for the company itself and its investors, but for entire real estate markets.
According to calculations by the economist Dan Alpert from Cornell Law School in New York, WeWork rented in Manhattan, one of the most expensive real estate markets in the world, in the past 24 months nearly 300,000 square meters of office space. WeWork’s new contracts alone made sure that the demand for offices in New York was greater than the new areas that had come to the market at that time. Without WeWork’s expansion, the office emptying in the U.S. metropolis would have increased at this time, as Alpert wrote in the "Business Insider".
Even in the UK capital, the balance in the real estate market could be shifted significantly without further expansion of aggressive startups. Among other things, weWork is the main tenant, in a last year bought by the savings bank fund provider Deka for almost 100 million euros in the center of the financial metropolis.
Many landlords have converted their properties for the requirements of WeWork with high investments. If WeWork fails to make its business model profitable soon, the property owners would probably have to write down some of the expected billions of revenue. Access to the - anyway scarce - reserves of WeWork they do not have despite long-term leases. Because the rental of the individual locations of WeWork is usually done by additional subsidiary companies, so-called special purpose vehicles, for which the parent company is only liable in tight limits.
Russia again arrested numerous North Korean fishermen
The Russian Coast Guard has again been against North Korean fishermen. A total of 262 wilders who had been illegally fishing in the waters had been arrested in the past few days, according to the Russian Domestic Secret Service FSB, announced to the Interfax agency on Friday.
It was only ten days ago that 161 fishermen from North Korea were arrested. Previously, the border guards had been shot and three were injured by them. This time there were no injured people, it was said. Communist North Korea suffers from chronic food shortage.
The North Korean fishermen were therefore on their way to Russian territorial waters, where the Russian Coast Guard, according to its own information, is driving patrols to protect its marine biological resources. In the course of the re-checks, 30,000 squids were discovered. In addition, the data were seized after three fishing and two motor boats and taken to Naodka and Posjet at Vladivostok. According to the agency Ria Novosti, the 2018 Coast Guard Guard identified a total of more than 8,000 infringements.
The Russian Fisheries Authority had not issued any fishing licences to the North Koreans this year, even after the complaints of local entrepreneurs. According to the media, thousands of fishermen from North Korea had already been arrested there in 2019.
The head of the association of Russian fishing companies in the Far East region of Primorje, Georgi Martynow, recently also complained of high ecological damage caused by North Korean fishermen. They fished with narrow synthetic nets banned in Russia. With them also small creatures would be taken out of the sea. In addition, the nets would simply be disposed of in the sea where they needed 200 years to be destroyed. Also, the ships themselves do not comply with the hygienic and technical regulations.
Three members of the Russian Coast Guard were injured during the arrests in the week before. According to the FSB, a wounded North Korean died later in his injuries. On that September 17th, Russian border guards first arrested a North Korean boat and then a second after it opened the fire.
United States impose a ban on entry for ex-President Castro
The US has imposed on the former Cuban President Raúl Castro and his children entry bans. The American Foreign Ministry justified this in a communication on Thursday with Castro's participation in "groben human rights violations". As head of the Communist Party of the Caribbean state, he is facing a system in which thousands of Cubans would be arrested arbitrarily and there were more than 100 political prisoners.
As chairman of the armed forces, the brother of the dead revolutionary leader Fidel Castro was also accused of human rights violations there by supporting the President Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro. "The disregard for human rights and the use of violence by the Cuban regime to support the former Maduro regime is responsible for the ongoing crises in Cuba and Venezuela," said American foreign minister Mike Pompeo.
On Wednesday, President Donald Trump had issued a ban on entry, among others, against members of the Venezuelan government and the military. In Venezuela, for months a bitter struggle of power between the government and the opposition has died. The United States imposed a whole series of sanctions against Maduro’s government to force him into the knees and to help the opposition leader and self-appointed interim president Juan Guaidó.
Cuba is considered to be one of the closest allies of Maduro. The socialist Caribbean island receives oil from Venezuela in exchange for the services of sent doctors. According to the U.S. and Venezuelan opposition, Cuba has also sent numerous intelligence agents to Venezuela to help the government to suppress government opponents.
New Climate Protests by Fridays for Future
One week after the biggest international climate protests, today thousands of people want to go on the road again for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement plans again to take action and rallying in dozens of countries around the world. Due to the time shift, New Zealand and Australia are expected to begin, before the protests are taking place across Europe to North America. Climate activist Greta Thunberg wanted to participate in a large rally in Montreal, Canada. Demonstrants also wanted to gather in front of the White House in Washington.
How great the global appeal this Friday will be after the record participation of the previous week is relatively unclear. Thunberg himself was good things. "Last Friday more than four million people have spread for the climate. This Friday we will do it again!" she wrote on Twitter. So far, during the strike week 6383 actions in 170 countries, she added.
A good third of all worldwide demonstrators - around 1.4 million - had participated in the protests in 575 German cities, according to estimates by Fridays for Future. This time, a list of the movement is planned to be held in at least 65 cities. These include cities such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, as well as smaller communities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland on Sylt, who want to see the people go to the streets for the climate.
At the age of 15 in August 2018, Thunberg had put himself in front of the Swedish Parliament to ask the politicians of her country for a stronger commitment to climate protection. This was the result of the Fridays-for-Future movement within a short time. The climate protests mainly involve students and students, but increasingly also scientists and other adults.
Together, they call for more ambition from politics in the fight against global warming and the threatening climate disaster. In particular, according to the Paris climate agreement, global warming had to be reduced to less than 1.5 degrees compared to the pre-industrial period.
Thunberg arrived in New York just a month ago after a two-week Transatlantic Tower, where she had recently participated in climate protests and summits of the United Nations. On Monday she gave an emotional speech to the UN, in which she spoke in an inquiring way to the heads of state and government of the earth. In her home country Stockholm, she had been assigned to her work for more climate protection of the Alternative Nobel Prize of the Right Livelihood Foundation on Wednesday.
Russia forbids smoking on the balcony
In the future, people in Russia are not allowed to smoke on the balcony. This means a change in fire protection. "This also applies to smoking," said a spokesman from the Ministry of Emergency on Thursday in Moscow, the Agency Tass. The ban will enter into force on 1 October.
Those who smoke must therefore expect a fine of 3,000 rubles (€42.46). If the cigarette should light a fire, then the penalty will be higher. According to the Ministry, burning candles fall under the ban. Also, to grill meat pieces on the balcony is no longer permitted.
Hit against cybercriminal - Investigators Remove Server
In the fight against crimes on the Internet, German investigators have for the first time launched a large server provider for illegal business in the Darknet.
A total of 13 perpetrators are suspected of having hosted numerous websites through the internationally operating criminals in a former NATO bunker in Traben-Trarbach on the Mosel.
This was reported by the General Prosecution in Koblenz. Seven suspects were arrested on Thursday evening in a major action. The Darknet is a shielded part of the Internet.
The clients of the suspects are said to have been the operators of the world's second largest Darknet market for drugs, "Wall Street Market" - the investigators had broken down in spring. The attack on 1.25 million Telekom routers At the end of November 2016, according to the public prosecutor's office, was controlled by a server in Cyberbunker.
Such a host was removed in Germany for the first time, it was said. A webhost provides the infrastructure for an Internet presence.
The access action with the support of special units such as the GSG9 has had searches in Germany and abroad. It has been the result of almost five years of investigations. At noon, the investigators want to inform about more details.
New global climate protests from Fridays for Future
One week after the biggest international climate protests today, thousands of people want to go on the streets for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement planned again actions and rallys in dozens of countries around the world.
In Germany, protests are planned in at least 65 cities, including in metropolitan cities such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, as well as in smaller communities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland on Sylt. Climate activist Greta Thunberg wants to participate in a major demonstration in the Canadian Montreal.
Climate protests Who are actually Thunberg's backmen?
Justice sense and courage are high virtues, even in the 21st century, in a world full of war and smoke factories that warm the climate. All the more amazing that a 16-year-old girl keeps the power of this time in front of the mirror. But what is behind it? Is it helpful or clever marketing of a climate activist? Historical master performance or manipulative tactics for his own sake?
On the one hand, Greta Thunberg is putting the masses in motion and is bringing young people up for a better climate-friendly world. It is historically not the first time in Europe that a young person is able to win a collection of children and young people for himself. Already in 1212, a child named Nikolaus from Cologne felt chosen to work for a fairer world. At that time, he has also been able to win a host of young people for himself and persuades them to cross the sea to get to the praised land, similar to Greta Thunberg has recently made his way to America with a sailboat.
But is there a shadow side in this regard? Why does it need a share called "We don't have time" to save the world? In addition, Greta Thunberg has rich PR managers at her side. By the way, her mother has published a book that has sold itself widely, thanks to the daughter in the skylight. Even old-fashioned followers of Greta Thunberg were a little disarmed over the last PR show, or the trip with the boat was probably too thick. This is not unfounded, because the action was very valid in the media worldwide and it flows much money thanks to the imposing action.
Here, the spirits now divorce: Is it morally right to enrich themselves financially in the ration of the world? Is it still authentic if certain groups of people work together with stockbrokers during the world rescue campaign? No matter what position is ultimately involved, a critical and reflected viewpoint is increasingly important in a democratically shaped society, because democracy lives on various opinions and discussions. Therefore, it may well make sense also to critically question some of the projects of certain trends.
Comet discovered: Interstellar guest crossed by our solar system
A strange comet is crossing our solar system right now.
The astronomers' assumptions have confirmed themselves: a strange comet is crossing our solar system at the moment - it is the second of its kind.
Garching/Washington - Long, the researchers have only suspected it, but now they have certainty: a comet of another star crosses our solar system at the moment. He was baptized after his discoverer 2I/Borisov and is currently working worldwide astronomers.
2I/Borisov: Comet discovered by amateur astronomers in Crimea
The said body was discovered by an amateur astronomer named Gennadi Borissov in Crimea. He looked with a self-built telescope to heaven and other observations confirmed his first suspicion. It is actually an unknown comet that does not come from our solar system. It is only the second of its kind that was seen during the flight.
The great opportunity for astronomers is now to catch up with insights into a foreign solar system from the vicinity. Apparently, the Comet is similar to our own system, as the astrophysical institute of the Canary Islands reports. According to the International Astronomics Union (IAC), the comet is clearly interstellar and is currently moving on a so-called hyperbole track that leads it out of our system.
Comet has been seen before approach - and can be observed for several months
But before it is so far, astronomers can observe it in detail. In contrast to its predecessor, 2I/Borisov has already been seen in his approach, which means that he can be examined from Earth for many months. "The object will reach the greatest brightness in mid-December and then be seen with medium-sized telescopes until April 2020," explains Davide Farnocchia from the US space travel agency Nasa. "By October 2020, it will only be observed with larger, professional telescopes."
The predecessor of the new visitor: 1I/2017 U1 "Oumuamua".
First findings about Comet 2I/Borisov raise hopes in science
According to the first findings, the comet is estimated at 2 to 16 kilometres in diameter. At the same time, the celestial body seems to be similar to our comets - as IAC researcher Julia de León expresses it, the spectrum of the tail star is similar to ours. This observation suggests that comets in other solar systems could form through similar processes as in our, added de León's colleague Javier Licandro.
The observation, however, goes beyond individual knowledge. That two such objects have been discovered within just two years, may allow a new way to explore certain processes in other solar systems.
Time and again asteroids employ the researchers. It was only recently that a giant asteroid passed the earth and was dangerously close to her.
"Absolutely puzzling": Rachel Johnson startled over brother
To Boris Johnson it becomes more lonely. Only his younger brother leaves the Cabinet, his sister now scoffs in clear words the military language of the prime minister as "flavourless". It is not the brother she knows.
"Capitulation", "Betrog", contract": Prime Minister Boris Johnson is under pressure and is constantly preparing - at least verbally. At Question Time in the House of Commons this Wednesday, this was due to massive outrage of the opposition, and now more critics have reported themselves: dozens of bishops and his own sister Rachel Johnson.
The well-known journalist and author told Sky News, her brother uses words such as capitulation as if the opponents of an EU exit should be "hanged, lengthened, divided, tarred, and feathered". She considers this to be extremely objectionable. She does not recognize the version of her brother again, said Rachel Johnsons, who took part in the elections to the EU Parliament for the Anti-Brexit Party "Change UK".
In particular, she insisted that her brother Jo Cox mentioned an EU-friendly sub-houseman who had been murdered by a neonazi a few days before the exit referendum in 2016. The memory of her brother Jo Cox could best be honored by going through the Brexit, Boris Johnson had said in the House. "It is very tasteless to refer to a MP who was murdered by someone who called 'Britain first'," now criticized Johnson's sister. The perpetrator was obviously from the far right camp who felt "through this kind of language". For all who mourned her, it was very tasteless.
The widower of Cox also strongly criticized the Prime Minister. "It makes me sick if Jo's name is used in this way," he thundered. The best way to honor them is if you passionately and decisively stand up for what you believe - no matter what opinion you are. But you should never "dmonise the other side". He also complained that an atmosphere was created, in which attacks had become more probable.
Only a few weeks ago, Boris Johnson, younger brother Jo, had laid down his office as Secretary of State and his mandate as Tory Member. "I had been torn apart in recent months between loyalty to the family and the national interest - it is an indissolubly tension," Jo Johnson explained the step.
Johnson’s language also met with strong criticism in the Church. As the "Times" reported, all 118 bishops and archbishops of the Church of England criticise the language that is "not worthy of this country". In a joint statement they explained: "In the past days, the language has not been acceptable, both in debates and outside Parliament. We should speak with respect to each other".
Shakira and Jennifer Lopez perform at the Super Bowl
The NFL is a strong sign in the year of its 100th anniversary: Two women with Latino roots will appear in the mid-term show of the upcoming Super Bowl. They promise "an explosion of fun and energy".
Latina-Power at Super Bowl: The Superstars Shakira (42) and Jennifer Lopez (50) will deliver the mid-term show at the upcoming finals of the U.S. football league NFL. This was announced by the organisers on Thursday (local time).
"I feel incredibly honored and humble to represent the Latino community in addition to JLo, because it has an incredible strength in the USA," Shakira said in a video.
The final of the American football league, which celebrates its 100th birthday next year, will be held in Miami on February 2. In the metropolis at the southern tip of Florida, many people live with Latin American roots. Shakira ("Waka Waka") comes from Colombia, Lopez ("On the Floor") is Puerto Rican origin.
"I love the Super Bowl setting two women on stage this time - and two Latinas," said Lopez. This sent an important message to all Americans and the world. She promises for the show "an explosion of fun and energy".
The 50-year-old was born in New York after her parents emigrated from Puerto Rico. In the 2000s she landed with songs like "Waiting For Tonight" or "Let's Get Loud" big hits and later released songs in Spanish. Lopez also works as an actress and is on display in German cinemas from November onwards in the drama "Hustlers".
Shakira became a star of a telenovela and singer in Colombia. In 2001 she made her breakthrough worldwide with her first bilingual album and the single "Whenever, Weather".
The announcement of half-time guests in the US is expected every time. This year many also value the choice as a political gesture. Finally, the country, not least by the immigration policy of President Donald Trump, is deeply divided.
The Super Bowl is the biggest US sports event and at the same time a huge advertising spectacle. Musicians such as Justin Timberlake, Beyoncé, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Madonna, Bruno Mars and the Rolling Stones made sure that there were fires. Usually, the NFL finals are far over 100 million television viewers, and it is also extremely popular in Germany.
Last year, there was political controversy. The reason was the dispute over the quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who had refused to protest against blacks in protest, to rise when the national anthem was played and for this, among other things, had been fought hard by US President Donald Trump. Out of solidarity with Kaepernick, some musicians had rejected a super bowl performance - including Rihanna and Pink. The fact that the Maroon 5 rock group was finally criticised by many.
An actor and Youtuber uses Egypt's ruler: But for the first time, Mohamed Ali prefers to stay abroad.
The two men who have an influence on whether blood flows on the streets of Egypt have spent the last week both abroad. One of the two floated again at Cairo Airport on Friday. President Abdelfattah al-Sisi returned from the UN General Assembly. The ex-General, who had abandoned the Muslim brother Mohammed Mursi, the first freely elected head of state of the country, had spent a pleasant time in New York: US President Donald Trump had praised Sisis' action against political Islam and had not lost a syllable over human rights violations at the Nile - in a week in which Egypt's security forces arrested hundreds of people because they had dared to protest against the president. He had "no reason to worry", said Sisi at the airport in the microphones of state television. "The Egyptians are not being led to the error."
The president of the other man, who is currently setting the events on the streets, is trying to get to the wrong point. Mohamed Ali, of course, remained abroad, where he was deprived of the access of the security forces who would immediately arrest him if he tried to enter Egyptian soil. He was known as a minority of the Egyptians by the 45-year-old as an actor. Today, he is the leading voice that dominates the political discourse in the cafés, living rooms and teashouses of the country: With his Youtube channel "Mohamed's Secrets", Ali calls his countrymen to stand up against Sisi.
He goes to the head of state directly and in quite rustic language. While the people are starving, the president is anxious in luxury and lets himself build magnificent new palaces, it is said. The army leadership, on which Sisi is based, throws up corruption and enrichment. Because in his second job as a construction contractor, he has been doing business with exactly these gentlemen for 15 years, he seems to know quite exactly what he is talking about - at least this is the impression of many Egyptians, as the straight-to-exploding click numbers show.
After nearly 2,000 citizens, among them prominent figures of civil society, human rights lawyers and opposition politicians, had been arrested for the first time since Sisis's arrest after the power of thousands against his rule, Ali called for a "million march" for this Friday. But there was no chance that so many people would dare on the streets. But there were small protests, for example in Giseh near Cairo as well as in the town of Kina near Luxor. Videos in social media showed protests whose participants proposed corruption and demanded his departure. In these protests, the police also started to use tear gas and rubber shots. These videos were not independently verified at first. From security circles, the police said the protests had ended.
From the city of Mansura in Nildelta, where demonstrators last week torn banners into pieces with the portrait of the president, on Friday massive police presence was reported. Security forces built checkpoints in the city and on the outposts. In Cairo several underground stations in the city centre were closed because of "remaining work", most roads around Tahrirplatz, the heart of the revolution of 2011 were blocked. And on the Rabaa Square, on which in 2013 followers of the fallen Muslim brother Mursi had been instigated until the army took them under fire and killed up to 800 people, another measure should prevent dissatisfied: Sisis Zukunftsparte wanted to hold here a large demonstration for the president.
Mohamed Ali made these arrangements to change his tactics: "Our goal doesn't have to be the Tahrir square," Ali said in his video camera in Barcelona. "Don't let us meet with police officers." But as a retreater, this is not to understand: "All Egypt is Tahrirplatz".
If the provider promises too much performance
The Internet connection seems always much slower than advertised by the provider, there are various testing possibilities.
Those who conclude an Internet contract do not need to be blindly confident of the speed data of the providers. Customers can check for how much of it is actually achieved in the event of conspicuities.
Finally, the pre-promised transfer rates are a contractual element and should therefore be achieved, explains the Consumer Centre Bayern.
The connection seems to be much slower than applied for by the provider, there are various testing possibilities. Thus, the measuring tools of the Federal Network Agency (BNetzA) measure the actual data transfer rates and compare them with the rate agreed in the contract.
"However, the tests of the suppliers are carried out in accordance with provider-specific requirements and are therefore not uniform and objectively calculated," the Consumer Center of Bavaria recalls on its side.
If the connection is much slower than announced, customers can set a reasonable period of 14 days for the supplier to make the promised performance. This is best done in writing by subscription.
Even after multiple calls, customers can cancel and in some cases also claim damages. However, in the event of outstanding success, only the claim path will help.
First senior Republican for investigation
As the first senior Republican, the Governor of Vermont has expressed his support for an impeachment investigation against US President Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important, yes, and where this is carried out from here, is determined by the facts found," said Phil Scott at a press conference on Thursday. He wants to know more about the Whistleblower affair before measures - an impeachment procedure can lead to the suspension of the President.
Scott said that he was not surprised by revelations that Trump had repeatedly asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyj in a telephone call to investigate interventions by the democratic candidate and former vice-president Joe Biden in Ukraine, because Trump observed bids "since many years".
Republicans have held back so far with criticism of Trump because of the Whistleblower affair; few have shown discomfort for this. Scott’s statements are the first sign of this in Trump’s party. Scott, a moderate Republican, has already opposed Trump’s policies several times, such as the relaxation of environmental protection rules and the strengthening of immigration rules.
Spider-Man stays in the MCU: Marvel-Film is also planned
It was a shock for all Spider-Man fans: at the end of August it was known that Sony and Marvel will go separate paths in the future. Tom Holland’s Spider-Man would therefore no longer be part of the "Avengers" universe. It was absolutely unclear as the films around Tom Holland should continue.
Now the surprise: Spider-Man receives another final third film within the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) after "Spider-Man: Homecoming" and "Spider-Man: Far From Home". That's what several U.S. media say. Therefore, the movie is supposed to be the beginning of the film: the film will start in the USA from 16 July 2021.
In the magazine "Screenrant", Marvel-Boos Kevin Feige is quoted: "I am pleased that Spidery's way is continued in the MCU. I and all of the Marvel-Studios are delighted that we can continue to work on it ... He is the only superhero with the ability to play in different universes, because Sony continues to work on his Spidery version. You never know what the future will bring."
But what about the sudden good news? It is said that Sony Marvel has submitted an offer. According to industry magazines, the company Disney, which also belongs to Marvel, would participate with 30 percent in the revenue of upcoming Spider-Man films. However, the message is not confirmed.
This is how Duchess Meghan and Prince Harry appear in the "Suits" finale.
After nine seasons, the series "Suits" has now reached the big finals in the US. In the last episode there were many Happy Ends and as many Cameo performances. And also the royal couple Prince Harry (35) and his Meghan (38), who participated for many years in the series, was brought into trial in a charming way. Attention, the following sections contain spoilers to the series finale.
One way forward: Herzogin Meghan did not return in the finale for a final farewell greeting as Rachel Zane, at least not for new scenes. Instead, some of the most memorable scenes with today’s Duchess once again showed him the moments of the failed and the successful wedding with Mike or how she welcomed him after his dead imprisonment.
But her real husband, Prince Harry, was mentioned in the "Suits" finale, naturally in a wedding scene. When Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman, 49) is walking straight toward the altar to marry his fiancée Sheila (Rachael Harris, 51), Harvey Specter (Gabriel Power, 47) makes a promising remark about his suit. Whether he has actually overturned a walking skirt, the polluted Harvey of the groom wants to know only to say, "Louis, you are not the Prince of England".
ägäis: Baby and four more children drown in boat accidents
A baby and four other children were drowned at the kentern of a refugee boat in the Aegean. A total of seven people died in the accident, as reported by the Greek Coast Guard on Friday. Nationalities were still unclear.
The boat sank near the Greek island of Inousses, which lies between the island of Chios and the Turkish mainland. Four children, three women and five men could be saved.
Hundreds of migrants from Turkey are currently passing over to the Greek islands in the eastern Aegean. Last year, according to the United Nations Refugee Help Force (UNHCR), 174 people were killed. Federal Minister Horst Seehofer has now announced his intention to visit both countries.
Together with his French colleague and the competent Commissioner for the EU, he wants to "information himself in Turkey about the refugee situation," said Seehofer on Friday. He then wants to learn more about the "administrative problems of the Greeks" in Athens in order to help cope.
On Friday, a spokesperson of the EU Commission confirmed the planned journey of Seehofers with EU Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos and France's Interior Minister Christophe Castaner.
In Greece there are still unusually many migrants from Turkey. On Tuesday alone, 654 people transferred to the Greek islands, said the Greek Civil Protection Ministry on Wednesday.
Does the deal of Turkey still work?
The increased figures have raised doubts about the operation of the EU-Turkey Agreement concluded in 2016, which provides for the EU to send back all refugees and migrants illegally entering the Greek islands through Turkey. In return, the EU wanted to start a Syrian refugee from Turkey for every Syrian who had been expelled.
However, the processing of asylum applications is only arduous on the Greek side because of lack of staff. According to the Ministry of Citizens’ Protection, Lesbos, Chios, Samos, Leros and Kos, almost 29 400 people are on the list. The worst is the situation on Lesbos: 5200 migrants are currently accommodated in a camp with capacity for 650 people.
Since the entry into force of the EU-Turkey Refugee Pact in March 2016, it has never been so many, reported the state radio.
Climate change: heat leads to more heart attack
According to medical doctors, climate change will test the health system in the future. Climate change is "very safe" one of the biggest challenges for the health system in the next 20 to 50 years, said Andreas Zeiher, President of the German Society for Cardiology. Especially the cardiovascular system made high temperatures and high temperature jumps to create within a short period of time and led to heart attacks. Especially people with cardiovascular diseases, elderly people and diabetics are affected.
Green politician must answer for embarrassing photopane
The head of the Canadian Greens, Elizabeth May, in the campaign - was manipulated for this reason?
The Canadian Green Chefin holds a multi-way cup in the hand in a photo. But now it came out: the cup was manipulated.
Ottawa/Canada - It has not been noticed for quite a long time - and finally it was noticed. Elizabeth May, the head of the Canadian Greens, has never held the reusable coffee cup with metal straw. On the party’s website she was on a photo with this cup to see, in conversation with citizens. However, the photo had already been published before and was also distributed to the media - and there was a beaker (papp) cup as the Canadian National Post reported.
Green Chefin must be responsible for photopane
The National Post then accused May of manipulation and that the party produces Fake News to appear more credible on the topic of "environmental protection". And that in the middle of a campaign for the Unterhaus election, in which Trudeau has become increasingly difficult because of bribery scandal.
The photo was viral in the social media and attracted the discussion of Fake News. A user shares a comparison of the photos and writes: "The Greens manipulate a photo of their chairmen in order to hide their one-way cup".
May showed up shocked, and on her blog, she knew nothing about this action. To underline this, she immediately posted the original: she, in conversation with citizens, put a cup in her hand. However, she put it right, she was from bamboo. She always had it with her. A spokesperson of the party said it was just about putting the party logo in the picture, and not hiding something. From the photo on the website is only a cut-out to see.
May writes, her suffering for the employee who did this is done. "I don't want to call him stupid, but there was nothing to hide," she said to the Guardian and at the same time asked her team: "If they want to work a picture again, couldn't they do something with my face, so I look younger?"
The German Greens have also been found in Shitstorms because of their use of one-way plastic or air travel. However, her pictures were not photographed. Thus, the head of Bavarian Greens, Katharina Schulze, ate ice with plastic spoons on vacation, as Merkur.de* reported.
Influencerin wants free upgrade: Lifelong flight ban at Cathay
It is said that Jaqueline Ng was secured an upgrade by the mail of Cathay Pacific. But when she asked her to check-in, she was not allowed on board - and she should never be allowed to fly with Cathay again.
Spontan get an upgrade for the Business Class - of which many passengers are dreaming. Sometimes they are lucky, and the staff at the check-in offer a free change from the Economy Class.
This case, however, shows how you should not do it: A self-explained influencer has actively asked the airline Cathay Pacific for a free upgrade. Follow on Instagram Jaqueline Ng more than 65,000 users. On May 30, she flew back from Taiwan to New York and June 7th.
On the way out, Jaqueline employees refused an upgrade, although she had shown an email in which their Cathay Pacific was supposed to offer an upgrade. The letter wants the influencer to have received from an airline marketing employee. The airline, on the other hand, accuses Jaqueline of having faked the mail.
On the return flight, Jaqueline once again tried to get an upgrade for the long-haul flight. This time the woman should have shown the same mail, but with another reference number. The JFK airport staff were skeptical: they stopped at the headquarters. And actually, the employee from whom the mail was supposed to have rejected the mail contact with Jaqueline. This also confirmed the mail system in which the messages did not show up.
The airline staff at the airport canceled Jaquelines ticket and imposed a lifelong flight ban with Cathay Pacific. For $1,400 (about $1,280) she had to buy a new flight ticket to Taiwan.
With her case, the influencer turned to Elliot Advocatecacy, a company that represents consumer interests, because Cathay had paid her the price for her original ticket, but Jaqueline also demanded the cost of the new ticket.
However, as long as Jaqueline does not submit the metadata of the mail, the case remains clear: for Cathay, the influencer has committed fraud, she remains locked for future flights. Airline’s terms and conditions also state that it does not have to pay for the new flight. Jaqueline does not want to be satisfied with this – and now turns on a lawyer.
Oil prices, according to report on the ceasefire in Yemen
The price of oil fell by more than one dollar on Friday afternoon. Last but not least, a barrel (159 litres) of the North Sea type Brent 61.83 U.S. dollars - about 1.4 percent less than the day before. The price for a barrel of the American variety West Texas Intermediate (WTI) fell by 1.3 percent to 55.77 dollars.
The trigger for the course slide was a report from the Wall Street Journal on a ceasefire in Yemen. Saudi Arabia is said to have agreed to a ceasefire in four areas.
In mid-September, a drone attack on the oil plants in Saudi Arabia had brought about five percent of world oil production. The Huthi rebels in the country of Yemen, allied with Iran, had declared the attacks for themselves. Saudi Arabia is responsible for Iran as the US government. A ceasefire would depress the political tension in the region.
In fact, if an agreement is reached, one could focus on growth and demand, said Ole Hansen, Head of the raw material strategy department at the Saxo Bank of the Bloomberg News Agency.
The oil prices continue its downward movement of the past days. A week ago a barrel of WTI oil had cost up to almost 59 dollars, Brent almost 65 dollars.
At the end of September, at the request of Insider, Bloomberg had reported that the repair work on oil plants in Saudi Arabia was progressing faster than expected after the attack. Thus, the production volume has again reached a volume of eight million barrels per day and is moving again towards the original quantity.
Most recently, there were several press releases calling on insiders to report on the rapid progress of the state oil company Saudi Aramco in the repair work. Raw materials experts pointed out that Saudi Aramco is currently planning to avoid a stock exchange and negative headlines.
At the same time, there was some relaxation in the conflict between Iran and Western countries: the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" is more than two months after the Iran arrest and the recently granted release on the way to leave the port. The crew is now preparing the departure while the ship continues to lie before anchor, Reedereichf Erik Hånell informed the Swedish radio on Friday morning in a text message.
However, the US announced that it would move defense missiles and soldiers to the Iranian arch enemy in Saudi Arabia. Fear of an escalation between the Islamic Republic and countries such as the United States and Great Britain had temporarily increased the price of oil over the past few weeks.
Preambles against Trump are getting worse
In the affair of possible abuse of power by US President Donald Trump, covert accusations against the White House have become loud. Several leading government staff had tried intensively to prevent access to the wording of the conversation after a disputed telephone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyj at the end of July. This was explained by an anonymous notifier.
North Korea considers the third summit of Trump and Kim to be questionable
North Korea has expressed doubts that in the nuclear dispute, a third summit of power-holders Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump will soon be held. The sense and prospects of such a meeting would be questionable due to lack of progress in the implementation of agreements of the first summit in Singapore, said top diplomat Kim Kye-gwan on Friday, according to the agency KCNA.
The United States had not done anything to implement the summit decisions in the previous year, said the adviser to the North Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He also criticised the United States sanctions and the US and South Korea's common military maneuvers. However, he hoped for a "wise" and "rooted" decision Trumps to get back to being approached.
Trump had said on Monday that he wanted to know what a third summit meeting with Kim was supposed to take place before he was ready to do so. Negotiations on an disarmament of the North Korean nuclear and missile programme have been under way since the failed second summit of Trump and Kim in February in Hanoi. In June, both of them met in the demilitarized zone between the two Korean states. They agreed to revitalize the consultations, but so far without much success.
Prince Harry: Weapons manufacturers to help with mine clearance
The British Prince Harry in Angola has symbolically lit and destroyed an explosion mine. Near a camp of the British Halo Trust in the town of Dirico, he created the ring of ignition. In a safe distance, the explosives exploded. In view of the goal of getting Angola free of mines by 2025, he later asked in front of running TV cameras: "I call all the countries whose names are on these weapons, but which have not helped them to make a commitment to help".
Pound under pressure - interest reduction expected
British pound under pressure
In view of a rapid reduction in interest rates, the pound is losing in value compared to the euro.
Frankfurt Speculations are increasing the pound sterling to a rapid reduction in the interest rate of the Bank of England (BoE). On Friday, the UK currency reduced by up to 0.4 percent to 1.2269 dollars.
The proceeds of the sales were statements by Michael Saunder, a banker of the music, who brought a reduction in interest, even if a chaotic Brexit could be turned off, because the uncertainty would affect the British economy at the foreseeable time. This statement was surprising, as Saunders considered as the defender of a restrictive monetary policy, said Analyst Ricardo Evangelista of the Brokerhaus ActivTrades.
Last week, the Bank of England had already pointed out the burden on the economy by the Brexit-Hickhack, without direct warning of a reduction in interest rates. Prime Minister Boris Johnson wanted to bring his country out of the EU, if necessary, without a divorce agreement on 31 October.
More: With its provocations, the British Prime Minister took a high risk, but it could pay off for him, says Handelsblatt Redakturin Kerstin Leitel.
Doping: Other Russian manipulations proved
Material from the Moscow analysis laboratory is manipulated - this confirms David Howman, once director of the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) and today's head of integrity of the athletics world association.
New details of the doping scandal in Russia come to the start of the World Championships World Championships, and they destroy the little credibility of what Russian sport had won back at the beginning of the year and even in the beginning. In January 2019, the Moscow Doping Lab finally delivered the required samples from 2012 to 2015 to the World Antidoping Agency (Wada). Now it turned out: They were faked.
In December 2014, systematic fraud in Russian sport had been revealed. The Wada had locked the Russian anti-doping agency (Rusada) for three years. During that time Russian athletes were not completely banned from the world stage. After individual examination at the 2016 Summer Games in Rio, the International Olympic Committee had about 270 athletes of the country going under neutral flag, at the winter games in February 2018, 168 Russian athletes were at the start. They were also allowed to join the World Cups in the various sports classes, in the summer even the football World Cup was held with the host as participants in Russia.
Missing Positive Findings
In the following September, the Wada lifted the Rusada banner, but requested access to the laboratory and the specified samples. The data should provide information on the extent of the cover-up of doping cases in state doping. They should help punish athletes later. Three months later they were finally delivered.
However, the president of the independent integrity commission (AIU) of the world athletics association (IAAF) has now confirmed that the doping data has been manipulated from the Moscow analysis laboratory. "Yes. We received the data nine months ago. We should check if the task force has received the right data," said David Howman in the interview of the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung" of Friday. "We have identified numerous discrepancies between the data the Wada has received from a Whistleblower, and those she received from the Russians in January." Many positive findings that were mentioned in the McLaren report were missing.
The World Cup not affected
This confirms the position of the IAAF: The athletics association is the only organization to hold the Bann of Russia. At the Doha World Cup, 30 Russian athletes start under neutral flag. They had to prove that they are training outside the Russian system and are testing themselves.
At the beginning of this week, the Wada manipulations had already been put in the room and asked Russia to answer the accusations within three weeks. Russia now threatens the further closure of the Rusada and in the worst case also the exclusion from the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo.
