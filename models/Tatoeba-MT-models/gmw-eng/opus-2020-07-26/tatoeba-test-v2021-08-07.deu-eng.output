The main task of the kings was to create a tomb, which was thought to be as timeless as the stars would seem to be over the sand of time, in which everything otherwise sank. Planning of the afterlife was more important than life itself, which was only the way there. Wars led them to remember the walls of this tomb, in which the scenes were measured, gloriously. Of course, much was beautified, and in later times even battles that had not even taken place.
