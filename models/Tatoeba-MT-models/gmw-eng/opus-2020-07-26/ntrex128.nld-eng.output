Members of the National Assembly of Wales are concerned that they ‘will be compared to Muppets’
A proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament - Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The proposal is a consequence of the plans to change the current name ‘Weelsh Assembly’ to ‘Weelsh Parliament’.
Members of the National Assembly of various political parties are concerned that the new name comes across ridiculously.
A member of the National Wales Assembly of the Labour Party said that MWP is ‘stirring on Twp and Pwp’.
For readers outside Wales: twp is Welsh for crazy and pwp is Welsh for poop.
A member of the National Wales Assembly of the Plaid Party said that the group as a whole was 'unsatisfied' and proposed alternatives.
A member of the Welshe Conservative Party said that his party is 'open' for the change of name, but notes that the words MWP and Muppet are very similar.
In this context, the Welshe letter W is pronounced as a short u.
The Commission of the National Assembly of Wales, which is currently preparing legislation to amend the name, said: 'It is of course the members of the National Assembly of Wales themselves who take the final decision on their new title.'
With the Government of Wales Act 2017, the members of the National Assembly of Wales were given the right to change the name of the Assembly.
In June the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which showed that most people felt that the National Assembly should be rebaptized to Parliament.
As regards the title of the members of the National Assembly, the Commission proposed ‘Weelsh Parliament Members’ or WMPs, but the MWP option received the most support in the public consultation.
At present, the members of the National Assembly would propose alternatives, but President Elin Jones will find it difficult to reach consensus, and in a few weeks' time she will have to submit a bill on the changes.
The reform legislation also includes other changes to the way the National Assembly works, including rules on the suspension of members of the National Assembly and the structure of the system of committees.
The members of the National Assembly will finally be able to vote on their new title when they debate legislation.
Residents of Macedonia vote in a referendum on the change in their country's name
On Sunday, voters vote to change their country's name to 'the Republic of Northern Macedonia'.
The popular referendum was organized in an attempt to resolve a pressing dispute with neighbouring Greece, which itself has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of its northern neighbor means that the country would claim its territory and has already repeatedly objected to Macedonia's requests to become a member of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who is against the referendum on the change of name, has said that he will not take into account the outcome of the referendum.
However, advocates of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that the change of name is simply the price to be paid to become a member of the EU and NATO.
The bells of Saint Martin's silence, those of Harlem have a hard time
"The older people I spoke to said that there was a café and church here at every corner," said Mr. Adams.
Today there is neither a café nor a church to search out."
He said it's understandable that cafes have disappeared.
'People now have social contact in another way,' he said.
‘Cafés are no longer the living room of the neighborhood, where people regularly pass by.’
However, he is concerned that the proceeds of selling the assets of the churches will go on for less long if the leaders expect, ‘and sooner or later they leave at the beginning.’
Churches, he adds, could be replaced by apartment buildings with flats where the kind of people would live that would not help in the remaining refuges of the neighborhood.
'The vast majority of the people who will buy flats in such buildings will be white,' he says, 'what will lead to these churches being closed even faster, because it is unlikely that the people moving to these apartments will become members of the church community.'
Both churches were once built by a white church congregation, before Harlem became a black metropolis: the metropolis community in 1870, Saint Martin's 10 years later.
The original church congregation of white Methodists left in the 1930s.
A black church congregation from nearby took over the building.
Saint Martin's was taken over by a black church congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of shopkeepers at 125th Street, an important shopping street in Harlem, where blacks could rarely get a job or be promoted.
In 1939 the building was badly damaged by fire, but when the parishioners of Ehrwert Johnson planned to rebuild the church, they also bought a beard.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Reverend Johnson and his successor in Saint Martin's, called the beard proud 'the bells of the poor'.
The expert who played the beard in July referred in another way to the instrument: 'a cultural treasure' and 'an irreplaceable historical instrument'.
The expert, Tiffany Ng of Michigan University, also noted that this was the first beard in the world ever played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger beard of the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said Saint Martin's had not replaced him.
The events of the last months in Saint Martin's are a complicated story of architects and contractors, some hired by church laymen, others by the diocese.
The consistory (the governing body of the parish, made up of lay leaders) wrote the diocese in July to express its concern that the diocese would 'will pass on the costs' to the consistory, although the consistory had not been involved in the hire of the architects and contractors who had sent the diocese.
Some parishians complained about the lack of transparency in the diocese.
Shark injuries 13-year-old who dives to lobsters in California
On Saturday, on the first day of the lobster season, a shark attacked a 13-year-old boy who went to lobsters in California. The boy came up with injuries, it sounds like that.
The attack took place just before 7:00 in the morning near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he had been doing about half an hour on Saturday with friends when he heard the boy screaming for help. Together with some others, he peddled to the boy to pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought the boy was crying because he had caught a lobster, but then he realized ‘ that the boy cried out, ‘ I’m bited!
I'm bitten!"
His key leg was completely open,' saw Hammel as he approached the boy.
'I shouted that everyone should go out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'
The boy was taken with a helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is said to be at risk of life.
It is not known which shark species is responsible for the attack.
Captain Larry Giles told us in a press conference that a shark had been mocked in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was then concluded that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim was seriously injured to the upper body.
The authorities closed access to the beach of Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours with a view to research and security.
Giles noted that more than 135 species of sharks live in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's wants to break through the British beauty market
Sainsbury's competes with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams and set up beauty departments where specialized assistants work, such as in department stores.
The initiative is part of a strategy to conquer the British beauty market, which is worth £2.8 billion and continues to grow, while the sale of fashion and household items continues to decline. The larger beauty departments are tested in 11 shops throughout the country. If they are a success, they are introduced next year in even more shops.
The investment in the beauty market is also a result of the fact that supermarkets want to fill the beams where TVs, microwaves and interior goods once stood, with other products.
Sainsbury's wants to double his beauty offer and offer 3,000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Also the existing range of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees gets more place, with tableau per brand, as in shops like Boots.
The supermarket also brings its Boutique make-up back to the market, now that most products are suitable for vegans, something younger shoppers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, perfumery the Fragrance Shop will test concessions in two Sainsbury's shops. The first is opened in Croydon, in the south of London, the second will be opened later this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
As more and more people shop online and buy small quantities of food on a daily basis in local supermarkets, supermarkets should make more efforts to convince people to shop with them.
Mike Coupe, Chief Executive of Sainsbury's, says that the shops will look more and more like department stores, now the supermarket chain is recording it against discounters Aldi and Lidl, with more services and non-food.
Sainsbury's has integrated Argos outlets into hundreds of shops and has also opened a number of habitats since both chains were taken over two years ago. According to the company, the sale of food has increased and the acquisitions have yielded more returns.
The last time the supermarket tried to give its Departments Beauty and Apotheque a make-over, that became a flop.
Sainsbury's tested a collaboration with Boots in the early 2000s, but the cooperation ended when a conflict arose about the distribution of income from the pharmacy department in the supermarkets.
This is a new strategy since Sainsbury's were 281 pharmacy departments in the stores three years ago sold to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for an amount of 125 million pounds.
Lloyds would also play a role in the plan, by adding an extensive range of luxury skin care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director of Sainsbury's, said: 'We have completely changed the arrangement of our beauty department, making it more pleasant for our customers.
We have also invested in the specialized training of our employees, who will be ready to give advice.
With our range of brands we offer to everyone, and thanks to its attractive surroundings and convenient locations, we ensure that our customers like to buy their beauty products from us, and no longer shop in the old way.'
Peter Jones 'voicing' after Holly Willoughby withdraws from the deal of 11 million pounds
Peter Jones, one of Dragons Den's stars, is 'voicing' because TV presenter Holly Willoughby has withdrawn from a deal of 11 million pounds with his lifestyle business. She wants to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time for Truly, their brand for homewear and accessories.
Jones and Willoughby's company is compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old presentation of This Morning announced on Instagram that she is leaving.
Peter Jones van Dragons Den is excited at Holly Willoughby because she has recently withdrawn from her profitable lifestyle business to focus on her contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was 'enraged' when during a difficult meeting in the main establishment of the company in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, Willoughby announced that she did not spend enough time due to her new contracts (with a value of one and a half million pounds) for Truly, their brand for homewear and accessories.
The company is often compared to the brand Goop of Gwyneth Paltrow and is expected to double Willoughby's fortune of an estimated £11 million.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced that she would leave Truly on Instagram, Jones left for one of his holiday homes abroad.
One source said, 'Truly was one of Holly's top priorities.
It would ensure its long-term future, and provide enough for the next decades.
Everyone was outraged when she decided to withdraw.
No one could believe his ears last Tuesday, because the launch was planned for soon.
The warehouse of the main settlement in Marlow is full of products ready for sale."
Experts believe that the departure of the presentatrice, one of the most profitable stars of Britain, could cost the company millions, as a result of the large investments in products from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear, and because the launch could now be further delayed.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin, who have three children, have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
In 2016, Willoughby started with Capp, and Jones, 52, became president of the company in March.
The two sets often go together on vacation and Jones has a 40% share in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will soon become brandambasseur of M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as presenter of the program I'm A Celebrity on the British channel ITV.
A source from Jones' entourage said last night: 'We have no comment on his business affairs.'
Hard language 'and then it was love between us'
He joked about the criticism he was going to get in the media for a comment he made that some people would find ‘unassuming for a president’, and for his positive look at the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump imitated a news anchor when he said:
'I didn't give up.'
He added that Kim was interested in a second meeting. Trump described their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards the decommissioning of nuclear weapons in North Korea.
But the negotiations on the removal of nuclear weapons have taken place.
More than three months after the Singapore Summit in June, top diplomat Ri Yong Ho from North Korea told leaders of the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea does not see a 'commonent response' by the United States following the first disarmament initiatives of North Korea.
In the meantime, the United States continues its sanctions to keep pressure on the boiler, he says.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech during the election rally.
"We're doing very well in North Korea," he said.
‘We were close to a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a fantastic relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim have led to positive results, and rocket testing has ended, hostages have been liberated and the material surpluses of American soldiers have returned to their own country.
He also defended his unusual approach to his relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to behave like a president, but instead of 10,000 people trying to get access to this busy arena, about 200 people would be here," said Trump, while he was to the public before him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroyed an island, killing hundreds
In the aftermath of the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs were given to hear that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10% of Lombok’s population were out of residence, no national disaster was announced, which is a requirement for launching international aid.
'In many cases, it is clear that they do not apply for international aid, which is difficult for us,' said Mrs Sumbung.
Save the Children is setting up a team to travel to Palu, but it is not certain whether the assistance providers from abroad can work on site.
Mr Sutopo, spokesperson of the Agency for Relief in National Disasters, said that Indonesian officials were still evaluating the situation in Palu to see if international organisations would be allowed to help.
Although Indonesia is constantly plagued by earthquakes, the country is still very poorly prepared for the anger of nature.
In Aceh, shelters were built to hide from tsunamis, but along other coasts you rarely see them.
That there was no warning siren for tsunamis in Palu, even if a warning was in force, probably contributed to the number of deaths.
Even in ideal circumstances it may be difficult to travel from one Indonesian island to another.
National disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship set up in Lombok to deal with earthquake victims is now on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days before the ship reaches the site of the disaster.
The improvement of Indonesia's homeless infrastructure was one of the key points of President Joko Widodo's election campaign, and he has already spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
But President Joko's government is struggling with a lack of funding, and that as he hopes to be re-elected next year.
President Joko is also put under pressure by persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Islamic majority today follow a rather conservative form of their faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to leave their homes because Christian and Islamic gangs fight on the streets, with machetes, arrows, and bows, and other primitive weapons.
Look at: Daniel Sturridge from Liverpool provides impressive equalizer against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing Chelsea in the Premier League last Saturday, with a goal in the 89th minute, during a match in Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge got a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri when he stood at a distance of about 30 meters from the destination of Chelsea, at the time his team was 1-0 behind.
He tapped left against the ball and then kicked toward the farst pole.
The ball flowed high above the penalty zone, toward the top right corner of the net.
He developed the leap of Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
‘It was very difficult to reach that position, to reach the ball, and players like Shaq always play forward as much as possible,’ said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
'I saw Kante approaching and ventured. I didn't really think about it, I was just kicking on the ball.'
Chelsea stood at the rest with 1-0, after a target of the Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The Blues led the ball with his heel to Mateo Kovacic, after which he rushed to Liverpool's play force via the civil society.
Kovacic did a quick one-two on civil society.
Then he gave a nice stitch pass, allowing Hazard to reach the criminal court.
Hazard was faster than the defense and kicked the ball with his left foot past Alisson Becker of Liverpool in the net, next to the rear pole.
Liverpool plays at 15 o'clock in the group phase of the Champions League against Napoli, in the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea recorded Thursday at 3 p.m. in London against Videoton in the UEFA Europa League.
The death of tsunami in Indonesia runs up to 832
The earthquake and tsunami deaths in Indonesia have risen to 832, said the relief agency in national disasters on Sunday morning.
Many people were trapped in the ruins of buildings that had collapsed as a result of the earthquake with a force of 7.5 from last Friday, where waves were also formed of 6 m high, spokesperson Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a news conference.
The city of Palu, where more than 380,000 people live, is full of debris from collapsed buildings.
Police arrests 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after woman is stabbed to death
This morning a woman's body was found in Birkenhead in Merseyside, after which a murder investigation was opened.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7.55 hours in Grayson Mews in John Street, the body was in a state of sting wounds, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police ask the locals to report if they have seen or heard anything.
Police inspector Brian O'Hagan said: 'The investigation has just begun, but I want to ask anyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead who has seen or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I would also like to ask everyone, in particular taxi drivers, to contact them if they may have filmed something through a dashcam, because they can have information that is essential for our research.'
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found is a local resident of Birkenhead and that she was found in a building.
This afternoon friends who think they know the woman on the spot came to ask questions about the place where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and the police have confirmed that they are currently informing the victim's family.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has tried to enter his apartment, but has been told by the police that no one is allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he found out what happened.
The inhabitants are now being told that it will take hours before they can return home.
A policeman would have told someone that the area was being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared crying on the spot.
She just keeps repeating, "What a pity!"
At 2:00 p.m., two police cars were in the lockdown, and a third was just outside.
Within the deposit, a number of agents were monitoring the apartment building.
Who has information is asked to send a message to @MerPolCC, to call 101 or anonymous contact with Crimestoppers on the number 0800 555 111, indicating log 247 of 30 September.
Portrait of Cromwell to the British Parliament is the latest victim of the 'rewriting history' reel
The banishment of the statue would be a poetic justice to the Taliban-like destruction of the many cultural and religious art objects carried out by his fanatic puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described the suggestion of Mr. Crick as 'dwaas' and 'an attempt to rewrite history.'
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: ‘It was inevitable that the current debate on removing statues would lead to the fishing of Oliver Cromwell’s figure just outside the Houses of Parliament.
The iconoclasm of the English civil wars was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestral Thomas in the last century.
The beautiful image of Cromwell, made by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, testifies to the opinion that reigned in the 19th century and is part of the history of a figure which, according to many, still has to be recognized.
Mr. Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: ‘Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as defender of Parliament against external pressure, in his case of course the monarchy.
Whether that is a completely correct performance is still being debated.
What is certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century formed the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individually recognizable figure that represents one side of that gap.
His achievements as Lord Protector must also be recognized and remembered.'
Killing Pig Kills Chinese Farmers
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in the southwest of China, according to reports in the local media.
The man, known only as the last name 'Yuan', was found dead at a stable on the market in Liupanshui in Guizhou Province. His arteries were pierced and he was under the blood, reported the South China Morning Post Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares for the intensification of pigs at a pig stable, on 30 May 2005, in Xining in the province of Qinghai, China.
He was said to have left from Yunnan Province on Wednesday with his cousin to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead and turned out to be a door open to a neighboring pig stable.
According to the cousin, a large male pig with blood on his mouth was in the pig’s cage.
A forensic investigation showed that the pig of 250 kg killed the farmer, according to the report.
'The legs of my cousin were bled and maimed,' said the cousin with the last name 'Wu', according to the newspaper Guiyang Evening News.
On images of surveillance cameras, it can be seen that Yuan arrived on the market on Thursday at 4.40 p.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man wasn't from Yuan or his cousin.
A market representative told the Evening News that it was locked up to prevent the attack of others, while the police collected evidence on the spot.
The Yuan family and the market authorities are said to be negotiating compensation for his death.
It happens only rarely, but there have been cases of pigs that attack people before.
In 2016 a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts, causing the man to get seriously injured.
Ten years earlier, a pig of 300 kg pushed a farmer from Wales against his tractor until his wife swept away the animal.
When a farmer from Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoban farmer witnessed at CBC News that pigs are normally not aggressive, but that the taste of blood can provoke aggression.
‘They’re just playful.
It's like kids, very curious... they're not ready to hurt people.
You just have to show them the right amount of respect," he said.
The tail of the Hurricane Rosa brings heavy rain to the southwest of the USA
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa weakens now that she has reached the cooler waters of the north coast of Mexico.
In the coming days, however, Rosa will bring heavy rains to the north of Mexico and the southwest.
At a wind speed of 135 km per hour, Rosa was on Sunday morning at 5 a.m. local time a hurricane of category 1, and was located at 620 km from Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to push to the north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a trough begins to form above the Pacific Ocean, which is heading east towards the west coast of the United States. When Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, tropical humidity is pushed northward, to the southwest of the US.
Pink will bring Monday 10 centimetres of rain to parts of Mexico.
Then, tropical moisture that reacts with the approaching trough will cause widespread heavy rainfall in the southwest in the next few days.
Locally, 2 to 10 cm of rain will cause dangerous floods, debris and possibly earth shifts in the desert.
Tropical moisture will result in a drop of 5 to 8 cm per hour, especially in parts of the south of Nevada and Arizona.
There are about 5 to 10 cm of rain expected in parts of the southwest, especially above most of Arizona.
There are sudden floods possible with rapidly worsening conditions, as the tropical rain can fall very widely.
It is strongly dissuaded on foot to enter the desert when the tropical rainfall threatens.
The heavy rainfall can transform ravines into desert rivers, and storms will produce local windshields and dust.
The approaching trough brings some heavy rain to parts of the coastal line of Southern California.
There is rain of 1.5 cm possible, which could lead to small debris flows and smooth roads.
This would be the first rainfall of the region during the rainy season.
Distributed tropical rains will approach Arizona Sunday evening to Monday morning, after which the rain will be spread more at the end of the day and Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall will spread over the Four Corners on Tuesday and continue to fall until Wednesday.
In October, the temperature in the US can fluctuate strongly, because the Arctic is getting cooler, but the tropics remain quite warm.
This sometimes leads to large differences in temperature over short distances.
There is a fine example of impressive temperature differences in the middle of the US on Sunday.
The temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, is almost 20 degrees.
In the coming days, the continuing summer heat will try to build up and expand again.
In much of the middle and east US, October is expected to start warm, with temperatures ranging around 30°C, from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
In New York, Tuesday may be 27 degrees, which is about 10 degrees hotter than the average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows that the chances of rising to mid-October are at above average temperatures in the eastern United States.
Over 20 million people looked at Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people watched Thursday on one of the six television networks at Brett Kavanaugh's thrilling testimony, candidate for the U.S. Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of an assault reportedly taking place in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political impasse continued, while broadcasters interrupted the regular programming for the surprise of Friday: an agreement arranged by Jeff Flake, Senator of Arizona, to investigate the charges for a week.
Ford told the Justice Senate Committee that it was 100 percent sure that a drunk Kavanaugh touched her and tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a dedicated testimony, declared that he was 100% sure that this had not happened.
Probably more than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen have looked at Friday.
The company counted the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There were no immediate figures available for the other networks that sent out the hearing, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble counting people who look at an office.
In comparison, this is about like a playoff of a football match or for the Oscar tournament.
Fox News Channel, which gives all support to the appointment of Kavanaugh, had most viewers during the hearing day: an average of 5.69 million viewers, according to Nielsen.
ABC followed with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC had 2.94 million viewers, MSNBC had 2.89 million viewers and CNN had 2.52 million viewers, according to Nielsen.
Even after the hearing, the public remained very interested.
Flake was the central figure of the events on Friday.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that he would support Kavanaugh with his voice, CNN’s and CBS’s cameras recorded on Friday morning that protesters shouted at him when he tried to take the elevator to a hearing of the Justice Commission.
He stayed standing for a few minutes with lowed eyes while he was being reviled, live on CNN.
"I'm right here for you," said one woman.
‘Do you think he's telling the people the truth?
Someone cried, "You have power, while so many women are powerless."
Flake said that his office had issued a statement, and just before the elevator closed, he added that he would say more during the hearing.
The various channels sent everything out live when the court committee later had to vote on the appointment of Kavanaugh in the Senate.
But Flake said that he would only vote in favour of the FBI to investigate the accusations against the nominee by the next week, something that the Democrats of the minority urged.
Flake was convinced, among other things, by his friend Chris Coons, Senator and Democrat.
Flake made his decision after a conversation with Coons and several senators.
Flake's choice was important because it was clear that the Republicans would not have the necessary votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the accusations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of a 'political game' around Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper, Prime Minister Theresa May accused politicians who criticised her plans to leave the European Union of 'a political game' with the future of Britain and undermine national interests.
Prime Minister of Great Britain Theresa May will arrive at the Conference of the Conservative Party in Birmingham, Great Britain, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, on the same front page of the paper, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson stressed his attack on her so-called Chequers plan for the Brexit. He said that her proposal that Britain and the EU should collect each other's charges was 'absurd'.
Shooting Wayde Sims: Police arrests Dyteon Simpson as suspect of the death of the player of LSU
The police arrested a suspect for the shooting in which Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU, was shot.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and in prison was suspected of death, said Baton Rouge's police.
The authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson and the police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police found the glasses at the crime scene and found Simpson's DNA on the glasses, reports WAFB, a CBS television station.
The police interviewed Simpson and later declared that he had known that he had shot Wayde with death.
His deposit is fixed at $350,000, reports the Advocate.
On Friday, the coroner of the congregation in East Baton Rouge published a provisional report stating that the cause of death is a gunshot wound in the neck.
The report mentions that the Fugitive Task Force of the Louisiana State Police, the crime lab of state police, the police of Southern University and local residents all contributed to the investigation that led to arrest.
Sport director Joe Alleva of LSU thanked the local police for his 'use and pursuit of justice.'
Sims was 20 years old.
He was 198 cm tall and grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He scored an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per race last season.
On Friday morning LSU basketball coach Will Wade said that the team 'capot' and 'in shock' was killed by Waydes.
"This is an event you always hope it will never happen," says Wade.
Volcano spits as in Mexico City
The ashes spread out by the Popocatepetl volcano have reached the southern parts of the capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Ramp Prevention warned the Mexicans last Saturday to stay away from the volcano, after activity in the crater had been picked up and 183 emissions of gas and ashes were registered in a period of 24 hours.
The center detected several rumblings and vibrations.
On social media photos of a thin layer of ash appeared on author's doors in districts of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in activity in the volcano, which is 72 kilometres southeast of the capital, the first time since September 2017, when an earthquake with a force of 7.1 on the Richter central Mexico scale was found.
The volcano, called 'Don Goyo', has been active since 1994.
Police clashes with Catalan separatists on the eve of the anniversary of the vote for independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence activists were successful with the riot police, while thousands of participation in rival demonstrations on the occasion of the first anniversary of the vote on independence in Catalonia that broke down the region in two groups.
A group of masked pro-separatists who were stopped by the riot police ordered the agents with eggs and powder paint, thus creating dark clouds of dust in the streets that are usually filled with tourists.
Later on in the day, screens broke out with the police, and the officers took their bats upstairs to stop the fights.
For more than an hour, pro-independence groups sang: 'Don't forget, don't forgive', while their opponents called 'Lang live Spain'.
Fourteen people were treated for slight injuries they suffered during the protests, reported the local press.
The tensions remain high in the region of independence, one year after the referendum of 1 October, which Madrid considers illegal, but is celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The electorate spoke overwhelmingly to become independent, although the rise was low and the people against separation were boycotts.
According to the Catalan authorities, after the police tried to stop the vote in the voting agencies in the region last year, nearly 1,000 people were injured.
Pro-independence groups had camped on the spot on Fridays on Saturdays to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration continued, but it was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who together with his wife attended the separatist protest, said that he was no longer hopeful about the prospects of Catalonia to become independent.
‘Last year we went through one of our most beautiful moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy because they could vote, but now we're stuck,' he said.
Although the Catalan pro-independence parties won a key victory in the regional elections in December, even if it was nipt, this year it was difficult for them to build on their success, since many of their best-known leaders are absent, either in self-imposed exile or in captivity, waiting for a trial over their role in organising the referendum and proclaiming independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who filmed the protest to support the police on his phone, said that the conflict had been fired by politicians on both sides.
"The tensions are getting higher," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who had been in provisional custody since the end of last year, declared that he was taking part in the European Parliament elections next year.
'A candidate for the European elections is the best way to sue the decline in democratic values and repression we have seen from the Spanish government,' he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after home was rammed by a car
Three men from 33, 34 and 39 years of age were arrested after a car was seen repeatedly in a home in Londonderry.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 7.30 p.m.
Police inspector Bob Blemings said the gates and the building itself had suffered damage.
A crossbow on the car may have been fired at some point.
Livingston wins 1-0 against Rangers thanks to Menga's goal
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston gave them victory
It was promoted by Livingston to surprise the Rangers and gave Steven Gerrard his second defeat in a series of 18 matches since he was manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's goal made the difference and the team of Gary Holt came to a level level with Hibernian.
Gerrard's team did not succeed this season to win a competition during the premiere. They have to take it on Sunday against leader Hearts, who presupposes eight points on them.
But first the Rangers Rapid Vienna will receive Thursday in the Europa League.
The team has already won six matches in his department, and coach Holt has not suffered any defeat since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses opportunities against strong visitors
The Holt team had long been able to achieve an advantage for the first goal, because their direct way of playing caused many problems with the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but failed to finish it with a target point, then Alan Lithgow, who picked up Craig Halkett's headball, kicked the ball over the target.
The home team let the Rangers play with great pleasure, and waited for his chances to be calm and confident.
And that eventually led to the crucial goal.
The Rangers allowed a free staircase and Livingston provided an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson worked together to create a chance for Menga, who scored from the criminal district.
At that time, the Rangers had been in balance for a long time, but the defense of the home team was unmurderable and the targetman Liam Kelly had not yet had much to do.
That pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos made sure that Kelly had to avoid a goal.
Scott Pittman kicked the ball at the feet of Rangers-Zielman Allan McGregor and Lithgow missed the goal after a presentation of his colleagues from Livingston.
Continued progress was made to reach the punishment zone of Livingston, but they were rejected every time. Twice a criminal kick was refused, one after Halkett’s attack on invader Glenn Middleton and one for handball.
'Personal' by Livingston - analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland in the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
Without exception, they played excellently and continue to exceed expectations in their race to the top.
Their playing style and the composition of their team has hardly changed since their return to the highest regions, but especially Holt deserves much recognition for the way he has pushed the team up since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was fantastic, with an excellently organized defense, while Menga Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall ran on the tops of their toes throughout the game.
The Rangers, however, did not manage to break through.
Even though they have often played very well under Gerrard, this time they have not reached their usual level.
Their final phase was not good enough (they succeeded only once in reversing the home plow) and the Rangers will now realize that they have to play better, because they are in the middle of the classification.
Erdogan is received with mixed feelings in Cologne
Under a radiant blue sky and with a broad smile, the leaders of Turkey and Germany went on Saturday, September 29, together with breakfasts in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, aimed at restoring relations between NATO allies.
They disagree on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then left for Cologne for the opening of a giant new mosque.
Cologne is the home of the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police called for security reasons when they stopped the crowd of 25,000 people from gathering for the mosque, but many sympathizers came near to see their president.
Hundreds of demonstrators, many of them Kurds, also voiced their voices, condemning both Erdogan's policy and the decision of the German government to welcome him to the country.
The rival protests reflect the division of a visitor praised by some German Turks as a hero and accused by others as autocrat.
Traffic accident in Deptford: cyclist dies after collision by car
In London a cyclist died in a collision involving a car.
The accident happened near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, in the south-east of the city, at about 10.15 hours local time.
The driver of the car stopped and the ambulance staff was present, but the man died on the spot.
A few months ago, another cyclist died in an accident involving flight crime on Childers Street, about a mile from Saturday's accident.
Metropolitan Police said officers were busy identifying the man and his nearest family.
The road is closed in several places, buses are diverted and motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Prison of Long Lartin: six principles injured in breach of order
Six cipers have been wounded in an orderly breach in a severely secure prison for men, according to the prison office.
The riots broke out on Sunday at about 9.30 a.m. local time in HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire and are still going on.
Specialized 'Tornado' principles are used to resolve the situation of eight prisoners in one department.
The cipers were treated there for slight facial injuries.
A spokesman for the Prisons said: ‘There has been special training in prison staff for an up-to-date incident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and those responsible are, at least, referred to the police and may have to stay behind bars longer.'
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the director of the prison had been treated in the hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, the riot police was called to prison for a serious disturbance in order to attack personnel with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (with possible positive effects on drought areas)
It is rare that a tropical depression will reach Arizona, but that is exactly what is likely to happen early next week, because the remaining energy of Hurricane Rosa is moving across the southwest of the desert area, which poses risks to flooding.
The National Weather Service has already given warnings for sudden floods for the west of Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, and the south east of California and Utah, including the cities Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to hang right above Phoenix on Tuesday night.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted in a tweet that since 1950 only ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of tropical storm or depression in the 200 mile area of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of Arizona's border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 centimetres of precipitation, with isolated quantities up to 15 centimetres in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
Other parts of the southwest of the desert area, including the Central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, will probably get 3 to 5 cm of rain, and here and there is 10 cm possible.
For areas that are not at risk of flooding, the rain of Rosa may be a blessing, as the region is affected by drought.
Although floods are very worrying, part of this rainfall is likely to be beneficial, because the southwest is currently experiencing a drought.
According to the U.S. Dragt Monitor, the map on which up-to-date drought areas are indicated, just over 40% of Arizona is going through at least extreme drought, the after-highest category,' reportedweather.com.
The route of Hurricane Rosa reaches mainland via the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa is still on sunday morning on hurricane strength with a maximum wind speed of 140 km per hour, is located 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moves north at a speed of 20 km per hour.
The storm hits cooler waters in the Pacific Ocean, which weakens them.
That's why she's expected to arrive in Mexico in the afternoon or evening with the power of a tropical storm.
There may be heavy rains in parts of Mexico, which poses a significant flood risk.
'A total of 8 to 15 cm is expected from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, with up to 25 cm possible,' saidweather.com.
Rosa moves north over Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the border with Arizona in the early hours of the morning as a tropical depression, which will then pass through Arizona and south of Utah on Tuesday evening.
‘The greatest danger expected of Rosa or her tail is very severe rainfall in Baja California, the northwest of Sonora, and the southwest of the desert region’ said the National Hurricane Center.
This rain is expected to lead to life-threatening sudden floods and ruins in the deserts and land-stripping areas.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: four arrests on suspicion of attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested for suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old with sting wounds was found in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace district in Midsomer Norton on Saturday at about 4 hours local time.
He was taken to the hospital and his condition is 'stable'.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested at night in the Radstock area, according to Avon and Somerset police.
The police are asking anyone who may have filmed something about what happened to report.
Trump says that Kavanaugh has been 'suffered by the commonness, the anger' of the Democratic Party
'A voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to reject the merciless and scandalous tactic of the Democratic Party', said Trump during a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that during his appointment, Kavanaugh was constantly 'suffered under the common sense, the anger' of the Democratic Party
Kavanaugh witnessed Thursday before the Congress and strongly and emotionally denied the provocation of Christine Blasey Ford that he had sexually assaulted her dozens of years ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also witnessed her allegation at the hearing.
The president said on Saturday that the 'American people saw 'the magnificent and incredible character, the quality and the courage' of Kavanaugh that day.
'A voice to recognize Judge Kavanaugh is a voice that recognises one of the most complete legal opinions of our time, a lawyer with an excellent state of service,' he told the crowd of advocates in West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to the appointment of Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of the Republican attendance at the interim elections.
‘Over five weeks, one of the most important elections takes place in our lives.
I'm not taking part, but actually I'm taking part," he said.
"That's why I'm looking everywhere for great candidates."
Trump explained that the Democrats are on a mission to 'resist and hinder us'.
The first important procedural vote in the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh is expected to take place no later than Friday, a top employee of the GOP management told CNN.
Hundreds of people killed by Indonesian earthquake, tsunami, and the toll is getting higher and higher
In a large earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, at least 384 people were killed, many being swept away from the ground when gigantic waves crashed on the beach, the authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered on Friday for a beach festival in the city of Palu, when waves of as much as six meters of land hit at the time it started to shudder. Many people were falling to the top and the waves destroyed everything on their path.
The tsunami was the result of an earthquake with a force of 7.5 on the Richter scale.
‘When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, there were still people on the beach. They did not walk away immediately and thus became the victim of the tsunami,’ said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson of the Indonesian Agency for Aid to Natural Resources BNPB during a briefing in Jakarta.
'The tsunami also led to other dangers: he dragged cars, tree trunks, houses, he hit everything on the land,' said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had traveled across the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coastline.
Some people climbed into a tree to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
In aerial photographs, released by the natural aid agency, you can see that many buildings and shops have been destroyed, bridges have been distorted and collapsed and a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday the coastal city continued to tremble.
The set of earthquakes was felt in an area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released in the massive earthquake of Friday was about 200 times the power of the atom bomb that had fallen on Hiroshima in World War II.
It is possible that the geography of the city, which lies at the end of a long, narrow bay, has enlarged the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as 'observable' and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had collapsed.
Some deadly victims were trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said. Some 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the number of victims and the damage could be even greater along the coastline 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communication with Donggala is completely flat, we have no information at all," said Nugroho.
There are more than 300,000 people living,’ said the Red Cross in a statement. The staff and volunteers of the Red Cross are on their way to the affected areas.
'This is a tragedy already, but it can get much worse,' said the Red Cross.
The organization received much criticism on Saturday because she had not said that a tsunami had hit Palu, although employees said that the waves had reached the country within the time the warning had been given.
In amateur images shared on social media, you can hear a man screaming at the upper floor of a building in panic to people on the street down to warn them that a tsunami is coming.
Minutes later, a wall of water falls on the coast and buildings and cars are swept away.
Reuters could not verify the images immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power failure that cut off communication around Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army is currently sending cargo aircraft from Jakarta and other cities, said authorities, but the evacués still urgently need food and other basic needs.
The airport of the city is only reopened for relief and will remain closed to the public until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
Tsunami’s death toll rises above 800.
It's very bad.
While World Vision staff from Donggala have arrived safely in the city of Palu, where workers at the courtyard of their office are searching shelter in tents of decks, but passes on the way scenes of destruction, said Doseba.
"They told me they saw many houses that had been destroyed," he said.
It's very bad.
Even when aid groups began the difficult task of launching emergency aid, some complained that certain foreign aid providers with great expertise could not travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, goods and personnel from abroad can only be authorised if the location of a disaster is declared a national natural disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
'It's still a province-level disaster,' said Aulia Arriani, spokesperson of the Indonesian Red Cross.
'As soon as the government says, 'Okay, this is a national disaster', we can provide international assistance, but that status has not yet been declared.'
When the second night after the earthquake and tsunami of Friday fell on Palu, friends and relatives of the missing hope that they would find their loved ones alive, as in the miracles that people so much like to hear from terrible natural disasters like these.
On Saturday a kid was taken out of a sewer.
On Sunday, aid providers released a woman who had spent two days under the rubble with her mother’s body next to her.
Gendon Subandano, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which had taken place earlier this month in Indonesia.
His students were also stuck in the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr Mandai.
"As a veteran in the paragliding world, I carry my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon said that the news that the Roa Roa Hotel had collapsed had spread in the paragliding community and that in the hours thereafter he had desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the athletes in Palu, who participated in the beach festival.
In his messages, however, only one gray fink appeared instead of two blue finks.
'I think that means the messages have not been delivered,' he said.
Thieves steal $6,750 while providing cash machine in Newport on the Levee
Friday morning thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who was filling a cash machine in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport police.
The driver had just emptied a ATM in the entertainment complex and wanted to fill it with money, so Inspector Dennis McCarthy wrote in the message.
When he was busy, another man walked from behind Brink's collaborator and stole a bag of money that was ready to deliver.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing, the press release said, but the police did not say how many people were involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about the identity of the perpetrators is asked to contact the Newport police on the number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West turns his name into Ye.
Last Saturday, he announced the change on Twitter with the words: ‘The being that is formally known as Kanye West’.
41-year-old West has been called Ye for a while and used this nickname as a title for his eighth album, which came out in June.
The name change was announced in the start of his performance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to introduce his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled her performance during the show for 'emotional reasons', says the artist of the show.
You're not just an abbreviation from his current artist name, but, rather, West already said that the word has a religious meaning for him.
I think 'ye' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you', West said earlier this year when he told about the title of his album by radio presenter Big Boy.
‘So I am you, I am us, we are.
I've been transferred from Kanye, which means 'the only', to just Ye, a reflection of the good in us, the bad, the confused, all.
The album is rather a reflection of who we are."
He's not the only famous rapper to change his name.
Sean Combs was formerly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but announced this year his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who used to cooperate with West, has also worked with and without the couple sign and the capital letters.
Mexican President promises not to use forces against civilians
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the elected president of Mexico, has promised never to use military power against civilians. The country is on the eve of the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday on Tlatelolco Plaza that he would ' never use military violence to suppress the Mexican people.'
On 2 October 1968, military troops fired at a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing as many as 300 people. During that period, left-wing student movements occurred throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to help young Mexicans open monthly grants to students and more free public universities.
He said that young people often become members of criminal gangs due to unemployment and a lack of opportunities to study.
United States should double the financing of A.I.
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount they spend on research of A.I., says investor and A.I. specialist Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for all Google, Microsoft and Apple.
He said this in response to the announcements about A.I. coming from various US government departments, despite the fact that the US does not have a formal strategy for A.I.
In the meantime, China announced its plan last year: the country wants to be number one in the field of A.I. innovations by 2030.
'Dualing the A.I. research budget would already be a good start, given that all the other countries are so far behind the US, and we are looking for the next breakthrough in A.I.', said Lee.
A doubling of funding can lead to a doubling of the chance that the next major achievement for A.I. will take place in the US, Lee said this week in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book ‘AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order’ this month was published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which invested in Face++, one of China’s leading A.I. companies.
In the 1980s, he worked in Carnegie Mellon University on an A.I. system that defeated American Othello's best player, and later he was manager at Microsoft Research and President of the Chinese department of Google.
Lee expressed his appreciation for technology competitions organized by the US government, such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when the next contest would take place, because it would help to discover the following visionaries.
In the US, researchers often have to work hard to get government subsidies, said Lee.
'China doesn't pick up our best academics, the companies do that,' said Lee.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recruited the best powers of universities to work on A.I.
Lee said that the U.S. effort in the field of A.I. would also benefit from a change in immigration policy.
"Whoever teaches in the field of A.I. should be offered a green card automatically," he said.
The Chinese National Council issued its development plan for the next generation's artificial intelligence in July 2017.
The Chinese Foundation for Natural Sciences provides financial support to staff of academic institutions, just as the National Science Foundation and other government organisations give funds to US researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defence launched a Joint Artifical Intelligence Center designed to involve partners in the industry and academic world in the initiative, and announced the formation of the Select Committee on Artifical Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced that 2 billion dollars would be invested in the AI Next initiative.
The NSF is currently investing more than 100 million dollars in A.I.
However, the U.S. legislation that should lead to the establishment of a national security committee for artificial intelligence has been in the process for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on their country's possible change of name
Last Sunday, the Macedonian people voted in a referendum on the possible change of their country's name to 'Republic of Northern Macedonia', which would lead to a dispute with Greece that has been pending for decades and would no longer impede Greece's Macedonian application for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province which is also called Macedonia, and says that the name of its northern neighbor means that the country is entitled to claim in Greek territory, and therefore Greece has put its veto against the inclusion of Macedonia in the European Union and NATO.
The two authorities concluded an agreement in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalists believe that the change of name would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he was not going to vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign is not sure that the required rise of at least 50% will be made, so the referendum may not be valid.
The question on the vote is as follows: 'Are you in favour of membership of NATO and the EU with acceptance of the agreement with Greece?'
‘Prohibitors of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, consider that the price to be paid is worth trying to become a member of bodies like the EU and NATO. Macedonia is one of the countries that arose when the former Yugoslavia broke out.
‘I am voting today for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live free under the umbrella of the European Union, because it will lead to a safer life for all of us, said 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska in Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, enough Members have indicated that they will respect the outcome, making it decisive.
For the change of name, a two-thirds majority in Parliament would be required.
The National Election Committee said that there had been no reports of irregularities at 13 hours.
However, the rise was only 16% at that time, compared with 34% during the previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of the registered voters came to vote.
‘I’m voting because it’s important for my children. Our place is in Europe, said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev of Macedonia, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted on 30 September 2018 in Strumica, Macedonia, during the referendum on the change of name of the country that would open the way for membership of NATO and the European Union.
In front of the Skopje Parliament, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov set up a small stage and placed chairs for tents placed by people who boycott the referendum.
‘We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to participate as a full member, and not through a back door, said Kavadarkov.
‘We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries, such as China and Russia, and become part of the European Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says that membership of NATO will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20%.
'I am convinced that the vast majority is in favour, because more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO,' said Zaev after his voice was cast.
He said that a 'yes' as a result would be 'a confirmation of our future'.
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Study showed that between 30 and 43% of voters would participate in the referendum, less than the required outcome.
From another survey conducted by hot Macedonian TV station Telma TV, it was concluded that 57 percent of respondents were planning to vote on Sunday.
Of this, 70% would vote yes.
If the referendum is to be successful, the rise must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government's policy since it came into power in May last year.
Look at: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City passes full defense of Brighton and scores
Last Saturday, Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling were in short contact with Brighton’s defense in the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England. Manchester City won the 2-0 match.
It looked like a flute of a cent, how Aguero scored in the 65th minute.
The Argentine summit was first played on civil society.
He ran between three Brighton defenders, straight into the open field.
There, Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He was able to pass a defender and was too quick for some others on the edge of the Brighton criminal zone.
Then he gave a pass to the left, where Sterling was waiting.
The English attacker used his first action in the criminal field to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right shoe to defeat targetman Mathew Ryan with a shot in the right side of the net.
'Aguero has problems with his feet,' said coach Pep Guardiola from Manchester City to the press.
‘We decided to let him play 55 to 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal at the time."
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the first benefit in the Premier League.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball when he was deep in Brighton's playing field.
He sent a beautiful stitching pass along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane held the ball for a while and then sent Sterling to the second pole.
The Sky Blues player just inserted the ball right before it was too far.
City takes up the Tuesday at 12.55 p.m. against Hoffenheim in the group phase of the Champions League. The race takes place in the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in the German Sinsheim.
Scherzer wants to play and make it the Rockies not easy to reach the playoff
Now that the Washington Nationals have been eliminated for the playoff, there was not much reason to force a new start.
However, the ever competitive Scherzer hopes to play Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still consequences for the participation of the Rockies in the play-off. They currently stand one match for the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies have authorised at least one wild card for the play-off thanks to their 5-2 victory against the Nationals last Friday, but now they want to do everything in their power to secure their first departmental title.
‘Although there is nothing left for us, we can at least pitch with the knowledge that the atmosphere here in Denver will be optimal with this audience and the other team will probably play at the highest level that I would encounter this year.
Why wouldn't I want to play in that?'
The Nationals have yet to announce who will be on Sundays, but are reportedly inclined to create Scherzer as pitcher in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th start, was in the injection field on Thursday and would still pitch next Sunday, although that was normal his rest day.
Washington's right-wing thrower stands at 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump organises meeting in West Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation surrounding Brett Kavanaugh, his candidate for the Supreme Court, while he spoke about the importance of the Republican rise in the interim elections.
‘All we have already achieved is at stake in November.
In five weeks, one of the most important elections takes place in our lives.
This is one of the really big elections. I'm not taking part, but actually I'm taking part. That's why I'm going to stand up for great candidates everywhere," he said.
Trump continued: ‘We see a terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, we see it happening now.
And they're determined to take power back, no matter what they have to do for it.
It doesn't matter who they hurt, who they must push away to get power and control. That's what they want: power and control, but we won't give them."
The Democrats, he said, are on a mission to "resistance and hinder us."
'And we've seen that in the last four days,' he said, calling the Democrats 'boss and mean and false and lying'.
He named the name of the Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, who sits in the Senate Committee for Justice, leading to a loud public appeal.
‘Do you remember what she said?
Did you lick the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, no, I'm waiting for one... that was really a bad body language, the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer a broad church.
The party is intolerant for people who say what they think
When Momentum activists voted in my local party to censor me, that was no surprise.
Finally, I am the latest in a whole series of Labour Members who have received that we are not welcome just because we say what we think.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan was given a similar treatment because she was firmly opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was punished for censorship because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically enough such issues as those in which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The announcement of the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday stated: ‘We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.’
And that was also the case during most GC meetings on Friday night during the eight years that I am already a local Labour Members.
Unfortunately, this is not the tone of many meetings today and the promise of a 'more nice, softer' politics has long been forgotten if it has ever begun.
It is becoming increasingly clear that a different opinion is not tolerated in the Labour Party and every opinion is assessed as to whether it is acceptable to the party management or not.
This began shortly after Jeremy became leader. Collega's who, as far as I knew, had a similar political view as I was, suddenly expected that I would make a change and take a position that I would never otherwise have agreed to, from subjects like national security to the European single market.
Every time I speak to a public, whatever I say, social media abuses are called upon to reject my candidacy as a Member of Parliament for the next elections, exposing the politics of the centre and telling me that I should not be a member of Labour.
And that's just what I'm going through.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments to my address are generally political.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who each day have to deal with a flood of sexist or racist reactions, but do not let themselves be intimidated.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this age of politics is that there seem to be some shattering parties considered normal.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer a broad church and with every 'motion of mistrust' or change of selection rules, the party becomes more small-minded.
I have been given the advice often over the past two years to keep myself down, not just to speak out loud and then I would 'not get into trouble'.
But I didn't go into politics for that.
Since being a schoolchild 32 years ago, I have always advocated better public services for those who need them most, both in my role as a municipal council member and in my role as a minister.
I have never kept my politics hidden, nor in the last elections.
Everyone in Nottingham East had clarity about my policy positions and my contentions with current leadership.
I can only say one thing to those who have advocated the motion on Friday: when the country is moving towards a Brexit that will harm families, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact, I have only one message, and it is not addressed to Nottingham Momentum, but to my electorate, whether they are members of Labour or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that threats to reject my candidate as a Member of Parliament for the next elections or that political opportunities will not prevent me from acting according to what I think is in your interest.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unspoiled Ayr on his way to the top
Two late trys may have broken the final result slightly, but there is no doubt that Ayr is quite triumphing in this wonderful competition of the day in the Tenent's Premiership.
They're at the top of the ranking now, the only rough team of the ten.
Eventually, they were both superior defenses and their better chances of winning the home team, and coach Peter Murchie was allowed to be content.
'We've been hard on our matches so far, and we're still rough, so I'm a lucky man,' he said.
Robyn Christie van Melrose: 'All honors to Ayr, they have taken advantage of their opportunities better than we do.'
Grant Anderson try in the 14th minute, completed by Frazier Climo, led to an advantage for Ayr, but through a yellow map of Rory Hughes of the Scottish national team (which he received during the Warriors contest), Melrose was able to speak the numbers and Jason Baggot managed to break off a try.
With a penalty, Climo provided an extra advantage for Ayr and scored a conversion after a solotry just for the rest. Thus it became 17-5 for Ayr after the first half.
But Melrose started the second half good and the try of Patrick Anderson, followed by a conversion of Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
The game stopped for a long time for a serious injury by Ruaridh Knott, who was dropped on a brand card, and once the game was restarted, Ayr could continue with a try by Stafford McDowall followed by a conversion of Climo.
Then captain Blair Macpherson of Ayr got a yellow card, and again Melrose paid off with the extra man when no conversion followed a race by Bruce Colvine at the end of a game where the pressure was very high.
However, the home team came back, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card because he hit Climo without the ball, MacPherson took care of the uplifting Ayr mouth for a touch-down on the penalty-line-out.
Climo took care of the conversion, and did so almost immediately after the restart, after Kyle Rowe caught the box kick of David Armstrong and sent away half-back Gregor Henry for the fifth try of the home plow.
Star of Still Game is ready for new career in the restaurant world
It looks like Acteur Ford Kieran from Still Game is in the hordeca. Apparently, he has been appointed director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he writes and in which he acts with his comedy partner Greg Hemphill himself.
The duo has announced that the coming ninth series will be the last in the series, and it seems that Kirinn is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official information, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor didn't want to comment on the story, but a source from the Scottish Sun caused Kirunn to search for a way to participate in the 'blowing restaurant business' in Glasgow.
'The sea is ours: it includes Bolivia, hopes that the court will reopen the path to the Pacific Ocean
Zeelu patrol in a Navy office in La Paz.
On public buildings an ocean blue flag is wafting.
On all marine bases of Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the motto is: ‘The sea is ours.
It's a duty to win them back."
In the whole country surrounded by Bolivia, the memory of the coastline that the country had to give Chile after a bloody 19th-century commodity conflict is still alive, as is the desire to re-operate the Pacific.
That hope may have reached its highest point in the last decades, since Bolivia is waiting for a ruling from the International Court of Justice, which should fall on 1 October after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity, and, of course, looks forward to the result with positive prospects," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians throughout the country will look at the ruling of the Court of Justice on large screens, hoping that the Hague Tribunal will plead in favour of Bolivia that Chile, after decades of fine talks, is obliged to give Bolivia sovereign access to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic native president of Bolivia, who is in favour of a controversial battle for re-election next year, is also at stake with the statement of Monday.
'We are very close to the return to the Pacific,' he swore at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court will probably not decide in the benefit of Bolivia, and even if it were so, there would be little change.
The United Nations body established in the Netherlands does not have the power to assign the territory of Chile and has indicated that it will not determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the judgment of the International Court of Justice falls only six months after the closing betogen indicates that the case was 'not complicated', says Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And the prospect of a positive outcome from Bolivia has certainly not improved, on the contrary, in the last four years the situation has perhaps become even worse.
'The matter of access to the sea has been captivated by the present Bolivian government,' said Zárate.
The warlike rhetoric of Morales has completely undermined all the good will that Chile might have completely undermined, she claimed.
Bolivia and Chile will continue their discussions at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to talk about the following.
The two countries have not had ambassadors in each other since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representing Bolivia in The Hague, denied that the court's decision was taken unusually quickly.
Monday, Bolivia will be given 'an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of international relations with Chile' and an opportunity to 'end 139 years of disagreements, with mutual advantages', he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, used the maritime issue as a political crutch.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific," he added.
'The verdict is an opportunity to see that we have to leave the past behind us.'
North Korea says nuclear disarmament is only possible if it can trust the US
The North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says that his country will never remove its nuclear weapons if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to fulfill the promises made at a summit between the leaders of the rivals in Singapore.
He said this at the time when State Secretary Mike Pompeo seems to be about to restart the fixed nuclear diplomacy, more than three months after the Singapore summit with Kim Jong Un of North Korea.
Ri says it's a utopia that the continuing sanctions and the American objection to a declaration ending the Korean war will ever get North Korea on its knees.
Washington is not inclined to agree to the declaration without Pyongyang taking important steps first in the area of disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is skepticism and it is doubted that Pyongyang is serious when he says he would refrain from an arsenal that probably sees the country as his only way to guarantee his safety.
Pompeo intends to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Fashionshows in Paris reveal the latest collection of huge headgears, soon for sale with you nearby
If you want to expand your hat collection or keep the sun completely out of your eyes, do not look further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne revealed a series of crazy oversized headgears for their SS19 collection on the catwalk, a striking move during the Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical hats were not to think of Instagram this summer and these designers have sent their eye-blinding creations to the catwalk.
The striking piece of Valentino was a giant beige hat decorated with a feathery wide edge, which hung to the eyes of the models.
Other oversized accessories were watermelons occupied with gemstones, a wizard hat and even an pineapple, but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre masks, just in time for Halloween.
In many of the colorful masks, the lips were thickened. They looked more like Hannibal Lecter than on haute couture.
One creation looked like diving equipment, complete with snorkel and glasses, while another looked like a melted ice cream.
And if you want to follow this bold fashion, you're lucky.
Stijlwatchers predict that the huge hats will find their way to the clothing stores near you.
The giant hats are perhaps inspired by 'La Bomba', the straw hat with a two-metre-wide edge that everyone wears, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the very impractical hat that appeared everywhere on social media also provided another great creation on the catwalk: a straw beach bag that was almost the size of the model in the bath suit that the bag engulfed.
The red orange raffia bag, set with raffia franjes and finished with a white leather handle, was the most striking piece in the La Riviera SS19 collection of Jacquemus during Paris Fashion Week.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: 'I expect to see large hats and beach bags in the shops next summer. Since the designer has made such a huge impact, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for extra large accessories.'
John Edward: Languages skills essential for world citizens
The independent schools in Scotland have an excellent academic excellence service, and this continued in 2018 with a series of excellent exam results, and also individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other initiatives of the whole community.
With more than 30,000 students in Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best service to their students and parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their pupils for continuing and higher education, the career they choose and their place as world citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a custom-made school curriculum, we see that modern languages remain popular and desired subjects at the best of schools.
Nelson Mandela said: ‘If you talk to someone in a language he understands, you reach his head.
When you talk to him in his own language, you reach his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely on English alone when we want to build relationships and a bond of trust with people from other countries.
From the recent exam results of this year, we can conclude that languages are at the top of the ranking, with the highest success rates within independent schools.
A total of 68% of the students who studied foreign languages achieved a high score.
The data collected from 74 schools joined SCIS shows that 72 percent of the students achieved a high score in Mandarin, while 72% of German students, 69% of French students and 63% of Spanish students also achieved A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now rated as professional as STEM subjects (science, technology, technology and mathematics) in independent school programmes and elsewhere.
A study by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 revealed that 17% of the obstacles to job creation were attributed to a lack of language knowledge, according to employers.
Language skills thus become increasingly important to prepare young people for their future career.
Now that there is an increasing demand for language skills, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career someone chooses, if he has learned a second language, he has in the future a real advantage with such a skill for life.
Direct communication with people from abroad automatically gives a multilingual person a lead in competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75% were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation. French was the only language that exceeded 10 percent, with a total of 15%.
This is why investing in language education is now important for the children of today.
Several languages, in particular those of emerging economies, will give children a better chance of finding a meaningful job.
In Scotland schools themselves choose which languages they teach.
A number of schools will focus on the more classical modern languages, while other schools will teach languages that are most important to the United Kingdom when they look forward to 2020, such as the Mandarin or Japan.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be different languages to choose from in independent schools, with teachers specializing in this field.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares children and gives them the skills needed to succeed, regardless of the future.
At the moment, it cannot be denied that languages in a global business environment remain vitally important for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should actually be regarded as 'international communication skills'.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
Il faut been le faire.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron makes his debut on Sunday at the Lakers in San Diego
Fans waiting for the first LeBron James game at the Los Angeles Lakers, the waiting is almost over.
Lakers-coach Luke Walton announced that James will be playing the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday in the opening match before the season.
The number of minutes he'll play is still to be determined.
"There will be more than one, and less than 48," said Walton on the official website of the Lakers.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell said in a tweet that James would probably play a limited number of minutes.
After the training earlier this week, James was asked for his plans for the Lakers' schedule for the six races prior to the season.
'At this stage of my career, I don't need any races before the season to prepare me,' he said.
Period of election rallys of Trump in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia, on a long series of election rallys
It is the first of five planned trials of Trump in the coming week, including stops in places that have been healed to him, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the vote on the appointment of the candidate he prefers for the job in the Supreme Court has been suspended, Trump wants to build support for the upcoming interim elections, because Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when voting in November.
What time does Trump's rally in West Virginia begin tonight and how do you watch online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, starts tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 19 h.
You can check Trump's rally in West Virginia online through the live stream on YouTube.
Trump will probably be talking about the hearings for candidate-privileged Brett Kavanaugh this week. These were extra loaded now that Kavanaugh is accused of sexual misconduct and the Senate may wait a week to vote on his appointment, while the FBI is investigating the case.
But the main objective of this series of rallies is to help the Republicans who are candidates for the November elections to get more elan.
President Trump's campaign leader said that these five rallyes are intended to 'stimulate volunteers and supporters, while Republicans are trying to protect and extend the majority they have in the Senate and House of Deputies', says Reuters.
‘Control over Congress is so important for its programme that the President travels to as many states as possible now the busy campaign season’, said a spokesman for the Trump campaign who did not want to be named against Reuters.
The rally of tonight in the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could attract fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania and are discussed in the media of Pittsburgh, West Virginia Metro News said.
Saturday, the second time in the last month that Trump visited West Virginia, the state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for the Senate of West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who remains in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president must come to give him a boost in the polls," said Simon Haeder, political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA is willing to fight to keep the hope alive in the run-up to Sunday's singles
After three unilateral sessions, the foursomes of Saturday afternoon might have been just what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging sling of opportunities is a fully invented sports concept, but it is one that players really believe in, and especially in competitions like this one.
So who is currently getting the best chances?
'They first had a six-point advantage, and now that's only four more, so we find so little that happiness is currently on our side,' Jordan Spieth said before he left at the end of the day.
Europe, of course, has the advantage of being in favour of four points, while there are twelve left in the game.
The Americans find, as Spieth said, that they have a little wind in their sails, and there are many things that give courage, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and scored every three points of the four.
Spieth has been a fearless opponent from tea to green and he gives the good example.
The typical throat sounds he makes when he plays well became louder as his round progressed and he achieved a crucial putt that made four games a success when he and Thomas were two points behind after two matches.
His well with which she won the match at 15 was followed by a similar scream, the kind from which you can deduce that he believes the U.S. team has not yet been defeated.
'You have to dig deep and just worry about your own game' said Spieth.
That's all these players can do.
18 holes to print your stamp.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable story of the Ryder Cup.
This remarkable, but delicious European duo has four in four and can't do anything wrong.
'Moliwood' was the only duo that did not play bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the back nest on Friday morning they avoid bogey's.
Because of that series, and the way they seem to exchange energy with their noisy audience, they are the players who have to be defeated Sunday. If Fleetwood or Molinari wins, he will be the most popular player ever to beat a European victory when the sun sets above Le Golf National.
It's preferable to both at the same time at different holes.
However, it is premature to speak of a European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made short measurements with Sergio Garcia, the fourball hero of that morning, when he formed a duo with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the front nest led to a backlog for the Spaniard and the Swedes that they no longer got over.
On Sunday, however, there is no one who can help to catch up.
The four-balls and foursomes are so fascinating to see through the interactions between the duos, the advice they give, the advice they don't give and the way a strategy can change in an eyetip.
The European team has played best so far and has a good lead in the final day, but this foursome session has also shown that Team USA is willing to fight, something that some, especially in the US, doubt.
Europe takes the lead with 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe starts with a nice advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup. After the four-balls and foursomes of Saturday, they stand in the United States with 10-6.
The team, with two wins, led their team more than Tiger Woods, who had a hard time, so that they now have four points ahead in Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, who wanted the trophy she wanted to lose back in Hazeltine two years ago, was stronger than the blundering Americans in the four-balls in the morning, with a score of 3-1.
The US offered more resistance in the foursomes, where it won two games, but could no longer catch up with its hindrance.
The Jim Furk team has to score eight points during the 12 singles competitions of Sunday to maintain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European newcomer to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, who got the nickname 'Molliwood', after a sensational weekend only the second duo in the history of the Ryder Cup are that four points win in their four opening matches.
After they had put Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-balls, they were beautifully played together and defeated a disappointing Woods and American newcomer Bryson Dechambeau with a powerful 5&4.
Woods, who swept himself through two matches on Saturdays, occasionally showed a brilliant move, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in four-balls and foursomes and seven in row.
Justin Rose, equipped for the four-balls of the morning, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes and together they defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the number one and three of the world, with 2&1.
Yet, it was not a mere game for Europe on this pleasant day with a breeze southwest of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, who already won the Major three times, and Justin Thomas set the standard for the Americans on Saturday with three points.
They won after a difficult match with 2&1 of the Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-balls and later defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 4&3 in the foursomes after losing the first four holes.
It happened only twice before in the history of the Ryder Cup that a team had been able to catch up with four points at the beginning of the singles, although the team from Furik has enough to play the game, as they currently have the trophy in their hands.
But now that they've been in second place for two days, a counterattack on Sunday seems too high.
North Korea says it 'in no case' will unilaterally disarm without confidence
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea told the United Nations on Saturday that the continuing sanctions are leading to increasing distrust in the United States and that under such circumstances the country could in no way unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told the UN Annual General Assembly that over the past year North Korea had taken 'important goodwill measures', such as stopping nuclear and rocket testing, decomposing the location for nuclear tests and the promise not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
'But we don't see any corresponding response from the US,' he said.
'Without any confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we will by no means disarm ourselves unilaterally.'
Although Ri repeated the well-known North Korean complaints about Washington’s resistance to a ‘phased’ approach to denuclearisation, whereby North Korea would be rewarded as the further steps take, it seemed that he did not a prioritize the unilateral denuclearisation, as Pyongyang did earlier.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between an active American president and a North Korean leader on 12 June in Singapore, when Kim promised to work on the 'destruclarization of the Korean peninsula', while Trump promised guarantees for the safety of North Korea.
North Korea is seeking a formal end to the Korea war from 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up his nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed the appeals to simplify the harsh international sanctions against North Korea.
"The US insists on 'decentralisation first' and increases pressure by means of sanctions to achieve their goal in a compelling way and even by objecting to the 'declaration of the end of war', said Ri.
‘The perception that sanctions can bring us on our knees is an air castle of the people who are ignorant of us.
But the problem is that the continuing sanctions only strengthen our mistrust.'
Ri made no mention of plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader did come to the United Nations earlier in the week.
Instead, the Minister stressed three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: ‘If the other party were in this issue of decentralisation of South Korea and not the USA, the decentralisation of the Korean peninsula would not have been such an impasse.’
However, the tone of Ri's speech was considerably different from last year when he said to the United Nations General Assembly that it was inevitable that North Korean missiles were directed on the American continent so that after 'Mr Evil President' Trump Kim called a 'raketman' on a suicide mission.
Trump, who threatened to completely destroy North Korea last year, praised Kim this year to the United Nations to take his courage to take action to disarm, but said that much remains to be done and that sanctions should continue to decommission North Korea.
On Wednesday Trump said that he had no timetable for this: 'Whether it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter.'
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, the U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council on Thursday: 'The enforcement of the sanctions of the Security Council must be continued with strength and certainty until we have achieved the complete, definitive, verified denuclearisation.'
Since 2006, the Security Council has implemented unanimous sanctions against North Korea in order to significantly reduce funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo had a meeting with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and said he would go back to Pyongyang next month to make preparations for a second summit meeting.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not go well.
Almost a few hours after he left Pyongyang in July and said that progress had been made, North Korea accused him of setting 'sterious demands'.
This month, during a meeting with Moon, North Korea promised to dismantle a rocket site and also a nuclear complex if the United States were to take 'joint measures'.
He said that Kim had told him that the 'agreeable measures' he wanted were security guarantees that Trump had promised in Singapore, and steps towards normalising relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on the importance of adequate rest
A new course at Harvard University this year ensures that all students get more sleep, in an attempt to combat the growing macho culture in which it seems cool to study all night and to drink a lot of caffeine.
A professor noted that the students of the world's largest university often have no idea of the basic principles of caring for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School, a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, started the course, as far as he knows this is unique in the USA.
He got the idea to start the course after giving a talk about the influence of sleeplessness on learning.
'At the end of my speech, a girl came to me and said, 'Why do I get to hear this right now, in my last year?'
She said no one ever told her how important sleep is, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
In the course, which will be organised for the first time this year, students will explain the basic principles of how good sleep habits help improve academic and athletic performance and how they also promote their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of university health services, said the university decided to organize the course when it was found that students had a serious sleep shortage during the week.
The course lasts one hour and includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one of the parts, the students see an image of a dormitory, where they click on coffee cups, curtains, exercise appliances and books to learn more about the effects of caffeine and light and how sports performance is influenced by sleep shortage, and the importance of a routine when sleeping.
In another part, participants will be told how long-term sleep shortage increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
Using a campus map, with interactive icons, participants are encouraged to think about their daily routine.
‘We know that we will not change the behavior of the students immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know all of this, just as people have the right to know the effects of the choice of cigarettes on their health, Czeisler added to it.
The culture of chivalry on a night is still being studied, he says, and because of modern technology and the increasing pressure on students, sleep shortage is an increasing problem.
To ensure adequate sleep, of good quality, must be the student's 'secret weapon' to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said, and even to avoid weight gain, because sleep shortage causes the brain to give them a constant hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from Calfornia who is studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to set up the course, since he had studied with the professor last year when he studied at Harvard in his first year.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to ensure that the course became available to everyone on campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all students to follow a similar study program before coming to the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler advises students to set an alarm for their bedtime, and not only an alarm to stand up. They should also be aware of the harmful effects of the 'blue light' of electronics screens and LED lighting, which can disrupt your circadian rhythm, making it difficult to fall asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Men of Menga down the men of Gerrard
The Rangers saw their competition again disappointing when Dolly Menga scored and the weak team of Steven Gerrard defeated with 1-0 in Livingston.
The team of Ibrox hoped for a first victory during a competition since they defeated St. Johnston with 4-1 in February, but Gary Holt's team took care of the defeat, almost the second of Gerrard as manager in 18 races. His team now stands eight points behind Hearts, which continues to finish at the top of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga scored at seven minutes before the rest, and the Rangers failed to score the equalizer.
The Rangers now fall to sixth place, Livingston rises to third, with only a difference in number of goals compared to Hibernian.
And the Rangers could get even more problems, as border judge Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound after apparently an object was thrown to him by the visitor team supporters.
Gerrard carried out eight changes in his team. They stopped Ayr and went to the half finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt stayed with the same 11th for Livingston, who had been able to sniff the Hearts last week. He would have been excited about the way his well trained team managed to block the opponents from every move.
The Rangers might have had the most balbeit, but Livingston did more.
They had to score after two minutes, when Menga gave off the ball for the first time and Scott Pittman's goal was to strike Allan McGregor, but the civil society couldn't finish it.
A deep free staircase of Keaghan Jacobs reached commander Craig Halkett, but his fellow defender Alan Lithgow kicked against the rear pole.
The Rangers did succeed in taking control, but they seemed to hope for a good outcome rather than really believing in it if they could approach the goal.
Alfredo Morelos found in any case that he was entitled to a criminal kick when he and Steven Lawless collided after a quarter of an hour, but referee Steven Thomson waving away the Colombian's request.
The Rangers were only able to shoot twice to the target in the first half, but Liam Kelly, who was once the target at the Ibrox, could easily stop Lassana Coulibaly's headball and the tame shot of Oviedo Ejaria.
The opener of Livingston in the 34th minute may not be in the extension of the general game process, no one can deny that they deserved this, even if it was just because of their hard work.
Once again, the Rangers had not been washed up against Jacobs' deep-play pattern.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher passed the ball on to Scott Robinson, who remained cool-blooded and chose Menga, who easily stepped the ball into the goal.
Gerrard interrupted the Coulibaly/Ryan Kent change. This move had almost immediate consequences when the winger Morelos passed, but an impressive Kelly raced away from his line to stop the ball.
However, Livingston continued to force visitors to play the kind of game Livingston prefers to play, where Lithgow and Halkett continue to kick long balls.
Holt's team could have increased its lead in the final stage of the game, but McGregor stood up well and blocked Jacobs, after which Lighgow came out of the corner.
Invaders Glenn Middleton of the Rangers asked for a criminal kick at the end of the game after an attack with Jacobs, but Thomson looked the other way again.
Almanak: the inventor of the Geigerteller
And now a page from the almanac of our 'Sunday Morning': 30 September 1882, today exactly 136 years ago, for whom TELLEN could well... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm 'Hans' Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the apparatus called Geigerteller.
The Geigerteller has since failed to think away from science, and has also become an icon in pop culture, for example in 'Bells or Coronado', a 1950 film with the unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: 'What the hell is that?'
Rogers: ‘That’s a tiger counter used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.

New cancer vaccine can learn the immune system to “see ” malignant cells
New cancer vaccine can learn the immune system to ‘see’ and kill malignant cells
Vaccin teaches immune system to identify malignant cells in the context of treatment
The method includes extracting immune cells in a patient to change them into a laboratory
They can then ‘see’ a protein that often occurs in many types of cancer and is then injected again
A test vaccine provides promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman treated with the vaccine learning the immune system to identify malignant cells saw her ovary cancer disappear for more than 18 months
The method removes immune cells from a patient, after which the cells in the lab are adjusted in such a way that they can ‘see’ the protein HER2, which often occurs in all types of cancer. Then the cells are injected again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 ‘stimulates the growth of different types of cancer’, including breast cancer, ovary cancer, lung cancer and colon cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar way to remove immune cells from patients and ‘learn’ these cells to handle cancer cells was shown to work earlier in the treatment of a particular type of leukemia.
Kanye West turns off pro-Trump-tirade and wears MAGA-pet after his appearance in Saturday Night Live.
That didn't walk as he had hoped.
Kanye West was released during a broadcast of Saturday Night Live after an inconsistency performance in which he praised the U.S. President Donald Trump and said that he would become President's Syndicate in 2020.
After bringing his third song of the evening, Ghost Town, with on his head a cap with the text Make America Great Again, he stopped a tyrade against the Democrats and repeated that he supported Trump.
‘When I talk to a white man, ask him, ‘How can you have sympathy for Trump? He’s a racist!’
If I was worried about racism, I'd been out of America for a long time," he said.
The release of Saturday Night Live began with a parody in which Hollywood star Matt Damon struck the dragon with the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh in the Senate Committee on Justice in connection with the alleged assault of which Christine Blasey Ford accused him.
The tyrade of West was not broadcast, but comedy Chris Rock uploaded them to social media.
It's not clear if Rock wants to cross the dragon with West.
West also complained to the public that he had been taken backstage for his cap.
'They fought me backstage.
They said, "Don't get on stage with that cap."
They've been teasing me!
And then they say I'm apathetic,' said the Washington Examer.
West continued: ‘Do you want to see how apathic?’ He said he would attract them superman cape, ‘because that means you can’t command me. Do you want the world to get better?
Give me some love."
At least twice from the public came the bidder and the castles of SNL appeared embarrassed, according to Variety. The magazine was heard by one present: 'The whole studio was suddenly silent.'
West was the last-minute substitute of singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-friend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West, many were surprised with a performance of the song I Love it while he was dressed as Perrier bottle.
West received support from the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: ‘To one of our bravest spirits: BEDANCE THAT YOU ARE THE MASSA TROTSEERT.’
But talk show present Karen Hunter tweete that West was just 'normal itself, and that's beautiful.'
‘But I choose not to reward someone who supports and spits out an ideology that harms my community (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his ‘art’).
He's free to do whatever he wants.
We too', she added to it.
Before the show started, the rapper had announced on Twitter that he had changed his name. From now on, he says, 'the being formally known as Kanye West'.
He is not the first artist to change his name. He was preceded by Diddy Puff, also known as Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Colleague rapper Snoop Dogg also bore the name Snoop Lion and the late music legend Prince once transformed his name into a symbol and then in The artist formally known as Prince.
Complaint of attempted murder after smiting in restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was accused of trying to kill after a man was stabbed off Friday in a restaurant in eastern Belfast.

The defendant is expected to appear Monday before the police officer in Belfast.
The accusation will be examined by the Public Ministry.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington extracts into toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as sword fighter Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy series Game or Thrones of HBO.
But the 31-year-old actor pulls out to the machotype of the macho and says that young boys when seeing such roles on the screen often think they should be tough to get respect.
In a conversation with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that he found that 'there has been something wrong' and asked himself how to tackle the problem of toxic masculinity in the era of #MeToo.
Kit, recently married to his co-star of Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, who is also 31 years old, admitted that he is strongly convinced that the problem must be addressed.
'This is an important question for me personally at the moment: where has it been wrong with our masculinity?' he said.
"What did we teach men when they grew up, which is why we are now confronted with this problem?"
Kit thinks that television may be partly responsible for increasing toxic masculinity, because of its very male characters.
He continued: 'What is born and what is taught?'
What is being taught on TV and on the street that makes young boys think they should be a certain sort of man?
I think that is one of today's big questions: how do we change that?
'Cause obviously something went wrong for young men.'
In the interview, he also admitted that he will not act in prequels or sequences of Games or Thrones when the series is over next summer, because he is 'finished with battlefields and horses'.
Starting in November, Kit plays in a Revival of True West of Sam Shepard, the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that his encounter with his wife Rose is the most beautiful result of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife during the series, so that's how I've been left with my future family and my life from now on," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the great love of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the fantasy series awarded an Emmy.
The couple married in June 2018 on the estate of Leslies family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase of 14% new cases
China reports that the number of Chinese with HIV and AIDS has increased by 14%.
Health authorities say that more than 820,000 people have been affected by it in the country.
40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
In the vast majority of new cases, the diseases were passed on through sex, which was previously not the case.
In the past HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China through transfusions of contaminated blood.
But the number of people who are HIVing in this way is now almost zero, said Chinese health officials during a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, compared to the same period last year, the number of people with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000 people.
The transfer of HIV via sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality is no longer punishable in China since 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be widespread.
Because of country conservative values, studies suggest that 70 to 90% of men who have sex with men would eventually marry a woman.
Often the diseases are transmitted by insufficient protection in sexual relations in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medication in the context of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denys that staff member has leaked data from Republican senators and extracts from 'hazardous lies' and 'complot theories'.
U.S. Congressman Maxine Waters goes against the allegations that one of her staff has placed the personal data of three U.S. Republican senators on the Wikipedia page of the legislators.
The Los Angeles Democrats claim that the allegations are spread by ‘extreme-right’ contestants and websites.
'Lives, lies and more mean lies', said Waters in a Twitter statement.
The published data would include the private address and the private phone number of the American senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The data appeared online on Thursday. They were posted by an unknown in Capitol Hill at a hearing of the Senate Committee on the accusations of sexual misconduct at the address of Brett Kavanaugh, candidate judge for the Supreme Court.
The leak came after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
According to conservative websites such as Gateway Poundit and RedState, the IP address that identifies the source of the posts was linked to the office of Waters and contained the information of a collaborator of Waters, said the Hill.
"This unfounded accusation is completely false and a flagrant lie," said Waters.
‘My collaborator, whose identity, personal data and security are compromised as a result of these false accusations, was in no case responsible for leaking this information.
This groundless accusation is completely false and a flagrant lie."
Waters' statement has quickly encountered criticism online, including the former press employee of the White House Ari Fleischer.
'This denial sounds angry', wrote Fleischer.
‘You can open this that she doesn’t have the temperament to be a Congressman.
If anyone is accused of something he has not done, he should not get angry.
He's not supposed to be rebellious.
He should not question the defendant's motives.
He needs to stay calm and serene."
Fleischer appeared to compare the reaction of Waters with the criticism of the Democrats against Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of excessive evil during the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who wants to take over Waters' place in the interim elections, also gave his opinion on Twitter.
"Truly, if it's true," he said.
In her statement, Waters stated that her office had informed the relevant services and law enforcement authorities of these false accusations.
'We will make the perpetrators known,' she said, 'and they are legally liable for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to my staff.'
Review: Johnny English Strikes Again - weak spy parody with Rowan Atkinson
In every new film with a British impact, we are now traditionally looking for references to the Brexit, and this is indeed applicable to this revision of the Johnny English franchise, the comic action films with a sleepy spy in the leading role, which started in 2003 with Johnny English and was back in 2011 created with Johnny English Reborn.
Is this airy evenity about how bad we are doing the latest export product for our country?
The incompetent Johnny English with vomiting eyes and flexible faces manage at least to send everything into the hundred, also with his second comeback. From his name you can already conclude that he is a common comic character that was conceived for cinemagoers in countries where one speaks a language other than English.
He is of course the foolish secret agent who, despite his bizarre claim to smooth glamour, a little Clouseau, a touch of Mr. Bean and a grain of that guy who contributed one note to the theme number of Chariots or Fire during the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games in London in 2012.
He is originally based on the traveler and the international mysterious man Atkinson once played in the TV spots of Barclaycard (who's forgotten everyone in the meantime) who always leaves behind a certain chaos.
His latest portrait of Johnny English contains one or two beautiful moments.
I loved the way Johnny English approaches a helicopter in his medieval armor and pull the rotor blades against his helmet.
Atkinson can show in this film how much talent he has for physical comedy, but the humor is rather weak and crazy enough, especially now the "serious" film series like 007 and Mission Impose self comedy include as an ingredient, and do that well.
The humor seems to be for children rather than adults, and Johnny English's mad disaster comes to me less original and focused than the jokes without the text of the character Bean that plays Atkinson.
The constant theme now is that Great Britain is in serious difficulties.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the super secret spy network on the web, making the identity of all active secret agents of Britain known, to great horror of the agent in function, a unfortunately small role of Kevin Eldon.
That's the drop that makes the bucket overflow from the prime minister, a pretentious woman with problems at her head and terribly unpopular as politiciana. Emma Thompson does her utmost with this character that reminds of Teresa May, but the script does not offer much material to work with.
According to her intelligence advisers, she has to use a retired spy, since each active spy is compromised.
And that means the stunning Johnny English himself, who now works as a schoolmaster in a chic institution, but unofficial lessons about undercover work. Here are fun jokes in the story, because the spyesses of English think of School of Rock.
English is quickly laid out on Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with his former pathetic aid Bough, re-played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, his wife is captain of a submersible, a turbulent and jovial role that lies below Vicki Pepperdine's level.
The Batman and Robin of the disastrous conditions of Her Majesty's Secret Service are therefore back in action and meet Olga Kurylenko's blood-mooth femme fatal Ophelia Bulletova.
In the meantime, the prime minister unfortunately falls for the charms of charismatic technology billionaire who claims that he can solve British computer problems: sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their odyssee of clumsy mad fun: disguised as waiters they set fire to a carefully French restaurant, they kick herring aboard the luxury yacht of Volta and English free anarchy when he tries to use a Virtual Reality headset to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's house.
To that end, all the registers are opened, but no matter how well-educated and turbulent the scene is, it is doing a bit of thinking about children's television.
It's not all very original.
And just as with the other films of Johnny English, I ask myself: can the British film industry really not think of a role that honors Rowan Atkinson's talent?
Labour denys that the party is planning to consider where British work four days a week, but pay for five days
The Labour Party of Jeremy Corbyn would consider a radical plan in which Britons work four days a week, but get paid for five days.
It is said that the party would like companies to pass on to their employees the savings they make as a result of the revolution of Artifical Intelligence (A.I.) by giving them an extra day vacation.
For example, workers can enjoy a three-day weekend, but still earn as much.
According to sources, the idea is reflected in the party's economic agenda and the plans to make the country's balance sheet shine in the direction of the workers.
The transition to a four-day working week has already been approved by the Association of Trade Unions, which finds it a good way to ensure that workers can benefit from the changing economy.
A high-level source from the Labour Party said to The Sunday Times: ‘A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
"It will not happen at one time, but a four-day working week is a goal that fits within the party's efforts to make the economy's balance more beneficial to the workers and also fits it within the overall industrial strategy of the party."
Labour is not the first party to support such an idea, given that the Green Party has already promised a four-day work week in the 2017 national election campaign.
However, the overall Labour Party does not yet support the effort.
A Labour Party spokesperson said: "A four-day work week is not a party policy plan and is not considered by the party either."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Conference last week to highlight his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back the power from the 'faceless drivers' and the 'profiters' in utilities.
The Shadow Chancellor's plans also mean that the current shareholders of water companies may not regain the full value of their share, because a Labour government could apply 'shorts' based on observed misconduct.
He also confirmed that there are plans to include employees in the board of corporate governance and to set up inclusive ownership funds (including Ownership Funds) which give 10% of private sector shares to employees who can earn up to £500 a year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell '60 Minutes' whether the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh can make them change their mind
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least one week and raises the question whether the findings of the FBI could ensure that Republican senators withdraw their support for the candidate.
In an interview sent at '60 Minutes' on Sunday, correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham or the FBI to discover something that could lead them to change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more open in this than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I told the hearing I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, after the charge came out, and I asked him, "Did you do it?"
He was resolute, determined, impudent."
The voice of Graham, however, appears to be wall-resistant.
"My opinion about Brett Kavanaugh is stuck and the accusation should contain dynamic," he said.
"As for Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett strongly denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And no one named by her could verify it.
It's been 36 years.
I don't see any new developments."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has contributed to reducing poverty?
This Saturday, the Global Citizen Festival will be held in New York, an annual music event that will feature a very impressive line-up to stars and that will have an equally impressive mission: the end of poverty in the world.
For the seventh time again, tens of thousands of people will come to the Great Lawn in Central Park for the Global Citizen Festival. Not only to enjoy acts like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes but also to generate awareness for the real purpose: ending extreme poverty for 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, organised for the first time in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, a group of international stakeholders who hope to put an end to poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting against it.
Concertgoers who want to obtain a free ticket for the event (unless they were willing to pay for a VIP card), had to complete a series of tasks, or 'actions', such as volunteering, e-mail a world leader, make a phone conversation, or generate awareness for the purpose: an end of poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizen Festival been, with 12 more years to reach this goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a suitable way to convince people of a call for action or is this just another form of 'clickivism', giving people the feeling that they are making a real contribution by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
According to Global Citizen, more than 19 million 'actions' of supporters have been registered since 2011, aimed at a large number of different goals.
According to Global Citizens, these actions have contributed to the commitment of world leaders and have made policy proposals worth more than 37 billion dollars to change the lives of 2.25 billion people before 2030.
Early in 2018, the group quoted 390 initiatives and statements on the basis of the actions, at least 10 billion dollars of which have been paid out or brought together by sponsoring actions.
The group estimates that the funds obtained have so far had an impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
One of the most important statements of intent is that of The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and executives from the United Kingdom with the aim of 'helping children to realize their full potential'.This group promised Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the help of the British government, donors, other national authorities and Global Citizens like you, we can make a footnote in history of the social injustice that is malnutrition," said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, the public during a London concert in April 2018.
The group also announced that after more than 5,000 actions were sent asking the UK authorities to improve the nutritional situation for mothers and children, the government announced to support a project, the Power of Nutrition, that will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
In answer to one of the FAQ on the Global Citizens website, which asked "why do you think we can put an end to extreme poverty?"
the group replied, "It will be a long and difficult way, sometimes falling and failing.
But, like civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will eventually succeed because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, The Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are a few of the artists who will perform this year at the New York event presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States can use the Navy for a 'blockade' to hinder Russian exports of energy - Minister for Home Affairs
Washington may resort to the Navy if necessary to prevent Russian energy coming on the market, including in the Middle East, stated Ryan Zinke, the U.S. Minister for Home Affairs, as mentioned by the Washington Examer.
Zinke claimed that the involvement of Russia in Syria, where the country is acting at the invitation of the legal government, is a pretext for exploration of new energy markets.
"I believe they are only in the Middle East to be able to act in energy, as in Eastern Europe and the southern flank of Europe," he said.
And according to the officer, there are ways and means to counter this.
"The United States has that opportunity, with the Navy, to ensure that the navigation routes remain open and, if necessary, to block them to ensure that their energy does not come onto the market," he said.
Zinke spoke for invited people during an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that feels like the 'voice of the energy consumption' in the US.
He went further and compared Washington's approach to Russia with Iran and noted that they did not differ substantially.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less the use and replacement of fuels," he said, pointing to Russia as a country with only a 'art', with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a time when the Government is trying to encourage Trump to export liquid natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, a country that offers the most affordable option for European consumers.
For this reason, officials of the Trump government, including President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the 'unfit' pipeline project Nord Stream 2, which Trum of Berlin says has made Moscow's 'capitated'.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, worth $11 billion, which will double the current pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is just an economic project.
The Kremlin argues as an argument that Washington's strong opposition to the project is only sent by economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we agree with the view that energy should not be used to exert pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers themselves," said Aleksandr Novak, the Russian Minister for Energy, after a meeting with Rick Perry, the U.S. Minister of Energy, in Moscow in September.
The US position has triggered a reaction from Germany, which has reaffirmed its involvement in the project.
The Federal Association of German Industry (BDI), the leading industrial organization in Germany, has called on the US not to interfere with EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a major problem when a third power interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kemp, Head of the German Federation of Industry (BDI) after a recent meeting between German chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren 'thinks seriously about it' to participate in the presidential elections in 2020, says the Senator for Massachusetts
Elizabeth Warren, the Senator from Massachusetts said Saturday that she is "thinking about it" to participate in the presidential elections after the interim elections.
At a local meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was thinking about taking part in the elections.
"It's time for women to go to Washington to recover the damaged government, and this also means that a woman in the top position," she said, according to the political newsmagazine The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will think seriously about it to make myself elected President."
Warren was fighting President Donald Trump at the meeting in the town hall and said he "is driving this country in the wrong direction".
"I'm worried to the bone about what Donald Trump brings about in our democracy," she said.
Warren has been open in her criticism of Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, his candidate for the Supreme Court.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said "of course we have to wait for an FBI investigation before we vote on it."
However, an opinion published on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own follow-up felt it should not be elected by 2020.
Eighty-eight percent of the 'probable' voters in Massachusetts said that the senator should not be elected, according to an opinion of the Suffolk University Political Research Center and Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent were in favour of being elected.
The study showed that there was more support for former governor Deval Patrick, 38% before a possible candidacy and 48% against.
Other names of prominent Democrats associated with possible participation in the presidential elections in 2020 are former Vice-President Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, senator from Vermont.
Biden said he would make an official decision in January, according to an Associated Press report.
Sarah Palin talks about Track Palin's PTSS at an election meeting of Donald Trump
Track Palin, aged 26, spent a year in Iraq after serving in September.
He was arrested and accused after a report of domestic violence on Monday night.
"By what my own son has to experience, what he's going through now he's back, I understand other families who are experiencing the consequences of PTSS and the injuries with which some of our soldiers return," she told the public who was present at a meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said about her son and other veterans "they come back a little differently, they come back and become harder, they come back and wonder if there is respect for what their fellow soldiers and pilots and all the other soldiers have given to the homeland".
He was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska on Monday and was charged with domestic violence and assault on a woman, interference in a report on domestic violence and possession of a weapon under influence, according to Dan Bennett, police spokesman in Wasilla.
Washington D.C. and 18 States support the protest against a new asylum policy
Eighteen States and the District of Columbia support a legal protest against a new US policy refusing asylum to victims who are fleeing from gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and Washington D.C. submitted a statement last Friday as 'friend-of-the-court' to the Washington court in support of an asylum seeker fighting this policy, NBC News reports.
The full name of the complainant in the Grace versus Sessions case that the American Civil Liberties Union had appealed against federal policy in August has not been published.
She says that her partner "and his violent sons who are members of a gang" abused her but that American officials rejected her asylum application on 20 July.
She's been detained in Texas.
The lawyers of the countries that support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of people come from who are applying for asylum in the US, as countries with major problems in the field of gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy has reversed a 2014 decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals, which made it possible for immigrants without documents fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Karl Racine, the attorney-general of Washington D.C., said on Friday in a statement that the new policy "aboves to ten years of state, federal and international legislation".
"Federal legislation requires that all asylum applications be assessed on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application and that such an obstacle be contrary to that principle" is stated by the 'friend-of-the-court'.
The lawyers further argue that the policy which denied immigrants access to the US is damaging the US economy, because these immigrants are likely to become new entrepreneurs and the country 'provides the necessary labour force'.
Jeff Sessions, the Minister of Justice, ordered judges not to grant asylum to victims of domestic and gang-related violence in June.
"Asiel is available to those who flee their country because of persecution or fear based on race, religion, nationality or membership of a specific social group or political belief," said Sessions in his announcement on 11 June of policy.
Asiel was never meant to alleviate all the problems, even if these problems are serious, with which people every day have to deal with everywhere in the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu while the number of dead doubled in the race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation also became worse and worse.
"It feels very tense," said the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, trying to comfort her feverish baby in an evacuation centre in the ruined city of Palu.
"Every minute new bodies arrive in ambulances.
And clean water is scarce".
Residents returned to their destroyed homes and searched for valuable things they could still use in their well - watered possessions.
Hundreds of people have suffered injuries and the hospitals are overcrowded to the extent that they have not been damaged by the 7.5 earthquake on the Richter scale.
Some wounded, including Dwi Haris who had run a broken back and shoulder, were resting outside the army hospital in Palu, where patients were treated outside because of the chance of severe aftershocks.
Tears filled his eyes as he told about his feelings when the devastating earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was printed against the remains of a wall," Haris told an Associated Press correspondent and added that he was with his family in the city for a wedding.
"I heard my wife cry for help, and later I heard nothing.
I don't know what happened to her and our child.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of 'intimidation' with propaganda advertisements
A week after an official Chinese newsmagazine placed a four - page advertisement in an American daily, which praised the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China, the US ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump referred to China Daily's paid annex to the Des Moines Register, the most sold newspaper in Iowa, after accusing China of interference in the US Congress elections of 6 November, an accusation denied by China.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere with the U.S. elections, marked a new phase in an escalating campaign by Washington to pressure China, according to U.S. officials quoted by Reuters.
Although it is normal for foreign authorities to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in an escalating trade war, in which they have imposed ever higher import rates.
China's early trade war retaliation rates were specifically aimed at meeting exporters in states such as Iowa, who supported the Republican Party of Trump, as Chinese and American experts have said.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and governor of Iowa, an important exporter of agricultural products to China, said that China had affected American workers, farmers and businesses.
"China", as Branstad wrote in an opinion paper in Des Moines Register of Sunday, "dualises the harassment by publishing propaganda advertisements in our free press".
"By spreading this propaganda, the government of China uses the freedom of expression and a free press, a long cherished tradition in America by placing a paid advertisement in Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, a kiosk in the centre of Beijing will find you indescribably different voices and you will not see a true reflection of the different opinions the Chinese people may have on the difficult economic path, because the media are firmly under the thumb of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newsmagazines refused to publish his article," as he did not say to what newsmagazine this was.
By the Kavanaugh debacle, the Republicans estranged female voters just before the mid-term elections, warning analysts
Now that many important republicans are in the ranks of Brett Kavanaugh, the candidate for the Supreme Court, and defend him against various accusations of sexual violence, analysts warn that they will suffer a setback, especially among women, during the upcoming interim elections.
The emotions surrounding this subject have risen enormously, and most Republicans have already indicated that they wish to continue with the vote.
"These things can't be turned back," said Grant Reeher, professor of politicalology at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, at The Hill for an article that appeared Saturday.
He said that he was wondering whether the attempt of Senator Jeff Flake (Republicaan, Arizona) to plead for an FBI study at the last moment would be sufficient to satisfy the evil voters.
"Women don't forget what happened yesterday, they didn't forget it tomorrow and they didn't forget it in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior consultant and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn on Friday, according to the Washington newsmagazine, D.C..
On Friday morning protesters called "November coming!" during their demonstration in the Senate hall while the Republicans who have controlled the Justice Committee chose to approve Kavanaugh's candidacy, despite the testimony of Dr Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"The enthusiasm and motivation for the Democrats will reach a record height," said St. Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst, on the news site.
"People say it's high already, and that's true.
However, it may continue to rise, particularly among floating female voters in the suburbs and among younger voters, from 18 to 29 years of age, who often do not vote even though they disagree with the President".
Even for Ford’s public testimony, in which she further explained her accusation of sexual harassment against the candidate for the Supreme Court, analysts suggested that there could be a setback if the Republicans were to push through the appointment.
"This has become a confused mess for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former party president of the Republican Party, earlier last week according to NBC News.
"It is not only about the vote in committee, or about the final vote or Kavanaugh taking place in court, but it is also about how the Republicans have dealt with this and how they have dealt with it," says Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps Democrats to be elected, clearly to the news channel.
The Americans, however, appear to be divided on the question of who they believe after the testimonies of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a small majority voting for the latter.
A new opinion poll by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents certainly or probably believe Ford's testimony and that 35 percent surely or probably Kavanaugh believes.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought that Kavanaugh was certain or likely lying during his testimony while only 30% said the same thing about Ford.
After the presentation of Flake, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's allegations and at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Last week, Ford told the Senate Justice Committee that Kavanaugh had attacked her under the influence of drinking when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court has shown his genius to her during a festival at the time they both studied at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans a new internet to tackle Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, starts a startup that wants to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the latest technology legend project, is a company based on the open source platform Solid by Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data are stored and which persons have access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that 'world domination' is the leading thought behind Inrupt.
"We have to do this now," he said about the startup.
"This is a historical moment."
The app uses Solid's technology to enable people to make their own 'personal online data storage' or POD.
Lists of contacts, activity lists, an agenda, a music library and other personal and professional tools can be stored in it.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available together through one browser and all at the same time.
What makes POD unique is that it depends entirely on the user who has access to what information.
The company calls this 'personal empowerment through data'.
The idea behind Inrupt is according to CEO John Bruce that the company provides the resources, processes and skills needed to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some developers who are contracted to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
From this week on, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralised apps with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not going to talk to "Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete transformation that will put all of their business models on their heads in the first place".
"We don't ask for their permission."
In a medium post published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that the "mission (of Inrupt) is to deliver the commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps to protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
After the start of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain as founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about this new age for the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Clergy and Carrier of Victoria Cross from WO I Honored
The only minister of the Church of England who acquired a Victoria Cross during World War I as a military is honored in his birthplace 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann obtained the distinction following the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt on 29 September 1918.
However, four days later he was killed by a sniper and never knew that he had the highest military honor.
A memorial stone was revealed by his two small zones during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of the small zones, Michael Vann, said it was 'brilliant symbolic' that the stone was revealed exactly 100 years after the fact for which his grandfather was distinguished.
According to the London Gazette, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion on 29 September 1918 over the Canal de Saint-Quentin "in a very dense fog and under intense fire of field gun and machine guns".
He later stormed to the fireline and led the line forward before running to a field archery only and shut down three members of the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, a little more than a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions "were something I know I can never type it, but also something that makes me feel humble".
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid a wreath after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he "feel very honoured to be allowed to play a role in the parade" and added that "the courage of a real hero is shown by the support he receives from a large number of people".
MMA fans stayed up all night to see Bellator 206 and got Peppa Pig instead
Imagine, you stayed awake all night to view a complete Bellator 206 and you won't see the most important moment.
13 battles, including six in the main section, were mentioned on the billboard from San Jose, and this was broadcast all night in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., just at the time Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald got ready for their fight, viewers in the United Kingdom were surprised when the channel switched to Peppa Pig.
Some were indignant because they had stayed awake especially for this fight all night.
A fan described the transition to the children's program on Twitter as "a bad joke".
"According to government regulations, after 6:00 a.m., no more content should be displayed which is not suitable for children, and therefore we had to switch to the children's program," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president for marketing and communication at Bellator, when he was asked for the broadcast.
""Peppa has pig," yes."
Scott Coker, business president of Bellator, said that they are going to adapt their programming to ensure that viewers in the United Kingdom will also have a chance in the future.
"I think, with a view to the return match, that we can solve this problem," said Coker.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning here on Sunday and we can't discuss anything until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
We're working on it.
When I made the transition, a lot of text messages went back and forth and believe me, these were not all as friendly.
We tried to solve it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't. It was a government problem.
I can promise this won't happen a second time.
We limited the broadcasts to five nights instead of six, as we normally already did, we tried to make it better for the fans, but we just went too far.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt 'inferior' because of his sexual orientation
Olympic in-law Tom Daley says he felt inferior during his youth because of his sexual disposition, but this gave him the motivation to be successful.
The twenty-four year old said that until he went to secondary education, he did not realize that 'not everyone is like me'.
In a conversation with Desert Island Discs on Radio 4 with Lauren Laverne, he said he had spoken out about homo rights to give others 'hope'.
He also said that the parenting had helped to reduce the value of winning during the Olympic Games.
Kirsty Young, the regular presenter of the long-term show has released a few months because of illness.
It appears as a crossover on Laverne's first program Daley told him that he felt less than others during his youth because it was 'socially not accepted to like both girls and boys'.
He said, "Until today are those feelings, the feeling of being less and the feeling of being different, really existing facts that have given me the strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "one", so that he wouldn't let people down if they finally found out about his nature.
The winner of two bronze Olympic medals has become a prominent campaigner for the LGBT community and used his presence at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year to call on more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke out because he felt happy that he could live openly without further consequences and that he wanted to 'hope' others.
The three-time world champion said that the fact that he fell in love with a man, the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Back, whom he met in 2013, "has totally surprised me".
Daley was married last year to the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than he, but said the age difference had never been a problem.
"When you have to endure so much," he took part in his first Olympic Games at age 14 and his father died of cancer three years later, it is difficult to find someone in your own age group who has experienced the same heights and lows.
The couple became parents in June of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said his "whole perspective" had changed.
"If you had asked me this question last year, I would have answered that it was all about winning a gold medal," he said.
"But you know what, there are more important things on earth than winning gold Olympic medals.
My gold Olympic medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father who died in 2011 at 40 years of age after receiving the diagnosis of brain cancer.
Daley said his father had not accepted that he would die and one of the last things he had asked was if they had already received the tickets for London 2012, because he wanted to be in the first row.
"I couldn't get it about my heart to say, you won't be there anymore to sit in the first row, Dad," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and not until his breathing actually stung and he died, I finally recognized that he was not invincible," he said.
The next year, Daley joined the 2012 Olympic Games and won bronze.
"I knew I had dreamed about this all my life, diving for a home-public during the Olympic Games, there's no feeling better," he said.
It was also the inspiration for his first choice of music, Proud by Heather Small, that had attacked him strongly on the way to the games and which he still got chicken skin from.
Desert Island Discs can be heard on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, not in form, on bank during the Ryder Cup on Saturday
The American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th match in the Ryder Cup, but he has to find his shape back to make no sad milestone.
Mickelson, who participates for the 12th time in the biannual event, was placed on the bench by the team captain Jim Furik for fourballs and foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of standing in the centre of the action, as he has often done for the United States, the winner of five majors divides the day between supporting his teammates and practicing on the driving rank, in an attempt to find out what it is calling for.
Since he was never known even at the peak of his career for his right-wing drives, the 48-year-old is not the ideal choice for Le Golf National's close fairways, where the long grass of the rough-fucking balls routinely punishes.
And if the job on itself is not even terrifying enough, in the ninth match on Sunday Mickelson comes the ever-accurate Francesco Molinari, winner of the British Open, against which is linked to newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans behind the four points at the beginning of the 12 single matches start well, Mickelson's match can be absolutely crucial.
Furijk has shown confidence in this man, although he could honestly be difficult to believe differently.
"He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a slap on the back, hit his arm around me and said he's ready for it tomorrow," said Furijk.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is included in the Hall of Fame and he has contributed so much to these teams, in the past, but also this week.
I probably didn't expect him to play two matches.
I had expected more of it, but it's as it is and it's the way we were supposed to act.
He wants to be there, just like everyone else."
Mickelson can improve Nick Faldo's record on Sunday for the highest number of Ryder Cup matches played.
It can also mean the end of a Ryder Cup career in which he has never entirely matched the highlights of his personal career.
Mickelson has won 18 matches, 20 lost matches and 7 equal games on his name, but Furik said that his presence had a certain incorruptible influence on the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's caught, he likes to joke with people and he's a great guy to have on the team," he explained.
"I think the younger players liked to fool him every now and then also last week, that was funny to see.
He has so much more to offer than only his game."
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows that great advantage can quickly disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that the comfortable advantage ahead of the single matches on the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily be turned into a less comfortable situation.
The Deen made his debut in the race in Valderrama in 1997, where the team with Captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead on the Americans, but finally the finish line passed with the smallest possible margin: 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a big advantage in Valderrama; we had a big advantage in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but just," said Bjorn, called here after he had seen the light of 2018 win with 5-3 on Friday and yesterday, good for an advantage of 10-6 on Le Golf National.
So history shows me and everyone else in the team that this isn't a game yet.
Everyone will have to make a full effort tomorrow.
Go ahead and carry out the plan on the right one.
It's not over until the points are on the plate.
We have a goal, and that's this trophie win, and we need to keep focused on that.
I keep telling you, I focus on the 12 players we can have, but we are also aware of the people on the other side, some of the best players in the world."
Rejoiced at the performance of his players on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never go ahead with things in this field.
A new challenge awaits tomorrow.
Tomorrow, the individual achievements come up, and that is another completely different discipline.
It's great to be out there with a partner if it's okay, but when you're alone, your abilities as a golfer are really tested.
That's the message you need to tell the players, try to get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
So now let your partner go and he must also get the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, its opponent, Jim Furk, expects that players perform better individually than partners. The exceptions are Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who conquered three of the four points.
Furijk himself has experience with both sides of this kind of change on the last day, as a member of the winning team in Brookline and as a loser when Europe realized the 'Miracle of Medinah'.
"I remember every damn word of that talk," he said in response to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the Captain in 1999, had picked up his players for the last day.
"We have 12 important matches for the bow tomorrow, but let's try to start well, like in Brookline, or like in Medinah.
When we have the momentum, there's a lot of pressure on the matches in the middle.
We have tuned our line-up on this and sent the men on their way in the order that we think is best and, you know, we're going to try to magic something out of the high hat tomorrow."
Thomas has the task of trying to give guidance to the opponent and put Rory McIlroy in front of the first match, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are the other Europeans in the first half of the battle order.
"I have chosen this group in this order, because I think we are so constantly covered," said Bjorn of his selection of single players.
The new warship of Germany postponed again
The latest frigate of the German Navy should have been in service in 2014 to replace the outdated warships from the time of the Cold War, but it will take at least one year before it is ready, due to faulty systems and rising costs, reported local media.
The launch of the 'Rheinland-Pfalz', the leading ship in the brand-new Baden-Wuerttemberg-Classe frigates, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newsmagazine Die Zeit that quotes a military spokesman.
The vessel should have been part of the Navy in 2014, but the worrying problems after delivery have plagued the fate of the ambitious project.
The four vessels of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class which the Navy ordered in 2007 are intended to replace the obsolete frigates of the Bremen class.
As far as we know, they have a powerful canon, a series of air defense and anti-ship missiles and a form of stealth technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic characteristics.
Other important features are longer maintenance cycles, it should be possible to employ the latest frigates up to two years in a row, far away from home ports.
However, the continuing delays mean that the advanced warships, intended to allow Germany to project its power overseas, are already outdated by the time they are taken into operation, notes Die Zeit.
Last year, the fatal frigate F125 already caught the headlines, when the German Navy officially refused to put the vessel in service and sent it back to the Bluhm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy sent a ship back to a ship builder after delivery.
There is little known about the reasons behind this return, but German media quoted a number of crucial 'software and hardware defects' that would make the warship useless if it were used in a combat mission.
Software defects were particularly important because the vessels of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class are operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, half the manpower on the frigates of the older Bremen class.
It also became clear that the ship has a serious overweight, which will reduce the performance and reduce the ability of the Navy to perform further upgrades.
The 'Rheinland-Pfalz' weighs 7,000 tonnes, which is twice as much as ships of a similar class used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the defective hardware, the price tag for the entire project, including crew training, will also be a problem.
It is said that this achieved a dazzling €3.1 billion compared to the original €2.2 billion.
The problems of the latest frigates in their grip are becoming extra important because of the recent warnings that the power of the German Navy is diminishing.
Earlier this year Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the parliamentary defence committee in Germany, recognized that the Navy actually "has a shortage of employable ships".
The officer said that the problem grew over time as a snowball because old ships were taken out of operation but no replacement vessels were delivered.
He complained that none of the frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class were available to be included in the Navy.
National Trust listens to the secret life of bats
New research carried out on an estate in the Scottish highlands is trying to reveal how bats make use of the landscape in their search for food.
The hope is that the findings will light up the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and will contribute to future conservation activities.
The study carried out by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland follows the ordinary and the small dwarf bat, the brown large-eared bat and the waterwing mouse at Inverewe Gardens in Western Ross.
Special recording equipment shall be placed at key locations around the estate to follow the activities of bats throughout the season.
Staff members of the NTS and volunteers will also carry out mobile investigations using hand detectors.
Expert audio analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of the calls of the bat and what kind of thing does.
A map of habitat and a report is then produced to give a detailed picture on the landscape scale of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, nature conservation adviser to the NTS, hopes that the results show the habitat's most important areas for bats and how they are used by the species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management, such as making meadows and how we can best maintain forests for bats and similar species.
Bat populations in Scotland and the rest of the UK have decreased significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development activities affecting dorms and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lightnings can also pose a risk, as can flight fans and certain chemical treatments of building materials and attacks by domestic cats.
Bats are not blind in reality.
Because of their night hunting habits, however, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching a prey.
They use an advanced echo-location technique to determine the position of insects and obstacles in their flight route.
At the NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, bats are taken very seriously.
The NTS has ten trained experts who conduct regular investigations, bedside inspections and sometimes rescue operations.
The organization has even set up the first and only reserve for bats in Scotland at the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight of the ten species of bats of Scotland live.
Landscape manager David Thompson says that the estate is the ideal territory for bats.
"Here in Thrave we have a great environment for bats," he said.
"We have the old buildings, many very old trees and the right habitat.
But so much is not yet known about bats, and that's why the work we do here and in other locations will help us to understand better what they need in order to thrive."
It stresses the importance of monitoring bats before maintenance is carried out, as the possible unconscious destruction of a sleeping place can result in the death of 400 female bats and their offspring, thus potentially destroying a complete local population.
Bats are a protected species and it is illegal to kill them, to bother or to disturb them or to destroy their sleeping places.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish official for the Bat Conservation Trust, has asked the public to make a contribution to help.
She said, "We still have to learn a lot about our bats and many of our species, we simply don't know how their populations are doing."
Ronaldo rejects charges of assault while his lawyers prepare to persecute a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo qualified accusations of assault as 'fake news' and said people want to 'promot themselves' by using his name.
His lawyers are about to sue the German weekly Der Spiegel, in which the allegations were published.
The top of Portugal and Juventus is accused of the assault of an American woman named Kathryn Mayora in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is also accused of paying her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Through a video for his 142 million followers on Instagram Live named Ronaldo, 33, a few hours after the allegations were reported, the reports 'fake news'.
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they say today, fake news," says the winner of five Golden Balls on camera.
"They want to promote themselves by calling themselves my name.
That's normal.
They want to become famous by calling my name, but that's part of the trade.
I am a happy man, and through and through" the football player added, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing a case in which they want to prosecute Der Spiegel for the accusations they called 'an unacceptable report of suspicions in the field of privacy', according to Reuters.
Christian Schertz, lawyer, said that the football player wants compensation for the 'moral damage for an amount corresponding to the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years'.
The alleged incident reportedly took place in June 2009 in a suite of Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After they met in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga, according to the report, went back to the football room, where, according to the accusation, he raped her anal, as read in the charge filed at the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and that he told her that he was a '99 percent' good guy, but that he is sometimes abandoned that 'one percent'.
The documents state that Ronaldo confirms that the couple had sex, but this was with mutual approval.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that photos of her injuries were taken in a hospital, but that she later agreed to an extrajudicial settlement because she was 'panged for the consequences' and because she was concerned about the 'public humiliation'.
The 34-year-old now says that she wants the scheme to be declared invalid because it has been permanently traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to go from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged assault and this summer left for the Italian giant Juventus in a deal worth € 100 million.
Brexit: the United Kingdom 'will have eternal regrets' as automakers leave
The United Kingdom 'will forever regret it' when it loses its position as world leader in car production after the Brexit, said Greg Clark, Minister of Economic Affairs.
He added that the 'careful' was that Toyota UK had said against the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, the company would temporarily suspend its production in the Burnaston factory, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Clark.
The Japanese autoproducer said that the impact of delays at the border would cost in the case of a 'no-deal Brexit' jobs.
The Burnaston factory, where the Auris and Avensis are made from Toyota, produced almost 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other countries in the European Union.
"My vision is that if Great Britain crashes from the EU at the end of March, we will see production shut down in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, the managing director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other car products in the UK, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also expressed their fears about the consequences of leaving the EU without agreement on the functioning of cross-border trade.
For example, BMW has already told us that it will close the Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
Most of the concerns concern car manufacturers about risks in the supply chain in the case of a 'no-deal Brexit'.
The Toyota production line is based on the 'just-in-time' principle, whereby every 37 minutes parts arrive from suppliers in the UK and in the EU for cars made on order.
If, on 29 March, the UK leaves the EU without a deal, there can be a disturbance at the borders which, according to industry, can lead to delays and lack of components.
Toyota cannot store stock in the Derbyshire factory for more than one day, so the company had to know, and that is why production would be stopped.
Clark said that Theresa May's Chequers plan for the future relationship with the EU is "exactly aligned to avoid those border controls".
"We must have a deal. We want the best deal, which will not only enable us to continue the current success, but also to take this opportunity," he told the listeners of BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"The evidence, not only from Toyota but also from other producers, is that we must be able to continue with this very successful set of supply chains."
Toyota could not say how long production would be stopped, but in the longer term warned that the additional costs would affect the competitiveness of the company and that it would ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years, and who represents the trade union Unite at the factory, said that his members are increasingly worried: "In my experience, once these jobs have been lost, they never come back.
A government spokesman said: "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Meeting Trump and Rosenstein can be delayed again, says the White House
The crucial meeting between Donald Trump and the deputy attorney-general Rod Rosenstein can be postponed for a week yet as the fight over the candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, who investigates the Russian influence of the elections, links between assistants from Trump and Russia and possible obstacle to the President's action.
The question of whether Trump is going to fire the deputy attorney-general and thereby endanger the independence of Mueller has kept the Washington gossip machine running for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of carrying a microphone to record conversations with Trump and to turn the president off through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied this report.
But when he went to the White House last Monday, rumors made the round that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, then at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he didn't want to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was moved to avoid a conflict with a hearing of the Senate Justice Committee, in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, would both testify.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to carry out a one-week investigation of the accusations against Kavanaugh, which slowed down the vote in the entire Senate.
On Sunday Sarah Sanders, the press chief of Trump, appeared on Fox News.
Asking for the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "No date has yet been set, it could be this week, but it could also be postponed a week, given all the other things going on with the Supreme Court.
But we'll see and I'll always want to keep the press up to date."
Some reporters had trouble with this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since 10 September.
Host Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said that the scarcity of press conferences was not caused by an aversion to the 'thinking' TV journalists, though, she added: "I will not deny that they are trying to attract attention."
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The President is doing more question-and-answer sessions for him than any president," she said, without providing evidence: "We've been looking at the figures."
Press conferences will still take place, said Sanders, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, that is infinitely better than talking to me.
We are trying to do that a lot, and you have seen us do that many times over the past few weeks, and that will take the place of a press conference when you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in public sessions or at press conferences with poets visiting.
Press conferences with the President alone are rare.
In New York this week, the president was able to demonstrate why, he made a frank and, at times, bizarre appearance for the collected reporters.
Minister for Health writes a letter on Brexit to employees of NHS Scotland from other EU countries
The Minister for Health has written a letter to the EU staff working in the NHS Scotland to express the gratitude of the country and the desire that they continue to work with the NHS after the Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent a letter of less than six months before the UK withdraws from the EU.
The Scottish government has already agreed to bear the costs of applying for a fixed status for EU citizens working for the decentralised public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer negotiations between the UK and the EU have continued, and this autumn the expected decisions will be taken.
At the same time, however, the UK government has also pushed up preparations for a possible scenario in which no deal is achieved.
I know this should be uncertain times for all of you.
That is why I would like to stress once again how much I appreciate the contribution of all staff, regardless of their nationality.
Collega from all over the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the NHS and offer benefits to the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we would like you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie underwent an emergency operation after head injury
The liner of the Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, underwent an emergency operation yesterday after he had suffered a major injury in the 31-27 lost match against the Vanderbilt Commodore, reported Mike Organ of the Tennessee.
Rod Reed, the chief coach of Tennessee State, told reporters that the accident took place shortly before rest.
"He came to the sideline and fell down a little more and more," said Reed.
The trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie direct oxygen on the sideline before they put him on a stretcher and took him along for further research.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had come out of the operating room at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "no details are yet known about the type/size of the injury" and Tennessee State trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a 'redshirt sophomore', is in his first season with Tennessee State after a transfer from Illinois.
He was handcuffed in a total of five times on Saturday before leaving the field, making him a total of 18 times this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher empties when they buy a house in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher empties when buying a house in the UK and the proceeds will be used to help the homeless according to new plans of the Conservatives
This action will have to neutralise Corbyn's success in attracting young voters
The increase in empties is levied on persons who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Ministry of Finance expects this to increase £120 million a year to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher empties when they buy a house in the UK and the extra proceeds will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn, who attracts young voters with promises to provide more affordable houses and to record this on many earners.
The increase in emptiness is levied on persons and firms who do not pay taxes in the UK, with additional revenue being raised in an attempt by the government to combat homelessness.
The surcharge, which comes on top of the current emptys, including the higher levels introduced two years ago for second houses and houses purchased for rent, can be up to three percent.
In this way, the Ministry of Finance expects to collect up to £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of the new building in London is bought by people who do not live in the UK. This means that prices are raised and it is difficult for starters to get a foot on the dwelling ladder.
Many prosperous areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become practically 'spook cities' because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
This new policy is coming just a few weeks after Boris Johnson had pleaded for a drop in emptiness to help young people buy their first house.
He accused large construction companies of holding the prices high by buying up land and not using it, and he called on May to abolish quotas on affordable houses to restore the 'domestic housing damage' in Britain.
Corbyn announced a remarkable series of housing reforms, including rental ceilings and an end to disfellowshipping 'without negligence'.
He also wants to give local authorities more opportunities to build new houses.
May said, "Last year I said that I wanted to spend my time as prime minister on restoring the 'British Dream', which makes life better for every new generation.
And that means that our faulty housing market needs to be restored.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it cannot be that it is as simple for people who do not live in the UK and for foreign companies to buy houses here as it is for hardworking British residents.
For too many people, the dream of having a home has become too vague a dream and the humiliation of life without a roof above the head is too real."
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate ambition is to manage Scotland'
Jack Ross, the head of Sunderland, says it's his 'ultimate ambition' to ever become manager of Scotland.
The Schot, 42, enjoys the challenge of reviving the club from northeastern England, which is currently in third place in League One, in three points of first place.
He went to the Stadium of Light last summer after he had returned to the Scottish Premiership the previous season of St Mirren.
"As a football player, I wanted to play for my homeland.
But I was selected for the B-team, and that was why Ross told Sportsound on BBC Scotland.
"When I was a child I often saw with my father Schotland playing at Hampden Park and it's something that keeps on attracting me.
However, this possibility would not come until I was successful in managing a club."
The predecessors of Ross as managers of Sunderland include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former boss of Alloa Athletic says that he was not intimidated to become the successor of these established names at a large club, earlier he had refused avantas of Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Succes for me is currently being measured by "Can I have this club returned to the Premier League?"
Because of the structure and facilities at this club, it should undoubtedly be in the Premier League," he says.
"It's not a simple task to achieve this, but I can't see myself as successful until I get the club back there."
Ross has only been working for three years as a manager, after a period as an assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months in the coaching group of Hearts.
He then helped Alloa recover from degradation to the third division and transformed St Mirren from the brink of degradation to winning the Championship in the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did during his career as a football player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a crossroads," he recalled the moment he took the lead at Alloa.
"I really believed that management was the right choice for me, much more than playing.
It sounds bizarre, because I did it pretty well, I earned quite well and knew some reasonable highlights.
But football can be heavy.
There's a lot of things you're confronted with weekly.
I still have that, given the stress and pressure of the trade, but management just feels good.
I always wanted to be a manager and now that I am real, I am so good in my skin, as I have never felt in my adult life."

The perfect time for a pint is 17:30 on a Saturday, reveals research
The summer heat wave has increased the revenue of British pubs who are struggling to survive, but has also put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Groups with pubs and bars saw sales increase by 2.7 percent in July, but revenue in restaurants was 4.8% less, showing the figures.
Peter Martin, of the CGA business advisory firm, who collected the figures, said: "Sustainable sunshine and the fact that England took part in the world championships longer than expected meant that July showed a similar pattern as June, when the pubs had 2.8% more revenue, with the difference that the restaurants were getting even harder now.
The fall of 1.8 percent in the turnover of restaurants in June, was only worse in July.
Pubs and bars that are aimed at drinking sales performed by far the best, with better LFL growth (like-for-like) than that restaurants went down.
Pubs which are also aimed at selling food are also members of the sun, but not as dramatic as the restaurants.
Looks like people just went out to drink.
In pubs and bars under management, the alcohol turnover was 6.6 percent higher for the month, while the food turnover was 3% lower."
Paul Newman of RSM, analysts for the leisure and hospitality industry, said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and impact of important social or sporting events remain the main factors in the market turnover.
It is no surprise, therefore, that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although a turnover of 4.8% year-to-year is particularly painful given the constant cost pressure.
The long, hot summer could not have come at a worse moment for the operators who set themselves on food and only learn time or give the more temperate temperatures of August so necessary."
Total turnover growth in the pub and restaurant industry, including new openings, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the decline in the introduction of new brands.
In the Case Peach Tracker, the turnover monitor for the public, bar and restaurant sector in the UK, the performance data are collected and analysed by 47 operational groups, with a joint turnover of £9 billion. This is the established benchmark of the industry.
One in five children has a secret social media account, which they hide from their parents
One in five children, some not over 11 years old, has a secret social media account, which they hide from parents and teachers, reveals a survey
Survey among 20,000 pupils from secondary schools revealed the growth in 'false Insta pages'
This news has strengthened the fear that sexual content will be posted
Twenty percent of the students say they have a 'head account' that they also show their parents
One in five children, some not over 11 years old, accounts for social media that keep them hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 students from secondary schools revealed a rapid growth in the 'false Insta accounts', a reference to Instagram, the site for sharing photos.
This news has strengthened the fear that sexual content will be posted.
Twenty percent of the students say they use a clean 'head account' that they show to their parents, while also having personal accounts.
A mother who died by chance on the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter discovered there a teenager who asked others to 'rape' her.
The research carried out by Digital Awareness UK and HMC (Headmasters" and Head Mistresses" Conference) of independent schools found that 40% of the 11 to 18-year-olds had two profiles and that half allowed to keep personal accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HCM, said: "It is disturbing that so many teenagers are lured into creating online spaces where they are not found by their parents and teachers."
Eilith Doyle becomes the 'voice of the athlete' in the Scottish athletic council
Eilith Doyle has been elected to the Council of the Scottish athletics world, as non-executive director at the general annual meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most decorated athlete in Scotland on the track and in the field and President Ian Beattie described her election as a great opportunity for sports drivers to learn about her extensive experience at an international level over the past ten years.
"Eilidh enjoys great respect in Scotland's athletic community, the UK and the world, and we are sure that Scottish athletics will benefit greatly from its election in the council," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I'm happy to be able to serve as a voice for the athletes and I hope I can make a contribution and help control the sport in Scotland."
The American who won the 200 meters and the 400 meters during the 1996 Games in Atlanta, two of his four gold Olympic medals, and who now regularly comments on the BBC, could no longer walk after a TIA.
He wrote on Twitter: "Today a month ago I had a TIA.
I couldn't walk anymore.
The doctors told me that only time will tell me if I will recover and to what extent.
It's been a terrible hard job, but I've been completely restored now, I've learned to walk again and do my flexibility exercises again today!
Thank you for all the expressions of support!"
Advertising for breast pump in which mothers are compared with cows, divides online opinion
A company that makes breast pumps has divided the online opinion with an advertisement in which nursing mothers are compared to cows that are milked.
In order to mark the introduction of what is called 'the most silent portable breast pump in the world', Elvie, consumer technology producer, has released an ironic music video-inspired advertisement to illustrate the freedom this new pump has to offer to battling mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a hay-filled barn on a song that contains lyrics like: 'Yes, I milk myself, but you can't see anything' and 'In case you didn't see it, these aren't udders, these are my breasts'.
The chorus then continues with: 'Pomps, pumps, pumps, I feed the babies, pumps, pumps, pumps, I milk the ladies'.
However, the advertisement, which was published on the Facebook page of the company, directly caused an online controversy.
The video has been watched 77,000 times and has attracted hundreds of comments, especially mixed comments from viewers, in which many people say that the 'horror' of the dairy industry is condoned.
"A bad choice to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they must be expected and delivered to produce milk, but in their case the babies are taken away within a few days after the birth" is written in a response.
Elvie’s breast pump fits discreetly in a feeding beha (Elvie/Mother).
Someone else said, "This is, of course, traumatic for mother and baby.
But yes, why don't we use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Another one added: "This ad is so far from reality."
Others defended the ad and a woman admitted that she found the song 'Hilarish'.
"I think this is a genius idea.
I'd buy one if I were still breastfeeding.
That pumping gave me the feeling of being a cow.
The ad's a little weird, but I haven't been looking for it too much.
This is a genius product" someone wrote.
Someone else had the following comment: "This is a funny ad, aimed at moms who are calves (often in the workplace or in a toilet) and then have the feeling of being just 'cow'.
This ad does not seem positive or negative at all about the dairy industry."
At the end of the video you will see the group of women who are dancing with the pump discreetly hidden in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the understanding that many women who fight are sometimes feeling like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is completely silent, has no wires or snakes and fits discreetly into a feeding bra, so that women have the freedom to move, hold their babies and even go out while they are on flasks.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother says: "The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it earned a tough and provocative introduction.
By making a comparison between battling mothers and dairy cows, we wanted to put the flasks and the associated challenges in the spotlights and at the same time show in a entertaining and understandable way how the new pump will provide an incredible sense of freedom.
This is not the first time Elvie's pump gets the front page.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on Marta Jakubowski's catwalk while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children silently moved to a tent camp on the border with Texas
The number of detained migrant children has reached a peak, although the number of monthly crossings has remained relatively unchanged, partly because the harsh rhetoric and harsh policies introduced by the Trump government make it more difficult to bring children to sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors themselves are undocumented immigrants and fear their own chance to stay in the country by registering for a child.
This risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households should print out their fingerprints and that these data will be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week Matthew Bonnence, a senior officer of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, announced in a testimony to the Congress that his organization has arrested dozens of people who have reported as sponsors for unaccompanied minors.
The organization later confirmed that 70% of the arrested had no prior criminal record.
"Over 80 per cent of the people who are sponsors or family members of the sponsors are illegal in this country and a large part of it are criminal strangers.
We're persecuting these people," said Mr. Bonnence.
In an attempt to process children faster, officials have introduced new rules, requiring some of them to appear before the court within one month of the start of the detention, instead of within 60 days, which was previously the standard, according to the staff at the shelter
Many of them will stand before the court through a video conference, rather than in person, to advocate their application for a legal status for an immigration judge.
Those who are deemed not to be eligible for assistance will be deported quickly.
The longer the children remain in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can cause violent eruptions or attempts to flee, according to the Shelter staff and reports that have come out of the system in recent months.
Lawyers said these concerns are stronger in a larger facility, such as Tornillo, where the signs that a child struggles are more often ignored because of the size of the camp.
They added that moving the children to the tent camp without giving them enough time to prepare for it emotionally or to say goodbye to friends can contribute to the trauma that many of them are already struggling with.
Syria recommends immediate withdrawal of the 'occupied forces' of the US, France and Turkey
In a speech for the United Nations General Assembly, Minister for Foreign Affairs, Walid Al-Muallem also called on Syrian refugees to return, even now that the war in the country is in the eighth year.
Moualem, who is also vice-premier, said that foreign troops are illegally on Syrian soil, under the pretext of combating terrorism and that 'this will be dealt with accordingly'.
"They have to withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he told the Assembly.
According to Moualem, the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more have been uprooted and driven away from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue with "this holy struggle until we have liberated all Syrian territories" from terrorist groups and from "a random illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly in training and consulting Kurdish troops and Syrian Arabs fighting President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops torn in the war - torn country.
With regard to refugees, Moualem said that the conditions are favourable for their return and he has no idea of spreading 'some Western countries irrational fears' which will keep most refugees away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate this return," he said.
"They are politicalizing a matter that should only be a humanitarian problem."
The United States and the European Union have warned that reconstruction aid will not be available to Syria until a political agreement is concluded between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
Diplomats from the United Nations say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in Idlib, the last major bulwark of the rebels, has created the possibility to start political talks.
The deal between Russia and Turkey has turned away from Russia’s supported Syrian troops on the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that this agreement has known 'clear deadlines' and said that he hoped that the military action will focus on jihadists, including fighters of the Nusra Front, which is linked to Al-Qaeda, which 'will be eradicated'.
Staffan de Mistura, UN Deputy, hopes to convene the first meeting of a new committee consisting of members of the government and the opposition to draft a constitution after the war for Syria and to pave the way for elections.
Moualem made it clear what the Syrian government's conditions to participate in the committee and said that the work of the panel should limit itself 'to reviewing the articles of the current constitution' and he warned against interference from outside.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Term
According to that logic, Mr. Trump would win the election in 2020 unless, as many 'liberal' viewers probably hope, his presidency was ended early on by a decommissioning procedure and scandals.
In what would undoubtedly be 'the most dramatic final of a presidency ever'.
At the moment, however, there are no signs of peekiness.
Since 2014, the viewers at CNN have more than doubled to 1.05 million and almost tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers during 'prime-time', compared to 1.7 million viewers four years ago, and 'The Rachel Maddow Show' of MSNBC is at the top of the reviews for cable programs with 3.5 million viewers on evenings with important news.
"This is a fire that attracts people, because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, the responsible behind the ABC drama 'Designed Survivor' a series about a minister who becomes president after an attack destroyed the Capitool.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy writer and author of 'Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club' has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston for the 2016 elections.
The driver told her he was going to vote for Trump.
Why? she asked.
"He said, "Because he makes me laugh," Skovell told me.
There's entertainment value in the chaos.
Of course, unlike all the others on TV, the story lines that come from Washington can influence or determine the future of Roe v. Wade whether immigrant families can reunite or influence the status of the world economy.
Turn off is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, it's going to be more than a well-informed citizen, when you get to know that you've been watching a panel of experts discussing the use of sources from the 'deep background' by Bob Woodward in his book 'Fear', who's talking about Paul Manafort's jacket that cost $15,000 ('a garment full of overconfidence' according to The Washington Post) and those discussing the implications of the colorful description by Stormy Daniels of the, uh, anatomy of Trump.
I'll never be able to look at Super Mario in the same way.
"What he does to give you the idea that it's about a reality show, is partly that he stops you something new every night," said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of 'Pawn Stars', about the rotating role distribution of the Trump show and the daily plot changes (a fight is going on with the N.F.L., Kim Jong-un praises).
You can't afford to miss an episode or you have the idea that you're running behind.
When I reached Fleiss earlier this week, it was sunny and 26 degrees out of his house on the north coast of Kaai, but he sat inside to watch MSNBC while he was recording CNN.
He could not pull off the screen, with Brett Kavanaugh who had to appear before the Senate Justice Committee and the future of the Supreme Court at stake.
"I remember we were doing all these weird shows, not so long ago, and people said 'this is the beginning of Western civilization'," Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but now it turns out they were right."

Money from outside flows into the most exciting interim elections for the House of Deputies
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania sees a flood of money, thanks to a redeployment of a constituency which requires two sitting national representatives to fight for the same seat.
The newly classified district of Pittsburg meets Democratic representative Conor Lamb, who acquired his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb must take it up against another sitting national representative, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, who has a lot of overlap with the new 17th district.
The maps were reclassified after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January held that the old districts were unconstitutional ('gerry mandate') to the benefit of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district has led to a campaigning party in the field of campaign financing between the financial arms of the two major parties, the DCCC (Democracy Campaign Congressional Committee) and the NRCC (National Republican Campaign Committee).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in a well viewed special election for the 18th constituency of Pennsylvania.
This seat had been occupied by a Republican for more than ten years and President Donald Trump had conquered this district with 20 percentage points difference.
According to political experts, the Democrats have a minor advantage.
The US considered punishing El Salvador for aid to China and has waived this
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognised Beijing and received little negative response from Washington.
Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and he owned a hotel in Panama until his partners put out the Trump Organization management team.
Officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs of the United States have decided to recall the American heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the 'recent decision to no longer recognize Taiwan' said Heather Nauert, the spokesman of the Ministry, in a statement earlier this month.
But punishment was only considered in the case of El Salvador, because the country received $140 million in American aid in 2017, for control of narcotics, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, including reductions in financial support and targeted visa restrictions, would have become painful for the Central American country with high unemployment and high murder rates.
While the internal meetings continued, North American and Central American officials held a high-level conference aimed at security and economic prosperity as a follow-up to a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step forward in the efforts to prevent migrants from leaving the United States.
But in mid-September, some government senior officials announced that they wanted the conference to continue, making it impossible to take all possible sanctions against El Salvador in advance.
The plan is now that Vice-President Mike Pence give a speech at the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance the government attaches to the meeting, say diplomats.
And the three American emissaries have returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without further lifting, without any hard messages about Washington's sanctions.
A spokesperson of the White House on behalf of Mr Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal debate, subject to anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an external analyst who is also close to the government and who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Study History
The next step may be the report of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller on the possible counter-effect of Trump's justice, for which serious evidence has now become public.
Mueller is also likely to focus his research on cooperation between Trump's campaign and Russia in Russia's attack on our elections.
If the Congress of Color changes, Trump must be responsible for that institution, just as he is ready to return to the electorate, and perhaps he should be responsible for a jury in a court.
These are a lot of myths, and I do not want to suggest that Trump's fall is inevitable, nor his equivalents in Europe.
There will have to be choices made by all of us, on both sides of the Atlantic, who will determine how long the battle will take.
In 1938 German officers were ready to execute a 'coup d'état' against Hitler, but only if the West had offered resistance and Czecho-Slovakia had supported Munich.
We failed and missed an opportunity to prevent the years of bloodshed that followed.
The course of history revolves around such points of view and the inexorable march of democracy is being accelerated or delayed.
Americans are currently confronted with several of these types of bending points.
What will we do if Trump fires adjunct attorney general Rod Rosenstein, the man who has the fate of running Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult position since this magazine reported that he, last year, had suggested making conversations with the president in secret and that he had speculated about the President's fitness for his office.
Rosenstein says the report from The Times is wrong.
"How will we react if the new requested investigation from the FBI to Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if he is appointed to the Supreme Court despite credible accusations of assault and unfair testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the mid-term elections for a Congress that will call Trump to account?
If we fail in these tests, democracy is waiting for a very long winter.
But I believe we will not fail by the lesson I have learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had ever occupied my ambassador home.
She survived, immigrated to America, and, 60 years later, sent me away to light candles before the Sabbath on that table on which a swastika was pictured.
With that as my inheritance, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans from Glasgow Rangers is optimistic about the match against Rapid Wien
Rangers receive Rapid Vienna on Thursday and know that after the impressive drawdown in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, a victory on the Austrians places them in a strong position to qualify in Group G of the Europe League.
Due to a kneeblesure, the civil societyer Graham Dorrans could not play his first match of the season until the 2-2 match at Villarreal, but he believes that the Rangers can use it as a springboard for better results.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal really has a good 11th." said the 31-year-old.
"We went into the competition with the idea that there was something to win and came out of the game with a point.
Maybe we could even have won at the end, but seen throughout the game, a similar game is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half, but when we came out in the second half we were the better team.
Coming Thursday is a new big European evening.
I hope we can get three points, but it's going to be a tricky game, because they also had a good result in their last match, but if the public is behind us, I'm sure we can push through and get a positive result.
Last year has certainly been hard, of all that happened with my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now there is a feel good factor on the club.
The team is good and the boys really enjoy it.
Hopefully, we can push through now, leave us behind the season and become successful again."
Women cannot sleep because of fear of retirement
Despite the fact that the participants in the survey had a clear idea of how they wanted to receive care, few people discuss this with their relatives.
About half of the participants in the National Research said that they were talking to their husbands about the cost of long-term care.
And only 10% said they had talked to their children about this.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they do not take the steps needed to conduct this conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice-president for Life Insurance at Nationwide.
Here we start.
Talk to your spouse(o)t(e) and the children: You can't prepare your family to care if you don't know your wishes well in time.
Work with your consultant and your family to discuss where and how you will receive care, as these choices may be a significant factor in determining the costs.
Take a financial advisor in your arms: Your advisor can also advise you on how to pay these expenses.
Your long-term long-term financing choices may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with cash value to help cover these expenses, or use own funds as insurance as long as you have money.
Create legal documents: Avoid legal struggle when insurance is to be used.
Ensure a health care authority, so that you can identify a trusted person who can overlook your medical care and ensure that the professionals comply with your wishes in case you cannot communicate.
Also consider an authority for your financial affairs.
In that case, you select a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and make sure that the invoices are paid if you can't do this yourself.
Don't forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly father or mother is experiencing a medical emergency and is on the way to the hospital.
In that case, can you answer questions about medication and allergies?
Please specify these details in a written plan, so that you have the information in your hands.
"It's not just the financial matters that matter, but who are the doctors?" Martin asked.
"What medications are used?
Who cares for the dog?
Make sure that plan comes."
Man shot several times with air pressure gun in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air pressure gun as he walked home after a night out.
The victim, forty plus, was in the Oxford Grove neighborhood of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was hit in his chest, belly and hand.
Agents described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as a 'voluntary act'.
The victim didn't see who attacked him.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police have called witnesses to report.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a powerful earthquake and a tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and it is expected that the death toll will continue to rise.
Because the means of communication have been disabled, the official authorities have not yet received information from Donggala County, a region north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake with a force of 7.5 on the Richter scale.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people have been evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Celebes and lies at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Celebes, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th birthday when the tsunami joined.
Donggala is a regent that extends over 300 km along the coast of northwest Celebes.
The rule, an administrative region just below a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main activities in the economy of the province of Central Celebes, in particular in the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but they are mostly located in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Celebes.
Palu and Donggala have been regularly affected by tsunamis in the last hundred years, according to the Agency for the control of Indonesia's disasters.
In 1938, a tsunami claimed more than 200 lives and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck in the west of Donggala in 1996, with nine deaths.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific Ring of Fire and is often affected by earthquakes.
The following is a list of some of the most severe earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Atjeh on north Sumatra on 26 December caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries and claimed a total of 226,000 lives along the coasts of the Indian Ocean, more than half of which in Atjeh.
2005: A series of heavy earthquakes took place on the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and the beginning of April.
Hundreds of people were killed on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake with a power of 6.8 on the Richter scale took place south of Java, the most densely populated island of Indonesia, and caused a tsunami that invaded the south coast and claimed nearly 700 lives.
2009: An earthquake with a force of 7.6 on the scale of Richter found the city of Padang, capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people found death.
2010: An earthquake of 7.5 on the Richter scale found one of the Mentawai Islands, off the coast of Sumatra, and caused a tsunami of more than 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and demanded about 300 human lives.
2016: A shallow earthquake hit the regent of Pidie in Atjeh and caused destruction and panic, because the people were reminded of the destruction of the deadly earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
This time, no tsunami followed, but more than 100 people found death through crashing buildings.
2018: Several earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, where more than 500 people were killed, for the most part on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and caused thousands of tourists to be temporarily stranded.
Oldest son of Sarah Palin arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of Sarah Palin, former governor of Alaska and candidate for Vice-Presidentship, was arrested on charges of domestic violence.
Palin, 29 from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interference on a report of domestic violence and the offering of opposition during the judgment, according to a report released Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a woman was trying to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took the phone from her.
Palin is held in custody in the house of conservation Mat-Su with a $500 bail, KTUU reported.
He appeared for the judge on Saturday and declared himself 'no excuse, sure' when this was asked, the network reported.
Palin is charged with three class A infringements, which means he can be sentenced to one year in prison and fined up to $250,000.
He is also charged with a class B infringement, which is punishable with a day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
It is not for the first time that Palin is charged with criminal offences.
In December 2017, he was accused of mistreatment of his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged abuse.
This case now serves in the Veteran Court of Alaska.
In January 2016 he was accused of domestic abuse, interference in a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon influenced by the incident.
His girlfriend claimed he had hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized in 2016 by a veteran group, after having linked the violent behavior of her son to PTSS, which he would have remained in his service in Iraq.
Indonesia, earthquake, tsunami: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday.
The earthquake with a force of 7.5 on the Richter scale has led to a tsunami and has destroyed thousands of houses.
Electricity and communication networks are disabled while the number of deaths is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake took place just next to the center of Celebes, which lies northeast of Jakarta, the Indonesian capital.
There are video circulations on social media that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami reached the coast.
Federal prosecutors demand a rare death penalty for suspect of a terrorist attack in New York City
Federal prosecutors in New York claim the death penalty for Sajfoello Sajpov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York City, with eight people killed, a rare punishment that has not been executed in this state since 1953.
Sajpov, 30, used a rented truck from Home Depot according to the charge to perform an attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, in which he overturned pedestrians and cyclists who came on his path in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors will have to prove that Sajpov 'wildly' killed the eight victims and caused serious physical injuries 'absorbably', according to the statement of intent in which the death penalty is demanded, which has been lodged in the Southern District of New York.
For both charges, the death penalty is possible, according to the document submitted to the Court.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury approved the charges with 22 charges, including eight charges of murder for a racket, typically a charge used by federal prosecutors against organized crime, and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required 'substantial planning and preparation' according to the prosecutors and described the way Sajpov carried out the attack as 'bruising, cruel and corrupt'.
"Sajfoello Habiboellaevich Sajpov has caused injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlie, Hern Ferruchi, Hernang Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco" is in the statement of intent.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It is more than ten years since, in the Southern District of New York, a case was brought in which the death penalty was demanded.
The suspect, Khalid Barnes, was sentenced to the murder of two drug suppliers but was ultimately sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time that the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple executed after two years before they had been sentenced to spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
The Rosenbergs were executed by the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Sajpov, from Uzbekistan, did not show any remorse in the days and months after the attack, according to the judicial documents.
He let the detectives know that he felt good about his deed, she the police.
Sajpov told the authorities that he was inspired to execute the attack after viewing videos of ISIS on his phone, according to the charge.
He also asked to hang the flag of ISIS in his room in the hospital, told the police.
He pleaded not to be guilty of suing 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Sajpov, said that he was 'naturally disappointed' with the decision of the prosecutors.
"We think the decision to demand the death penalty instead of accepting a debt in exchange for a life-long prison sentence without the possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all those concerned," said Patton.
Sajpov's defense had previously asked the prosecutors not to demand the death penalty.
Conservative Member says NIGEL FARAGE should lead the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised today to mobilise a "people's army" during a protest at the Conservative Party Conference.
The former leader of Ukip said that politicians should feel the 'heat' of the Eurosceptics, while one of Theresa May's own MEPs suggested that he should lead the negotiations with the EU.
The conservative backbencher Peter Bone told the participants at the Birmingham march that the UK would 'be out already' if Mr. Farage Brexit had been Minister.
But the challenge that May faces in reconciling the highly divided ranks is underlined by two conservatives who are pro-Remain and who participate in a separate protest meeting against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister struggles to keep her Chequers compromise on the ride while it is under attack by Brexites, Remainers and the EU.
Fellows insisted that she will continue and will try to make a deal with Brussels despite the setbacks, thus forcing Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and 'chaos'.
At a meeting of Leave Means Leave in Solihull, Bone said that he wants to throw 'Chequers into the trash basket'.
He suggested that Farage should be knighted and given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he turned out the service, we'd be out of it now," said Bone.
The Wellingborough MP added: "I will support Brexit, but we have to throw Chequers into the trash basket."
In order to clarify his opposition to the EU, he said: "We did not fight in two world wars to be subordinated.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Bone suggested that the public opinion had been changed since the 2016 referendum: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay in the EU is completely false."
The conservative Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns also participated in the march and told reporters: "I'm just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequers is unpopular with the general public, the opposition is not going to vote, it is unpopular within our party and with our activists going from door to door and ensuring that we are elected.
Drop Chequers and listen."
In a targeted message for May, she added: "Premiers keep their job when they keep their promises."
Farage told the meeting that politicians must 'feel hot' if they want to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"This is a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them, "We don't let you get away with this."
In a message to the enthusiastic masses, he added: "I want you to give up our political class, which is about to betray Brexit.
We are mobilising the national army of this country that has caused us victory in the Brexit referendum and we will never rest until we have become an independent, sovereign, proud United Kingdom again."
In the meantime Remainers marched through Birmingham and closed this march with a two-hour meeting in the city center.
A small group of activists waved with flags on which Tories Against Brexit stood, after the establishment of this group in the weekend.
Lord Adonis, a member of the Labour High House, made jokes about the security problems of a party app of Conservatives at the beginning of their conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can provide IT systems and all technology for Canada plus, for the non-smoker border, for free trade without frontiers in Ireland," he added.
It's a full farce.
There's no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Warren's plan to 'go and think well' about presidential candidacy
Senator Elizabeth Warren says that after the elections in November, "she will think well about her candidacy for the Presidency."
The Boston Globe reports that the Democrat from Massachusetts told about her future at a meeting in a town hall in west Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critique of President Donald Trump, wants to be re-elected in November against Geoff Diehl, Republican Member who was co-president of the Trum campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
She has been the center of speculation that she might be fighting Trump in 2020.
The event in Holyoke on Saturday afternoon was her 36th meeting with voters in a town hall since Trump came into power.
A present asked her if she would be elected for the Presidency.
Warren answers that it's time for women to go to Washington to restore our flawed government and that includes a woman at the top."
Arrest after shooting Wayde Sims from LSU
The Baton Rouge police, Louisiana, announced Saturday that a suspect was arrested after the shooting of Wayde Sims, LSU basketball player on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at an ET press conference at 11:00.
They released a video of the shooting incident on Friday and asked for help in identifying the man shown in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the campus of Southern University on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims got a gunshot wound in the head and died of its consequences," said police officer Murphy J. Paul to the press on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wayde stepped forward to defend a friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson has been questioned and has known to have been present at the crime scene, owned by a gun and shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson has been arrested without further incidents and is held in custody in the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims was a junior player of 1.98 meters who grew up in Baton Rouge. He played in 32 games and started the last season in 10 matches. He had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per match.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after Sebastian Vettel has let him win after orders from team
When Valtteri Botta qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that Mercedes team orders would play a role in the race.
Bottas knew a good start from pole position and left Hamilton almost completely in the cold when he defended his position and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went into the pit and let Hamilton drive in the busy tail of the group, something that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes went into the pit later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton came back on top of a wheel-on-wheel-action, allowing the Ferrari rider to leave room with reluctance on the inside after a double movement in the third curve.
Max Verstappen started from the last place and was seventh after the first round on his 21st birthday.
He was then the leader of the race for some time, because he stayed with his choice of tires and mingled on a fast finish, allowing him to catch up with Kimi Raikkonen for the fourth place.
In the 44th round, he finally went to the pit, after which he could not increase his speed in the remaining eight rounds, making Raikkonen fourth.
It's a hard day because Valtteri did his best all weekend. He was a real gentleman and left me behind.
The team did its best for the places one and two" said Hamilton.
That wasn't a good body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at an election meeting on Saturday about the fact that she did not insist on being the source of Christine Blasey Ford's leaked letter, in which the candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, was accused of assault.
Speaking at an election meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention the testimony given by Ford to the Senate Justice Committee. Instead, he indicated that what took place in the Senate showed that people could be 'common, unkind and untruthful'."
"The only thing that can happen and the beautiful show that takes place the last days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you are the people who are angry and mean and unkind and untruthy," he said.
"When you look at the press releases and the leaks and then they say 'Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you lick?
You remember her answer, you leaked the document - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't lick."
Well, wait a minute.
No, we didn't leak," he added, in an imitation of the senator.
In July, the letter in which the allegations to the address of Kavanaugh were sent to Feinstein by Ford and it was leaked in September, but Feinstein denied that her office was the leak.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't lick her story," said Feinstein to the committee, according to The Hill.
"She asked me to go with her confidentially, and I treated it confidentially, as she had asked."
But the president didn't seem to believe her denial and he commented on it during the meeting on Saturday night: "I'll tell you what, that wasn't a good body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
Further, with his defense of the Supreme Court candidate, accused by three women of sexual misconduct, the President suggested that the Democrats used the accusations for their own purposes.
"They are determined to take back power, with all the necessary means.
You see the meanness, the indifference, they don't give anything about who they're hurting, who they have to drive to take power and get the control back," the president said, according to a Mediaite report.
Elite League: Dundee Stars vs Belfast Giants: 5-3
Patrick Dwyer made two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars compensated the loss of Friday in the Elite League against Belfast Giants by winning the return match with 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants had two goals led by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie took the home plow by the side before Dwyer put the Giants back in the lead.
Francois Bouchard made the equalizer for Dundee, before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen with two goals guaranteed victory.
It was the third loss in the Elite League this season for the men of Adam Keefe, who had to make a backlog on Friday evening to defeat Dundee with 2-1 in Belfast.
It was the fourth time this season that the two teams met, where the Giants won the previous three races.
The opening hall of Dwyer came in the fourth minute at 3:35 on an assistant from Kendall McFaul. David Rutherford gave the assistant with which Beauvilier doubled the lead, four minutes later.
In a busy opening period Sullivan returned the home team to the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt gave the lead to the equalizer of Cownie at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure that the Giants entered the first rest with an advantage when he made his second goal of the evening at the end of the first period.
The home team recaptured and Bouchard brought them back to an equal position with a power-play-goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran then combined well to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the game, late in the second period. He took care of the victory with the fifth goal for his team, halfway in the last period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of the last five games, play at home against Milton Keynes in their next Friday match.
Air traffic controller dies, while ensuring that hundreds can escape the earthquake in an airplane
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is honored as a hero after he died because he made sure that an aircraft with hundreds of people could rise safely on board.
More than 800 people have been killed and many have been missing after a severe earthquake struck the island of Celebes on Friday; an earthquake that then caused a tsunami.
Powerful aftershocks still plague the area and many are buried under the tip in the city of Palu.
Despite the fact that his colleagues fled for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Guchtan Agung refused to leave his post in the wild to-and-again moving traffic tower of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
He continued to ensure that flight 6321 from Batik Air, which was ready on the starting track at that time, could rise safely.
Then he jumped out of the traffic tower when he thought it was on a crash.
He died later in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, a spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said that his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, reported ABC News from Australia.
We had a helicopter scheduled for Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter had reached Palu.
"It breaks your heart when you hear it," he added.
In the meantime, the authorities fear that the death toll could rise to the thousands and the country's disaster control agency indicated that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"Men assumes that the death toll continues to rise because many bodies are under the rubble and have not yet been reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Waves reaching a height of two feet [6 m] have destroyed Palu, where on Sunday a mass funeral ceremony will be held.
Military and commercial aircraft provide assistance and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a mother of 35 years, told Sky News: "Every minute bodies are brought in by ambulances.
Clean water is scarce.
Minimarkets are looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said: "The Indonesian Red Cross is wrapped in a race to help survivors, but we do not know what they will find.
This is a tragedy already, but it can get much worse."
President Joko Widodo of Indonesia arrived in Palu on Sunday and he said to the present military: "I appeal to you all to work day and night so that all the tasks necessary for the evacuation are completed.
Are you ready?" reported CNN.
Indonesia was already hit by earthquakes in Lombok this year, where more than 550 people were killed.
Air Niugini now says that one man is missing after a crash in the lagoon
The airline operating the flight crashed in a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says that one man is missing after they had previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew members had safely left the sank plane.
Air Niugini said in a press release that is missing one male passenger on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said they worked with the local authorities, hospitals and detectives to find the man.
The air carrier did not respond immediately to the questions for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped to rescue the other passengers and crew members, after the plane had become watery during landing at the airport of the Chuuk Islands.
The authorities announced on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday and that the condition of everyone was stable.
What the crash has caused and what is the exact order of events remains unclear for the time being.
The airline and the American Navy both say that the plane has landed in the lagoon and missed the runway.
Some witnesses believe that the plane has been shot across the runway.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said the plane approached the airport very low.
"That's good news," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he himself and some others succeeded in waving the water that came to their aid to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He also said that the stewardesses were panicking and screaming and that he had a no serious head wound.
The American Navy announced that seamen working in the vicinity of a yard also helped in rescue work by bringing people to the coast with an inflatable boat before the plane sank further in the about 30 meters deep water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network show that over the last 20 years 111 people have been killed in crashes of air carriers registered with the PNG, but not related to Air Niugini.
Analist sets the timeline of the night a woman is burned alive
The prosecutor closed his requisitor on Friday in the reopening trial of a man accused of the live burning of a woman in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, analyst of the U.S. Department of Justice, witnessed for a few hours as a witness in the field of information analysis.
He made it clear to the jury how he had used the phone call details to record the movements of the 29-year-old suspect, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, in the night she was alive.
Rowlett said that he had received the location data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was at Chambers on the night of her death, which was in contradiction with his previous claims, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers during the time he claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford again.
Sanford was in the witness bench on Saturday and told me he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he told me he was at Sanford's truck during that night, Sanford said that he was "lying because my truck was then in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis had said that he knew Chambers about two weeks when she died.
The cell phone records indicated they didn't know each other until one week.
Rowlett said that at some time after the death of Chambers, Tellis knew the text messages, calls and contact details of his phone.
"He knew her from his life," said Hale.
The defense starts on Sunday with the closing arguments.
The judge said he expected the jury to start the deliberations later that day.
The High Breed: What is Conscious Hiphop?
A hiphoptrio wants to discuss the negative image of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol states that hip hop is alienated from the origin with political opinions and the mapping of social problems.
They want to return to the roots and make 'conscious hiphop' popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently had a resurgence in Britain by artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black?!
A New York child girl sues a couple for the judge because of a 'racist' text
A New York child girl sues a couple for the judge for discriminatory reasons, after she received an incorrect text in which the mother complained about 'against such a black'.
The couple deny being a racist and call the trial 'expressing'.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, showed her horror when she discovered that the new child girl, Giselle Maurice, turned out to be a negroid woman when she met her on her first working day in 2016.
"NEEEE WERE ZO'N ZWARTE," Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a message to her husband.
Instead of sending it to her husband, however, she sent it to Mrs Maurice only twice.
According to the American newspaper The New York Post, Plasco-Flaxman, who felt inconceivable, fired Ms. Maurice when she realized her blunder. She explained that her former child girl, who was Afro-American, had done bad work, and that she had therefore expected a Philippine.
Ms. Maurice was paid for a workday and was then sent home by taxi.
Now Maurice charges the couple for the court to get a compensation of $ 350,-- a day for the 6 months for which she was hired to bake internally with the family, although without contract.
"I want them to feel that you just don't do this," Maurice said last Friday in the New York Post, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple turn their backs on the claim that she is a racist by saying that it was reasonable to fire Maurice after being afraid, by having insulted her, that they could no longer trust her.
"My wife sent her a message that she didn't want to send her.
She's not a racist.
We're not racists', husband Joel Plasco told the New York Post.
'But would you leave your children to someone who insulted you, even if it was by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Don't worry about it."
Compared to the trial with 'expressing', Plasco said that his wife was expecting a baby in two months and was 'in a very difficult situation'.
"Are you going to persecute someone like that?"
That's not so conspicuous' the investment banker added to it.
While the case is still in the process, the public opinion is quick to captulate the couple on social media, where they are worked out for their behaviour and reasoning.
The publishers of Paddington feared that the public would not be very interested in a talking bear, reveals newly revealed letter
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the approval of the book, said of the letter: 'It is difficult to stand in the shoes of someone who reads it for the first time, before the first publication.
With what we know now about the enormous success of Paddington, it's very pleasant."
She told her father who, before he was inspired to write the children’s book about a small toy bear, if cameraman worked at the British channel BBC, was optimistic about whether his book would be rejected. She added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book ‘bittersweet’ felt after his death last year.
About Paddington, who describes her as 'a very prominent member of the family', she said that her father was secretly proud of the ultimate success.
She said, "He was a quiet, modest man."
'But because Paddington was so alive for him, it almost seemed like a child's performance; you're proud while you didn't do anything for it yourself.
I think he was about the success of Paddington.
Although Paddington was the creation of his own imagination, he honored the bear himself for the success.'
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her by phone.
Immediately after the landing, her daughter was taken to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where the doctors tried to save her life in vain.
'Nad had called several times to say that it looked very bad and that it was expected she wouldn't get it,' said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then Nad's phone call came to say that she would die in two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much.
We'll be together soon.
Then I'll be back with you.
The medications the doctors had given her to keep her heart pumping slowly got worked out and left her body.
She had died for some time before, and this process turned everything off.
I could only sit there, knowing what was going on.
I couldn't be sorry, yell, or cry, because I was in the middle of a lot of people and families.
I really had to be big."
Finally, Mrs Ednan-Laperouse, who now mourned the death of her daughter, stepped into the plane with the other passengers, who had no idea what trial she was to experience.
"No one knew," she said.
"I sat down with my head and the tears kept coming.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight I got an overwhelming feeling of compassion for Nad.
I felt he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Rolling women paste messages on bridge to prevent suicide
Two women who have been lost by suicide make themselves strong in preventing others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys record inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call in need for help on a bridge in Wales
Ms. Davis was her son, Tyler, 13 years old when he became depressed for the first time and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel like I'm feeling every day," she said.
Ms. Davis, 45 years old and residing in Lydney in the English county of Gloucestershire, relates that her son was a promising chef with an attractive grin.
"He was known for his smile.
They always said that his smile lit every room."
Yet he already stopped working for his death because he was deep in the well."
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 years old, found him after he had robbed himself of life.
Mrs Davis said, "I am constantly worried that a chain reaction is coming."
Mrs Davis has made the cards, 'to let people know that there are others you can go where you can go and what you can talk to, even if it's just a friend.
Don't keep quiet - talk about it."
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs. Davies for years, lost Mark who was her partner for 15 years, not long after his mother died.
"He didn't say he felt sad or depressed or something," she said.
'A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He was completely on the ground on Christmas Day - when the children took out their gifts he didn't look at them at all or something.'
She said his death was a big trauma for them, but they have to process it: "It's tearing the whole family apart.
It drives us apart.
But we must all continue and keep fighting."

Brett Kavanaugh's future uncertain while FBI is starting research
'I thought that if we could actually get what he is asking for; an investigation limited in time and size, then we might be able to create more unity again,' said Mr Flake last Saturday, to which he added, that he was afraid that the committee was falling 'out of each other', in the middle of a firmly anchored patchage within the party.
Why did Mr Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to conduct an investigation?
Their restraint has everything to do with timing.
The mid-term elections have been seriously hampered in five weeks, on 6 November and, as expected, the Republicans have been making efforts to get their husbands elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush has already called with members of the U.S. Senate to praise Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush, and thus met his wife Ashley, who was the Bush' personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI's finished the report?
Then there will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 republicans and 49 democrats are currently sitting.
It is not yet clear whether Mr Kavanaugh can count on at least 50 votes in the Senate, and that would allow Mike Pence, Vice-President, to issue the determining vote to confirm the appointment of Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
Number of runners in North Korea 'overlay' under Kim
According to a South Korean legislator, the number of North Korean conquerors has fallen to South Korea since Kim Jong-un came into power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug, quoted from data from the South Korean Ministry of Unity, states that last year there were 1,127 equidae compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park notes that stricter border controls between North Korea and China, and higher penalties for traffickers, are the main factors for the decline.
Pyongyang has not responded publicly.
The vast majority of the North Korean conquerors are ultimately offered the South Korean nationality.
According to Seoul sources, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most fled through China, which has the longest outer border with North Korea and where you can make the crossing easier than in the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ; Demilitarized Zone) between the two Koreas.
China views the conquerors as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often puts them out with violence.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still formally capable of war, have improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang, mainly talking about the stagnated negotiations on denuclearisation.
This meeting took place after the historic meeting between the US President Donald Trump, and Kim Jong-un, in Singapore in June, where they agreed largely to work towards the nuclear decommissioning of the Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, however, the North Korean Minister for Foreign Affairs, Ri Yong-ho, accused the US of the lack of progress in lifting US sanctions since then.
'Without faith in US action, there is also a lack of confidence in our national security, and under these circumstances there is no first step of unilateral disarmament,' said Mr Ri during a speech for the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh 'hysterical', and finds him incompetent to serve in the Supreme Court
Chairman of the House of Deputies, Nancy Pelosi, called candidate for the U.S. Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh 'hysterical', and found him unable to serve in the Supreme Court
Pelosi made the comments in an interview, Saturday at the 'Texas Tribune Festival' in Austin, Texas.
'I couldn't help thinking that if a woman behaved like this, they would call her 'hysterical',' Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Committee on Justice on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emmotiond the accusations that he would have abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford sexually when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emmotioned; sometimes he almost shouted and was particularly upset when he told about his family and his high schooling.
He also strongly condemned the democrats in the committee, calling the accusations against him 'great and coordinated character murder' organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi stated that she found that Kavanaugh’s testimony proved that he was not fit to serve the Supreme Court because he was full of prejudices against the democrats.
'I think he disqualifies himself with his statements and the way he talks about the Clintons and the Democrats', says Pelosi.
Pelosi protested when she was asked if she would try to impose an impeachment proceedings against Kavanaugh if he were appointed, and the Democrats would get the majority in the House of Deputies.
"I can say this about it; if he doesn't tell the truth in Congress, or against the FBI, he's not only unfit for the Supreme Court, but also for the court where he serves now," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Court of Justice of the District of Columbia (usually abbreviated D.C.) District Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that as a democrat, she was concerned that Kavanaugh would speak out against the 'Affordable Care Act or Roe v Wade' (Law for Payable Health Care) because Kavanaugh is known as a conservative judge.
Kavanaugh ignored questions about the revision of certain decisions of the Supreme Court during the confirmatory hearings.
'Don't expect us to stand up cheering if a hysterical, prejudiced person is now appointed in the Supreme Court', says Pelosi.
Women just have to admit to this.
It is a just tyrade of months and years of pent - up anger that overflows, and she can only cry to get it out.
'We're gonna cry when we get angry,' Mrs. Steinem said to me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's weird, do you?"
She continued: 'I was greatly helped by a woman who was in charge of something and who said that she too was crying when she got angry. She developed a method in which she would cry every time she got angry. To the one she spoke to, she said, 'You may think I'm sad because I cry.
I'm angry."
And then she just cried on.
I just thought that was brilliant."
Tears are partially justified as expressions of anger, because crying is essentially unconquered.
One of my best memories from a former job, in a man-dominated office, was when I had to cry horribly because I was angry. An older woman, a cold manager who was a little afraid of everybody, grabbed me into my neck and dragged me into a stairwell.
"Never let them see you cry," she said to me.
They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and happy they got you on the closet.
Patricia Schroeder, then a member of Congress in Colorado for the Democrats, had worked for Gary Hart on his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Mr Hart was involved in an extramarital affair aboard a boat called 'Monkey Business' (informally means that 'caten craad' or 'opens') and withdrew from the race, the deeply disappointed Mrs. Schroeder felt that there was no reason why she would not put herself to the stand.
"It wasn't a thoughtful decision," she told me laughing 30 years later.
"There were seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone was talking about "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Because the campaign was already advanced, she was behind with fundraising, so she vowed not to join in if she couldn't raise $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters, who would give to men $1,000, wanted to give her only $250.
"Do they think I might get a discount?" she asked.
When she gave her speech in which she announced that she would not yet start a formal campaign, she became so overcome by feelings - of gratitude for the people who had supported her, of frustration because the system made it so difficult to collect money, and reach voters rather than delegates, and of anger about sexism - that she suffocated into it.
'Men will have thought I was getting a nervous breakdown,' Ms. Schroeder recalled about how the media responded to her.
'They'll have thought Kleenex was my company sponsor.
I remember thinking, what will they put on my gravestone?
"She cried"?
How the US-China trade war can be beneficial to Beijing
The opening balances of the US-China trade war were overwhelming, and although the fight has not been fought for a long time, a long-term gap between the two countries could be beneficial for Beijing, according to experts.
Donald Trump, the U.S. President, gave the first warning earlier this year by increasing taxes on major Chinese export products, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation became known this week when new effective, increased tax rates were revealed at $200 billion (€150 billion) of goods; half of all goods from China's US income.
Beijing has taken natural reprisals every time, most recently by increasing rates from 5 to 10% for 60 billion dollars in American goods.
China has committed to equalizing the US every time, and the world on a second-largest economy is probably not going to blink with its eyes fast.
In order to bend Washington, requests have to be granted, but public bending for the US is far too painful for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts claim that if Beijing plays smart, the trade war with the US, China could support it positively in the longer term, as the mutual dependence on the two economies decreases.
'The fact that a rapid political decision could create conditions in Washington or Beijing, which would enable one of the two countries to fall into an economic free trap, is really far more dangerous than spectators have previously recognized', says Abigail Grace, a research employee of the 'Center for a New American Security', a think tank specializing in national security issues, focusing on Asia.
Syria is 'ready' to allow refugees to return, according to Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help to rebuild the country destroyed by a war that lasts more than seven years.
In his speech to the UN General Assembly, Minister for Foreign Affairs, Walid al-Moualem, stated that the conditions in his country improved.
"Today, the situation on the spot is more stable and safer, thanks to the progress made in combating terrorism," he says.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists and normalize the situation on the ground.
All the circumstances are now present for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they have had to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that threaten their daily life and existence.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have escaped their country since the war began in 2011.
It is estimated that some six million people live in the country who need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would welcome help in restoring the destroyed country.
However, he stressed that Syria would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that had subsidized the rebellion.
Europe wins the 'Rider Cup' in Paris
The European team won the '2018 Ryder Cup' by defeating the American team with a final score of 16.5 against 10.5 on the golf course 'Le Golf National' to the southwest of Paris in France.
The US has now lost six consecutive times on European soil, and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the title when the Danish commander Thomas Bjorn's team won the necessary number of 14.5 points to defeat the US.
The star of the American team, Phil Mickelson, who was struggling almost the entire tournament, allowed his long battle from the tea to end up in the water at par 3, hollow 16, and admitted his loss of Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer, Molinari, excelled in all his rounds and became one of the four players who once achieved 5-0 since the tournament in its present form began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was thrown out by the lowest ranking of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark, playing with 5 holes down and 4 holes.
The top-class player in the world rankings, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 holes down and 1 hole to play Ian Poulter from Great Britain, who possibly played his last match in the Ryder Cup.
The Spaniard Segrio Garcia, veteran with eight Ryder Cups, became the best European player of all tournaments ever with 25.5 points in his career.
"I don't cry so soon, but today I can't do anything about it.
It's been a difficult year.
I am so grateful to Thomas that he selected me and believed in me.
I'm so glad we got the cup back.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I could help," said an emmotioned Garcia after the European victory.
He gives the torch to his countryman, John Ram, who beat the American legend Tiger Woods with 2 holes down and 1 hole in the game for singles on Sunday.
"The enormous pride I feel because I beat Tiger Woods. I've always followed that guy when I grew up," says 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
A strange statistics of one of the biggest players ever; winner of 14 major championships, second only behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled to find fairways, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level throughout the tournament.
The U.S. commander, Jim Furk, said after the disappointing performance of his team, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
We have made Europe a little more difficult this morning.
We were opposed.
All respect for Thomas.
He's a great commander.
All 12 players in his team played very well.
We're going to regroup. I'm going to work with the American PGA (Professional Golfers' Association) and our Ryder Cup Committee and we're looking forward.
I love these 12 boys, and I'm proud to be their commander.
You have to take off your hat for the opponent.
We're overplayed."
Red glow update: Concentrations decrease in the provinces of Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The most recent report of the 'Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission' (Florida Commission for the Conservation of Fish and Fauna) shows a general decline of Red glow concentrations in parts of Tampa Bay Area (on the west coast of Florida in the USA).
According to the committee, it is reported about the fragmentation of the Red glow in the provinces of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier, which could indicate a decrease in concentrations.
The red glow extends over an average of 200 km of coastline, from northern Pinellas to southern Lee counties.
There are about 16 km off the coast of Hillsborough County spots, but in less places than last week.
Red glow has also been seen in Pasco County.
Medium-sized concentrations have been reported on the coast of Pinellas County last week, low to high concentrations off the coast of Hillsborough County, background to high concentrations in Manatee County, background to high concentrations in or off the coast of Sarasota County, background to high concentrations in Charlotte County, background to high concentrations in or off the coast of Lee County, and low concentrations in Collier County.
It is permanently reported on airways irritation in the provinces of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee, and Collier.
In the northwest of Florida, no irritation of the airways was reported in the last week.
