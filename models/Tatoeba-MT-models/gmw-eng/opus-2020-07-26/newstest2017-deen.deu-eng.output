28-year-old cook found dead in San Francisco Mall
A 28-year-old chef, recently moved to San Francisco, was found dead in the stairwell of a local shopping center.
The victim's brother said that he can't imagine anyone who would want to harm him, "At last he went uphill."
The body found in the Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning was identified as the 28-year-old Frank Galicia from San Francisco, the medical department in San Francisco reported.
The San Francisco Police Department said that death was classified as a murder and the investigations are underway.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told the ABS channel KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who had worked as a cook in Boston six months ago, had given his dream job as a cook at the Sons & Daughters restaurant in San Francisco.
A spokesman of the Sons & Daughter said that he "was shocked and destroyed on the ground" over his death.
"We're a small team that works like a close family and we're gonna miss him painfully," the speaker continued.
Our thoughts and condolences are with Frank's family and friends during this difficult time.
Louis Galicia said that Frank first lived in hostels, but that "things for him finally went uphill."
"He found an apartment, he had a girlfriend," Louis Garcia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said he couldn't imagine anyone wanting to harm his younger brother.
He was a kind person with a big heart.
His way of connecting with his family was always to cook us something, to prepare dinner for us," said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to participate in any kind of dispute.
He was the brother who was swimming with the current.
"With everything that goes wrong in the world, he was this uncut diamond, which brightly lit every day," he said.
Anyone who has information on the case will be asked to call the SFPD's telephone number 415-575-4444.
Jennifer Aniston: I'm always put in drawers
Jennifer Aniston doesn't always have to be perfect or successful.
The Hollywood Star has made this clear in an interview.
"I'm always stuck in drawers or get stuck from outside label, which usually have little to do with me and reality."
"I myself don't want to be perfect and successful all the time."
"Surely, these things are more sniffing to me."
Jennifer Aniston (47) can only laugh at her being considered "Miss Perfect" as explained in the current "Cosmopolitan".
In fact, the actress loves to spend her time at home, in the form of television with a loose dozen and Mexican food, it says in the magazine.
To the weissglut, they put the question about the child's wish: "We women don't have to be married or have children to be perfect," said Hollywood star.
In her new movie "Mother's Day - Love Is Not a Children's Game", Aniston is seen as a single mother of two sons.
The film will run with us on August 25th.
Golfer Langer gets the sport pyramid
His experiences on the horse are manageable.
At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer and some colleagues looked for a bit of variety with a ride on the beach.
For the 58-year-old it was a premiere.
CHIO: "Golden Sport Pyramid" for Bernhard Langer
After a few minutes the horses remembered their holiday evening, they hunted home in the fast gallop to the feeding troughs.
A kilometer at this pace, I was scared.
"It wasn't a good experience," says Langer.
And with that the riding career ended again.
On Saturday, Germany's best golfer of all time - 101 tournament victory - was back near horses.
He was allowed to lead his family over the system of the ALRV, on a horse he did not even move for photo purposes.
Longer was the first time in Aachen and thus also at the CHIO.
The reason was quite convincing.
The German sports aid gave the golden pyramid to the man from an in-house within a small gala.
The sympathetic sportsman is not lacking in awards.
Bundesverdienstkreuz, Silbernes Lorbeerblatt, Champions Tour Player of the year...
Even the British Queen already did it.
Langer is the 18th winner of the sports pyramid.
In Aachen he met Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday.
"This award means a lot to me," says Langer, "because it is not only awarded for sporting success, but also for social engagement."
Langer has been promoting young people for decades.
And so he also passed on the prize money of 25,000 euros the same.
With 15 other outstanding athletes, the two-time US masters winner was added to the "Hall of Fame of German Sports" on Saturday.
Among the excellents are the athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the Turner Eberhard Gienger, the Feder Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the rower Peter Michael Kolbe, Bob driver Meinhard Nehmer, the Judoka Frank Wieneke, the jumper Alwin Schockemöhle and posthum of the handballer Erhard Wunderlich.
Many of these sports legends came to Aachen on Saturday.
After the official part, the illustrated society migrated to the Spring Stadium, where the Lavazza Prize ran.
Bernhard Langer kept away from the big animals.
Clinton and Trump's economic policy compared: it's all about the money
Investing in infrastructure and preventing the TTP trade agreement - both Clinton and Trump.
However, the two U.S. presidential competitors disagree in tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental issue.
The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are based on a fundamental, rather philosophical difference.
The one, on the role of the state.
Trump wants to keep that in doubt rather small and warns of how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations.
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate it to death, he says.
He himself would be quite different, Trump claims.
He is going to leave regulations massively, and he is working for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for businesses.
Clinton, on the other hand, says that the state has certain tasks to fulfil, has disadvantaged opportunities to open up and needs money for them.
That is why taxes for the rich would be increased, she says.
Interestingly, both are very close to infrastructure.
Trump and Clinton say that they have to invest in this.
The democratic candidate announced even the biggest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.
State investment programmes in the infrastructure are classical democratic policies and are strictly rejected by, for example, the Republicans' state-critical tea party wing.
For Trump, therefore, there could be some internal discussions.
More significant are the differences in energy and climate policy.
Trump wants to build coal power plants and to re-elevate coal production in the US.
Oil production should also be possible in areas which have been protected so far, and the Paris Convention on Climate Change should be announced.
Clinton, on the other hand, specifically wants to expand the renewable energies through its investment programme and demands: "A country will become the superpower of clean energy and create millions of jobs."
"It will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want us to be."
However, not only in the field of infrastructure, but also in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far apart.
TPP, the Trans-Pacific Trade Agreement, does not want to sign.
At the same time, however, both want not to isolate the US from international trade - but simply to better protect American jobs.
They're supposed to be paid better, for example, so it's Clinton's asking.
The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a hunger wage.
He wants to raise it to $15 per hour.
What Trump wants to do on this issue is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage must be up, he says he should not be changed.
But the great discussion of the coming months is likely to be more about the tax policy of the two camps.
On the one hand, Trump is trying to relieve the economy and the citizens to boost growth.
His critics think that the budget deficit would only be bigger.
On the other hand, Clinton, who at least wants to ask the rich to pay more taxes, and whose critics say that more taxes are not the solution either.
Escape: "Every fledged woman has experience with sexual violence"
Sexual violence almost belongs to everyday life for women who flee alone.
When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized.
A house offers refuge.
Four women sit in a large kitchen.
Everyone has a baby who is at most one year old.
One of them put her little son in the arm.
He's looking with big eyes curiously into the room.
His mother is staring at the tabletop.
Until she notices that she's being watched.
She smiles short and kisses the little one.
The scene is normal.
Until you talk to Katrin Bahr.
She is head of the department of Condrobs, a supporter of social assistance services in Bavaria, and deals, among other things, with the topic of women on the run.
The four women in the kitchen are refugees.
They live in the north of Munich in one of the few decentralized accommodations for single women and their children in Bavaria.
In January Condrobs opened the facility together with Pro Familia and the Munich women's aid.
She has recently been officially opened.
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.
There are no men - not even as visitors.
The exception is a guard in front of the door.
"It is not exaggerating to say: Every woman who arrives here has experienced sexual violence in her flight," says Bahr.
"Men flee for wars because they are politically persecuted because they are threatened with torture or death or because their families send them to Europe as hopemakers," she says.
In women, other reasons for fleeing prevail: "Many steal secretly from it because they see no other way out".
In their home country, they have experienced sexual violence, forced marriages, honoral murders, slavery or forced prostitution.
That's what she's doing.
It continues on the run.
"For example, that tugs call for sexual action for a bottle of water is not rare," says Bahr.
And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.
Whoever believes that this will end as soon as they arrive in Germany, says Bahr.
Here, too, single women in refugee accommodation would often be regarded as inferior and, at worst, abused.
This results in about 90 percent of the women who live in the north of Munich are traumatized.
"Some of the children have certainly not been born voluntarily".
Many women are used to it, so they don't say anything.
"Or they do not trust to talk openly about the person who is alive because the shame is too great".
Since they often don't know how to help, it takes more accommodations for them only, Bahr demands.
In Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for housing refugees.
When asked whether they knew of a similar project as in Munich in their area of responsibility, some answered with No.
In the Upper Palatinate and Upper Franconia, for example, there is no such thing in government accommodation.
Even in Schwaben, fledged women alone are not accommodated separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, press spokesman for the government.
In Upper Bavaria, Central and Central Franconia there are floors or private homes in some community accommodation only for single women and their children.
The exception is Niederbayern, there are two central accommodations for women only.
The Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality in the European Parliament also calls for women to be accommodated separately from men.
In a study published for the Committee, it says: "It is very important that men and women be housed separately."
"If privacy or men and women are housed together, violence against women can occur continuously."
Above all, the washrooms should be separate and accessible to women, says the study.
How the women feel about this need for protection can be read at the heart of the house in Munich.
"Since we talked about it, we have a long waiting list," says Bahr.
You could easily open a second house.
Assistance doctors: Demands for new work-related measures
Representatives of the assistants have called on their trade union to approve new measures to combat labour in their disputes with regard to a new contract.
The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has called for its entire Council to approve more work-related action as of the beginning of September.
The JDC said that ministers had failed to address the concerns about the contract.
Assistants and medical students voted in July on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BMA.
It was rejected by 58% of its members who voted in the elections.
In a letter to the members published on Twitter on Thursday evening, the chairman of the JDC Ellen McCourt said that the government would have been "obsessively quiet" to problems, which led to the rejection of the contract.
She said: "In view of this, the JDC Board has voted to reject the proposed new contract in its entirety and has called for official renegotiations on all your concerns."
In response to the silence of the government, the JDC Board of Directors has today submitted a formal application for a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve a current programme of escalating labour struggle measures, which starts in early September.
The disputes caused assistants to strike six times this year, the first total failures in the history of the NHS.
The head of the BMA Assistant Doctor Dr. Johann Malawana resigned after the election to reject the agreed terms of the contract, which had been recommended by the BMA.
He informed BMA members during the meetings, which were held before the vote by 54,000 assistant doctors and medical students, that the Treaty was and should be accepted.
After the vote, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said that the contract for doctors in England would be introduced.
Russia and Turkey: An "alliance of outsiders"?
It was a gesture that ended a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and to announce an official war lasting for eight months and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish opponent in the golden hall of the St. Petersburg Palace, I cannot deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most.
There was the handshake, yes.
But Putin's smile was slender and he hardly exuded heat, even for his restraining conditions.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his "love friend" Putin - according to a report all five times.
I couldn't count it anymore.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but would even improve.
The next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan would have behaved like nothing bad had ever happened.
His enthusiasm seemed to indicate the opposite.
But one of Putin's radiating, sustainable cooling showed that Russia's head of state had not forgotten anything.
Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduction words: the shooting of a Russian fighter aircraft on the Syrian border through Turkey.
Moscow's reaction at the time was sore.
Putin split up and accused Ankara of falling into the back of Russia.
The offense was even greater because it was committed by a supposed friend.
Reestablishing trust will be difficult if not even impossible.
Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.
For months the state-controlled media carried out a violent, unlimited attack on Ankara.
At once it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything.
Most seriously, the accusations of senior officials were that Erdogan's own family would have benefited from illegal oil trade in Syria's areas controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He fought this vehement.
But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.
Finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received from President Erdogan the apology he wanted to hear.
Russia has been able to win some sort of victory.
For Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire are clear.
Erdogan first and foremost needs all his friends who he can get after he was almost removed from office last month in a failed coup.
Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.
But there are also economic motives.
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular the ban on charter flights that normally bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.
The number has fallen by almost 90%.
In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be facilitated when the flights are resumed.
They are based on a late seasonal storm to the Mediterranean Sea.
This week, state television predicted cheaper fruits and vegetables as soon as Turkish agricultural imports were allowed again.
A report in Vedemosti formulated it as follows: "Tourists there long, tomatoes here long."
But the visit had an added political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West because it sees its reaction to the attempted takeover of power as a weak response.
To this end, the continued resentment about the sluggish pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin - which aims to benefit from the cool mood and to reduce Turkey's relationship to the West.
The Russian head of state won with certainty a bonus in Ankara for calling for support for the elected state bodies after the attempted coup.
This is well-known for Moscow as a matter of course, which itself is deeply afraid of changes in the regime.
The summit in this magnificent palace by the sea allowed Russia and Turkey to represent one, as an analyst once described to me, "allianz of outsiders": two countries, who are ostracized and ill-treated by the West and are now allied.
Nevertheless, despite public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two.
The greatest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently played the role as peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support opposite sides.
It could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks, both presidents said at the press conference that they did not even strip the issue.
The President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize them.
There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found to Syria.
But after months of open hostilities - and given the potential for a perfect disaster when NATO member Turkey shot off the Russian combat jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state talk to each other at least again.
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available for customers outside Scotland
According to the CEO of the Bank, the RBS brand is only to be reduced to a back office roll.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan informed BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was connected to the bank's global ambitions.
The bank has since distanced itself when it almost had to be collapsed and saved eight years ago.
During this time, brand strategists used "RBS" to protect other end-user financial brands.
She supported international sports with millions of pounds of sponsorship, from Six Nations Rugby to Wimbledon winner Andy Murray.
But now she has decided to focus more national brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available for customers in Scotland, but will not be initialized.
In England and Wales all RSB references, the decentralised headquarters and the stock exchange listing will switch to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other smaller brands for the retail business that will get more importance - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a tour of customers and employees in Inverness-shire.
He told BBC Scotland: "The RSB brand will become our investor brand as well as the brand where our employees will be engaged, as we now become more a bank of brands."
When the bank became a global brand itself, RBS became a global brand.
I am now saying that we are not pursuing global goals, but local goals.
Each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with customers among these brands.
RBS has already said that it will no longer continue its Six Nations sponsorship and that it will increase the perceptibility of the various brands in its sports sponsorship.
"It is time for us to develop into the bank of the brands, for how do we focus on making this a better bank for customers (we asked ourselves)?" said the Chief Executive Board.
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and launch these brands.
But with our work, the focus on customer needs and not our own, I think, you will see many changes.
We can launch these brands again, so I think the time has come.
Frankie Dettori achieves his 3,000th gain at Newmarket on Predilection
Dettori sprays champagne after a double at Newmarket, which brings it 3,000th gain
On Friday, the Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th British profit at Newmarket.
He set a milestone on predilection, which is trained by John Gosden, on his local race track with his second win of the night.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth Jockey who reaches the milestone in the flat race.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddry and Willie Carson.
The three-time winner Dettori, who before won Ghayyar, said, "It's something special."
I'm very emotional because my family is here
I am very happy that it happened at Newmarket because I landed here 30 years ago.
It's not a big meeting, it's not Royal Ascot - it's a banal Friday evening with 20,000 people.
I am relieved and very modest.
Dettori picks up the jubilant when he gets the victory for predilection
Two Jockeys reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time winner Sir Anthony McCoy, who won more than 4,300 in a record-breaking career.
Lester Piggott, the nine-time Derby winner had 4.493 career victory
Frankie is one of the best jockey of modernity and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone that only a few have reached before him.
He has style and is strong, but it's his tactical intellect that distinguishes him from the others in the weight control room.
He is a fantastic ambassador for racing, his enthusiasm and charisma have been enthusiastic fans for years for this sport.
I told Frankie at Epsom a few weeks ago that if he wasn't just a weekend-and-large tournament jockey, he would've already won 6,000 prizes!
Frankie has been riding in GB for almost 30 years, which is great.
He has a living personality, which is good for a British race, but beyond that, he's an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dismount
From Flying Finishes to Flying Dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the sign of the British flat race for two decades.
It was nervous.
A whole series of grand tournaments, including his famous "Glorious Seven" 1996 in Ascot, but he also survived an airplane crash and was banned from drugs.
Three years ago he had difficulties when he returned from his six-month lock, but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to defy his twin and return to his best form.
And he's not finished for a long time - Dettori once said that he wants to continue in competitions up to at least 50th year of life.
Russia's Putin fires Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly dismissed his Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov was part of Putin's narrowest circle of trust for many years.
The 63-year-old was appointed Special Representative for Environmental and Transport Affairs.
In a Kremlin's opinion, Putin had "ordered the release of Ivanov's duties as president of the Russian presidential administration without any reason".
Anton Vaino, who has been Ivanov's deputy since 2012, was appointed as his successor.
Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in the Estonian capital of Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the renowned Moscow Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Embassy in Tokyo.
On the Kremlin's website it is said (in Russian) that he was later protocol chief and staff of the government staff.
He said to Putin about his appointment: "Thanks for your trust."
I think it is the government's most important task to support your work as head of state regarding draft laws and controls to implement your instructions.
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.
Do the smiling faces convince?
This step has made Moscow mysterious.
Sergei Ivanov has been one of Vladimir Putin's closest confidants for a long time, working as he did for the Soviet intelligence service, the KGB.
As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, who was broadcast on TV, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff was withdrawing at his own request.
But despite the smile for the cameras, there are only a few of them - especially now, shortly before the parliamentary elections.
So is this the result of some kind of power struggle?
Nobody knows right now.
But the official claim - that a man who was once praised as potential president wants to lead Russian environmental policy at once - came up with a great skepticism.
In his remarks to Putin, quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said "it is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 to entrust me with these very complicated posts - you could almost say - difficult posts for four years.
As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months.
Ivanov accepted the post in December 2011.
Previously, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and like Putin former member of the KGB State Security Service.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was Chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed as his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov one of five people he trusted most.
Once it was assumed that Ivanov, after Putin's second term of office, could become President of Russia, as a third term of office would have violated Putin's constitution.
But this post was taken by another close allied Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister before becoming president three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds Star Thomas Gibson fired after beating producers
Gibson was involved in a physical dispute in the series set in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, announced his termination in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played the Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, publicly apologized for the announcement of his termination on Thursday.
On the set there were artistic differences and disagreements.
I regret the incident," he said in a communication.
Details about how the character Gibsons is written out from the series that follows a team of FBI agents are expected to be published at a later date, according to the opinion of ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
The 54-year-old who previously played in Sitcom Dharma & Greg was present since the first season of the series in 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds and have put my whole heart's blood in the last twelve years," said Gibson in a release on Friday.
I had hoped to be there until the end, but that will not be possible now.
I would just like to thank the authors, producers, actors, our wonderful crew and, above all, the best fans you can wish for a series.
The planned broadcast of the 12th season is started on September 28th.
Riddles around fish that landed in garden in Banff
A resident of Banff asked for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks that the 75 fish could be sandaal that was spit out by a fountain.
Mr Bain, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, published a video of the spectacle on Periscope, hoping that someone could throw some light on the appearance of the two-inch long fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connected to Fife
The £1.35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have connected the north deck of the Queensferry Crossing with the viaduct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of four closures of the "cover blowers" approaching the completion around each of the three towers of the bridge.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 shaft ropes.
The project is to be completed by May 2017 at £1.35 billion.
Minister of Economic Affairs Keith Brown visited the construction site today and was one of the first to go from country to bridge.
He said, "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Crossings.
We are all witnesses of an engineering of a truly epic measure in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel, which were used alone for this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, finishing the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for the fit.
A total of almost 79% of the entire bridge decks are at their place and the last section of the deck today gets a concrete cast for the deck in Rosyth, which means that the entire deck is ready to be raised to its place on the bridge.
Michael Martin, project manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said: "The first closure represents a significant milestone in every bridge project.
In this fantastic project, the closure represents forward-looking construction.
After the installation of the last street deck section and its connection with the built-in North Tower deck, we then had to close the remaining gap on the North or Land side.
This was reached by pulling the northern access bridge 700 millimeters south.
This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.
Massif, since the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled up at a slope of about 3%.
Heikel, because the tolerances the team was working on were tiny - on each side they were only a few millimeters.
Fortunately, everything went down very well.
Rescue at Moelfre Bay: Three men have "luck still to be alive"
Three men have "happy to be alive" after they were thrown off their fishing boat in Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station struck alert on Friday at 13:20 BST, after a crew observed the event in Moelfre Bay.
The three men had difficulty swimming in safety, while their boat continued its own strength.
"We saw how the boat turned around in its vicinity and imagined the worst," said the head of the rescue station of Moelfre Vince Jones.
"Happyly, the strong winds have already waded the boat outside its reach, until we turned to water," he added.
Two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat, while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and found hanging on a boat without a life jacket.
They all came aboard the coastal rescue boat and were taken back to the rescue station
Mr. Jones said: "The three men who have been thrown into the water are lucky and still alive.
Although the boat engine had an emergency stop line, it loosed itself from the person who controlled the boat when the boat was identifier.
Someone's been watching over these men today.
Hardly injured - man staggers on his ex-girlfriend
A man attacked his ex-girlfriend in Hamburg-Harburg with a knife and severely injured.
As the police told us yesterday, the 50-year-old had got the key to the apartment to get his personal things.
Instead, the alcoholicized perpetrator cut the clothes of his ex-girlfriend.
When he got to the apartment, he stopped at her twice.
The 44-year-old was injured on the hand and on the body.
The police were able to arrest the perpetrator.
While the 50-year-old destroyed his ex-girlfriend's clothes, he called his mother.
His sister then warned him.
Together with her companion, the 45-year-old wanted to calm down her brother.
But she couldn't move him to leave the apartment.
That's why she left the house with her companions.
On the street they met the ex-life partner of the man.
When the two women entered the apartment again, the 50-year-old pushed his sister aside and attacked his ex-girlfriend.
Who builds Braunschweig's cheap apartments?
The SPDs and Greens believe that investors will be taken on a much stronger duty in the future.
How do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 cheap apartments in the coming years?
At the next Council meeting, the SPD proposes a "action concept for housing".
But fight is programmed.
First of all, the question is: Who should build the cheap apartments?
So far, there is a lack of regulation.
SPD Group President Christoph Bratmann says: "We agree with the Greens: If you want to build on urban areas, you will have to show 20 percent of all apartments as social apartments in the future."
However, the favourable apartments can also be found in the stock.
However, Bratmann says that the big contention in the town hall is: "How do you deal with investors who want to build on private land?"
"We want investors on such areas to build at least 10 percent, but as much as possible 20 percent of apartments as social housing."
A new urban housing fund that will cost and still need to be financed will provide incentives.
The problem, says Bratmann: "There is currently no agreement between the political groups."
The CDU wants to make investors as few rules as possible.
The left still wants hard conditions for investors.
Despite that, says Bratmann, the situation on the housing market is getting worse.
If the concept of action is implemented, it will provide additional tasks in the building administration.
More staff is needed.
It's unclear whether we'll get the professionals.
However, the program is not yet complete: the approximately 1260 new apartments that should be built anyway.
But how do we compare the loss of more than 1300 cheap dwellings, the promotion of which will end in the next few years?
There will be 500 apartments by 2020 alone.
In order to prevent this from happening, according to the planning spokesman Nicole Palm, there should now be a purchase of out-of-date ties from the city.
Furthermore, it would have to be considered to bring apartments back back into the price commitment.
This is possible in the west city.
The problem could be solved at a time.
Because in West Town, deadlines expire at the end of the year.
About 1800 apartments could be brought back to the price commitment for cheap apartments.
Only: This is not what the owners, the housing companies want.
Because the number of social apartments in the west city will be increased dramatically again, away from the objective of so-called blending.
A concentration of social security in just a few districts should no longer exist.
The Greens expect there to be movement in the discussion.
Group chairman Holger Herlitschke says: "For a broad majority, the CDU must be in the boat."
It has concentrated on more construction sites for single-family houses.
What does not mean, however, is that a compromise cannot be reached.
Pokémon Go, a hunting for health and happiness that is worthwhile
It is fascinating to see how the world changes.
The fact that teenagers and children are no longer going outside to play, but rather prefer to spend their free time staring on screens was complained by many in the last decade.
Pokemon Go is about getting people off the sofa and getting more active.
The time on the screen was initially on the TV, then limited to video games and last but not least to smartphones.
Therefore, it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive.
Of course, I am referring to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters that were first created for the video games in the 1990s (later there was a drawing series, playing cards and other spin-offs).
How many phenomena of pop culture fell interest in the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July.
Market launch in other countries has been postponed by the massive demand that the servers overloaded.
Within a few days Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, the players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pokémons, which are tracked with a GPS and, once they have been found, can be "photographed" (via a screenshot on the phone) or "captured".
A generation who played the game when she was still younger joined the fool and jumped for the search of the sofa.
In the USA, the game led to a significant increase in steps that the "average" person returns every day.
Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch that chased 35,000 users, recently told the Washington Post that within two days of the launch of the game, the number of persecuted people who are training 30 minutes each day were encouraging from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it only sees the raw data to increase performance.
Many public education campaigns on health that people want to bring to "take 30 minutes to come," "to come from sofa" and "to be active every day" hit deaf ears because many public messages are boring to health and come from people who look miserable.
Nevertheless, the importance of sport cannot be overrated.
Those who regularly engage in sports reduce their chances of suffering from cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to lead them here.
But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it makes people do something outdoors that makes them fun.
Thus, three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.
Some people even close new friendships on the hunt.
As always, there are also Moorish game spoilers who always have to complain about something.
And yes, someone could walk on a door.
What's up?
It took place a breakthrough.
Even though smartphone apps like Fitbit were able to track our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to run sports as it does this game.
The new one will lose its appeal and the use will be abandoned with time.
However, due to Pokemon's success, there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with becoming active in the real world, helping many people hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.

Simone Biles creates gold in the ladies' tournament
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is immune to all of this.
Dynamically on the jumping horse.
It's easy on the bar.
Breathing on the ground.
Brilliant on the whole line.
And finally Olympic winner.
On Thursday, the 19-year-old American gymnast went on a multi-combat title and increased the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all the eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games.
Her total score of 62,198 was clearly in front of the silver medal winner and the "Final Five" teammate Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medal winner Aliya Mustafina.
The Americans Simone Biles roams on the floating beam during the single multi-combat finale of women in the art tournament at the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.
Biles is the fourth heterosexual American who wins a multi-combat title and overall the fifth, while she strengthens her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all.
She broke out in tears when her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment found an end.
This success puts her in the same league as unique athletes as Michael Phelps, who brought her sports to new heights:
For the last three years, Biles has dominated her sport, 15 world champions - including 10 gold medals - won with such amazing exercises that include a mix of ambition and precision, that the 1984 Olympic Champion Mary Lou Retton said of her that she is "the best gymnast I have ever seen."
She expected a final examination in Brazil, a competition that did not go so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a load of oversized expectations.
Not with a handful of gold coming back to the family in Spring, Texas, would be regarded as disappointment.
The Americans Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman hugged after winning gold and silver in the single multi-combat finale of women in the art tournament at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday
Biles received the first medal on Tuesday, while she served as an exclamation mark at the farewell ceremony of the retired team coordinator Martha Karolyi.
Although Biles insisted on taking the lead in her long journey, never to have planned the future, that is not really true.
Part of their floor exercises - which contain their typical Tumbling Pass - is matched to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio.
It's not a coincidence.
This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a small child and discovered by coach Aimee Boranman's mother during a school trip to the gym, who was trained in the Boorman, became powerful.
Since the summer of 2013, she has no longer lost a multi-competition competition, a winning series that will last for as long as Biles wishes.
Even though Mustafina was slightly guided by two rotations, the picture was drawn.
Swift beams and ground gymnastics - where Biles holds the World Championship title - listened.
She got back with 15,433 on the floating beam - and put another on the floor with a 15,933 on the floor.
Raisman hugged her gently when she expected her finality - a purely formality - and tears flowed to biles of shiny red, white and blue eyeliners, when the vision that she once described in her collection book became reality.
Raisman's performance was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for third place, but the bronze medal went in a tiefre to Mustafina.
This time, the 22-year-old captain, who is called "Oma", had a lead.
After her ground practice, she threw kiss hands to the audience, overwhelmed by a comeback that sometimes appeared dubious.
As for the children, the rapidly expanding Tweet of 19-year-olds from the beginning of this week has a completely new meaning:
Police: 3 victims in serial murder when listening to music shot in the car
According to police reports published on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot and killed in one of the most deadly attacks since a decade in Phoenix's first serial murder, while they stayed in the car and heard music.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Maleah were shot on June 12, while the car was parked in a driveway, the authorities said.
The culprit fired eight shots from a hand-fired weapon while standing on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle, is to be read in the report.
The police told us that the triple murder did not seem to have been the result of a robbery, as the attacker did not carry the handbags or the $2,900 that were owned by one of the adult victims.
Phoenix Sgt. Jonathan Howard's police officer said that shooting has led investigators to become a closer look at whether they are connected with four previous attacks.
A total of seven people were killed in hispanic residential areas within four months in nine attacks and two more were injured.
"It's happening in a residential area in front of a house," Howard told KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, early in the month.
It is assumed that the suspect used several vehicles, including a brown Nissan from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to disclose the evidence they led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same murderer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized due to her injuries and died later.
Liner, 31, and Ellis daughter Maleah died on the spot.
A witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
The authorities also published a police report on the shooting, which aimed at an empty pickup truck half an hour before the triple murder and which assumes that it was the work of the serial killer.
Detectives found cartridge sleeves and secured a ball from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine room.
Mother of a 6-year-old with microcephaly: "It will be better"
Like most 6-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But like the least of his peers, Edmund Microcephalie, has the result of a genetic disorder about which his mother Elizabeth Picciuto knew nothing during her pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was, I can't do it.
I can't do this.
That's what I didn't let in.
What's not right at all -- of course you've gotten involved," she said.
Her husband Vincent and her were told that Edmund could never recognize them and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even went so far as to suggest institutionalizing him.
"My first answer to that was 'I didn't know that people were still doing it,' said Picciuto.
Edmund can run with the help of a walker.
Edmund couldn't sit or scratch until his third year of life and he still can't speak.
But he's progressing slowly.
He can run with support and cycle.
He also loves playing and singing with his two brothers.
Elizabeth shows the sign language Edmund thought out for "Please sing to me"."
"We teach him sign language," said Picciuto CBS News.
But it's not a typical sign language -- she says. Edmund invented some characters on his own.
Microcephaly has a wide range of causes: genetics such as Edmund, and infections with viruses such as measles or cikavirus during pregnancy.
Symptoms and forecasts may vary greatly.
It is too early to say how it will affect the life of those infected with the cikavirus.
Picciuto remembers the emotional price of an uncertain future.
I kept asking what's going to happen?
What will happen?
And she still doesn't really know.
I haven't asked for the prognosis for a long time, because I don't expect anyone to tell me.
But Picciuto has a hopeful advice for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the zika virus.
It'll be better.
You know it will be better for you.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Many rainfalls, floods give rise to rescue in Louisiana, Mississippi
Many rainfalls and floods in Louisiana forced the governor to call for an emergency on Friday. It is expected that more rainfalls will continue all Saturday.
Many rivers in the southeast of Louisiana and the south of the Mississippi flooded their shores and threatened with large floods after extreme rainfall, reported the National Weather Service.
The governor of Louisiana John Bel Edwards informed us that state officials are in constant contact with the local authorities and are already on the move to help the communities concerned.
Mike Steele, a spokesperson for the Governor's Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparation, told us that the requests for high-water vehicles, boats and sandbags increased.
Steele said that only the municipality of Tangipahoa would have demanded tens of thousands of sandbags.
A flood warning system is used over large parts in the south of Louisiana until Saturday.
The weather service made it clear that additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall in this area.
In the south of Albabamas, a flood-earning warning system was used on Friday, while it continued to rain in the area of Mobile.
The Comite River near Baton Rouges and the Amit River near Denham Springs, both of which are located in Louisiana, are likely to reach record level over the weekend.
Meteologist Alek Krautmann says that both rivers could flood many houses in the suburbs near Baton Rouge.
He also said that a downstream flood in Ascension Parish is a danger, as these will flow slowly into Lake Maurepas via the streams.
The River Tickfaw, south of the Mississippi State border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest level at 09.00 on Friday, which was ever recorded.
Rescue teams still sucked people from the floodwaters in the districts of Amite and Wilkinson in the southwest of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were among those saved near Gloster on Friday.
Hansford, 62, says that water from Beaver Creek, which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house, rose strongly overnight.
He said that another stepson who lives nearby would have warned him.
"We woke up and the water streamed and streamed in," said Hansford.
It reached my waist.
His wife told Hansford that in the 48 years in which she lived, she had never seen such a high level of the river.
Hansford said that he and his family members had all the disabilities and he was the only one who could swim.
Hansford said that emergency helpers had saved all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Gloster, where they had been accommodated until Friday.
Krautmann said that the flood had "slowly spread" as there were still heavy rainfalls and that the authorities considered evacuation instructions.
According to Krautmann, an observer near Livingstone reported rain from midnight to Friday morning from 13.75 inches.
Krautmann said that the ground had been considerably filled by rainfall since Wednesday.
The authorities indicated that heavy rainfall and floods caused the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and the loss of education in five school districts.
The WWL CBS subsidiary reported that an associate in Tangipahoa gave 200 flooded houses.
The inhabitants were evacuated into two churches, which were now flooded.
The mayor of Robby Miller said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets who had been washed by the flood.
In the cities of Amite and Hammond, emergency accommodations were established to accommodate the evacuators.
"As soon as the water begins to return, they will be able to return to their homes," he said.
In the city of Hammond of the municipality of Tangipahoa, almost two dozen roads were closed due to the flood and sandbags were provided for the residents who hope to keep the water from their homes and shops.
"The last great flood we had was in March," said Lacy Landrum of the city administration.
This seems to be a similar incident.
In Mississippi, the emergency manager Rupert Lacy of Harrison County said it continued to rain on the Gulf Coast.
According to his information, a handful of houses were reported flooded on Thursday, but no reports have been made on Friday until now.
Keith Townson, manager at Shopper Value Foods in Amit, has been living in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places I've never seen before," said Townson, "and it's still coming."
Mahaj Brown, 6, "deeped by bullets", survives shooting in Philadelphia
The police tell us that the 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, this week already the second time a 6-year-old child is shot.
The boy's grandparents identified him as Mahaj Brown for CBS Philadelphia.
The grandparents reported that Brown suffered several shot injuries, including in the lung, leg, arm and belly, but that he was aware of his transport to the hospital.
"He's been through a lot, his little body was squirted by balls," his grandmother Delores Melendez told the transmitter.
I just can't believe it.
The boy's condition was considered critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations.
The boy's family told the transmitter that he was expected to recover.
He should have started the first class in a local primary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in Germantown.
Three men were also shot: two at the age of 29 and a 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-olds is in critical condition; the other two victims are in stable condition according to CBS Philadelphia.
The boy was found on the front seat of a car along with the 29-year-old in critical condition, reports the transmitter.
The other two victims were not in the car, and the police just determined whether one of the injured men of the perpetrators could be among them.
Researchers told CBS Philadelphia that a crossfire had apparently occurred between several shooters.
Patron shells for storm rifles, which were traced back to different storm rifles, crossed the crime scene.
It seems that this was clearly a continuing struggle.
On the road, on both sides of the walkway, were huts.
For example, there seem to have been several armed fighters who were very active in this field," told police skinpmann Anthony Ginaldi of the police in Philadelphia to the station.
Several houses and vehicles were also hit in the area.
There were no arrests and the police are currently reviewing reports of the surveillance video.
On Tuesday another 6-year-old girl was hit by a cross-batch on her arm when she played in front of her house in the West Oak Lane residential area.
She'll recover, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That's what I'm presenting under the women's olympia team in the gym, for more than one reason.
First of all, I've been with every summer ollympiade since 1984, and the US has never been so dominant.
And second: This team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Lauria" Hernandez, who inspired many young girls of other skin colours.
The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, who is Jewish and Madison Kocian, who is a Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This team finally reflects the US.
It has consolidated the black and hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.
In the last four years, the number one among female gymnasts was an African American.
Last year Simone and Gabby were #1 and #2.
This shows strength.
At the last Olympic Games Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner, and America rejoiced.
Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they provided unexpected yet masterful gymastic routines.
On Thursday Simone became the fourth, heterosexual American who won gold at an individual multi-combat event for women.
Team member Aly Raisman won silver.
We're experiencing the top of this sport, but gymnastic classes don't look like this all over the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all took the same path as Aly and Madison to make it into the Olympic team.
They are the "Last Five", because the next Olympic team will have only four tournaments in the team. Moreover, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a coach.
But reality looks like gymnastics is a expensive sport and gymnasiums primarily in private gymnasiums that are maintained by parents who stand up for training, furnishing, travel, clothing, competition and hotel costs (for trainers and their gymnasiums and families). The list can be continued at any rate.
The majority of these gymnasiums are located in wealthy suburbs that can support the business.
In these associations, the gymnasiums receive their entire training, which is an expensive and long-term commitment for the families.
Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, both trained their athletes since they started the gym.
We need to provide the communities with a more numerous young girl, inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, with a more durable and accessible gymnastic training.
I've founded my 20-year-old turn-stifting.
At my events we offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for over 15,000 urban young people (especially black and hispanic) and trained national and international winners.
In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer the youth high-quality gymnastics that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Turnen develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.
This combination offers lifelong health benefits as well as school and professional success.
It's the inspiration of this team that brings thousands of young girls to take an interest in the gymnastics and that's great.
It is so important to take part in sports, especially for girls.
That's such an exciting time.
Thanks to Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real representation of "Girl Power" by getting the Olympic team gold and thanking her so many young girls with different background motivated to begin to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
Assistants want to organize more strikes after they have rejected Jeremy Hunt's proposal
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting a reformed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37,000 assistant doctors who voted in a election rejected him.
In July Hunt had revealed plans to bring the contract into force and said that the NHS was located in a "Ninemansland" and any further delay would be harmful to employees and patients.
The first assistant doctors will be given a new contract, which will include changes to night and weekend work to improve care at unsavory time.
Dr Ellen McCourt, Chairman of the BMA Committee for Assistant Doctors, announced last night in a statement: "Assistants continue to have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it will stimulate the current employment crisis and prohibit justice to all doctors."
For only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors are covered by the new contract, progress must be made and time is running out.
Efforts by the BMA to resolve the disputes by means of discussions with the government came to the forcible to participate and sometimes to silence the ears.
This happened to a promise made by Jeremy Hunt only last month that his door would always be open.
"Jeremy Hunt must act now, remove the forced force and address the concerns of the assistant doctors."
If he does not do this, the assistants have made it clear that they are willing to carry out further labour struggle measures.
The last strike at the end of April saw a delay of almost 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 dates since nurses and doctors were included to provide doctors with coverage on the strike-post chain.
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting the reformed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association.
The BMA wants a better weekly remuneration for the 54,000 assistant doctors who are subject to the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, Director General of the NHS staff, urged the assistants to stop the strike.
Mortimer said: "Employment measures do not achieve anything of the little, but already burdened teams and service providers, and provide patients, nurses and their families with only concerns, hardships and interruptions."
In the last two months, we have spoken to the Committee of Assistants, and we have responded positively to the concerns of the Ministry of Health and other ministries regarding the guardianship and whistlebloving.
Employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important issues - such as posting, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning from a career, training classes, mutual recognition of the curriculum, training leave and the gender pay gap in medicine - was a sign of how serious it was for employers, the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health regarding compliance with the agreements with the BMA in November, February and May.
The £2 per day drug that can reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of cardiac infarction patients will benefit from a £2 per day drug after the authorities have recommended that they administer more people for a longer period of time.
The anti-inflammatory drug Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease.
The medication is given for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of stroke or other heart attack.
The NICE regulatory authority has recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
The NICE regulatory authority has recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Around 140,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer another heart attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulations of fatty materials in the arteries walls that form pests.
When the coating breaks apart, it can cause a blood clot that clogs the blood flow to the heart and causes a heart attack.
When the blood clot dissolves, it can flow through the bloodstream and clog the blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk of having another.
Ticagrelor, produced by the British company AstraZeneca and distributed under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots unlikely.
The draft directive of NICE, published today, recommends a 12-month intake of 90mg of Ticagrelor, followed by 60mg with a twice daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Centre said: "Despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with disaster consequences."
Fear of a renewed heart attack may have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person.
Experience shows that Ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
By a provisional recommendation from Ticagrelor, we are pleased that we are able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it.
The information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years.
Culture of Political Correctness causes election fraud to blossom in Muslim areas
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year on the initiative of a government report for corruption
A culture of political correctness has led to the knowing disregard of widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities as a destructive government report revealed today.
Former Cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles verbally attacked the police, electoral observers and councillors to ignore evidence of election abuse due to "examination of hypersensitivity to ethnie and religion".
The former Minister for Integration and Local Government, who is now an anti-corruption king, said that the intimidation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set up lockers outside of electoral booths in order to protect intimidated voters.
He recommends that voters carry a ID to prove their identity in elections.
Currently, a voter just has to name his name and address.
The report suggests putting non-removable ink on a person's fingers when they give their vote to prevent someone from choosing twice.
Whistleblower should be given more protection, says Sir Eric.
He called for the press to have more access to community documents and decisions of non-official committees or working groups.
"This not only serves against electoral fraud, but it is also intended to protect the local government from the broader culture of corruption and financial fraud that is associated with it," he said.
The report was arranged by Downing Street as a result of Tower Hamlet's election scandal in East London.
Last year, a special election court ruled that the mayor Lutfur Rahman should be removed after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices of his office.
The court was that Rahman had perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community"in a cynical way" and that he had silenced his critics with Rassissmus and Islamophobia accusations.
Rahman should have "led his campaign on the basis that it was the religious duty of Muslims to choose him."
Up to 300 votes were either doubtful or the consequence of a imitation in which one person selects as someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud all over the country.
In particular, he was alarming about the fraudulent election of letters - with the older members of the Muslim community pressured people to choose a candidate for their election.
Sir Eric, illustrated, made several recommendations to clean the electoral system, including leading IDs to prove the identity
His report states: "It has been proved that pressure has been exerted on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, in particular women and young people, in order to choose according to the will of the older, in particular communities with Pakistani or Bangladeshic background.
"There were concerns that... state institutions had knowingly ignored such behavior due to "politically correct" hypersensitivity to ethics and religion."
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to clean the system, including the prohibition that political activists are processing letter-election documents to stop "elections".
The report, which is considered by Theresa May, also requires tougher registration checks to prevent the electoral directory from being used for immigration and social fraud purposes.
Consider options to ask voters before choosing your ID.
Use non-removable ink on a person's finger once she has given her voice to prevent someone from choosing twice.
Systematic checks on the nationality of a person to ensure that they are eligible for election.
A three-year limit on requests for automatic mail.
Prohibition that political activists edit complete letter choices and envelopes of letter choices.
The police have the power to set up locks for election stations.
A legislative amendment facilitating an intimidation charge in accordance with the Representative of the People Act 1983 (Volksremtunggesetz 1983).
Photographer ban in constituencies.
Require that only English be used in the electoral stations (with the exception of Wales).
Intensification of the training to ensure that employees enforce the rule that voters go to the election booth alone.
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it "very beautiful" that after the Tower Hamlet's case no criminal notice was made.
"The election court has declared Lutfur Rahman and his deputy to be inappropriate due to a litany of corrupt and illegal practices," he said.
It has been declared guilty for a number of reasons for sufficiently, in accordance with the high requirements in criminal proceedings.
He also criticises the ineffective "return controls" of the electoral registration departments of the town halls.
Sir Eric said, "The court judgment in Tower Hamlet's last year was a warning signal.
As the mother of Parliament, our country bears a proud legacy, but the worrying and hidden spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities threatens this good reputation.
Crazy to Kate's cycling double and other famous Olympic athletes in Rio
This week, French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, fans of the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio, came outside of Rand and Band, which proved to be an impressive double-passer of Cambridge's Duchess.
But this summer the 24-year-old Olympionic is by far not the only one to have gold-combating athlete who has his own famous double-goer - at least not if you can believe the social media.
In honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that are now flickering on our screens, FEMAIL has created a list of Olympics that have more than a certain similarity with Hollywood celebrities.
The hunter and the wolf: team member of the U.S. team in the archery Brady Ellison, on the left, has been compared since his childhood with Leonardo DiCaprio
In addition to Kate's double runner on the cycling track, many people on the Internet pointed out how a certain archer of the twin of A-Promi Leonardo DiCaprio could be.
The team member of the U.S. team in archery Brady Ellison has caused an intrusion on Twitter, after pictures on which he looks very similar to Wolf of Wall Street Star.
In fact, the archer got the madness in the social media and admitted that he has been told since childhood that he looks like Leo.
"I don't see any similarity myself, except for facial hair," Brady told the Huffington Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I'm probably taking it as a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be even more central this year: the all-embracing similarity between the British long jumper Greg Rutherford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
The Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina with her big expressive eyes should be able to go through as a double-passer for the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the swimming pool, the South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to Glee Star Matthew Morrison for years.
A gang higher: This user considers Nathan to be the "athletic version" of the Induction actor
Another continuing comparison was made between the tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who has similar heavy eyebrows and lips.
The Russian silver medal swimter Yulia Efimova has more than just the sun-brown skin and blond hair such as the actress Annalynne McCord, while American Nathan Adrian was attested by fans to be a "athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt".
Strong Women: Football Star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, right, have a similar facial shape and eyes
Not the only one: a Twitter user was very happy that others also noticed the similarities
Theory put into the room: According to this user there might be a reason for the similarity of the couple
A Twitter user expressed her satisfaction that "the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are almost identical."
In fact, the U.S. football star Hope Solo and the Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter have an incredibly similar facial shape and eyes.
Other popular comparisons included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to that of actress Laura Linney and the gold medal winner in the Gabby Douglas turn, who has her own beautiful, broad smile, similar to that of Bring It On Star Gabrielle Union.
CBC commentator for the Olympic Games apologizes for his statement that Chinese swimmer "has died like a pig"
Byron MacDonald's analysis of the fourth place of the 14-year-old Ai Yanhan at Dr 4x200m freestyle swimming squad indignant viewers of the CBC live transmission of the Olmypian games on Wednesday
The Canadian channel CBC had to apologize after one of his commentators said that the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "as Mief went off" and died like "a pig" during the race.
Commentator Byron MacDonalds thought that his microphone was turned off when he gave his own opinions at the end of the 4x200m freestyle game.
MacDonald, who had been brought to the CBS commentator team on board to give more "color", could be heard say: "This little 14-year-old Chinese has lost the connection, baby".
Too excited, went off like Mief, died like a pig.
Thank you for that.
The Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second stage of the swimming season 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck, allowing Canadians to unlock the gap with China.
Visitors across Canada responded quickly after they were shocked by the sound and the language
Emmett Macfarlane tweet, "Did the CBC commentator just say that the 14-year-old swimmer from China "has died like a pig"????
The idiot didn't get that they were still on show."
Ai Yanhan from China has been described in the final 4 x 200m freestyle swim for women as follows: "This little 14-year-old Chinese has lost the connection, baby."
Criticism against Byron MacDonald on Twitter came quickly and hard, in which many spoke to him
Twitter users did not stop when they heard how insensitive Byron MacDonald was
Another Twitter user Sarah Paradis wrote: "Wow, #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and let us all look like racists.
A short time later, Scott Russel, who moderated the CBC broadcast, went live for MacDonald's comment and said, "We apologize that the comment was broadcast through a swimming performance."
It was an unfortunately chosen formulation, we are sorry it happened."
CBC apologized over 90 times for the people who responded to the comment on Twitter
Commentor colleague Scott Russel had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald
CBC copied and inserted his apologies with more than 90 other Twitter users who had complained about MacDonald's comments
The network also quickly apologized and issued a message.
We sincerely regret that these statements were made and that it was made possible for them to be broadcast.
We quickly apologized to our spectators on broadcast and to our followers in the social media last night.
To clarify one thing, Byron's comments related to the performance of the swimmer and not to her as a person.
Nevertheless, they were inappropriate and an unfortunately chosen formulation. Byron is very sorry for what he has said.
On Thursday afternoon MacDonald apologized in the show and tried to justify his comment by saying that it was not his intention to interpret it as a personal attack.
"I'd like to take a moment to apologize for the comment I made after the women's swimming squad in the CBC Olympic broadcast, he said.
"I've been referring to the performance of the swimmer and not to her as a person."
Of course, no disdain was intended and I am very sorry."
Buyers in Primark outraged about woman who is trying shamelessly underwear in the middle of the shop
The buyers did not know where to look when a woman took off her clothes in the middle of a Primark to try underpants.
To make the situation worse, she patterned what she looked like in it, pulled it out and put it back into the shelf.
She continued to stop and tried four pairs of underpants in a shop at Bouverie Place Shopping Centre in Folkestone.
The Primark store at Bouverie Place shopping center in Folkestone where the woman tried the underpants before she put them back into the shelf
A mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was in business at the same time, said that after the mysterious woman had tried the underwear, "she again dressed up and left the business without buying anything."
She said, "People couldn't believe what they saw."
Standing in the middle of the sales area, she took a pair of underpants out of the display, pulled off her own tights and pants and tried them on.
"She didn't even try to find a more discreet place to do it - she just stood there, freaking like Oskar."
"Everybody stared when she pulled out the underpants she obviously didn't like, because she put them back in the shelf."
She repeated the same thing with three other underwear before she finally decided that she didn't like anything, dressed herself again and went out.
"She didn't seem to bother that she was watching someone - or thinking about the person who might be buying the underwear that she had tried."
Ms. Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said: "How disgusting to think that someone would take underpants home with him who had another person and who had not been washed."
The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson added: "As I've learned, the employees have tried to remove the garments from the sale after she went - which is just as good."
"I would hate to go home with a new pair of underwear and find out that another woman hated her and was taken out and she wasn't washed."
A spokesperson from Primark said: "Primark is aware of the incident that took place on Tuesday, August 9 in our Folkstone branch."
All the products in question were withdrawn from the sale.
How to protect yourself from arms attacks with Krav Maga
The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video of Dailymail.com could make it a bit safer for you.
We talked to Rhon Michigan, a Grand Master of the Krav Maga Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed robbers at a distance.
Regardless of whether you are approaching you from the front or from the back, this video will show you how you can turn the spear around for your robber.
If you approach you from the back, you should turn around first so that you can see your attacker and "go out of the shooting line," says Michigan.
Then grab the weapon between your front arm and your shoulder before you hit him with your free elbow in the face.
Then hit him with the knee in the chest and twist as the attacker bends in from pain, the weapon out of his hands. Hit him with the run into the face and move back while they point the gun at him.
For attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the shooting line, grab the weapon and twist it so that the attacker cannot shoot.
At the same time, publish the weight on the gun and hit the attacker on the chest, then twist the gun out of his grip before moving backwards and pointing the gun at him.
Sounds difficult?
Take a look at the video to see exactly how the video is set up.
But remember, it's safest to hand over your money - unless you're a Krav Maga Grandmaster.
Traveller Ian Wright scrapes his tongue in the most dirty places in Europe for a guide
A British traveler subjected his immune system and worm-flex to a serious test - by licking some of the most dirty and disgusting places in Europe.
The moderator and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk sluggished his train on a euro view, a terrain at Piccadilly Circus, a rinsing button of a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to demonstrate the resilience of his immune system.
Before leaking each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he will get in.
But the experiment, filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Stärth", brought some surprising results to light.
The idea of leaking the rinsing button of a train toilet that has already been used by thousands of others may be completely repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.
On his journey through Europe, Mr Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of colon bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, nothing he licked left more than a bad aftertaste in his mouth.
Mr. Wright became known for testing the resistance of his gut by traveling around the world and eating strange as well as wonderful things.
From public countries to stations to rinsing of toilets, the task was to definitely put his immune system under a sample
In the film he said, "Already as a child, I was relatively unattended about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and muddy water."
In the film, he was definitely quite right about his reputation.
The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.
Its sample line showed a luminometer of more than 4000 units.
In comparison, the number of luminometers of freshly washed hands is less than 60.
But there was a Russian toilet that he refused to lick, after their luminometer number was over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands had one of less than 60
Mr. Wright and Finnish producer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strictness", which shows the number of bacteria in various places such as the bathroom
In the film, he says, "This comes close to the worst of what I smelled in a toilet."
There's nothing more dirty than that!
I'm not gonna lick anything here because it's disgusting in here.
"The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Stärth" was produced in cooperation with the Finnish producer of dairy products Valio.
The company employs Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the promotion of gut bacteria and the immune system.
Valios Senior Venice President for Snacks, juices and New Categories Niko Vuorenmaa says, "We really wanted to offer the consumer something new.
Something fascinating to look at while simultaneously explaining the benefits of probiotics.
We carried out crazy brainstormings, which ended with saying "Let's call Ian."
They claim that the interest in colon health becomes a global phenomenon
Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a wider context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it is linked to the immune system.
The growing interest in colon health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary film we have been able to provide more information to consumers in an interesting way.
I also think the movie shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added: "Let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had licked some of the things I had instructed him to lick, just like the disgusting Russian toilet that is shown in the film."
Of course, there were things that made it easier to get Ian to lick them and others in whom this was quite difficult.
I'm glad we recorded some of these dirty treats on film."
In a 2015 Valio survey, 84 percent of all lactic acid bacteria surveyed in particular with the well-being of stomach and intestines and 58 percent said they were using at least occasionally products containing lactic acid bacteria.
Social family destroyed before detachment Social flat in Saltash, Cornwall
An a social family left her social home after a dementation with a damage of £50,000 because she had terrorized her neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints by their estate in Saltash, Cornwall.
After they were violently removed from their property, the house cooperative's employees found property in an irreparable state.
The walls showed clumsy holes, wood sections were torn up, garbage was scattered on the floor and graffiti was smeared to the walls.
The family was relocated and it is assumed that she now lives in a private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, who works for housekeeping at Cornwall Housing, said that she fears that the apartment is no longer to be repaired.
She said, "It was an absolute nightmare for the people here, and I think people don't have to live this way.
There are many things to consider, as this property is likely to be considered as not so beautiful part of Cornwalls.
The family is infamous and its reputation is also.
The couple had three sons living in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror the family had committed involved street fighting with baseball batons, intimidating residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive screaming, fighting and fleeing.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, received an order for antisocial behaviour in June.
In some rooms of the house that may be torn down, old garbage was found
In the estate in which drugs were traded in the past, the wood parts were torn up
Neighbors said they saw them fighting on the street and had to be called the police regularly
Cornwall Housing has declared her and her partner violently of the estate this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to voluntarily withdraw.
The detachment was cheered by relieved neighbors who said that their life was made hell.
One said, "They didn't scream around anyone."
We lived next to them for 20 years and it was always bad.
The countless times we're telling the police here are incredible.
"Today we couldn't sleep."
We got up because it was so quiet here - we're not used to it!
Now that they're finally gone, it'll be nice.
Adam Fitzpatrick, near-bourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said it would have forbidden the family to cooperate with the local authorities.
The family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals, for 20 years
On the overcrowded side of the town hall, garbage and old toys were thrown down
He added: "It is a shame that the tenants forbade accepting any responsibility for their behavior and their family's behaviour, as a detachment is always the last step to consider Cornwall Housing.
This was a very difficult case, because the behavior was extreme and their actions had to be a terrible thing for their neighbors.
I appreciate all the work that my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall, and members of the community who have courageously approached us and provided us with the information.
I hope that this development will give some neighbors comfort and convey the message that antisocial behavior is not tolerated.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times, but they were all over 20.
A dirty mattress left on the floor in one of the bedrooms of the house after detachment
Workers of the house administration will now have to clear away garbage mountains that surround the house
In 2014, the police conducted a razzia in the house and found over 70g cannabis as well as scales, paraphernalia and cash of £1,700.
Skeldon received a fine after she had been guilty of possessing a class B drug in trade.
She claimed that the money was for a gravestone of her son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After they were without a shelter, it is assumed that Tanya and her partner now live in a private accommodation in Plymouth.
Many walls of the house were covered with graffiti.
The police say she's going to delog tenants who don't comply with the house rules.
Angela Crow from Devon and Cornwall police told us that the detoxation was a clear warning to the other tenants who did not comply with the house rules.
"This is about those who think that they can act without self-admission and those who have been hurt by such a behavior," she said.
Devon and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and antisocial behavior, which will continue to cooperate with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal panic after flying a deep military jet beach
Sun worshipers in Aveiro, Portugal experienced the shock of their life
A Portuguese P-3C Orion aircraft of the Air Forces laid an incredible crash flight
The Air Forces indicated that there was a training flight, but insisted that there was no safety risk.
This was the moment when scared tourists began to panic after a deep jet crashed over a full beach.
Dramatic video shows how the military aircraft flew almost in tangible proximity across the sun worshipers on the beach section in Aveiro in northern Portugal.
The holidaymakers jump up when, understandably, they started to worry about the noise of the jet engines, without first seeing what came on them through the clouds.
The incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the many holidaymakers who posted videos about the dramatic Fly-By in the social media, said: "It flew twice really very deep and there was a moment when it looked like it was crashing."
Nuno Arroja added, "I was just surfing and it felt like the plane was falling on me."
Tourists at the beach of Aveiro were panicked when the plane came out of the darkness and incredibly deep flew
The Portuguese Air Forces today indicated that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and had to fly so deep that this was the only way to recognize them.
The speaker said that due to the bad vision conditions, the jet flowed somewhat deeper than usual due to nearby fires, but the air forces insisted that safety was at no time endangered.
Surface fires destroyed parts of the mainland of Portugal this summer, where four people died on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Forces today reported that the pilot had to fly so deep due to the conditions - strong fog and fire smoke - that restricted his vision
The plane was on a training flight in which the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise
Supercup: Barca with concerns about Seville
Seville - The Barcelona FC will fight for the first step to win the first title in the new football season on Sunday.
The Catalans take off the Spanish supercup against the FC Sevilla in duel, and the replay rises three days later at Camp Nou.
The double winner has to leave Neymar in power with the inferior Cup finalist and ruling Europa League champion, among others, who contests the Olympic football tournament with Brazil.
Goalie Marc-Andre is also missing for the road.
In training, the German suffered a banding in the knee, making the one question at Barca clear for the benefit of Claudio Bravo at least for the time being.
For two years, the Chilean International and Ter Strett have been competing for the status as number one in Barcelona.
Coach Luis Enrique so far waived a clear decision in this regard and left Bravo in the league, but for this reason Ter Stegen took the lead in most other competitions.
Before the first mandatory game of the new season, the Spanish champion has doubts about the fitness condition of the team, which was humiliated on Saturday in a test game by Liverpool with 0:4.
Also at 3:2 in the trial gallop against Sampdoria on Wednesday, Lionel Messi and Co. did not really know how to convince.
Seville again has to digest the 2:3 defeat after an extension in the European Supercup against Real Madrid and strives for the second triumph at the "Supercopa de Espana".
Barcelona is the winner of this competition with eleven results.
Ma Long in a separate league to table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic player.
On Thursday, the 27-year-old defeated his compatriot and title defender Zhang Jike 4:0 (12,5,4,4) in a one-sided finale.
This was the first to win the "Golden Grand Slam" with success at World Cup, World Cup, World Tour final tournament and just Olympia.
Bronze went to the Japanese Jun Mizutani.
The two Chinese made it to the final game, as expected, and made the title among themselves.
This made it clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese would bring the single title in the sign of the Five Rings.
The last non-Chinese on the top Olympic meeting was the former SVS-NÖ legionary Ryu Seung-min from South Korea.
Ma and Zhang were left alone on the record, between the sentences and at time-outs they had no coaches with them.
They had moved back to the courts and had their shooters split up in fair competition on their own.
"I've played the matches for my country until here."
"I play for me in the final," Zhang said in a follow-up.
After the game, gold and silver medal winners posing with the China flag.
The match itself was unexpected one-sided.
Ma had to fight with his 28-year-old opponent only in the first sentence.
After that, he determined the pace at the record and left Zhang with only 13 points.
Through the superiority of Ma did not develop the expected captivating match.
Nevertheless, enough stunning ball changes were to be seen.
Mizutani won the bronze match against 40-year-old Vladimir Samsonov 4:1.
In his quarter final against the German champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov, the white-breather had suffered a rib injury, after which he was in medical treatment, and had to be content with sheet metal.
By the way, Sweden's Jan-Ove Waldner (38/2004) and Jörgen Persson (42/2008) had become a similar table tennis age at Olympia.
Donald Trump gives rise to violent problems in the campaign
The leadership of the U.S. Republicans is plagued by massive concerns about losing their majority even in traditionally conservative states.
President-in-Office Donald Trump now admitted weaknesses in his election campaign at Utah Republican castle.
A rare moment in which the usually large-track and self-confident multi-millionaire expressed concerns as reported by correspondents.
After he threw 16 rivals out of the race within his own Republican camp, his doubts now grow as to his success in the struggle for the White House.
"We have enormous problems in Utah," said Trump to evangelical Christians whom he asked for support in important states such as Ohio, Florida or Virginia.
To blame for false reports of his candidacy, he resumed his well-known media screech.
Republican castles waving
Utah is usually a safe bank for Republicans.
According to a June Survey of Survey, Trump and his competitor from the Democratics, Hillary Clinton, were at the same time.
Other institutions see Trump in the front, but not by the distance that is common for Republican candidates in the state.
Arizona and Georgia are also considered to be endangered.
In an interview by the channel CNBC, Trump answered the question of how he wanted to stop the advance march of Clinton again: "Genauso, as I have done so far".
And push behind: "This will be either successful, or I will make a very nice, long holiday."
He didn't do anything else but "to tell the truth."
If, in the end, it is not enough for reasons of political correctness, Trump continued to say so.
Then I return to a very good way of life.
According to press reports, Trump should have threatened to remove funds to support his campaign, if he cannot present any better survey values.
Instead, the Republicans' candidates for the Congress are more likely to be attacked.
Olympia: Driest fraud in doping testing
The IOC intends to set up a Disciplinary Commission on the case.
Kenya's athlete threatens the second doping event at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
After a fraud attempt at a doping check in the Olympic village, Kenya sent a coach home.
The International Olympic Committee informed us immediately to set up a Disciplinary Commission to investigate the case.
A Kenyan officer had reported that the former Sprinter and today's coach, John Anzrah, had made a Urin test in the Olympic Village under the name of the 800-meter-runner Ferguson Rotich.
This was reported by the Doping controllers to Kenya's team management.
The International Association of IAAF has asked the IOC for information on the case in order to make its own investigations, a IAAF speaker announced.
"Depending on the results of the investigation and the subsequent measures of the IOC, IAAF will make an assessment," said an IAAF declaration.
"He (Anzrah) went to the doping control station and spent himself as Ferguson Rotich, gave the sample and signed it," said Kenya's chief de Mission Stephan Arap Soi.
He was in possession of the athlete’s accreditation, which was on the list of the World Anti-Doping Agency’s training controls.
Ferguson Rotich had become over 800 metres in 2015 in Beijing.
Four days earlier, the Kenyan athletics delegation chief Michael Rotich had been deducted from the Rio games.
He is expected to have informed athletes of his country about upcoming doping tests against cash payments.
According to media reports, he is said to have been arrested on his return to Nairobi Airport.
Kenya has been under special observation since many doping procedures at the IOC.
The announcement of the more than 2000 doping target controls made by the IOC before the Rio games has been unusually mentioned in advance that particularly athletes from Kenya and Russia are being put into sight.
The World Anti-Doping Agency had exerted much pressure on the African country before the summer games in Brazil to create an anti-doping law and a functioning control system.
The law was passed a few weeks before the Olympic start.
As a result, WADA took Kenya from the list of countries whose doping is consistent with the rules of WADA.
Kenya is considered a major runner nation.
At the 2015 World Cup in Beijing, the athletes of the country won most medals.
A number of ARD television reports have repeatedly brought accusations that doping funds are easily accessible in Kenya and that there is a significant mentality of sports fraud.
IOC member Richard Pound recently requested a similar investigation in Kenya, as he had done in the Russian athletics.
It has been demonstrated that this sport has been dipped across the board and systematically.
Russia's athletes were then excluded from the summer games.
Salzburger "West Side Story" with Cecilia Bartoli
In Shakespeare's year, the Salzburg Festival presents the West Side Story with Tony and Maria as a tragic pair of love, similar to Romeo and Julia.
With a surprising Cecilia Bartoli.
A musical conquers Salzburg: the West Side Story, Leornard Bernstein's masterpiece.
Artistic director Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classicalism and fulfilled a youth dream with the role of Mary.
In the orchestral tomb the Simón Bolívar orchestra led by Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel: "This music is full of rhythm", he warms.
We always say that it is very Latin American.
There are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and melody.
It is a wonderful mixture, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.
I would say that we really have Bernstein's music in our blood!
Bartoli plays an older Maria in this production.
She remembers her love with Tony, while the younger Maria plays and dances.
The role of Mary has always fascinated me.
First of all because it is musically exceptional!
And then there would be Mary's personality.
She says it in her song: "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and whitety and bright".
So she's smart, of course also naïve, and very passionate.
"She likes me very much, my Italian character, which I have as a Roman," Bartoli laughs.
Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."
It's such an honor for us to work with her.
She's a very generous person.
And Bartoli returns the compliment: "Dudamel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate!"
Conducting is a necessity for him.
You can see it in each of his movements, in his eyes, it's his life!
It is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him.
We both have a more southern temperament, a fire, a passion and also a joyful approach to life, that is very important at all!
For American director Philip Wm. McKinley, the West Side Story is highly up-to-date: "This is about prejudices and fanaticism."
Today we have the refugees, at that time the Puerto Ricans went to New York, and the New York residents did not want them.
These are the same topics, and they are just as meaningful today as they were then.
59 years later, the piece is still relevant.
London Schoolgirl, who joined the IS, was killed in Syria
According to reports, Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join the IS, died in Syria.
The lawyer Takope Akunjee said that her family learned about her death in Raqqa, Syria a few weeks ago.
It was suspected that she was killed by a Russian air raid in Raqqa, the group's bolmp in the country, reported ITV News on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and died, according to her family, shortly after she had planned to leave the war - torn country and return to England.
"One can only hope that the only good is - as warning and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going to a war zone - to prevent people from ever making this decision," said Akunjee.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other schoolgirls from East London boarded a plane towards Turkey and then entered a bus at the Syrian border.
Sultana's family was told that she married an ISIS fighter in Syria - and became a widow within a few months.
Reid says that Clinton will remain as candidates for the Supreme Court in the event of a election at Garland
Harry Reid, leader of the Democrats in the Senate, is convinced that the President-in-Office of the Democratic Party, Hillary Clinton, will appoint Judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court.
The Republicans in the Senate have blocked Garland's confirmation since his nomination by Barack Obama in March.
The majority leader in the Senate Mitch McConnell believes that the next president will appoint the successor of the deceased judge to the Supreme Court Antonin Scalia.
Reid said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he expected Clinton to select Garland "with a certain degree of certainty".
A speaker from Reid later said that he had not yet spoken to Clinton if she would nominate Garland and he speculate.
He praised Garland and said Clinton's team wouldn't cause trouble with a new candidate.
Garland is the Supreme Judge of the US Appeal Court for the District of Columbia.
Raid said Republicans blocked the Garlands nomination, were Lakaien and helpers to the Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He also noted that Donald Trump was inappropriate for the presidential office.
Treats wants Nacktkalendar for "Women and for Men"
The Treats Magazine works with photographer David Bellemere to bring out a 1970s Pirelli-inspired Kalendar for 2017.
But instead of famous naked people, they want to find the next generation of top models for their NU Muse Kalendar for 2017.
The editor-in-chief of Treats Steve Shaw told us at the beginning of this year that his naked magazine differed from Oldschool-Playboys, since "Playboy was for men".
I'm doing this for women.
Apparently, he believes that the Kalendar also does.
"We need to return to the presentation of timeless and classical nudity, in which both women and men feel comfortable and inspired by these images of a female body," said Shaw in a press release on the Kalendar's publication.
Women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art.
Models can submit their images online or personally with open casting calls in Los Angeles and New York.
Turkey: Kurdish community expects mass flight
"Whoever doesn't adapt and praises Erdogan, sits on packed suitcases," says Ercan Karakoyun, Chairman of the Gülen-Near Foundation Dialogue and World.
The Kurdish community of Germany expects in the short term with tens of thousands of people seeking protection who flee from Turkey to Germany.
In the medium term, it could even become "some hundred thousand," believes the president of the association Ali Toprak.
Due to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's hard action following the coup, the Kurdish community of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany.
"In the short term, I count with tens of thousands, in the medium term with several hundred thousand people seeking protection from Turkey in Germany, if the Erdogan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition," says Ali Toprak, president of the "World" of Friday.
Because the government had already covered Kurdish strongholds with criminal actions months ago, 500,000 Kurds were fleeing within Turkey.
After the destroyed coup, even secular and oppositional ethnic Turks would be added.
Many will want to start new in Europe if they are further suppressed in Turkey.
"It can't be that a state that takes up refugees itself in its own country produces refugees," said Toprak.
The head of the association complained of the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish but also in Alevitian cities.
Erdogan wants to increase the exit pressure on the remaining Kurds.
"They are the last major minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have been exterminated or expelled in the last hundred years," said Toprak, who is also a CDU member.
The head of the association demanded that the Federal Government "position itself as sharply as Austria against Erdogan and its followers".
Also in Germany there is a "Hexenjacht" against Erdogan critics.
I have not felt safe in Germany for the first time in recent months.
The German branch of the Gülen movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad.
More Turks will seek asylum in Germany, especially Kurds and oppositionists.
The branding as a gilding trailer destroys teachers and other academics' professional existence.
"Whoever doesn't adapt and praises Erdogan, sits on packed suitcases, by the way also the kemalists and seculars," said Ercan Karakoyun, Chairman of the Gülen-Near Foundation Dialogue and Education, the "World".
As the newspaper reports in response to figures from the Federal Ministry of the Interior, the Turks were the largest group of asylum seekers in Germany in front of the coup.
At the end of June 30, this was 11,386 people, and thus almost 29 percent of all persons entitled to asylene (39,625).
This survey does not include those who have fled before war, poverty or perspektivelessness.
Asylum rights under the Basic Law are exclusively political, i.e. from the state, individually persecuted.
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: "Where it hurts"
Rare Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: The locals don't get anything from the summer election - and holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to choose the country day.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.
In 2021 the Landtag election will not take place at the end of the summer holidays again, the Schwerin Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.
Because it's not so far: summer holidays, heat and land-based campaign - that's what bites.
The locals who are to be convinced by the election fighters are on vacation.
Most of the holidaymakers who are in the country, traveling on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are not locals, so they are not allowed to choose the country day.
In addition, practical problems arise: In the holidays, helpers who hang up posters, blow up balloons, distribute flyers, and end up counting voices are only tiresome to start up.
By 4 September 2016, the election and last holiday day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern will have to pass the people on one occasion.
The hot phase, if you can say that at all, has just begun.
And it is also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD/CDU coalition, must fear his office.
The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in surveys.
Exciting is how strong newling AfD is cut off and what remains at the end of coalition suitable.
Sellering, 66 years old and since 2008 head of government, makes an almost inconspicuous campaign, one looks at his large posters.
He travels through the land, distributes roses and chats a little with the people, just as his legendary dictionary predecessor Harald Ringstorff did.
Otherwise, soul ring has got cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel the blame for the blooming of the AfD.
Her refugee policy, her "We create it" has accelerated the rise of right-wing populists, which is likely to cost him the beautiful office now.
The CDU with its top candidates, the Interior Minister Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is when you make an election campaign at the wrong time.
She has invited two chancellors Angela Merkel to major demonstrations; Merkel Federal Election Circle is located in the northeast.
But the target group did not agree, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berliner and Saxony than Mecklenburger and Vorpommern.
"There was probably the majority of other states," lamented Vincent Kokert, Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in the NDR.
But no one from other corners of Germany can listen to Angela Merkel.
Otherwise, the Northeast CDU largely refrains from the usual electoral positions on marketplaces and in front of shopping centers with parasols and balloons.
That, says Kokert, only plays a "subordinate role".
The Union has also noticed that on the land you are breaking away the basis that it must work very hard to find a wire to the people again.
It is like the left, the SPD, the Greens: it is hardly present in the country's vastness.
However, the CDU election fighter's advice to his fellow fighters is also self-evident: "They have to go where it hurts, namely where people are: village festivals, golden weddings, every birthday celebration must be used".
Because much is at stake, Sellering has now called his SPD for a particularly committed election campaign.
In surveys, the Social Democrats were last behind CDU (25) with 22 percent and only just before the AfD (19).
In the 2011 election, the SPD had won clearly 35.6 percent before the CDU (22).
The Greens, small parties with seven percent in the surveys, are expected to create the leap into the country.
They make the holiday note a modern virtue and move their campaign largely to the Internet.
"Online election", it is called the chairman of the state Claudia Müller.
On the other hand, green election fighters go on their way to search for local voters among the holidaymakers.
Silke Gajek, the top candidate, is just wandering through the Mecklenburg lakes with a houseboat and also finding it beautiful.
Your impression: "Walk Holiday in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is not a penalty".
B27-Rehabilitation: restaurants suffer from blocking
At the speed with which the B 27 is renovated, there is nothing to mess with.
For those responsible for the construction work, which starts at 5.30 in the morning and only ends at 8 p.m., there is praise everywhere.
"They've made everything pretty tough," Elvira Tetzlaff tells us about the jet gas station.
It's a superteam.
There's no delay either.
At the beginning of the week, the construction site was planned to be moved south at mid-term, and by the end of October everything was to be finished.
The presence of those responsible for the construction works is also praised, for example, in the setting up of relief entrances.
Since the construction site has migrated south on Monday and the blockage of the Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen has also been removed and thus the connection to Rottenburg is established again, the traffic situation has relaxed within the place.
Citizens can now proceed from Ofterdingen from the B 27 on both sides.
Elimination through the place seems to go back.
"There have been some significant complaints," says the deputy head of the Florian King, responsible for the transport management of the renovation.
The inhabitants of Bachsätzstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise, because many of them were looking for lockways and were more familiar with their Navi than with the signage.
This led to the burning of some trucks in residential areas.
Since the speed limits were not met, the municipality more strongly demanded the measuring vehicle from Mössingen.
"There were significant excesses," says King, who once knew himself about the situation on the spot.
There have already been two to three flashes per minute.
The fastest was on the way at 77 kilometers in the tempo-30 zone.
Since the construction site has continued, however, it has become calmer.
For businessmen at B 27, it is only a small comfort that the road is now open to customers from Rottenburg.
Businessers don't like to look at the cards.
But that the B 27 renovation has resulted in sales collapses, lets everyone you ask see through.
However, some are more and some less affected.
Whoever has less to do with the "end customer", i.e. produced for other companies, for whom the refurbishment has hardly any consequences.
Thomas Sulz also speaks of a "highest slight decline" at the Maier car house, but also admits that of course "the career is missing".
The most exploited are the locals along the road.
J. Albert Göhner, owner of the steakhouse, formerly Krone, finds clear words.
It's already threatening existentence.
Not only did he, but all the restaurants were "hard to meet".
The customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil were missing.
We must be happy about every euro turnover.
The loss of sales is "over 50 percent".
The road refurbishment had "turned back by two years".
He had to release half of his employees.
If I had a company with 4000 employees and half had been released, policy would have responded differently.
Instead, government president Jörg Schmidt replied to a request from Göhner whether there could be a financial compensation, with the suggestion that the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the situation at B 27. Now it must also bear the disadvantages resulting from the renovation.
Göhner knows about other districts, where this was done more generously.
In all complaints, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue.
Finally, the family business has been located here since 1715, he refers to the long history.
The fact that other regulars now less often pass because of the complicated traffic management, he can understand.
If you can't drive around, it's nice somewhere else.
The fact that his common clientele returns after the end of the renovation work has no doubt about this.
Despite the crises with BSE and bird flu, Göhner considers the effects of B 27 constructions on his clientele to be the greatest crisis his host has experienced in his many years of history.
Six months of construction work, it's already brutal.
In the name of the fight against terrorism, laws are constantly being made.
After the recent attacks, Interior Minister de Maizière presents a thick security package.
But what does a dubious state have to do with terror?
And what does the coalition partner say about all this?
Thomas de Maizière gives the reconciler.
All of his proposals would be "politically reasonable" to the coalition partner, says the Federal Minister of the Interior in presenting his new security package.
They don't overwhelm anyone.
Other further points would initially be discussed within the parties.
I'm also taking part in that.
As Minister of the Interior, however, he was on the basis of results and on a "responsible consensus" within the coalition.
After the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, De Maizière has missed a little time before presenting his conclusions on security in the Republic.
However, they are all the more extensive in this respect.
Some is already known, proclaimed, determined: The fact that a new security authority should take care of the cracking of encrypted communication is not new.
Nor is it the fact that Germany must implement several EU rules on passenger data and arms law.
The call for more video surveillance and personnel for the security authorities does not come as a surprise.
In part, de Maizière launches a second start on proposals that the SPD has not yet had to do with: he wants to punish sympathy advertising for terrorist groups and to push jihadists with double citizenship off the German passport.
"This will be difficult points for the SPD," admits the CDU man.
He still considers this to be reasonable and does not demand anything that the coalition partner has any chance at all.
A few new ideas are also presented by the Maizière.
Some of them have it in themselves: He plans fast-tracking procedures for deportations and more possibilities for the detention of people before the deportation.
Refugees who are being brought to the country should have their smartphones checked before and disclose social media accounts for a security check.
He wants to make some worse than those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers in order to conceal their identity in the case of suffrages for rejected asylum seekers.
Some of them are politically and legally delicate.
Some of them also seem unbridled and leave questions open.
And on a number of points, for example, when treating the patient, the question arises: What does this actually have to do with security and terror?
Yes, de Maizière says it is important to differentiate between the topics of refugees and terror.
But it can't be said in agreement that the assassins of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.
Moreover, in view of the high number of refugees, many people were concerned about safety.
And things that people were deeply occupied were not allowed to end in election times.
The internal security is enormously focused.
First the attacks in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.
Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.
The uncertainty is great.
And yes, there are election struggles on.
Union and SPD are therefore increasingly positioning on the issue of internal security.
In the last few days, the two parties have gone high.
It is only a gratifying dispute about the establishment of the federal police, then about a security-political idea-gathering of some Ministers of the Union, in which the chiefs of ressort also demand a Burka ban and a departure from double citizenship.
De Maizière is also working hard to make up for the sounds of reconciliation.
From a double pass, he doesn't think he's doing anything.
We have satisfied the discussion in Germany.
They don't make sense.
And in case of a Burka ban, he has constitutional concerns.
Whether its own package is constitutionally fixed at all corners and whether it is "appropriate" for the coalition partner, has yet to show up.
There's a few things in there that could cause disputes.
But the SPD is also trying to profile itself on the issue of internal security.
Party leader Sigmar Gabriel first signals caution and says: "The SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further increase security."
Volkswagen is still coming through smoothly.
Despite diesel scandals, extradition figures are rising worldwide.
But not in all markets.
In the recall action, there is a vortex for a term.
Volkswagen starts with the extraditions more behavioral in the second half of the year.
Although Europe's largest car builder can continue to show a plus in the course of the year, thanks to its many brands and some well-running markets, despite the diesel affair.
However, in July, the VW nuclear brand weakened mainly in Western Europe, thereby reimposing the total sales, as reported by the Dax company.
In July, the VW brand sold 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous month with 449100 cars worldwide.
In Western Europe alone, according to China's second most important market, sales were 14 percent below the previous month.
In the home market Germany, extraditions fell by almost a sixth.
Head of the brand Jürgen Stackmann reduced the weaker figures from July to two sales days less in Europe.
In addition, there has been a buy-back in some core markets through "changed economic conditions".
In addition to the situation surrounding the coup in Turkey, the British vote has also burdened the exit from the EU, explained a speaker.
In the U.S., where the exhaust affars were first escalated, there is also a minus.
Large support for VW is the Chinese market.
Overall, the mainly affected house brand of the Lower Saxony is still slippery through the Diesel scandal: After the first seven months, only a reduction of extradition of 0.9 percent to 3.37 million vehicles is available.
Head of Sales Fred Kapper was able to continue to show a sales increase from January to July.
1.3 percent more vehicles delivered Volkswagen at this time, worldwide 5,904 million.
Volkswagen had manipulated exhaust gas tests with a software.
In Germany alone, VW calls about 2.5 million cars for conversion to the workshops.
In the course of the conversion, VW confirmed that the conversion of the cars did not have a negative impact.
Once the vehicles have been converted, there is no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine performance.
The automaker issue a "guarantee" certificate to the customer after the upgrade, but do not refer to a "guarantee" as it was in business circles on Friday.
The reason is legal fines.
The "Focus" had reported that Volkswagen provided its German customers with a guarantee for retrofitted diesel models.
Last Monday, VW representatives at the Federal Ministry of Transport confirmed this.
The Ministry of Transport confirmed that there was this meeting.
"VW has to fully meet the requirements of my investigation commission and KBA."
According to Minister of Transport Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), "Derogations are not accepted", states Minister of Transport Alexander Dobrindt (CSU).
VW has taken over the guarantee that, in the case of fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power after the upgrade, no deterioration occurs and all vehicle type-approval values have remained unchanged.
Volkswagen itself does not use the term "guarantee" as it was called in corporate circles.
With the broad term "guaranty", Volkswagen sees the possibility that customers, for example, will come to a workshop half a year after the upgrade, for example, with motor damage - and this could lead back to the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it.
It is also important in the interests of customers to avoid any other damage that does not have anything to do with the waste gas scandal, as it was said, in terms of possible guarantee arrangements.
Therefore, VW does not use the term "guarantee".
The Raiffeisenbank Gmund am Tegernsee requires rich savers to pay criminal interest - as the second institute in Germany.
Bank head Josef Paul said on Thursday: "It's only 139 customers who park 40 million euros on giro or daily cash accounts."
The Bundesverband Deutscher Banken speaks of an individual case and sees no signal in it: Normal savers should "not fear to pay for their spargrossian interest rates".
In storage banks money overnight at the European Central Bank (ECB), they have to pay their 0.4 percent interest rate.
As of September, the Raiffeisenbank Gmund charges this fee from private and corporate customers for deposits of over 100,000 euros on Giro or daily cash accounts.
"The first 100,000 euros are free."
"The next 100,000 euros a year will cost 400 euros," said Paul.
It has been keeping 40 million euros for some time, which could be lifted from one day to the next and which it cannot use.
"These are on my central bank account and cause 0.4 percent costs," said the bank manager.
"I can't lie down for every million euros."
The costs are now passed on in accordance with the 'polluter pays' principle.
Just leaving the cash in the safes of the Raiffeisenbank would be far too dangerous: "I've already experienced four raids, I don't want to be the fifth!" the board of bank members said.
Most customers had understanding and switched to other forms of investment.
Few migrated to other banks.
The Bayern Association stated: "The extreme monetary policy price of the ECB causes considerable costs for all banks".
To carry them on their own is "unsustainable in the long run".
Some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account management, credit cards or transfers.
The Thuringian Volks- and Raiffeisenbank Altenburger Land had made headlines with their Skatbank branch in 2014 with interest rates for deposits of less than three million euros.
Michael Kemmer, Chief Executive Officer of the Banks Association, said: "We do not expect private customers to pay for deposits on a wide scale, and the competition in Germany between banks and savings banks is far too strong."
A banker said, at the Tegernsee there were "a clientele that is a little more abundantly equipped with wealth".
"This can become a problem for a small bank if it pays for free money.
Founded in 1911, Gmund has branches in Bad Wiessee, Rottach-Egern, Kreuth and Tegernsee.
The region has well-known actors, athletes and entrepreneurs.
The association of cooperatives in Bavaria "There are currently no other banks that charge a deposit of private customers," said Spokesperson Ernst.
The president of the German People's Banks and Raiffeisenbanken (BVR), Uwe Fröhlich, said at the end of June: "The threshold of going to the negative towards the private customer is very, very high".
Competition is tough, and it threatens the emigration of investors to compete.
The customers in Germany will not like this in width.
Destination records: who actually buys records?
Lonely men of old age love plates.
Before you hurry to the comment section to hand it over under the pseudonym NotAllEinsameMenMittleAlders with harsh insults, this statement is derived from current data.
According to YouGov, the much discussed resumption of records is not due to a boom in Millennials that want to welcome the novelty of physical objects, but to midlife nostalgia.
Those who have recently bought a plate are in all probability between 45 and 54 years of age.
In fact, the 18-24 age group is the most unlikely buyer group.
It is also not a hordes by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers keep their feelings more for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).
But do the results of YouGov vote?
If this blog were a television news report, the camera would follow me as I walk in the middle of a busy street in Soho, wear a modest grey suit and solidify wildly before I stop, hold my hands, and say something definite like, "So, let's take a closer look at it."
So, let's take a look at that.
Even though the heart of Sohos slowly breaks into its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic plate shops.
I would probably ask the cameraman to turn off the camera for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such stores and try to assess her age and mind by observation.
Stuart from Glasgow, 55, which I follow from Sister Ray (number of data: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (number of data: eight middle-aged men, a woman, probably around 20) is one day because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.
Is he a collector, I ask?
"I guess," he says.
I've got about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These records, pictured above (he sent me the shot by e-mail, I didn't follow him home), dress out the walls of his living room.
The reason he owns such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records that he could not afford when they appeared and to buy again items he sold when he was young and pleaded.
"Many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. Things I was probably too young to buy them," he says.
He agrees that those who buy plates are more introverted and like to spend time alone, adding: "I don't smoke and I don't drink much.
That's my truck.
Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many customers he meets are on the YouGov profile.
However, he has also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media hype, people who have heard about the comeback and who are making themselves see themselves buying their old records again.
Of the conversations I've held, people have usually done so around 1998 or 1999 of their collection.
Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again," he says.
This would explain the tree to followers of the plate survival of a certain age.
But what about the supposed emotional significance of plates?
It only takes a few seconds in a business like Phonica to realize that record shops offer a soothing community of like-minded people.
According to Wez, some of the older customers took an incitement to the contactless payment system.
Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to withdraw to the stability of familiar record covers, from objects that arouse happy youth memories.
"I think sometimes it can be the filling of an empty or the possession of material possessions as a sort of consolation," says Wez.
It's like I'm a collector, and I think that's the case with many people.
It is a simple way to engage spiritually.
"We are like their social workers!" an employee flocks from a slab pile.
A poll of the ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people who bought a record last month have not heard them yet.
The survey also found that 41% have a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record have no record player.
At this time of the news report, I would probably look very concerned while handing through a pile of Bossa Nova compilations.
Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (number of data: three middle-aged men), has noticed a "trophen aspect" of the Revival.
"Someone came in here recently and said, "I don't own a record player, but I would like to buy a radiohead record so I can put it into the shelf," he says.
This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.
More productive, less musicy.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
These are younger people, not older ones, who come in slowly.
Fopp, who has dedicated almost an entire floor to the records, has a colorful audience when I went in.
There are couples around 70, tourists taking photos, teens and women middle ages.
Even if the atmosphere is a little less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beast's latest synthesizer and sex-packed pop instead of experimental jazz dries from the speakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers.
None of them look peculiarly lonely, but the nagging psychological traumas are difficult to detect when standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been walking around in the store for a few minutes and is looking at the variety of plates for sale.
She's more likely to make a mannequin than a big purchase.
It does not deserve much, so collecting records is not a real option, she says.
It costs a lot.
It's easy to hear music from a computer or in any other way, but the beauty of records is..." she drives off with a popular sigh.
I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.
My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: Urban Outfitters.
While I appear to be modeling the jeans hotpants, I observe a group of young teen girls who are grouping around Polaroid cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter think they're buying a Crosley record player.
To the left there is a staircase, a wall full of records of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.
No one sees them - perhaps because they're just decorative, some so far up that it's impossible to touch them.
It's pure "Plattenkunst".
But considering that any attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and send some customers into the depths of Sohos for more, there is nothing to complain about.
It is no surprise that a population that has more time and money than others is also the one that spends most on luxury items such as plates.
Although my research has shown that youGov's results are true, they do not take into account, at least in record stores in Soho, the large number of female collectors and record lovers who exist in reality, record shops and online forums.
These people probably work hard in school or in offices.
They certainly don't spend their Thursday mornings bubbling through plate shops on Berwick Street and the leaves through plates, while avoiding the stark look of a hideous, 30-year-old false moderator who is looking up over the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Greenlandhai is the longest living vertebrate - video report
Scientists say Greenlandhai has the longest life span of all vertebrates on the planet.

French court rejects offer on the demolition of transactions in the jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected an offer from the authorities in Calais to destroy dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, where thousands of refugees live.
During a court hearing this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be empowered to bring down 72 provisional stores in which persons inside the warehouse sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer hairdresser services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 Pence) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants.
The prefecture of Calais argued that these places should be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which would pose a fire and sanitation risk.
Humanitarian groups informed the court that the shops and restaurants were important, as the free meals offered by the State-supported association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the warehouse.
They also argued that the provisional shops and restaurants would often offer accommodations and free meals for people in need.
A Lille court ruled that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people operating the 72 provisional transactions, but admitted that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais were "absolutely understandable."
Judge Jean-François Molla said that the grocery stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much larger role than just feeding people who "live in extremely precarious conditions."
He said that the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places that was threatened by the low crack was the camp's Jungle Book Kids' Café, which is non-profit and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as advice on asylum for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed the petition to preserve the Kids' Café.
In a letter to the Guardian, it was said that the closure would be "for these children a catastrophe of which the youngest eight years of age are."
On Friday, the two aid organizations Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrant estimated that the number of young people living in the jungle camp had increased to over 9,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase in new arrivals during the summer.
Despite Olympic disappointment: Martin remains combative
Despite his disappointing appearance in the Olympic era, Radprofi Tony Martin does not want to be undermined.
"I continue to watch the World Cup, remain confident and continue to fight," the 31-year-old wrote on Thursday before leaving Rio de Janeiro on Facebook.
He has no explanation for his miserable twelfth place at the sugar hut.
"I honestly find it hard to comment on the time trial of yesterday," said Martin.
He should have calmly analysed the reasons for the debacle.
Martin actually wanted to compete for the title at the Zeitfahr World Championship in Qatar in October.
"I'm going to take a closer look at everything we've changed in recent times."
"This also counts my position," wrote the three-time time-travel world champion who lost more than three minutes on Wednesday on the 54,5 km at the Olympic winner Fabian Cancellara (Switzerland).
Olympia: Tennis Profi Siegeund misses semifinals
The victory of Laura Siegeund ended in the quarter finale of Rio: The world rankings 32. from Metzingen missed by a 1:6, 1:6 against Monica Puig (Puerto Rico/WTA-Nr.
34) the semi-final of the Olympic tennis tournament.
Siegund, who was plagued by back problems, could only carry out her impact once and acted powerlessly compared to the previous rounds.
On Thursday, Angelique Kerber (Kiel/No. 2) had the chance to jump to the preliminary round.
The Australian open winner met the British Johanna Konta (No. 10).
As the last German tennis pro, Tommy Haas had taken a medal (silver) in Sydney in 2000.

Group joins in startup for live video video broadcasts
Watching other people while playing video games is a big trend - of which Microsoft also wants to benefit.
The technology group buys the start-up beam that specialises in this hobby.
How much money flows for the acquisition, Microsoft did not share on Thursday.
Beam started his offer only in January and already has more than 100,000 users.
You can watch others while playing, but you can also intervene yourself.
For example, they can give up missions to the players and confront enemies and provide equipment.
The Playful Activision Blizzard launches a new HD video service for the booming world of e-sports.
On the way to the global media event, Facebook will help.
The advertising industry is already listening.
The employees of the start-up, which has its seat in Seattle, Washington, are moving to Microsoft headquarters in the California Redmond, as Beam co-founder and CEO Matt Salsamedi reported.
Therefore, nothing should change for the customers through the acquisition.
According to Microsoft, Beam is integrated into the video game department around the Xbox console.
The market of live streaming of video game activities is growing rapidly.
Known platforms are Twitch and YouTube Gaming.
Twitch was bought in 2014 by online dealer Amazon - for almost one billion dollars.
YouTube Gaming belongs to the Google-Mother Alphabet.
Here comes the Enforcement Trailer
Germany's shaver needs to adjust to the next generation speedometer: in various federal countries, including Hessen and Brandenburg, new lightning devices are being tested, which are particularly effective in transmitting the speed probes.
The futuristic-acting Enforcement Trailer of Vitronic from Wiesbaden can be used, for example, at areas of accident where it would be too dangerous for police mobile measurement.
For example, at motorway construction sites or to renovated bridges with a temporary speed limit there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure compliance with the speed limit with a stationary flashes.
A permanent mobile structure, however, can be too dangerous or elaborate.
The Enforcement Trailer is autark: Its battery holds five days in continuous measurement operation, the case data is transmitted encryptedly via a modem.
Laser measurement technology also allows all vehicles to be recorded simultaneously across multiple tracks.
Variable speed limits as well as transit bans by time, lanes and vehicle class can also be monitored.
In the high-level state you can move the trailer according to the manufacturer with any car with trailer coupling.
In order not to be simply stolen, it is lowered in the measuring operation, so that the wheels disappear in the punched and by the way also shock-proof outer shell.
In addition, a built-in alarm system is intended to protect the lightning against vandalism.
Since 2015, the trailer has been tested by Vitronic in various federal states and is now also used.
Foreign authorities are also flashing with the new technology: France recently ordered 100 pieces, after an order of 150 pieces last year.
UK brings silver in the 7-s Rugby after Fiji Masterclass gets gold
The impressive performance of Britain at the 7-er Rugby came to an abrupt stop at the last obstacle in the form of the Fijis in the final on Thursday evening when they were beaten with a result of 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji gave a master class in handling, side-stepping, back, line running and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any color.
The defeat was sweetened by the not too bad consolation prize of the silver medal - Britain's fourth this day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The clear defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semifinal on the same day, could fall on them in the finale.
But regardless of that, Fiji would have beaten a 15-man team in the best shape in this form.
It could be a consolation for GB, but it probably won't - that at least one Brit will have a gold medal to hang around his neck tomorrow: Fiji's chief coach Ben Ryan, the former head of England from Wimbledon.
GB had a difficult path behind it.
Eight years ago, they lost every game in the Adelaide Sevens under Ryan.
Here they just lost one.
This blow will hurt, but the progress is amazing.
Fiji started wonderful and had the attacks beat off GBs out of fun.
It felt for Captain Tom Mitchell and Co. as if you were running in driving buses. The World Series winners went up 5-0 when Osea Kolinisau was hanging up in the corner.
With four more minutes of playing time, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner he converted.
12-0 and GB have hardly touched the ball.
A high-end Tackle of Mitchell stopped the mountain of Man Leone Nakarawa to reach a third gate, but it just stopped Fiji.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua left a touchdown in the right corner and it stood 0-17 for GB.
Nakarawa added a new one since the re-approach and there was still over a minute playing time ... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou pruned through other weak Tacklings of the GB team and stormed to the line to make a goal.
The conversion brought a 29-0 to the break.
It's like Fiji was born to play the 7 while GB is still learning to play.
That's how it is.
GB carried out fundamental changes at half-time and closed the Physian gap...for all four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time until Joshua Tuisova went through after a brilliant interplay of Fiji.
Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game was long in favor of the South Sea insulators, whose fans sang flags and danced on the gallery.
It was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fiji.
Mata Viliame put the i-tub with another attempt in the last seconds.
The pipe rang, the Fijis hugged, and GB kicked in the lawn with annihilation.
Earlier that day Fiji defeated Japan in the semifinal by 20-5 and Great Britain pushed South Africa in a short semi-final match from the race - Great Britain's transformation of the difference.
Kyle Brown brought the Boks forward in the first half, but Dan Norton broke the line with an impressive footwork and scored a gate under the posts in the second half.
A brilliant late Tackling by Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-Aside team, secured the winning and thus the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by the fight with the coach's cancer to win the row
There will be no more emotional gold than at these games and that's what wants to be called.
From the first rowing to the last, 220 hard hips that go into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.
Even though it was only the two who sat on the rower, there were three voices in the boat. The echo of the coach Robin Williams, was always present when they rowed to the second Olympic gold in two without a tax woman in a row, the first women in the history of British sports who set such a scale.
Their dominance was absolute, after all their 39.t unscathed use, which is also unprecedented.
What we see are two brilliant athletes who slide across the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the nature of triumphalism completely.
Behind every gold in rowing is a battalion of willing helpers who contribute to the incremental progress that makes the difference and it was no one more helpful than the trainer who did not know 30 months ago whether he would survive this day at all than was diagnosed with cancer.
Like he said, there was something risky.
I had bladder cancer, which can be operated, and they did.
If you don't, he'll spread everywhere.
It would have been a pretty bad situation.
It changes the outlook a little bit.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio was lucky that he could begin his treatment at the beginning of 2014, outside the season, which kept the interruption to a minimum, if under such circumstances that is at all the right term.
I needed money, so I had to go better soon.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said some steps would suffice.
That's how it starts.
The rowing itself is already a challenge, but that makes it one even bigger.
In the immediacy of the victory, their first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nervous morning talking more than usual, trying to deal with his own fears.
Stanning, who was a captain in the Royal Artillery Regiment in an operation in Afghanistan, said, "I was an emotional wreck this week. That's perhaps something extreme, but it means so much."
It just repeats how much that means to me how much I and Helen and Robin have worked.
There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin we wouldn't be anybody, so a massive thank you goes to him. He's the best trainer in the world.
I couldn't have wanted a better person to train or a better trainer.
Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race in the last five years.
The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up with.
Even in the last 500 meters when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to join, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.
We were very caught at the moment.
Helen called "Stay in the process, stay in the process."
It is really important not to get caught up.
We had a good start and at the same time we didn't want to do something great.
We didn't want a fireworks today, we just wanted to achieve a good result, go out and win the race, whatever we did.
The couple will take one year to make decisions about their future.
Glover must appear at a wedding next week, her own with the TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't want to say that was my last race.
That would have meant too much pressure.
In London it took about six months to understand that I was an Olympic winner.
It was all so new to me and I was so stressed.
This took about four minutes.
That feels so much better," she said.
For 31 years exemplary for clarity
The managing director of the "Veitensteingruppe", Ruppert Göller, is retired.

A small Franconian drinking water association as a model for the large water producers.
Some time ago, it was originally in a contribution from the Bavarian radio station.
Little later, the Water Forum of the Government of Unterfrunken acknowledged the purpose of the association.
The work of the Veitenstein Group was considered "bayernwide as an example".
Behind all of this is Rupert Göller, who was 31 years of staff in the field association, 28 of them as Managing Director.
Now he was retired at the age of 65.
The drinking water association of the Veitenstein group with its headquarters in Kottendorf, Breitbrunn municipality, supports about 150000 cubic metres of water annually and provides 32 places and villages with about 5500 inhabitants.
Members are the municipalities of Kirchlauter, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the city of Baunach.
There are water supply contracts for other cities and municipalities.
The current president, Breitbrunn Mayor Gertrud Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert Göller was recruited as a waterguard in 1985 and had already been appointed managing director of the target association in 1988.
"His tasks have been very diverse and extended from water management and maintenance work to office and organizational activities, budget creation, calculation of fees and contributions, and emergency payments on weekends," said the president.
She mentioned the start-up and initiation of the new wells (1994), the purchase of land in the area of the new wells (1998) and the compensation of farmers, the renovation of the high tanks (1999), the re-establishment of a central computer control system (2004) and the partial renewal of water pipes.
There has been no standstill, and it has always been renewed because water means life and drinking water is the most important food.
In her laudatio she praised Göller's faithful, reliable and correct service over 31 years.
He has worked with a lot of heart blood for his water-use association and he has lived the water-use association as if it were his own company.
A few weeks ago, as a real practitioner, he was allowed to present the Veitenstein Group's concept of success for nitrate reduction in front of the Water Forum of the district Unterfrunken.
He received a great deal of recognition and praise for this.
Rupert Göller, for his part, praised Alfons Griebel, who had worked with him for 28 years.
He's the best waterguard and he was a faithful boy.
Together we were an unbeatable team.
From his point of view, he described well construction and the restructuring of the purpose association.
However, the biggest challenge and the most difficult use were the break at the high-pitch container at Kirchlauter on January 3.
Here at minus 17 degrees will have to work all night long so that the villages could be supplied with water.
Also, the supply of Neubrunn could only be maintained once because the high-pitched container of Pettstadt was filled with hoses.
The management of the drinking water association was handed over to Daniel Stürmer from Lauter, who succeeds Rupert Göller.
Soprano Anna Netrebko turns openly to the autism of her son Tiago - and turns to other parents affected: "You must have the courage to talk about it."
"Medicine has made great progress," said the 44-year-old of the Italian newspaper "Corriere della Sera".
When the disease was recognized with her son, she believed that she had to die.
The now eight-year-old Tiago has come forward well and now learn privately in New York, where there are the best therapists.
"To give an example: If I ask him something that was two years ago when I sang to the Milan Scala, he remembers nothing," said Netrebko.
But he is the happiest man on earth.
Tiago comes from Netrebko's connection with the Bassbaritone Erwin Schrott.
She is now married to the Tenor Yusif Eyvazov.
Relationship Stat in Bargeteheide - Man shoots on companion of life
A 35-year-old man shot at his partner at a multifamily house in Bargteheide (Kreis Stormarn) on Friday about 10.45 a.m. and killed her.
"The man himself called us and said he shot his partner," said a police spokesman.
The culprit is on the run, and after him is publicly arrested.
In the meantime, Sven S. could be traveling by car.
The man is about 1.80 meters tall, muscular, brown-burned and has a glamour.
Meanwhile, the police have published a photo of him.
However, it is a few years old.
In the meantime, the man is wearing a glamour.
I don't want the man to be addressed directly.
He could still carry the gun, the police say.
Those who see Sven S. are supposed to call the 110.
The police speak of a "relation state".
The victim was the year 1988, the perpetrator in 1981.
At first, the responsible police in Lübeck did not want to make any mention of the Tathergang or the relationship between the perpetrators and the victims, but confirmed that a person had been killed.
"It's a murderous offence."
"We're not saying any more at the moment," said a police spokesman in Lübeck.
According to eyewitnesses, a special deployment command (SEK) was at the scene.
Steel - light view for German steel industry
The crisis-boosted and energy-intensive German steel industry remains spared from additional costs at millions of altitudes.
Financial burdens that threatened the sector from green electricity funding are from the table.
It remains in the liberation of renewable energy revenues from the existing installations for so-called own electricity production in the German steel industry, says Federal Minister for Economic Affairs Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the West German General Newspaper (WAZ, Friday issue).
"I am really glad that after two years of tough negotiations we were finally able to achieve this."
The European Commission therefore initially planned to ask steel producers who use high-fire gases to produce electricity for their own consumption to check out.
According to the German industry, the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year.
Gabriel said that there was now a basic agreement with the European Commission after discussions with Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.
Only when the generators are replaced at the steel plants do an EEG surcharge of 20 percent.
But neither will they be raised in the steel industry.
IG Metall welcomed Germany's agreement with the EU Commission on the production of electricity.
This will largely determine the status quota of the previous scheme.
Gabriel's successful efforts for the steel industry are of particular importance.
"With regard to our campaign 'Steel is the future' this is a first step."
"Others have to follow."
"Climate and employment targets must also be considered in the reform of emissions trading," said IG Metall-Chief Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt.
The European steel industry has suffered from overcapacity and a significant price pressure since the financial crisis in 2008.
Last year, the situation worsened as the world's largest producer country of China threw mass steel on the world market in view of the weakening domestic demand.
European producers accuse Chinese steel companies of price dumping.
Over the course of this spring, the situation has become a bit relaxed.
On the one hand, imposed import duties on imports of steel have been demonstrated, and on the other hand, the economic outlook in China has been brightened.
It is unclear how sustainable the price recovery is.
The German industry primus Thyssenkrupp remained cautious on Thursday.
Last but not least, prices would have stagnated.
The industry reacts to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.
Thyssenkrupp did not want to exclude closings of individual works.
In the German steel industry, approximately 86000 people were employed at the end of 2015.
In July, despite rising prices and increasing orders, German steel producers remain cautious.
At 3.4 million tonnes, they produced more than six percent less crude steel than in the previous month, as the steel industry reported on Friday.
After a short increase in May, the quantity produced went back the second month in a row.
Since the beginning of the year, production has been below the previous year's level by two percent.
In the coming months, the Association expects an increase in output thanks to an improved order situation.
Communion, mind, health: singing good seniors
Ursel Kipp has already accompanied her whole life: As a young girl she was in the school choir, in the teaching school she finished the subject music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a senior choir.
"Singing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes.
After a sample, she feels balanced, cheerful, and more alive, she says.
By the way, she does something good for her health and for her spirit.
Because singing is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler of the German Senior League.
Most seniors sing in the choir and share with like-minded people the joy of the music, Hackler describes.
Through regular co-operation, seniors can establish and maintain social contacts.
Because social and family structures are often dissolved, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.
This experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir: "Look to and organize, be able to rely on the others and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together".
Singen can be strenuous in a positive sense, says Hackler.
Because seniors practice a deep and controlled breathing.
Those who regularly demand their lungs do not get out of the puss in everyday life.
Even when it comes to maintaining the sound of the voice in old age, singing is an optimal hobby.
To elderly people, Singen often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz of the Federal Labour Community of Senior Organizations.
In the older generations, the common singing had a much higher importance, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and leisure, she explains.
Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs in older people arouses many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.
Through lyrics and especially melodys, self-inflicted peoples are interested in long-term events.
The head is also required to sing a special performance, explains Lenz.
At the same time, focus on your own voice and on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a major cognitive challenge.
Especially older people living alone practice not only focusing on themselves.
Another positive aspect is the recognition experienced by singing in the choir, Hackler says.
An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.
The feeling of self-esteem also grows through singing in the choir.
To show myself: If I practice for a long time, I will be better and grow beyond myself - this experience strengthens.
So there are plenty of good reasons to start singing.
If you want to try a new hobby, don't hesitate - even if you think you have little talent, Lenz advises.
You don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who already hears when a tone goes by?
In search of the right offer, seniors have different possibilities, says Hackler.
If someone from the circle of acquaintances sings in a senior choir, you can just join yourself.
Many cities also offer an overview of the choirs in the area.
If you want to sing in a church choir, you can contact the church directly or the church president.
Many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet.
Anyone who has no access to the Internet can ask the family, friends or neighbors for help with the internet search.
Whoever desires to sing should definitely join a choir, advises Hackler.
Singing does the soul well and has something liberating - that applies to every age.
Cats respond more sensitive than cats to cries of the young
In Hanover biologists have examined the effect of calling for cat babies on adult animals.
To their surprise, the male also did not leave the males cold - however, they remained the same in contrast to the females.
Female cats can recognize the excretion of cat babies on the eyes of the little ones.
They react by 10 percent faster to sounds of kittens who are in great distress, as scientists have found out from the University of Veterinary Medicine and the Hannover Medical University (MHH).
Cat also reacts to the calls of kittens - however always the same.
"Apparently, the acoustic differences between the mowing of fewer and strongly stimulated young males are either inconceivable or irrelevant for males," said the biologist Wiebke Konerding of the MHH.
She is the first author of the study to be published this Friday in the journal "BMC Evolutionary Biology".
In a previous investigation, the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the kittens' writings differed with the urgency of their need for help.
A total of nine adult cats and eight kittens from the MHH animal husbandry were observed.
They were played for one call by little ones who were taken out of the throwbox for three minutes and separated from mothers and siblings.
On the other hand, they were confronted with screams of more excited kittens, which were additionally raised.
The researchers consider their results to be meaningful despite the low sample.
"All females, even those who had not yet had their own young people, reacted differently to the screams," Konerding said.
They turned to the speaker faster when this call of the very excruciating kitten was playing.
This ability may be innate or developing with sexual maturity.
"A surprise was that the males have ever responded," said the biologist.
In the past, scientists have studied the reactions of women and men to baby noise several times in humans.
Also, some studies showed that women responded more sensitively to infants, regardless of whether they were mothers or not, the biologist Marina Scheumann reported.
Podolski takes "Gala" to Supercup
Hakan Sükür is a football legend in Turkey.
A warrant has been issued in Turkey against former football star Hakan Sükür.
He is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
For the first time after the coup attempt, an important football game takes place in Turkey.
Before the duel of the archrivals between Besiktas Istanbul and Lukas Podolskis Galatasaray Istanbul around the Supercup in Konya, the official line is clear: "Business as usual" is announced.
Even when the state of emergency was imposed after the attempt to overthrow the government in July, the government argued that normal citizens' everyday lives should not be affected.
This does not apply, however, to those suspected of belonging to the movement of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is responsible for the coup attempt.
This does not stop even in front of the football.
The prosecutor issued a warrant against the former Starkicker Hakan Sükür.
Thus, the succour now living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
Sükür is said to be the leader of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is responsible for the coup attempt by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Although the state of emergency imposed for 90 days is still valid until October, this has almost no impact on the lives of most Turks.
The night's "democracy growth" in public places throughout the country has declared Erdogan to be finished on Wednesday.
Sports is divided into followers and opponents of Erdogans - like the whole country.
Especially fans of the workers' club Besiktas are not traditionally among the friends of the president.
However, given the dramatic experience of the Turks in history, the strict rejection of military coups is unique.
Even the fans agree - whether their heart beats for Galatasaray or Besiktas.

The Cologneer demonstrated his sporting worth in the season: With 17 goals and nine templates in all competitions, the 31-year-old finished his first season as the top scorer of his club.
In the final match against Fenerbahce, he won the 1–0 victory.
The newspaper "Fanatik" cheered him, "He was the best in the place."
He finished the season in an excellent way and secured his team the cup.
Thanks to "Podi", the disappointing season for the record champion found a conciliatory conclusion.
After the pre-round K.o in the Champions League, the "Löwen" quit early in the Europa League.
In the Süper Lig it was only rank six.
The season was not good.
The cup was the only way to win something.
"That's what we did and that's the most important thing," said Podolski.
For Master Besiktas, the year ran better.
In particular, thanks to Mario Gomez, who, with 26 season hits as a Süper-Light-Torschützkönig, laid the basis for the 14th title.
This is also the reason that fans continue to hope for the return of the 31-year-old.
In doing so, the contract between the AC Florence and Besiktas had only announced to Besiktas that he had not returned to Besiktas after the coup attempt because of the political situation in the country after his holiday.
"If Mario wants to come to us, he just has to say it," quoted the specialist magazine "Kicker" Club Chief Fikret Orman.
To this end, however, the striker would have to be willing to give up around one third of his annual salary for 7,5 million euros, Orman said: "We can't pay his salary at Florence."
Despite doping: These athletes still have medal opportunities at Olympia in Rio
34-year-old Justin Gatlin had already been blocked twice because of dopings (2001 and 2006).
Rio de Janeiro - Whistleblogger Julia Stepanowa must not start in Rio.
Other transmitted athletics singers can only laugh at it - they fight for medals in Rio.
The topic of doping remains the headlines at the Rio Olympic Games.
The Russian swimmer Julia Jefimawa, who had charged herself with her starting right shortly before the games after a doping lock, was mercilessly plucked out and bred at her start (100 meters chest).
It offered itself a scaly scenery: With a smile set on, she was still proud of the hall and had provoked her appearance.
When it was established that they would not get gold, the audience broke out in a jubilant storm.
However, there are many more athletes who, despite doping past at the Rio Olympic Games, are taking off.
Here's an overview:
Justin Gatlin (100, 200, 4x100-m-stage/USA): The 34-year-old is one of the most controversial figures in athletics.
He had already been blocked twice because of dopings (2001 and 2006 to 2010).
Since his ban, the 2004 Olympic winner and ex-world champion have been even faster than before, he is over 100 m in 9.80 seconds the number one in the world and is considered the biggest challenger of Usain Bolt.
Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce (100, 4x100-m-stage/Jamaika): The double Olympic winner and seven-time world champion had to put a six-month lock down in 2010 after she was shown to take the pain agent Oxycodon.
She had strong toothaches after surgery and defended the 29-year-old.
Sandra Perkovic (Discus/Croatia): In 2011, the Olympic Champion from 2012, World Champion from 2013 and European Champion from 2010 to 2016 was tested positively for the banned stimulant mean methylhexanamin.
Perkovic disputed the scientific intake and was blocked for six months.
The four widest cubes this year go to the account of the great gold favorite.
LaShawn Merritt (200, 400, 4x400 m season/USA): The Beijing Olympic and twice World Champion over 400 m, had been tested positively in 2010 and locked for 21 months.
A penile enlargement tool was responsible, Merritt said.
This year, the 30-year-old is the fastest man in the world over 200 and 400 m.
Ivan Tihon (Hammerschlag, Belarus): Probably hardly any athlete was recognized after so many medals.
Tichon lost his 2005 World Cup title nine years later, after being identified with him Testosterone doping.
The now 40-year-old also had to give up Olympic silver 2004 due to steroid dopings and the 2006 EM title because of testosterone abuses.
He was also awarded a bronze medal at the 2008 Olympic Games due to a judgment of the International Sports Court of CAS.
At 80,04 m he is second in the world rankings.
Liu Hong (20 km walk, China): The World Recorder and Gold Favoritin was not tested positively until May but is still allowed to start in Rio.
The 29-year-old world champion found evidence of the use of a prohibited food supplement, the blocking of the World Anti-Doping Agency WADA dropped out mildly and had already expired on July 13th.
Bombing terror in Thailand - Austrian injured - several dead
The Austrian Embassy in Thailand was in contact with the woman, said the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Thomas Schnöll, Friday morning.
She suffered cuts and had been treated in the hospital, but had already been able to leave them again.
She planned her return home for early September.
Whether the other explosions on the holiday island of Phuket as well as in the southern cities of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon are also affected by Austrian citizens, is still unclear.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities, according to Schnöll.
In the approximately 200 kilometers south of the capital city of Bangkok, Hua Hin were first exploded on Thursday evening in an excavated area.
According to police, a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.
Friday morning, two explosions went up again, and another human being was killed, according to the authorities.
A bomb explosion was also reported by Phuket in the early days.
A taxi driver was injured in the detonation near Patong beach, which is popular with vacationers.
In Surat Thani on the southeast coast of the country, another bomb exploded, killing an urban worker.
According to the authorities, the explosion rate in a flower beet has gone into the air before the coast police station.
Finally, detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the southwest coast as well as in Chumphon on the southeast coast claimed several injuries.
One goes out of a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin, it was said.
"The bomb attacks carry the same manuscript," said army general Danai Kritmethavee Friday morning before journalists.
"We assume that this is a coordinated attack."
It was too early to express themselves to possible motives - but probably it was about the deeds of Muslim rebels.
Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern typical of the bomb attacks of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.
The Thai police, on the other hand, declared that the attacks were not related to the Islamist uprising or to international terrorism.
"This is only local sabotage that is confined to limited areas and provinces," said a spokesperson in Bangkok.
Instead, it is assumed that the bombs were laid by opponents of the ruling military junta.
In recent days, the authorities have received secret service evidence on upcoming attacks in the southern part of the country - although they have not been informed of the exact date and places.
Still unclear, which group is behind the attacks.
The police instructed their officials throughout the country to strengthen security around important government buildings as well as airports, railway stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment areas.
In Thailand there are always smaller bomb attacks, but they usually do not target tourists.
In Hua Hin lies a palace used over the years by Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej.
Following the bomb explosions that have taken place, the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends that it follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities on its website.
High security risk (security level 3) applied to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla as well as Preah Vihear and surroundings.
After discussions between security forces and Muslim sections of the population, no necessary travels to these provinces will be dissuaded.
Increased security risk (security level 2) applied for the rest of the country.
The attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a Constitution prepared by the military junta.
This will also give the military a great deal of influence in the coming years.
Junta chief and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs were an attempt to make chaos while the country moved towards stability, an improvement in the economic situation and tourism.
The military unta, who had taken power in 2014 after a phase of bloody unrest, keeps himself at the advantage of restoring the Kingdom to stability and order.
However, the military did not manage the uprising Muslim rebels in the far south of the country for years.
More than 6,500 people have already been killed in the conflict.
About a year ago, 20 people were killed in Bangkok in an attack on a popular Hindu barn - most of them foreign tourists.
It was the bloodiest attack of the country's recent history.
The right "identitarian movement" has become the visionary of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection.
After several national offices, the constitutional guards in the federal government also put the group under observation.
"At the 'Identiary Movement', we see indications for efforts against the liberal democratic basic order," said Head of the Constitution Hans-Georg Maaßen of the German Press Agency in Berlin.
For example, immigrants of Islamic faith or the Middle East are being defamed in an extremist way.
That's why we're watching the movement now.
The "Identitarian Movement" is a group of French roots, which has been active in Germany since 2012.
She turns against "multikulti-wang", "uncontrolled mass immigration" and the "loss of one's own identity through alienation".
Constitutionalists in nine federal states - Bremen, Bavaria, Hesse, Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, NRW, Lower Saxony, Saxony and Thuringia - are already observing the "identitarians".
Maaßen said that his authority had agreed closely with the national offices during the decision.
"Groups like the 'Identiary Movement' are trying to pick up their target group where it stands," said the Head of Constitutional Protection.
In general, extremists try to address them with youthful language, often with pop music.
That is just like right-wing extremists.
This is not a real promotion for your own business.
The propaganda should be an emotional response to people.
Young people are particularly vulnerable.
It's dangerous.
Most recently, there had been reports from several federal states about contacts of "identitarians" with AfD politicians.
Maaßen said he didn't know about that.
For constitutional protection, possible contacts of this kind are only relevant from a certain point of view.
It is important whether the respective party - in this case the AfD - changes its goal by certain persons who are extremist, and thus becomes extremist.
It is therefore crucial whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party.
This is not recognizable.
In view of the significant increase in legal offences and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee shelters, Maaßen said that he was not yet talking about new right-wing terrorism.
But we have seen in recent years that there can be legal terrorist structures.
There was the group 'Old School Society' or the Freital group.
It may well be that other terrorist groups or micro-groups are forming, planning attacks against asylum seekers, refugee homes or attacks from other extreme right-wing motives.
However, a German-wide or pan-European control of legal terrorism is not recognizable.
The previous groups had emerged at the regional level or in social networks.
Maaßen expressed concern that many assaults went on the account of people who had not appeared in the right scene before.
This is the alarming one.
Many of the suspects in attacks on asylum shelters had not previously been known as criminal, politically motivated criminals or supporters of the right scene.
"A lot of people have committed crimes, which previously had nothing to do with right-wing extremists, who may have been politically different or, for example, have chosen CDU, SPD or left, which have, however, radicalized themselves through right-wing extremist moods."
Rio 2016: Robel Kiros Habe becomes Internet hit
The Olympics or world records do not always determine the headlines at the Olympic Games.
This shows the courageous appearance of Robel Kiros Habte at the Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro.
In the Aquatics Center, the slightly obese swimmer from Ethiopia swam so slowly that he was temporarily out of sight in the TV pictures.
He simply disappeared - no matter how far the neckline was selected.
In the social networks Habte became a viral internet hit.
In fact, the 24-year-old ended with a 48-second residue and finished the 59th place of 59 starters.
But it was his not exactly sporty figure that attracted the attention of the international media.
Why the 24-year-old still participates in the Olympic Games?
The Ethiopian received a special start right from the international swimming association.
This is distributed to make swimming in underrepresented countries more known.
Since in Ethopia most athletes are running, I just wanted to do something different.
Preparation is everything: Robel Kiros Habte is ready for the big race.
Quickly the first nicknames made the round.
Some media called him "Robel der Wal".
The English boulevard leaf "The Sun" made fun of him with "Dad Bod".
His time, he only started with a minute and nearly five seconds over the 100 meters freestyle, there played no role.
Comparisons with "Eric the Eel" were also drawn.
At the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, the running of Eric Moussambani provided media attention.
Unforgettable was the appearance of the swimmer from Equatorial Guinea when he had to appear alone in an advance over 100 meters of freestyle.
Moussambani was a member of the family Moussambani.
The 22-year-old learned to swim eight months before Olympia and had never completed such a long distance before the competition.

Geretsried - The owner of a store at the New Square has been stolen.
According to the police, the 67-year-old Geretsrieder had left her business at about 5.30 p.m. on Monday and had forgotten to close a window on the ground floor.
When she returned at 8.15 a.m. the next morning, there were 250 euros missing from the cash desk.
There were no traces of the culprit.
Also a video surveillance is not available.
Trump does not see the threat of the elections so close
The Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at an election campaign event in Florida.
If there is nothing to do with the election as President of the United States, Donald Trump already has an alternative idea.
He's just going on a vacation.
If Donald Trump lost the U.S. presidential elections in November, he wouldn't care about it: "At last it will either work, or I have a very, very nice, long holiday," said the candidate of the Republican in a telephone interview with the U.S. television station CNBC.
If, in the end, it is not enough for him for reasons of political correctness, Trump said it was okay.
He called the President of the United States Barack Obama and the candidate of the Democrats Hillary Clinton, founder of the Islamic State (IS).
Within his party more and more resistance was formed.
Post increases trade with electric transporters
An electric delivery vehicle of the German Post in action.
The interest of other companies in the companion seems to be great.
The post also plans to sell her electric vehicle StreetScooter.
In a short time, the Group intends to start trading with the transporter.
The post wants to offer their electric transporters from the coming year also on the free car market.
"We want to enter the sale to third parties," said a post speaker on Friday.
The company has been examining for months whether to sell its own self-developed StreetScooter, with which letters and packages are delivered, also to other companies.
Post-Chairman Jürgen Gerdes had said there were always requests, for example by craftsmen.
According to information from the news magazine "Der Spiegel", the Bonner Group is about to enter the mass production of the vehicles.
In the post-own factory, the company plans the construction of up to 10,000 cars per year and shift.
Gerdes had announced that the Group wanted to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and in the long term had a complete transition to environmentally friendly vehicles.
"We will take a very, very robust step towards 2020," he said at the end of July.
I can imagine that we are changing the entire fleet.
The StreetScooter has been active on Germany's roads since 2014.
GfK leadership is based on disappointing business figures
The consumer research company GfK exchanges its boss Matthias Hartmann.
The withdrawals came suddenly - but not quite surprising.
The difficult situation of the market research company GfK has shown that the chair of CEO Matthias Hartmann is all the more uncertain, the longer the successes promised by him.
Turbulence at the head of the Nürnberg market research company GfK: After further disappointing business figures and the withdrawal of corporate governance, the worldwide number five of the industry is facing a new human beginning.
GfK Chief Executive Officer wants to leave the company at the end of the year.
The Chairman of the GfK Supervisory Board, Arno Mahlert, shall be part of the Supervisory Board with effect from 12 September.
As early as September 1st, the executive board member Gerhard Hausruckinger took over the management of the board, and informed the company.
He is supposed to take over officially the function of a Chief Speaker until a successor has been found for Hartmann.
As a reason for the withdrawals, the company called "different views" on long-term business policy orientation.
Details didn't want to mention a business speaker on Friday.
Anyone who will lead the market research company in the future is still unclear.
On Friday, investors reported that shareholders were most recently disappointed by the continuing successes of the restructuring that they had started years ago.
Mr. Hartmann has been at GfK since 2011.
"But the fruits of the restructuring are still not to be seen after 5 years," he said.
In view of the last bad GfK business figures, any shareholder will eventually become upset.
"If that were the case with BMW, it would also do the quarts," it said.
After setbacks in the previous quarter, the company could not have stopped its loss rate even in the second quarter of 2016.
With EUR 361.2 million, sales were 6.1 percent below the level of the comparable quarter of the previous year.
Compared to the first half of the year, sales decreased by 3.4 percent by 721.2 million euros.
The profit in the second quarter has, in particular, burdened the lower value of the company in view of its difficult economic situation.
Under the heading, the Group provided the Group with a loss of 148.2 million euros of net worth of EUR 139 million in the Consumer Experience business.
In the second quarter of 2015, GfK had generated a consolidated profit of 19.7 million.
Accidents - Bus slips into crammed horns in tombs: eight injured
Eight people were injured in Krummhörn (Landkreis Aurich) on Thursday in a passenger bus accident with 43 seniors.
Two of the inmates suffered serious injuries, told the police.
According to the information, the 66-year-old driver of the bus of a travel company from Eisenach had to avoid her information from an incoming truck, which was partly on the opposite track.
The bus came right from the street and slipped into a grave, as a police spokesman Aurich/Wittmund reported.
"Because of the bus's location, the passengers were unable to leave the bus independently," she said.
The fire brigade freed the inmates.
Six rescue cars and one emergency car came to the accident site on Landesstraße 2.
The unadulterated travelers were brought back from a line bus to the Krumhörner district of Pewsum.
There they should wait for a replacement bus from the travel company.
The investigators asked the truck driver and possible witnesses to report to the police.
The fees per cubic metre of wastewater are from 1 October 2016 for the waste water system Neudorf/Reuth/Welschekahl 3.44 instead of so far 2,10 Euro; for Zultenberg/Lindenberg/Lopp 3,36 Euro (up from 2.26 Euro) and for Azendorf 3,64 Euro (up from 2,18 Euro).
At the plant in Azendorf, the waste water fee will increase again at the latest if appropriate improvement measures become necessary.
After an excess calculation, the wastewater price in Azendorf will then be 4.37 euros per cubic metre.
As Mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, when the budget was approved by the Landratsamt Kulmbach, it was found that undercovers existed for these wastewater plants.
The Kasendorf market is obliged, on the basis of legal grounds, to operate the plants in a cost-effective manner.
As of 1 October 2016, the citizens, as well as the commercial and industrial companies from Welschchenkahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to get deeper into the money bag.
Fee increases range from 48 to 67 percent.
As managing director Herbert Schmidt pointed out to the panel, a recalculation of the charges for the waste water facilities of the market community was necessary.
In the period from October 2016 to September 2020, cover or undercovers from the previous calculation period should also be compensated.
The serious increases in fees justified Schmidt’s trade in all three waste water systems, which were relatively small, with a very low waste water attack, ranging from 6800 to 12,000 cubic metres per year.
For example, due to the low distribution base, expenditures would have a serious impact on the necessary repairs of several thousand euros.
In addition, the volume of wastewater in all three plants was slightly declining.
In addition, in the previous calculation period, all three plants had a significant impact on the amount of reorganisation and repair costs due to their age.
The plant in Azendorf was almost 30 years old, the facilities for Welschenkahl, Neudorf and Reuth, as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp almost 20 years old.
Schmidt pointed out that in the waste water system Azendorf the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to damage.
After almost 20 years of operation of the first clear pond, the sewage sludge was to be disposed of and an additional ventilation facility installed at the Lopp pond-clearing plant. After almost 20 years of operation, it was necessary to remove the sewage sludge and to comply with the water regulations in the future.
Schmidt: "These extraordinary expenses were covered by the continued maintenance and maintenance costs, which must be taken into account in the new calculation period."
The same applies to electricity costs, which in the previous calculation in 2011/2012 were still significantly below the current level.
Steinhäuser made it clear that in the case of a small waste water attack in the three plants, the costs for the operation and maintenance were "full".
In doing so, Schmidt added that the market community had been spared from major entertainment costs in the waste water systems over the past 20 years.
In the view of Steinhäuser, the situation for the said installations will continue to be precarious, especially as the waste water supply area of the Friesenbachtal waste water management association cannot be extended to include these plants, because it is deficient facilities.
Bulgaria first booked inflation in 8 months
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1% on a monthly basis in July.
This is the highest value (since June 2012) and the first one over zero since October last year, when positive 0.2% were booked.
The average annual inflation of the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was as measured by the CPI -0.8 %.
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101.0%, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0%.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) was -0.2% and the annual inflation in July 2016 was -0.2%.
In July 2016, a price increase of the following consumer goods was observed compared to the previous month: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%); transport (1.8%); leisure and culture (6.3%); restaurants and hotels (1.2%); various goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell in the case of clothing and shoes (2.2%); furniture, household appliances and routine maintenance (0.5%); health (0.1%).
Prices remained as in the previous month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco; housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels; communication; and education unchanged.
Snapchat "Anime" effect criticized as Asian caricature
Snapchat says that this filter is an anime inspired, but some observers say it is insensitive to breeds.
With its filter tool, Snapchat enables around 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in such a way that is already limited to the absurd.
You can turn into a pineapple, a dog, or a figure that could be from a Roy Lichtenstein painting.
The filters are unblemished, property-versing tools that generate more than 30 million improved selfies per day.
All misdemeanors come to the public.
Snapchat filters have in the past attracted criticism in which they were accused that the app would promote blackface or white skin as a beauty ideal.
This week, when some users suggested a filter that gave them slot eyes, false teeth and puffed cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asians - "Yellow Face".
They wondered if these repeated controversys pointed to a major problem that the company had with diversity.
The news and the emotion were widely spread on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, one day after Snapchat announced that it had disabled the feature.
The company offered an excuse: the filter was intended as a tribute to anime charactere and not as a cartoon of Asians.
But outside, which experienced racism, the filter reminded of injuring clichés.
Others strongly rejected the anime comparison.
In an e-mail, Grace Sarapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweets were widely spread about the photos, wrote that the filter "injuriously and laly said it was unpleasant."
She added that "it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very disgusting Asian caricature and the filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not yellow-tight, but that the yellow face has been pulled into the derogating extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural wire wire.
American culture seems to be involved in an endless struggle for diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in our hands.
And Snapchat's big audience of young people, who are more diverse in terms of race than their older counterparts, could rather expect sensitivity.
If one of Snapchat's filters creates a picture that's offensive to a user, "so it's much more difficult for such things to remain unnoticed than it used to be," said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.
On Thursday, Zhu, who works as a product manager and engineer for medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account called on others to do the same.
In an essay for media and in a telephone interview, she said that she believed that racial controversy reflected a lack of diversity in the recruitment practices of Snapchat.
Zhu criticized the mostly white, only male leadership and ended her essay with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
" Either they don't have a different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce, so they can make such decisions," said Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colors that work there but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say something about it."
Others share their opinion, a complaint that Snapchat has largely left unanswered.
The company does not publish any figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the cultural backgrounds of his employees, but according to a speaker, the company recently recruited a staffing officer, focusing on underrepresented groups and internal integration efforts.
Zhu, in turn, said that she would close her Snapchat account and added, "I wonder if they need more users like us to say that it's not OK."
Military leadership falsified ISIS intelligence information, sets out Congress Committee
Military members of the United States Central Command changed intelligence information to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than would have allowed the actual local states, reported an investigation committee of the Congress in a report on Thursday.
The preliminary report, prepared by a Task Force of Republican members of the Committee of Armed Forces, Security Committee and the Wehrbudget Committee, reports of great dissatisfaction among Central Command secret service analysts who reported how superiors changed their assessments of American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.
The Central Command, Cencom in short, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls the U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"News service information, which was typically curtailed by high-level Centcom commanders, regularly drew a more positive picture of the American efforts against terrorism than the actual conditions on the ground and were consistently more positive than analyses of other intelligence services," quoted a newspaper article.
"What happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," noted Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives.
The leadership errors in Centcom reach the top of the organization.
The 10-page report shows in detail stable problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in training Iraqi armed forces.
Although there is no direct evidence that government leaders have given instructions under Obama to change the reports, it shows how analysts were exposed to the pressure from their pre-legislations to draw a more optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic state, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
"During the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and statements before the Congress were much more positive than the facts," the report stated.
For example, a Centcom member publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mossuls could already begin in April or May 2015.
Mossul, second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"After months of investigations, so much is clear." said Mike Pompeo, Republican congressman from Kansas, in an opinion.
From mid-2014 until mid-2015, the leaders of the Central Command changed the news service reports in order to lower the risk of ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans called on the Task Force to come to life after it was played out to them that analysts were concerned about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State.
The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings as the investigations continue.
In addition, further investigations of the Centcom reports are underway by the General Inspector of the Ministry of Defense.
Democratic members of the intelligence committee published their own findings on Thursday, which were in line with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.
"In the years 2014 and 2015, the Centcom created an overly limited process for the creation of intelligence service assessments on ISIL and the Iraqi security services," announced the High-Level Democratic Party in the Committee, member of the Adam B. Schiff House of Representatives, in an opinion.
This process, according to Mr. Schiff, "reduced the publication of news service reports", damaged morals among analysts and " gave excessive room for divergent opinions."
But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats indicated that they had not found any evidence of the White House's intervention in the Centcom analysts regarding a "certain political opinion".
The preliminary results of the Congress's investigations were published on Tuesday by "The Daily Beast".
Last August, the New York Times reported investigations by the Pentagon General Inspector, who were recorded after Centcom analysts’ complaints.
Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon press officer, said in a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on Congress reports, while the General Inspector's investigations were still underway.
But he also stated that "Experts sometimes have quite divergent opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence."
The investigations have reversed the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (an allegation made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense).
The accusations of last year, however, raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.
Criticism of secret information about the Islamic State reminds of disputes over ten years ago, when a centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a paper on how the then government under George W. Bush, contrary to the recommendations of many analysts, foresaw only a small occupation force in Iraq and did little time to think about the consequences of the invasion of 2003.
Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the uprising against the current reporting of the Islamic State.
Last year, according to government agencies, the team around Mr. Hooker notes that, contrary to government statements, air strikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State would not have a significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, as these provisional refineries would have put into operation to sell oil on the black market.
However, this realization was not published, the Times reported in September.
Centcom's commandshaber, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the legislative because of his excessive positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel at the Central Command.
The USA wins fourth match in the field hockey of women, a showdown with Great Britain is coming
One day after she had shot three goals during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two goals for the women's American field hockey team in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3-0.
Five goals in two games should actually represent a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said she couldn't remember ever doing that.
"I have no idea." she said.
I'm not one of those people who keep their gates in mind.
She knows, however, that the Americans are in the Olympic competition at 4-0 and are in the same position in their group with the British in the first place, which, after their 2-0 victory against Japan, remains unbeatn.
The United Kingdom and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last match of the first round.
Both teams have already qualified for the quarter final, the game will decide which of the two within their group will win first and second place from six teams each.
The first-placed woman will leave the strong Dutch women out of the way for a little longer, who will lead the other group.
Whatever the Saturday game may be, the Americans have triggered a surprising vortex through their success story four years after they landed at the last 12 places at the last London Games.
Bam was part of this team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and for the first time at the age of three had a hockey racket in her hands (their two older sisters played the sport at Drexel University), at the age of 16, she became a national player of the USA, the youngest in the history of the team.
She missed the 2008 Olympics because she could not qualify for the cadre.
Then came the year 2012 in which everything went wrong for her and her team.
The following year Craig Parnham, an Englishman, became a coach of the national team and thus began to turn things into a better one.
"A cultural change, a mental change and a physical change," said Bam.
We didn't have the workpension in London that we have now.
We've been able to pull the row all the way around.
On Thursday evening, Bam opened the Torreigen in the first half of the game with a backhandle from the nearby area.
India had gone into the game without victory in the tournament, but the team showed up surprisingly and held the level from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands.
She carried out a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then pulled into the middle and dragged the ball into the gate to provide the Americans with a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter.
The Shutout was the first of the tournament for the U.S. goalkeeper Jackie Briggs, who had to book one goal in each of the previous games.
She's got a run.
Just like Bam.
"We are in a good position" said Parnham, but how well will depend on the result of the next game on Saturday.
In the midst of the battle of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the Trampoline
Wherever you are, whatever the time it is, it's the Olympic Games.
The events in Rio de Janeiro feel constant and inevitable, a speedy season run between competition and striving.
It's like the Olympic Torch itself is a burning rod, which is turned from the armbrush protector to the swimr to the triathlete.
You can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor in the queue in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, who is at the Olympic Games for the first time and is a woman's flock with dimples, could have been among these well-known names that are sent to Prime Time, built up by sponsors and well-being TV advertising if he were a swimmer, gymnast or even granddaughter.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is fighting for gold in the Olympic trampoline tournament.
The Olympic flame does not light every event the same.
Further from the center, partly in the shade are the sports, which are not generally recognized: air gun shooting, archery, Badminton, Taekwondo.
We will always have the breast swim and may rule for a long time.
But if I could modestly make arguments for my particular favorite, let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.
Although trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000 when it had its debut in Sydney, it has been so sparsely perceived over the past 16 years that many who, I had asked, did not know that it was even an Olympic sport.
This could also be regional ignorance.
Although the USA sent athletes to compete, it has never won a medal in trampoline jumping and had an athlete who made it to the final round by 2012.
The Chinese and Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians.
Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their London gold medal this year.
Trampoline jumping has a certain outer charm, partly because it is more suitable for the unexplained ear for a clown school than it sounds for the Olympic Games.
At this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but only an earth-bound enthusiast.
It has humorous potential - the cartoonlike tremor of its never-ending impact - as well as the Grazie of turning and diving, the two sports that unite it essentially.
The word "Trampoline" comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means as much as "jumpboard."
Dwelling winners jump on a giant trampoline, shoot almost 30 feet in the air and have to land on their feet a series of falling movements (thries, hedges and saltos).
According to the official Olympic program, they are evaluated according to execution, difficulty and "airtime".
Twenty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete against each other in Rio.
The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.
Medal hopes must continue in their quest for gold, faster, up and above, sometimes to the finish, sometimes back and forth, up and down on the playground.
They are hunting not only the target line or the starting wall, but also another path for television transmission: the one in the world or the Olympic record.
The goal-oriented striving is noble, admirable, even fanatical - and it is enough to even stir a spectator.
But it is also what I feel when watching these games as something tiring.
The trampoline offers a breathing break.
The vector of the trampoline jumper is up.
A forward movement is not the goal.
He or she turns off, apparently heavy like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly up again.
Even here there is a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant removal of time and gravity.
It is just like the competition at the Olympic Games.
Women's qualifications and finals will be held on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern time; men's on Saturday, also at 13.00.
NBC will broadcast the final rounds as part of an afternoon block on both days from 14.00.
In the middle of the Olympic Mania, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is probably overlooked in the general tumult.
If the raising of consciousness can only be achieved by angling and objectification of male athletes - as the male U.S. tournaments recently proposed by the The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Dooley expects his new fan community, ringing into air.
"A generation protests" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the USA
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrations calling for political change in Ethiopia met with violent opposition from the government.
Witnesses say that during the clashes with the police, twenty protesters were killed in shooting.
Is Ethiopia just about to collapse?
In the last ten years, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy.
But in recent months, protests against the government have shaken the country and spread into more and more areas.
Last week thousands of people stormed the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.
According to human rights organisations, the government’s response was unmerciful.
Witnesses said police shot and killed twenty unarmed demonstrators.
Video about the protests, which are probably from the last or beginning of this year, shows securitymen beating young people with sticks, while they were forced to make a handstand against a wall.
The head of the UN Human Rights Authority now requires an in-depth investigation.
"It has always been difficult to keep this country together and it will be even more difficult in the future," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.
Ethiopia, after Nigeria, is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West.
American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terrorist threats beyond the region, especially in Somalia. Few countries in Africa, if ever, receive so much Western aid.
Ethiopia's economy expanded at considerable pace.
Its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new shuttle train in the capital city Addis Ababa.
The streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
Even though Ethiopia was anything other than a model for democracy - human rights organizations have constantly led the government to oppression - opposition in the country was restricted, with dissidents being effectively silenced.
Many were sent into exile or prison, killed, or driven into the deserts.
But that could change.
"If you suppress people and have no other options except to protest, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Central Ethiopia.
All the youth protests.
A generation protests.
There are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to strangling handling in relation to power of the ruling coalition.
After a widely criticised election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the final seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of Parliament.
At the same time, tensions rise along the border with Eritrea; a struggle for this tough, controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogade, who have been forced more or less in recent years, could exploit and arm up turbulences.
Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness are now exploding after years of Hinköcheling under the surface.
The first seems harmless: smartphones.
Only in recent years have many Ethiopians been able to communicate through the social media, as cheaper smartphones became more frequent and Internet services improved.
Even if the government locks access to Facebook and Twitter, which it does at regular intervals, especially at protests, many people can still communicate via Internet protests that hide where they are staying.
Several young Ethiopians claimed that they were gathering in such a way as to protest.
The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.
Since eons, the Amharas, who come from Ethhopia mostly Christian highlands, have flourished in politics and economy, exploiting the Oromos, many of which are Muslims and live in flatlands.
But this too is changing.
"We are coordinating under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of Oromos.
The largest protests took place in areas of Amhara and Oromos.
Many Amharas and Oromos feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tigray ethnic group who make up about 6 percent of the population and who are dominant in the military, in the secret services, in trade and politics.
The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, had been Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until his death on a disease not made public.
He was regarded as a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners.
Analysts say that he was particularly decorated in seeing early signs of dissatisfaction and using EUSRs to treat opponents and make them harmless.
"The current regime lacks this basic skill," said Mr. Abdi, a conflict analyst.
Ethiopia's new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively opaque reasons to take the position of Mr Meles.
Unlike Mr Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the Tigray controlled security services.
Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such an uproar in 2005, after thousands protested against elections, which, according to analysts, seemed to have been bred by the government and then stolen.
During the subsequent Razzien, many protesters were killed, even though they were less than in the last few months and this time of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new pendulum train, as well as their measurable progress in the fight against poverty.
But obviously this has not prevented the intensification of the internal displeasure of the Ethiopian government.
And she takes a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month protesters attacked in Gondar, an amharic city, Tigray-run shops, and the hatred of Tigray is becoming more and more common in social media.
Analysts say that the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a strange position.
The U.S. government used Ethiopia as the basis for drone flights across neighboring Somalia, even though it recently announced that it had closed this base.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volatile area.
"This," said Mr. Abdi, "is a very thin moose hike."
Donald Trump explained his claim Obama had founded ISIS was "Sarkasmus"
Donald J. Trump tried to disperse the last controversy that surrounds his campaign on Friday by stating that his repeated claim, President Obama and Hillary Clinton would not have been the "founders" of the Islamic State terrorist group, was serious.
This clarification raised new questions about the communication skills of the Republican presidential candidate, whether he was able to communicate clearly and understandably with the American public.
It also brings his competitors, who strive to protect him during an eventful phase, into the peculiar position to have to explain statements that he could not have meant at all.
After he made the announcement at an election event on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump ran back on Thursday's allegation and insisted on interviews that he did not really intend to suggest that the President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.
But in an early morning Tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was just sarcastic.
The Tweet was the contrast to the previous day, when Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he meant the accusation perfectly serious.
When conservative radio moderator Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr. Trump to weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama ISIS wanted to destroy, the Republican presidential candidate wanted to know nothing about it.
The last storm of criticism is on Mr. Trump, while he has tried to direct his campaign's focus on the economic situation because of falling survey values.
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton gave speeches on the economic situation in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return to this issue.
Reporting on Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's suggestions would lead to higher taxes and that he had found their speech boring.
Mr. Trump has already brought Sarkasmus to his defense.
At the end of July, he took strong criticism when he said the Russians were supposed to hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but later he explained, "Of course I meant that sarcastic."
This method allows Mr. Trump to shift the linguistic boundaries in politics and then to row back as needed.
"I think it is one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans, how they arrive, and then, if necessary, "clarify" depending on how the reaction fails." said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who observed the language of both candidates.
But I also believe that he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.
Instead of disintegrating the tone for the presidential elections, Mr Trump accepted an even more valuable tone, as his survey values continued to decline.
A new survey by NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist, published on Friday, showed a leading lead in the states of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.
While Mr. Trump generally tries not to apologize for his provocative statements, he often accuses his critics of distorting his statements or misinterpreting his humor.
But while he is increasingly focused on the recent months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump's jokes have brought his loyal competitors into the uncomfortable situation of having to stand with him, no matter how provocative his statements may be.
Rudolf W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trump's most prominent advocates, made great efforts to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview on Thursday.
"I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments," said Mr. Giuliani, so he was asked about the accuracy of Mr. Trump's statements as to whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic state.
It is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called them backbones, completely false and so it happened because he pulled off the troops from Iraq.
Most mainstream republicans tried to argue that the government under Obama, in which Mrs Clinton served as foreign minister, allowed ISIS to expand by failing to force aggressively the situation in the Middle East.
In front of the elections in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of running around on every of his words and being prejudiced against him.
He loathed the "poor, miserable" television experts who tried to understand him and said, "You can't!".
Some of the Democrats mocked Mr. Trump's apologies as just another proof that he was unsuitable for the presidential office.
Once driven over the price from the market, Café returns to Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a shabby café in Williamsburg where you could pay only cash that had no Wi-Fi, but served good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, the prices were forced out of his Bedford Avenue shopfront.
The business Soap Cherie, which replaced verb in summer 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.
Locals entrusted it as the last loss in a gentrifying city.
The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know New York is a change, but I still can't believe CBGB dead, the Chelsea Hotel excluded and verb is now a soap business."
But if New York's change, it's also new invention.
A revitalized verb Cafe opened in Greenpoint last November, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same employees and a similar simple atmosphere.
The coffee is still good.
The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-standing employee of the old café, who is the owner and managing director of the new café.
He started working at Verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end.
When a customer offered to provide money for a new office, he was excited to do it, he said.
Rodriguez, 36, contributed a lot.
Verb uses the same distributor for the bagels to buy the same espresso machine model.
It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.
But Rodriguez said he also wanted to experiment.
He introduced new ingredients.
On the menu there are sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are yarns such as capers and sauced onions.
There are natural rice dishes.
The café no longer serves beer, for which there are fresh juices.
After nine months Rodriguez said he noticed a steady stream of old regular customers.
"Many old customers were also driven away by prices from Williamsburg," he said.
Recently on a Sunday Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.
Oliveira, 34, once lived in Williamsburg and visited the verb regularly.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she would take her way.
After the verb had closed, she gave up drinking coffee for a while, she said.
"I realized that it was coffee and culture in the verb that I liked," she said.
Now she drinks coffee again, even if she ordered a blended chai tea on that day instead of her usual Iced Coffee, which is another addition.
Since the beginning of the verb in 2003, Tom Rosenthal has been another long-standing and loyal customer.
He went there before work and inevitably always ordered the same thing.
"I came to the neighborhood after seven, every day, like a Swiss pocket clock, and they prepare my Everything-Bagel with butter," he said.
Foto Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and include new ingredients in the menu.
Nowadays Rosenthal still gets his usual order, but sometimes he changes his Everything-Bagel with bacon, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez said he didn't know a grudge about the soap business taking the old business space.
In fact, the owners of the Soap Cherie offered to make a special soap for verb with the cold-fried coffee of the café as an ingredient.
"I think we're still going to respond to her offer," Rodriguez said.
And the traditional Polish residents have also accepted the café.
A new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodriguez said he was planning to exhibit it soon so that his new neighbours feel welcome.
The location also has other advantages.
A local juice shop wants to fill and sell the cold-fried coffee in the bottles.
There is a chance that the café will expand to a neighbouring building.
For many customers, a new verb is enough to get their old favorites.
Joseph Witt was a common scholar and said he was destroyed on the ground when the café closed.
When the new café opened, Whitt said that entering the local and ordering a new coffee felt like a return home.
"I had to smell that," he said.
The depressing food of the economic crisis in "an abundant meal"
In March 1933, shortly after his accession to the President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office.
President Roosevelt had a flaw for refined fifth avenues such as Pâte de foie grass and Maryland water turtle soup.
His menu that day was a little more modest: filled eggs in tomato sauce, potato pore and a plum pudding as dessert.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added, "It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat."
The couple live in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.
Coes' last book "Chop Suey" was about Chinese cuisine in the USA, while Ziegelman in her book "97 Orchard" tells about life in a residential house on the Lower East side from the food perspective.
Her latest collaboration, "A decent meal" that will appear on Tuesday in Harper Verlag, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They showed culinary solidarity when they met with a reporter at the Eisenberg's Sandwich shop for dinner, a small, unscrupulous snack in the Flatiron District, which has been in business since the stock exchange crash in 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a cheese sandwich with olive pieces, while Coe, 57, ate turkey with potato pure and vegetable mixture.
When the reporter ordered hackbrates, the couple found it appropriate for a discussion about food in the era of great depression.
"Reichhalten Grocers were very popular", Ziegelman said.
There was peanut bread, liver cheese and bean bread.
They were prepared from an ingredient and a little cheap, which spreads the ingredient.
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they serve them as dinner.
Coe was grinned.
"It must have been in the stomach like lead," he said.
In the years before the Great Depression, the table was in an American household, especially in rural areas, an all-you-can-eat buffet.
Teams of women bought for male field workers and were served freshly baked pasta for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during the first world war. "A Square Meal" records the ways the country was dealing with it no longer being the Schlafenland.
"It was a time when food became a central, tense topic for the Americans," coe said, "that he and his wife wanted to write about it.
The new budget diet was just as tense: mysterious food such as bread and cash rolls became the basic food that the cashroll was "wonderful way to reuse food residues," said Ziegelman, as cooks could hide unappetitious ingredients under a creamy sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dry fruit.
Meat, which had been the center of American cuisine for years, became a rarely served luxury.
Unique blends were tried out, as a calorie rich and nutritious satisfaction had priority over taste or even healthy kitchen mind.
During her research for the book, which also includes recipes, Ziegelman prepared a dish from this epoch, baked onions with peanut butter.
"It wasn't a popular addition to lunch," says Coe.
Ziegelmann continues: "It was surreal."
Peanut butter and baked onions do not match each other.
It was typical of many of the domestic economy recipes.
Like never before or since, domestic economists - including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - have such a effect on the eating habits of the country.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "domestic politicians" and the challenge of converting mobiles such as creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals, to meet the challenge.
"A Square Meal" is a festival of historic treats.
In particular, the reports about the government's response to the hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoovers Lass-mich-Kuchen-Essen-Haltung, are tasty.
While he publicly praised the simple Iowa farmhouse kitchen of his kitchen, he fed like the million-heaviest man of the world to whom he has become.
"He liked continental cuisine like fish with cucumber sauce," said Coe.
He ate in an almost gilded dining room and wore a tuxedo.
He was a wonderful stranger to reality.
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if not his wife Eleanor had asked him to do an example with his stomach.
As described in the book, the hire of a housekeeper with no interest in tastes by Mrs. Roosevelt led to the White House producing the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most troubleless prepared."
Many of the species from the era of great depression to deal with food were rejected as soon as the country got back on its feet.
The legacy lies on our continued focus on calories and food, said Ziegelman, as well as on how science has been applied to food.
The couple gave a better understanding of the eating habits of Ziegelman's mother-in-law when writing the book - for example, how she could not throw away food.
"She was really afraid of the waste of food," said Coe.
Ziegelman remembered, "She actually made people sick."
There was the windbag incident.
After the plates were removed at Eisenberg's, they and Coe made a dessert that they had prepared at home: the Plum Endessert, which President Roosevelt ate at lunch.
"It is called Prune Whip," said Ziegelman, adding that it was a common trick to miss modest recipes a sent name.
There was no beaten cream, only plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone was a little reluctantly entering a spoon into the tough, brown glibber.
Amazingly, it didn't taste bad.
Coe took a three-time supplement.
Like a Can-Do Buddhist, he said to his wife, "A few hacked walnuts would help."
Killed in bomb attack: He was the hero of Aleppo
He risked his own life to help others: Khaled Omar.
He was the hero of Aleppo: Khaled Omar dedicated his life to people in Syria.
He risked everything to save other people's lives.
Now the 30-year-old died even in a barrel bomb attack of the Assad regime.
Omar was a member of the "White Helmets", a civil protection group that, according to Bild-Zeitung, has saved nearly 60,000 people.
2900 volunteers risk their own lives to draw people from broken homes and to provide first aid in the war zone.
They are the heroes of the war in Syria.
Omar was the face of the group: a video of the civilians who showed him in the 11-hour rescue of a infant from the ruins of a house, went around the world in 2014.
It made the Syrian a shining symbol in the horror of war.
But as a hero he never saw himself, according to the picture, "For me this is the real jihad."
"When I die saving life, I think God sees in me a martyr."
Shortly before Omar himself fell victim to an attack, he had spoken in a video about the last bomb attacks in Syria.
The helicopters dropped four barrel bombs over the Alzadia district, one filled with chlorine gas.
A woman and two children died, seven people suffer from respiratory distress.
"We now eliminate the toxic remains of the bomb, so that children do not play with it," the picture quotes his last words before he died.
The death bomb of the Assad regime was supposed to have hit terrorists.
Greenlandhai: The oldest vertebrate animal is almost 400 years old
Rare sight.
Greenland sharks usually reach the surface only in winter.
After an investigation on board the Sanna research ship, this shark was allowed to return to the sea.
He was born in 1624 and swims with a good 1 km/h through the North Atlantic - to this day.
Greenland sharks only get young with 150 years of age.
On average, Greenlandhai swims along the ground of the North Atlantic, and in an hour it reaches an average of 1,220 meters.
Only when it comes to it will the five-metre-long animal accelerate to a full 2.6 km/h - and at this maximum speed is half as fast as a seals.
But this lifestyle of slowness seems to be a patent recipe for a high age.
In any case, Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "Science" about a Greenland shark that could be 392 years old.
"Insanity", commented Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock, this life span, which represents a world record for vertebrates.
The evolutionary biologist had long suspected that Greenland sharks would become stone-alt.
Only the evidence was missing.
Greenland sharks are difficult to observe, after all, they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitzbergen.
Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear on the surface only in winter.
Researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland sharks accordingly.
They measure their time-lumping rate when they equipped six animals with a transmitter in front of Spitzbergen.
However, prey make these sharks: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seals, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear.
They may hunt sleeping animals or patrol at the bottom of the ice sea and search for cadavers that tumble down from higher layers of water.
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues have now examined 28 Greenland sharks that brought fishermen to Greenland or Spitzbergen from the depths of the North Atlantic between 2010 and 2013.
The smallest shark was just 81 centimetres long, while the largest measured 502 centimetres.
To determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the lens core of the shark with the carbon-14 method.
This center of the eye lens is formed even before the birth of sharks, the proteins contained therein are no longer renewed later.
The two smallest sharks had a striking amount of carbon-14 in the lens core.
Its birth should therefore be after the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons attempts plunged larger amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.
In the third smallest animal, with a length of 220 centimetres, the lens core contained a small surplus of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons tests, so it should have celebrated its 50th birthday during its investigation in 2012.
All the larger Greenland sharks, on the other hand, had normal carbon-14 sizes in their lens core, resulting from cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.
In fact, the carbon 14 clock for a 493-centimetre-long Greenland shark showed an age of 335 years, while the record shark with 502 centimetres should be even 392 years old.
The fact that Greenlandhai females will only get young ones when they are longer than four meters was known.
Now the researchers of the length were able to assign an age.
Since one of the animals with 392 centimetres was probably at the threshold to sexual maturity and its age was determined at 156 years, Greenland sharks with the propagation are obviously at least one and a half centuries of time.
This too is likely to be world record for vertebrates at present.
It is no coincidence that such methusema live mainly in icy waters.
The previous record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland whale, in whose bacon on the neck was a 120-year-old harpoon tip, was caught in Alaska.
Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often runs on spasms.
So they mature later - and age slower.
In order to keep warm in cold water, the animals also often become particularly large.
Because the volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal loses warmth.
The heat loss of a gram of mouse is therefore much greater than with a gram of elephant.
Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.
"So a smaller animal lives more dangerously and should focus on having as many offspring as possible early as possible," explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein.
A very large animal, on the other hand, should invest its resources more in a long life.
Building ground in a double pack
During the recent meeting, the municipal council has focused on issues relating to construction.
With ease, the panel accepted the announcement from Mayor Robert Putz that "in the end the marketing of the recently designated residential areas can begin".
After the land, parcelation and development issues have been clarified and the applications for measurement have been made, the sale of the land in the residential areas "Strastelweg" and "Schönau-West" (Binderstraße area - Extension section 1) to interested parties is no longer in the way.
The municipal council is convinced that the building areas in the rural and quiet municipality of Schönau address young families and skilled seniors alike.
As it was said, the building will be able to immediately report to the town hall, and the award of the plots is expected to advise the municipal council in its September session.
In order to be able to meet requests for further businesses linked to job creation, the municipal council decided to amend the land use plan in sub-areas that was being created only in the spring of this year.
In the field of sub-timelars, two plots are extended to state road 2112 in the area of the commercial area already designated there.
Frankfurt benefits from the
Thus, the city of the Main has the best opportunities to attract shifted jobs and companies in competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg.
"It is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Brexit-Votum," says Michael Voigtländer, Head of the IW Financial Markets and Real Estate Markets Field.
According to the Brexit referendum, it is uncertain whether money houses may continue to operate from London from financial operations throughout the EU.
For the so-called EU passport, they have so far been authorised in the UK.
That's what big US banks are using.
Several banks have already announced that they will move jobs.
The "Frankfurt Main Finance" lobby association expects 10,000 new jobs on the Main within five years.
For Frankfurt, according to the IW, the European Central Bank (ECB) is responsible for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the euro area, as well as other key authorities such as the European Insurance Supervisory Board and the ESRB.
In Paris, although the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) is headquartered, it is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB.
"The proximity to the central bank is important for banks, as they can communicate directly with the supervision," says IW professor Voigtländer.
Luxembourg, although home to a large fund industry, has made it worse for infrastructure as well as for Dublin.
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the large airport.
The city also has easy-to-use commercial properties.
"In Paris it's not that easy to find free high-quality offices," says Voigtländer.
At the Seine, rents for first-class commercial properties were 50 percent higher than in the Main.
Moreover, Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime.
In a ranking of the company advice Mercer, the city stands in place seven, Luxembourg in place 19, Dublin in place 33 and Paris in 37th place.
Even if quality of life was a question of preferences: "With its already strong position as a financial location for the European internal market, Frankfurt could attract further banks and investors," the IW is following.
London, however, will remain the most important financial centre in Europe, despite the Brexit-Votum, the economics researchers mean.
In London, according to figures from the Landesbank Helaba, some 4400 people worked in the banking industry at the end of 2015, and in Frankfurt there were 62500.
Gilead receives legal costs from the hepatitis C patent dispute with Merck
A U.S. judge decided that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to refund the legal costs incurred by it from the Hepatits C dispute with the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc.
In June Gilead was released from a damage payment of $200 million for the violation of two patents by Merck, which were related to the blockbuster drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni of Gilead after a US judge discovered a pattern of misconduct on the part of Merck, including mineides and other unethical acts.
When the action was brought on Thursday, U.S. judge Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead is entitled to decree the costs incurred during the defense of the case.
Merck tries to equal Gilead, which dominates the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medications that can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other and claimed property for laboratory work based on Sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in the drugs of Gilead.
Forces supported by the US say that they have regained full control over Manbei from the Islamic State
Forces supported by the US have returned full control over the northern city of Manbi near the Turkish border, after the last IS fighters in the city have left it, said a speaker of the group on Friday.
The Democratic forces of Syria (DKS) are impelling the city after the withdrawal of the remaining group of fighters who have buried themselves inside the city.
They released over 2,000 civilians who were held hostages by the fighters, told Sharfan Darwish of the Mange of Reuters, allied with the DKS.
"The city is now under complete control, but we're just doing cleaning up," he told Reuters.
Clintons earn 10.75 million in 2015 and pay 34.2% federal taxes
Hillary Clinton published its 2015 tax return on Friday, which resulted in an income of USD 10.75 million for the presidential candidate of the Democrats and their husband and an effective federal tax rate of 34.2%.
In 2015, the Clintons donated USD 1 million for charitable purposes, mainly to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton generated almost USD 5.3 million in Redenhonors; the former Foreign Minister announced an income of USD 3 million from Simon & Schuster for her book about her term of office in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Clinton's Vice-Presidentship candidate, Senator Tim Kaine from Virginia, together with his wife Anne Holton, has published his tax returns for the last ten years.
They paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3% in 2015.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set standards regarding financial transparency," said Clinton's campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri in an opinion.
In a sharp contrast, Donald Trump is hiding behind false excuses and withdrawals regarding his previous promises to publish his tax statements.
It is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax returns, although they are not obliged to do so by law.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have stated a tax check by the tax authorities as a reason for his refusal.
"They are on the train," said Clinton's campaign assistant, Ian Sams on Twitter, regarding the release of the presidential candidate of the Democrats.
On Thursday Michael Cohen, Trump's special advisor, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish something before the tax audits were completed.
Trump's critics, including the Republican presidential candidate for the year 2012 Mitt Romney, have already revealed that his refusal raises questions regarding assets, his donations for charitable organizations, his business gestures and various other connections, in particular with Russia.
Clinton has already crashed on the subject and on Friday released a video on the Internet in which high-ranking Republican Trump is calling for his tax return to be published.
On Thursday she also addressed the topic during a speech on the economy in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what any other presidential candidate has done in the last few decades and to publish his tax returns," she said to the crowd.
Politico has reported that Trump paid no or very little taxes for two years during the 1990s, and a New York Times business journalist quoted on Friday a number of tax lawyers and tax advisers stating that this could still be the case.
Federal taxes have become a topic in the campaign.
Clinton supports a scheme named after the billionaire and investor Warren Buffett, which would ensure that people who earn more than USD 1 million pay a tax rate of at least 30%.
President Obama also supports the proposal.
During an election campaign for Hillary Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway industrial conglomerate has its headquarters here, demanded Trump to meet to exchange tax returns.
Buffett said he had also been subjected to IRS tax audit and Trump had "anxiety" in front of the voters and not in front of the tax authorities.
Clinton's campaign has published tax returns back to 2007.
The Clintons, now living in Chappaqua, New York, on average paid an effective federal tax rate of approximately 32% between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 40.5%.
The 2015 Clinton tax return showed that it only related USD 100 of its income as a wage, unlike most of all Americans.
Its main currency was a low-cost index fund, from which Clinton's dividends and revenues of USD 109,000 taxed.

Condoms with chili powder, fireworks promote Tanzania's elephant protection
Naturalists in Tanzania use an unorthodox way to prevent elephants from going into people-inhabited settlements - they throw condoms on them filled with chili powder.
The method has proved effective and the Honeyguide Foundation, which had the idea years ago, has intensified its promotion together with the US nature protection by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania, using a non-violent four-step method to protect their homes and crops without harming animals.
Previously, many spears have been used to defend themselves.
Friday is world elephant day dedicated to animal welfare.
"Since we've developed the toolkit, we've been able to observe a change in their attitude within these communities, making them much more confident that they can keep the elephants from their fields without harming the elephants," said the managing director of Honeyguide Damian Bell in a communication.
The first two steps include lighting the elephant with a torch and blowing into a horn.
If he is not scared, a so-called "Chili cloud" is thrown.
Chili powder mixed with soil is packed together with a fireworks body into a condom whose end is turned to the igniter.
When it is lit, the condom bursts up with a bang and sprays fine dust into the air on chili powder.
A touch is usually already out to chase out the elephant.
A final possibility is a shipyard who shoots a gold rain fireworks into the air, causing a loud, bright explosion.
Council of the City decides unanimously: No kiosk construction at the St. Goarer Rheinufer
Usually, the St. Goar investment projects of traders with kissing hands are considered to be significantly expandable in the core city.
However, the City Council now unanimously rejected the request for the new construction of a salessky on the banks of the Rhine in the immediate vicinity of the Rhine-Barton.
"In principle, we welcome new business drivers, but this kiosk does not fit in at this site in an exposed location on the banks of the Rhine," said Michael Hubrath for the CDU Group.
Jewish director slammed Berliner Hotel because Israeli preselection was removed after "Arab" invitation - RT News
A French director with Jewish roots untied a media riot after he had betrayed that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin had not listed an Israeli pre-election, as it had "demanded Arab guests" according to one employee.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentation "Shoah" left his trouble at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his last stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the hotel's country preselection list.
However, the country was not listed among the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room.
How is it in Berlin in 2016, the capital of the new Germany, possible that Israel has been eliminated and deleted?
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead, Kempinksi Bristol offers an opportunity to choose Israel via its own call center.
After a statement the director turned to the hotel reception.
The answer he received there "fucked him," as Lanzmann wrote.
The hotel staff said that the measure was "an intentional decision of the management of Kempinski hotels."
The reason behind this caused even more anger in the director.
"Most of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre-election be deleted," Lanzmann's employee was quoted.
The Israeli ambassador in Germany Yakov Hadas-Handas-Handesman called this a "great shame", reports the Süddeutsche Zeitung.
We were shocked and disturbed by this event.
That's really very embarrassing.
The fact that this has been done in exactly this hotel chain in Germany is even a greater shame.
There's no need for any explanation.
We expect the hotel to draw "the right conclusions," said the official.
The incident triggered a fairly large resonance on the Internet, in which people called the whole a scandal.
Some said that it would have "delivered" the alleged calls from Arab guests to the Kempinski Hotel.
"Be ashamed," said another article, stating that the hotel, located on the noble Kurfürstendamm, is close to a synagogue.
The hotel quickly rejected all accusations and called the incident a "mistake" and "apologised" at Lanzmann, reports Der Spiegel.
"There was never a direct statement", not to include Israel in the quick-selection list," the Süddeutsche Zeitung quoted a spokesperson at the Kempinski Hotel.
It adds that the country preselection has now been added.
Police use tear gas & rubber floors against protesting Brazilian students
Students met with the police on Thursday in the Brazilian city of São Paulo when they gathered to demonstrate the government's reforms to the public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber shots against the demonstrators.
The difficulties began when police officers tried to disperse the students, which led the police to use rubber shots and tear gas.
Several hundred students participated in the demonstrations to express their fear of the plans.
According to the proposals of the governor of the state of São Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, a little less than 100 public schools are closed, while 300,000 students are being implemented to save money.
Some of the protesters saw graffites spraying on walls against the provisional president Michel Temer.
The recent protests took place a few days after demonstrators went to the streets in order to support the suspended President Dilma Rousseff, who had been expelled from office by a vote of the Senate.
Russia & Iran trade is suddenly increasing to 71% - RT business
With the abolition of the sanctions, the Russian ambassador in Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, reported that the trade turnover between Moscow and Tehran grew by 70.9% year-on-year.
Since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted, Russian business interest in business in the country has been greatly increased, the ambassador reported.
Russian companies take up existing links with Iran while new companies are ready to access the market.
Of course, further trade expansion is one of the greatest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," said Dzhagaryan.
He noted that the trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9% in the first five months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $ 856 million.
In particular, Russian imports in Iran rose by 91.5 percent and amounted to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $158 million.
The trade upturn was achieved through deliveries of machines, land vehicles and weapons," said the ambassador.
Dzhagaryan is expected to have a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia for this year.
Last year, the Russian foreign representation issued about 35,000 visas, primarily travel visas, to Iranian citizens.
Iran also reached the top 20 of the countries, with regard to the number of tourists in Russia.
One could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia last year, were broken," he said.
At the same time, only relatively few Russians visit Iran, something the ambassador hopes it will change.
"I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, which have preserved monuments of ancient Persian civilization in a good condition," he said.
Witnesses Searched: Drink market in Waldbröl
A robbery was committed on Thursday evening on Rewe XXL's beverage market on the Gerberstraße Waldbröler.
Under the supervision of a firearm, three darkly dressed people who had disguised their faces demanded the release of cash from the employees of the beverage market and then fled first on foot and then probably with a silver-coloured VW golf.
How much money was spent, the police won't tell you.
The perpetrators should have been between 1,60 and 1,70 meters in size, i.e. relatively small.
The beverage market is accessible directly from the park deck of the Rewe market and is poorly accessible.
After the raid, the perpetrators must have run towards Gerberstraße, Friedrich-Engelbert-Weg and fled from the gravel parking lot opposite the park entrance with the silver-colored car, possibly towards B 256 (laden ring).
Anyone who has made observations at the time of the crime (against 19.45) that are related to the robbery should report urgently to the police.
Nagold: Game and fun at summer break
Eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and young people of the social pedagogical daily group/social group work of the child protection association Nagold with their caretakers on their summer break in Nussdorf, near Mühlacker.
In the quiet leisure home Hardtwäldle, during the first week of school holidays, the lively group had been quantified.
Several full day trips were on the program.
First of all, we went to boards to visit the petting zoo.
On the other hand, after Mulbronn, where there was a special children's tour in the world famous monastery.
The third trip led to Pforzheim.
In the Keltenmuseum in Hochdorf, the group learned much about the daily life and the food of the Celts.
On the hot days, the group enjoyed the deep lake in Mulbronn, which invites you to jump, swim and planchen.
Children and caretakers were spoiled with their self-prepared body food such as the Acids Spätzle, the Seebronn Pfännle, Iselshauser-Bloff, the English-Breakfast and Tübingen Bolognese.
In workshops, beaked, beautiful jewels of pearls and stones were created or made of wood a Roman mill game.
Further highlights of leisure were fishing in a nearby pond, the evenings on fire and the final "Bunte Evening".
On the day of the journey home, the sun and the children and young people returned home satisfied.
Haigerloch: Pilgrims on the Gate of Mercy
The ministrants from the Eyatal-Haigerloch See Care Unit St. Anna were traveling on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.
Four stages were taken together.
In order to bridge the time to the next Rome Wall trip of all ministrikers in probably two years, the upper administrative round of St. Anna has decided to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrimage.
Various pilgrimage targets were examined and were finally decided on for the bishop city of Freiburg, where this year, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy, a special pilgrimage was offered with the gate of mercy opened at the Freiburger Münster.
16 Minis from Bitterbronn, Gruol, Haigerloch and Sanctuaries were on their way.
In the evening before, Father Storost sent out the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the Pilgrim Crosses and granted the Pilgrimage.
From Horb was driven by train to the starting point of Villingen, where also a Münster Our Lady stands and thus the Pilgrim path was taken by Münster.
The individual day tours were framed by a brief impulse with various prayers, songs and scriptures in the morning and evenings.
But also on the way, the minis made rests on the crossroads, chapels or churches to sing together a song of a specially composed song of pilgrims.
For the overnight stays, the parish homes of the local parishes were available.
At the stages, Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller provided a tasty as well as strengthening dinner and breakfast.
It continued on the second day on Furtwangen to Gütenbach.
Day after that, the stage was taken to St. Peter, which was the most strenuous route, but at first had to descend about 500 metres in the event of a sulfurous heat and then climbed again.
The deserved reward was a common barbecue on the bath in the evening.
After the morning impulse on the fourth Pilgrimage in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter, it went on to the final stage to Freiburg.
The minis arrived at the Freiburg Münster in the late afternoon in view of ease and happiness and entered the gate of mercy.
God was thanked with a little impulse.
At the evening fair in Münster, the minis by Koperator Markus Obert arrived at the Pilgrim's destination were welcomed.
After the service, the pilgrims were able to visit the sacristy and the high altar.
The next day was time for the Breisgaumetropole.
In the afternoon it went back to Horb by train.
Finally, all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were marked.
Shot Callum Skinner storms home when Brit Gold rings for cycling
Scotland's Callum Skinner raced last night in the men's team sprint in the Velodrome in Rio to fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor role that his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had made his own. The boyspund made the legend proud when he stormed home to take home a victory from the favorite New Zealand.
England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic gold medals.
They repeated the trick after taking only a modest sixth place in March at the London Railway World Championships despite Hoy's withdrawal.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.
They did this in time as a hint.
Hoy's retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.
Skinner was the man they stayed with when they saw potential in the bulkhead that has now developed.
Hindes, Kenny - who won with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner set an Olympic record in the qualification rounds, but in the standard rounds the New Zealand won in the first round.
And the British trio won the duel with gold.
After his rounds, Kenny was just back, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner kept it.
A strategy change made up a large part of the transformation, in which Hindes drove into a higher gear to slow him down and to enable Kenny and, above all, Skinner to keep pace.
Hoy looked from his position as a BBC expert and noticed Skinner, Kenny and Hindes as they rose to the podest.
The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said, "It's a flattering comparison."
I'm just here to do my best and make a name for myself.
We set an Olympic record in the final round and defeated the world champion.
It was just incredible.
There is no better way to win this.
After the triumph 2012 at the side of Kennys and Hoys, Hindes admitted that he deliberately fell on the track after a weak start.
He withdrew this statement later and there was no opposition from England's rivals.
In such an overwhelming victory, there was no such problem this time.
Hindes said, "It feels like London with all the GB flags."
We've been together in the last three months as a team.
We got away so bad with so many world titles that it was incredible to win back at the Olympics.
This is an event, a gold medal for the nation that was won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London.
If this is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, we expect successful five days in the Velodrome.
With the form Kennys it is in the area of the possibility that he repeated Hoy's victory of three Olympic gold medals in one competition.
For Kenny, who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on 23 March (a seemingly sacred date for British sports; on that day also Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - means an yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.
That would be the same thing from Hoy.
Kenny participates next in the sprint, which starts today and will go over three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said, "I only enjoy this for the moment."
The team event is always best.
You can win it with your colleagues.
It feels a little lonely to win alone.
In addition, he said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight."
It was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England.
Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doul qualified with the fastest performance in the four-four-kilometer race.
They arrived at the destination in 3:51,942.
The 2012 London Gold World Record was 3:51,659.
The first and final round (22.42) takes place today on the second day of the beaver, where Wiggins will certainly be in the focus.
He had argued with officers yesterday before the qualification when officials called him to measure his height.
In the corresponding women's competition, which continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie advanced in world record in 4:13,260.
The GB team relys on its strong railway cycling team to dominate the mid-period of the Olympic Games and to pick up a crowd of medals.
After a truly extraordinary presentation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were dropped.
Dramas played in the background, according to the technical director Shane Sutton, in April in the midst of sexism and mobs, as well as the retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, if you look at the first evening of the competition in the Velodrome, it looks like the now legendary reputation GBs, which has reached its peak at the perfect moment, could be repeated again.
The future of Portland smelting due to the abolition of the energy contract in question
The future of the aluminium melt from Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs of workers - is at stake, as the plant operator announces the energy supply contract and thus removes all supply contracts, as the supply company reported.
This step followed the Government's decision in Victoria early this year to grant no further subsidies to operate the plant.
A subsidy for 20 years will expire in November.
Up to 2000 jobs in the Alcoa facility in Portland are at stake.
No less than 2000 jobs - both direct and indirect - could be at risk of closure.
In addition, domino effects could occur, as the melting industry consumes around 10 percent of Victoria's total electricity generation.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the point Henry Schmelzerei, which led to a closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
Alcoa's melting in Portland loses money and risks closing.
This step follows the years of speculation regarding the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and, most recently, due to the electricity price for the plant.
AGL, which supplies the large aluminium smelting plant with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that it is assumed that three more owners will terminate their contracts.
The plant is largely owned by a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares.
"AGL assumes that the plant will continue to be operated in Portland, which means a further physical demand for electricity through melting," the company informed the company.
AGL continued to state that the contracts were so-called "guarantee transactions" which should have entered into force from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period so that they will end in 2017.
"From this point of view, AGL assumes that the contracts will contribute to revenue in the fiscal year 17," said the electricity supplier.
All potential effects on revenue on AGL from the CJ 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong future markets for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL announced that it had already written down the value of the contracts in its annual conclusion of $187 million in "awaiting a termination".
Alcoa said that the decision to register the contracts, the "ability of Alcoas... to operate the melting or to ensure the power supply to the melting plant" did not affect.
The US company said that in 2010 it had concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, which should have entered into force from November this year, even if it is still guilty of a statement of why it has resigned from the contract.
Analysts warn against the possible closure of Portland smelting in Victoria and the Tomago system near Newcastle due to the bad economic conditions of the industry.
In reference to the statements made by analysts at the beginning of the week, the Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland consumes around 600 megawatts of electricity every year and Tomago about 900 megawatts of electricity.
Should both plants disappear from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the [power market].
And it wouldn't be good for us as a generator," he said.
More than just a Kardashian reality TV star, Kendall is on the cover of the September edition of the Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of Kardashian-Jenner Clans Kris is on the cover of the coveted September issue of the US Vogue.
Kendall, the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder, who ran the Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
"In a room full of people I love, the sight of this coverr brought me to cry," wrote Kendall.
The disclosure of the cover followed a bizarre (or simple keeping up with the Kardashians similar?), scripted reality video showing the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (with the exception of the problems Rob and Caitlyn as well as in the presence of the most popular showbiz uncles and producers of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest), as they forget the cover of their sister and this ended with a classic turn: they all planned a surprise party.
This represents the cliché-like action almost every birthday episode of a children's show (Seacrest brought the sentence, "You thought we forgot you?," with the honesty of a drawing rabbit on a broadcast at 8 a.m.), but Kris had to let her other girls participate in this publicity somehow.
With regard to the September edition of the Vogue, a new era of Kardashians has certainly begun.
Kendall's great sister Kim likes to have beaten her as far as the Vogue cover is concerned (they and her husband Kanye West were on seeing it in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for themselves.
The September edition for Vogue is the most sold edition of the year.
With an extent that resembles a tape rather than a fashion magazine, the edition attracts a large number of advertisers (Laut Fashionista were of the 832 pages of the Wälzer 615 pages advertising).
The revelation of his coverstar is expected to be so longingly that in the last two years pictures of the magazine have been sent through before the official announcement.
Women already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have been clearly more "majorities, the models" than "models that are famous" on the cover.
Oscar Award winner and dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, one year after Lady Gaga was honored.
But even in the low chance that Mrs. Jenner - described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" of her generation - falls under the earlier category, she is in good company.
These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or youths of today who know how to make a good snapchat video (even when everything comes to Jenner).
They are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry.
Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the publication of Lemonade.
Of course, Jenner's success doesn't like everyone.
With her reality TV story, Jenner's position in the fashion world was always a bit tense.
In June, the former Victoria's secret model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticized her and called her "the dung of the moment."
These feelings came up again when the news came out with the appearance of Jenner on the Vogue Cover.
But riding around on the displeasure seems to pass the point.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September edition of the Vogue.
It is in the truest sense of the word a supermodel.
She's running for Marc Jacobs.
She advertises your foundation of Estee Lauder.
You and all your sisters will sell you pictures of themselves on their respective Paywall apps.
She sells pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter to the magazine LOVE.
And in her spare time, she's on reality TV. Probably only to see her sister Kourtney and her children.
Municipal law centres reject 160,000 people each year
More than 160,000 of the country's most vulnerable persons are rejected annually by the municipal law centres, while the industry is focusing on the effects of further budget cuts on already overburdened transactions.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly older people, immigrants, workers in need, victims of violence, and those who have no funds for unjust misdemeanors and the like - are rejected in their requests for free legal advice and legal assistance.
Legal services of the municipality, which are already overloaded, are ready for further cuts.
As of June next year, these legal centres are expected to lose another 30 percent of their federal funds.
The director of the Queensland James Farrell Common Law Centres said that the last survey of the National Association of Municipal Law Centres showed that thousands of people have already been rejected each year.
Farrell said that the situation would only get worse without a withdrawal of the federal government decision.
"Queensland's municipal law centers are chronically underfinanced, which means that thousands of people of important services you need are rejected," he said.
People who leave violent relationships, people with inconceivable and oppressive debts, families who go through separation, workers who have been unjustly released - all these people have legal problems and this survey shows that they cannot get the help they need.
As of June 2017, the Federal Government will cut the funding by 30 percent, which means that thousands of people in need of help from Queensland will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help.
We call on the Minister of Justice and the Federal Minister of Justice and the Senators of Queensland George Brandis to immediately abolish these budget cuts so that people can get the help they need from legal problems.
Last year, the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal aid to the national average.
It is now time to look at the needs of local law centres and their customer communities and to see that the Palaszczuk government invests in this important work.
Donald Trump's election campaign accused after employees allegedly drew weapon
New York: Donald Trump's campaign was sued for alleged inactivity, after being informed that her campaign leader for North Carolina had directed a firearm to an employee in February, while they were traveling in a jeep in February.
The incident is described in an indictment filed in the Landesgericht von Charlotte by Vincent Bordini on Wednesday, a former software programmer for the campaign in that state.
Bordini indicated for months to have waited that the matter would be settled internally before he realized that "this wouldn't happen."
The campaign leader, Earl Philip, " drew a gun, put his right index finger on the trigger, and rammed the run in Vincent's Kniekehle," Bordini announced in his charge.
After pleading with the local and regional campaign management, Bordini found that at least four others had already done the same experience with Phillip, he submitted in the indictment.
"Wapons don't have to be fired to cause damage," Bordini announced.
The charge comes only two days after the Republican presidential candidate triggered an uproar when he told a crowd in North Carolina that the Second Amendment should take action if his rival Hillary Clinton were to be elected and judge named.
Trump's campaign made it clear that the media had torn his words out of the context and that he would not be incited to violence.
Bordini's complaint demands compensation from the campaign for the violation of the duty of care and Philip's physical injury and permanent mental damage.
Trump's press speaker Hope Hicks was unable to reach an opinion.
Attempts to contact Philip also failed.
WCCB, a local news station in Charlotte, reports that Phillip is no longer an employee of the campaign.
No response was made to calls from his consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services.
The Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has so far led a controversial campaign.
The case is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, Supreme Court, County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Berlin/Schwerin: Survey before country elections: losing SPD and CDU
In the upcoming elections in the Länder of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (4 September) and Berlin (18 September), significant losses for the government parties SPD and CDU are taking place.
This resulted in representative surveys of the opinion research institute INSA for the "Image" newspaper (Friday).
While the red and black government coalition in the north could almost continue to rule, this is not possible according to the survey values in Berlin.
However, in both states, the SPD would be the strongest party and would have good opportunities to continue to be the head of government.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the SPD dropped from 35.6 percent five years ago to 24 percent.
According to the survey, the party was only close to the CDU, which could return to 23 percent.
The third place is disputed between the left and the AfD.
The left came to 19 percent (before 18.4 percent), the AfD would be represented for the first time in the Landtag with 19 percent.
Despite slight losses, the greens are again slowing down 6 percent (up from 8.7 percent) in the Schweriner Landtag.
At 3 percent, NPD and FDP would not be represented in the country.
According to the survey, the SPD would only be 23 percent (2011 election: 28.3 percent).
The CDU reached only 18 percent after 23.4 percent.
They are still behind the greens by 19 percent (2011: 17.6 percent), but before the left by 15 percent (previously 11.7 percent).
The AfD would be represented in the House of Representatives for the first time at 14 percent.
By 5 percent the FDP could hope for a return, while the pirates would miss the income in contrast to 2011.
Nokia 9000 Communicator: The First Smartphone
Email and Internet in Zeitlupe: 20 years ago, the Nokia Communicator came to the market.
The successors dominate the world today - his manufacturer experienced a disaster.
The device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.
It was thicker and bigger, so it wasn't good in the hand either.
On the contrary, it was pretty clumsy.
The built-in storage was initially eight megabytes, which would reach today for about two high resolution selfies.
An iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gigabytes.
The "Nokia 9000 Communicator" came into the shops exactly 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996, - and it was the first smartphone.
For a few euros, lovers can still buy the devices on the Internet, but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Internet.
20 years ago, however, the communicator was a sensation.
The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the computer trade fair Cebit in Hanover as a "office in the western pocket format".
In fact, the new mobile phone could be a lot for standards at the time: SMS and emails could be sent and received, even by fax was the communicator to reach.
Even access to websites was possible via HTML browsers, although torturing slowly.
A calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.
There was a little antenna, and the phone could be folded up like a laptop.
Then there was a small keyboard and a black and white screen.
The price was quite proud: 2700 D-Mark, about 1400 Euro.
The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 Euro in 2015.
No one could imagine in August 1996 that the communicator would become the beginning of the smartphone era.
Everything's been different since then.
The smart phones are a success story, though not for Nokia.
The phone division of the Finns experienced an unprecedented disaster, was finally sold and processed to Microsoft.
The market today dominates suppliers, who all came much later than Nokia.
Being online all the time, this is everyday for many people today.
In 2015, there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide.
About 1.4 billion devices were sold, Samsung and Apple account for 555 million of them alone.
Worldwide turnover with the devices is around 400 billion euros.
In addition, the well-running shops of the countless app providers and telecommunications companies are included.
A whole industry has been created around the smartphone.
The decisive breakthrough to the mass market only arrived in early 2007, then Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the iPhone on the Mac world.
He promised three devices in one: a music player, a phone and an internet communication system to easily use everything via touch screen.
Apple’s win began, still today the iPhone is the Group’s most important product.
Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry, who dominated the market, had the checkout.
They finally disappeared, Blackberry has to fight.
The legend now has Apple and Asian providers like Samsung.
The smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after its invention.
On average, every German now looks at his cell phone 88 times a day.
"We all have to learn to put the smartphone away again," said Janina Balle, in the Siemens board responsible for personnel.
Permanent accessibility is now regarded as a curse and blessing at the same time.
England must direct the Olympic spirit and widen Heathrow
Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local municipalities and throughout London, but throughout the country.
For me, this was the biggest attraction of Heathrow, just like at that time in London in 2012 when we made a huge effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games.
The Olympiad brought great benefits to Stratford and the East End.
And this will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near Heathrow.
For our local communities, we will already create 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment.
Just as they were ahead of us in London 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of enlargement Heathrow is too great.
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will blow on the world stage.
The twins were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong with Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcoming, but Heathrow answers every question asked him.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for many and not for individuals.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion in white-collar growth, and to leave behind a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and throughout the UK.
We have a great team in Heathrow, which has implemented an expensive £11 billion infrastructure investment program in time and budget, from T5 - which has been elected the world's best airport terminal for five years - to T2, which was built in the middle of the world's two most frequent runways.
Now they are ready to provide a third runway, which is supported by £16 billion in private investment.
The 2012 London Games were a great success for GB and I am confident that the extension of Heathrow will also be one.
It is time for us to direct this Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow while safeguarding our future trade and creating a legacy of skills and employment that can be proud of England.
Lord Paul Nighton is chairman of the Heathrow Board and former Commercial Secretary to the Treasure
Adblock Plus, Facebook in "Katz and Mouse Game" regarding ad blockage
For companies that earn money with online advertising, according to one of the software manufacturers attempts to avoid ad blocking, like a "catch and mouse game".
On Thursday, only two days after Facebook announced that it would block ad blocks on its desktop, Adblock Plus published a blog post in which it informed users that they could update their filters in the program to block advertisements on the social network again.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that its desktop page would modify the coding regarding its advertisements to make it difficult to detect ad blocks that are part of the advertising page.
But Adblock announced that it has found a new way to bypass the new codes.
In a blog post, the spokesperson of Adblock Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of Hin and Her fight between the ad-blocking Open Source Community and the surrounding is underway since the invention of ad blockers," and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come up with a new solution.
The fact that the world's largest company for social media has become involved in the fight is a strong indicator of how worrying ad blockers have become for the industry.
According to a study conducted last year by Pagefair and Adobe, around 200 million people use advertising blockers; almost four times as much in 2013.
With 1.03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook via their mobile devices, mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of the advertising revenue Facebooks.
The company did it on ad blockers on Desktop PCs, as mobile ad blockers have no effect on Facebook's mobile app for the social network and Instagram, a speaker informed.
Advertising on Desktop PCs is a sufficient proportion of revenue, so Facebook seems to be worth investing in such a step.
On Tuesday Facebook announced that it would update its "advertising tool" to have more control over the people about their targeted advertising.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblock's new filters would be worrying because they would also block content on the site that is not advertising.
"For users, this is not a positive experience, so we plan to address the problem," said a Facebook speaker in an e-mail message.
Ad blockers are a stupendous means, so instead we focused on developer tools such as Ad Preferences to put more control in people's hands.
Passing the woman on to the Swiss motorway in the event of suspected suicide
The victim was on the highway in the middle of the night.
The police call witnesses after a woman was overrun on a highway in the early morning hours on Thursday in a suspected suicide of several vehicles.
The incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight.
One woman lay down on the street in the dark "in an act of despair" and was met by several cars, the police in Vaud said.
It is obvious that a Swiss woman at the age of 49, who was overrun by several vehicles, including a truck, wanted to kill himself.
She died on the spot.
Several drivers have already been heard, but some have still not been identified, said the police who asked them and every witness of the incident to report.
An investigation procedure was opened, which is a "logical" step in such a situation, told Gilles Hofstetter to the Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers is displayed.
Was a collision avoidable?
This is something the prosecutor has to decide," said Hofstetter.
Two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers are not held responsible.
In each of the two cases - in which a person ran in the dark on the highway - it was decided that the drivers should not assume that a pedestrian runs on the highway in the middle of the night as it was called in the newspaper.
Last year a police officer was acquitted of the negligent killing after passing over and killing a man who was on the A1 near Payerne in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had drunk and became unconscious on the street, the court heard.
The court found that the police officer -- who had responded to an emergency call -- was in a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was "a perfect exceptional and unpredictable situation," the judge said.
Anyone who has further information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should report to the police under number 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA Climate Model: Venus was once habitable
The Venus was probably once habitable according to the projections of a new NASA climate model.
Scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those of climate researchers.
The model was designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-tight atmosphere could once have demonstrated earth-like conditions.
Scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere and still slowly turned on.
The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.
The planet probably had more dry areas than the earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to accommodate life and protect against rapid dilution.
The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matter.
"In the GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of Venus exposes its daily side of the sun for almost two months," said GISS scientists Anthony Del Genio in a press release.
This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from much of the solar heat.
The result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than those of the earth today.
The model produced a history of Venus, similar to evolution that had previously been suspected by planetary researchers.
Although it was once probably habitable, the Venus -- over the course of several billion years -- was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.
Their oceans diluted and their water vapor was burned away by ultraviolet light.
When their hydrogen escaped, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect remained behind -- the Venus that we know today.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus Climate Model in the Geophysical Research Letter.
Patrick Roy returns as a coach of the Avalanche
Patrick Roy resigned from Colorado Avalanche as a coach and vice president of Hockey Operations on Thursday and led to a lack of right of co-determination in the team's decision-making process.
Alternative President/General Manager of Colorados Joe Sakic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will immediately look for a new coach.
"In the last three years, I have fulfilled my duties as Chief Trainer and Vice President of Hockey Operations of Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination," said Roy in an opinion.
I've been thinking a lot over the course of the summer about how I could improve this team to give it more depth, this needs it and bring it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, the vision of the coach and Vice President of Hockey Operations must be perfectly aligned with that of the organization.
He must also have a right of co-determination in decisions affecting the performance of the team.
These conditions are currently not met.
Sakic, who hired Roy on 23 May 2013, thanked him for his contributions to the team.
"Patrick informed me about this decision today," said Sakic.
We all appreciate what he has done for our organization and wish him only the best for the future.
Roy won the Jack Adams Award as the best coach of the league during his debut season at the Avalanches 2013-14.
He led the club to 112 points and first place in the Central Vision, but Colorado was beaten in the first round of the Minnesota Playoffs and missed the post-season in each of the last two years.
The Avalanches registered a 39-39-4 brand in the 2015-16 season and fell behind the game for a second wild card spot in the Western Conference by five points.
Roy won four Stanley Cups as Hall of Fame Torwart -- two with the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
North-sea oil workers take up conversations again, put off strike
The labour struggles concerning the remuneration for North Sea oil workers are suspended, while all the parties are putting themselves on the table for a new round of talks, said negotiators.
Strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group were carried out sporadically on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Good Group as well as the Unite and RMT trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the settlement process of the current dispute," it says in a joint statement.
We will hold a few full-day meetings in the next few weeks to start the beginning of next year to tackle the problems again.
The unions said that their last strike, which is the first one in over 25 years, was a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent.
This year, Wood Group has reduced the rates to its North Sea contractors by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure.
The company's rate reduction follows a 10-percent decline for onshore contractors in 2014.
The company said that additional cuts give the company the necessary space to get through the market down.
Shell has released thousands of people for its part and announced plans to give up its oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries, as it rationalises its business activities as a result of its megacombination with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to the lower rovalry journey, an economic situation that was strengthened by the British decision to leave the European Union in June.
Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with workers leaders at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the biggest industrial disputes that have taken place in the North Sea for a generation.
The North Sea is important for the regional economy, he said.
"In the North Sea and throughout the country, we need an economy that works for many and not only for a few," he said.
In 2016, less than $1.4 billion of expenditure is expected for new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of about $7 billion in the last five years.
Kepler measures rotational rate of stars in the cluster of Pleiades
The latest mission with the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers collect the fullest catalog of rotational rates under the stars of the star cluster of the Pleiades.
The new data help astronomers to understand why stars rotate at different rates in the star cluster and in what context are the rotation periods with planetary rise.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other star clusters, we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebell, a researcher at the Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.
The cluster of stars of the Pleiads is 445 light years away from the earth.
Many stars in this star cluster, which arose about 125 million years ago, now reach the adult age.
They're turning around the fastest.
At peak rotation rates these ripening stars emit large amounts of star winds.
As these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a brake effect on the stars.
When a star ages, its rotational rate begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognizing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- like sunspots.
The latest catalogue of rotational rates indicates that massive stars are slower than less massive stars.
Rebell compares the stars to dancers, with larger stars of slow pirouettes spinning than smaller ones.
"In the "ballet" of the Pleiades, we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive, whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," said Rebell.
Since the star cluster of the Pleiades is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities such as rotational rates.
"The cluster of stars of the Pleiads offers an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older," said Rebell.
There is still much ahead of us about what we want to learn more about how the How, When and Why stars slow down their rotational rates and so to speak hang their "tanzs" shoes.
Rebell and her colleagues have reported in detail in three newspaper reports their latest analysis of the rotational rates of the Pleiads that will soon appear in the Astronomical Journal.
A controversial baseball star kicks off
The tears ran at Alex Rodriguez faster than the U.S. Baseball Star in the best days from Base to Base.
After his emotional withdrawal, the 41-year-old professional will last wear the jersey of his New York Yankees on August 12 against the Tampa Bay Rays.
"I love this game and this team."
"I say 'goodbee' to both," said the 14-time all-star game participant of the Major League Baseball (MLB).
In 2009, he won the World Series with Yankees, winning the 2009 World Series.
His signature under a ten-year contract has given him 27 million US dollars annually since 2007.
By the end of the contract on 31 December 2017, he will be acting as a consultant and youth coach - with full salary.
As a player, Rodriguez paid it back for a long time with power.
With 696 homeruns, 3114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ("Runs") for the Seattle Mariners (1994 to 2000), the Texas Rangers (2001 to 2004) and since 2005 the Yankees he has created several milestones.
With Hall-of-Fame members Hank Aaron and Willie Mays, only two more baseball players have similar values in the most important statistics.
However, the 41-year-old should not be included in the baseball hall.
Because so successful Rodriguez - nickname "A-Rod" - was on the field, so controversial is his appearance outside of the place.
In 2009, the superstar admitted to "ESPN" taking up banned steroids between 2001 and 2003.
In August 2013, he was detained for 211 matches in the so-called biogenesis scandal until the end of 2014.
Rodriguez is considered to have been the main suspect of having been receiving benefits for years via an anti-aging clinic in southern Florida.
After a dispute, the lock was still reduced to 162 encounters.
"The league could even have done me a favor for 2014 because I had been playing through for 20 years without a break," Rodriguez said, suffocatingly at that time.
His farewell days also do not run silent.
While many baseball legends in their last games get the big stage again, Rodriguez often had to sit on the bench.
"My job doesn't include a farewell tour."
"My job includes trying to win every game", Yankees coach Joe Girardi prized.
After all, Rodriguez, who was married to the actress Cameron Diaz and who was told about the relationship with Popstar Madonna and the actress Kate Hudson, received sympathy messages from the fans of Yankee Erzrivalen Boston Red Sox.
"We want A-Rod", the followers sang at the 4:9 defeat against the Rodriguez team.
Olympia 2016: Chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekowa and Adrian Zielinski are first doping cases
got caught: Due to a positive doping sample, weightlifter Adrian Zielinski from Poland must not start in Rio.
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are overshadowed by the first official doping cases.
A caught athlete would've won almost a medal.
Before the seventh day of the competition, the first official doping cases became known to the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
The Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 3000-meter-hinder Silwia Danekowa from Bulgaria and the Polish weightlift Adrian Zielinski were tested and excluded in Brazil – right before the start of the already critically empty athletic competitions, these messages are happening.
The diuretic hydrochlorothiazide was detected last Sunday at Chen, which is used as a masking agent for doping substances.
On Friday afternoon, the International Sports Court CAS confirmed its exclusion from the Olympic Games.
On Sunday the 18-year-old had finished fourth in the final over 100 m butterfly, only by 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal.
On Friday Chen should have participated in the predecessors of more than 50 m freestyle.
Chen requested the opening of the B-test and a hearing at the International Olympic Committee (IOC).
The national association takes the matter "very seriously and demands from Chen full cooperation in the investigations", Xinhua quoted a message: "We will cooperate with the International Sports Court CAS and will accept the judgment".
For the first time in history, the IOC is no longer responsible for the sanctioning of athletes with positive cases.
Also at the night of Rio, the news about the positive trial at Danekowa continued, and the 33-year-olds went to the offensive themselves.
"I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," she said to the Bulgarian TV channel BNT.
She was innocent that "the only explanation could be food supplements," said the athlete.
According to the report, the prohibited substance is to be the blood doping agent EPO.
Danekowa has been suspended for the time being, according to BNT, the B-test should have already been positive.
Bulgaria's Prime Minister Bojko Borissov immediately spoke with criticism of the athlete.
"I don't understand why athletes don't make the right conclusions," he said, "we Bulgarians are under observation, so many have already been excluded."
For example, all weight lifters from the chronic doping-loaded nation must not take part in Rio.
On Friday the case of "Adrian Zielinski" was also known, the London-Olympiäger in class up to 85 kg was tested positively on the anabolic steroid Nandrolone three days earlier, like his brother Tomasz.
Both contest the intake, but both must not start in class up to 94 kg.
Before the start of the athletes, the Danekowa case is also another heavy blow for the reputation of the entire sport.
The world association IAAF had forbidden the complete Russian team until an exception due to systematic dopings, even the runner nation Kenya produces numerous bad news in Rio.
In the swimming sport, the former crimes in China also caused fierce conflicts between the athletes.
The Frenchman Camille Lacourt attacked the Chinese Olympic winner Sun Yang.
"Sun Yang pisss purple."
"When I see the podium over 200 m freestyle, I want to hand over myself," Lacourt said on French radio.
Sun was also at the heart of a dispute with the Australian Mack Horton.
"I have no time and no respect for doping fraud," he said.
Sun had been tested positively for the Stimulan Trimetazidine in 2014 but only a three-month lock had to be held.
Data Clue: So perfide extorted hackers their ransom money
Programmers of extortion malware are currently targeting companies - and are successful in doing so.
According to a recent survey by malware defense specialists Malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of the companies surveyed have been at least once in the past twelve months, partly victims of an attack with extortion software.
In Germany almost 20 percent of companies were already the target of Ransomware extortion.
40 percent of the victims willingly paid the solvers required by the perpetrators to use the attacked systems and data again.
The perpetrators specialize their extortion software according to the observations of malwarebytes seeing on attacks in corporate networks.
If they are successful, the potentially extorting ransom is significantly higher than for private users.
"We are currently observing a terrifyingly fast evolution of the malware software," explains Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "world".
In 2008, most malware programs were still designed to send advertising.
Then the perpetrators discovered extortion software for themselves.
First, private users were the target, but the switch to corporate attacks has been terrifyingly fast in recent months.
Ransomware works for a simple pattern: Once active on the computer of a victim, she specifically searches for recently changed files such as Word, Excel or Database files, as well as archives of images and videos.
These files encrypt the Ransomware and permanently delete the originals.
The software then presents the demands of the extortioners.
To get the end encryption code to the files, the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of cryptocurrency bitcoin -.
However, where the personal photo database is available to private users, companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases without which production is suspended.
Accordingly, the damage is higher when a Ransomware hits.
22 percent of the affected German companies reported sales losses due to Ransomware, 13 percent even had to interrupt the business completely, in one case people were at risk of life.
In Germany, several hospitals have already been victims of attacks, whose patients may be threatened by the loss of disease.
"We always say to the victims: Don't pay, you just promote the problem," explains Kleczynski.
However, 80 to 90 percent of the companies that pay get their data back.
It is difficult for managers to reject the demands of the perpetrators in the event of a standstill in the operation.
The hackers, on the other hand, know this and try everything to build a good reputation.
In a recent study, F-Secure security researchers have examined the user interfaces and the contact with the extortioners and have come to the conclusion: the perpetrators are actually trying to build up a kind of customer service to take more money.
They explain to their victims by chat how they can pay via Bitcoin, specify freely accessible support websites, or undecrypt example files for free.
And if private individuals are redeemed after payments of a few hundred euros, companies have to partially negotiate hard and pay five-digit sums to get their data back unencrypted.
In view of the potentially high and relatively riskless profits from the Ransomware extortion, hackers become more and more professional and share the work, safety expert Chester Wisniewski from the antivirus provider Sophos explains: "One person can write a Ransomware within about a week."
However, it is more likely that these are three or four people.
The programmers then sell their malicious software in the form of a software modular to the actual extortioners.
The previously malware kits were created by buying the malware itself, advice and additional tools for a one-time, fixed price between $1,000 and $10,000.
"A customization tool is included in the delivery so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.
The extortioners are then looking for more hackers to spread the freshly purchased software among the victims.
We live in a service industry.
So you log into one of the underground forums, buy the set from a criminal and order another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.
Payment is made per infected computer.
"Usually the criminals order spammers to spread," explains Wisniewski.
The risk of Ransomware is now known to many companies that better secure their data.
More than 50 percent of the company's IT managers in the malware bytes survey are confident to be able to resist Ransomware by means of file backups and scanner software.
Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.
"If data encryption alone is no longer a sufficient threat to successful experimentation, the perpetrators threaten instead with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations," explains Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski.
This makes the damage potential even more numerous than before, depending on the type of data.
In the future, the perpetrators could also take on grain completely new goals on the Internet of Things.
At the Defcon hacker conference, security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control.
In the middle of winter, the release of such a blocked heating could well be worth a ransom.
If the perpetrators then block an entire production road in a factory instead of heating in the future, Ransomware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0.
One for all cases
HONDA HR-V is flexible and daily available
In the small HR-V Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupé and also the versatility of a minivan.
The HR-V, which was built on the same new platform as the new jazz, actually proves to be quite flexible in everyday life.
Although the HR-V is only 1.60 m high, passengers have a lot of space in both the first row and the find, it doesn't seem tight in any place.
The materials of the interior are well processed and work pleasantly, only the cockpit top is falling off.
The HR-V in the storage space is more versatile than comparable vehicles.
Not only is there a 453 l trunk available for raised and 1026 l for folded backrests, but there are the "Magic Seats".
This is less magical than it sounds: the seats of the back seat can be folded up like a cinema chair and thus provide storage space, which is 1.24 m high from the ground to the ceiling.
The trunk can be laden well, but the load height at 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008.
The 1.6-l diesel tested with 88 kW/120 hp accelerates the HR-V very powerful thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.
However, he is likely to do his job a little bit quieter.
The daily consumption of 4.7 l/100 km is enjoyable.
There is another motorization: a 1.5 l gasoline with 96 kW/130 hp.
An all-wheel drive is not offered.
The driving behaviour is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.
But the steering should be a little more direct.
The equipment leaves no wishes in the "Executive" tested top variant.
The safety systems include the city emergency assistant (working until Tempo 32), the collision warning system and the track maintenance assistant.
The collision warner sometimes annoys because he considers many obstacles as "close objects".
The remote lighting assistant works very reliably.
And the intelligent tempo controller reacts to the traffic sign recognition and pushes the speed if necessary.
But the full connectivity is only available for top equipment: 7 inch touch screen, navi, app integration and more.
Two USB and HDMI sockets are under the armrest and are therefore easy to reach.
The approximately 29000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are fine.
If you don't want to invest so much, you'll get the petrol from 20000 euros, the diesel from 23000 euros.
The engines comply with the Euro-6 exhaust standard.
With the HR-V, Honda offers a versatile and everyday car.
Airline is not liable: fall on passenger bridge
An airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger bridge.
The Oberlandesgericht Düsseldorf (Az.: 18 U 124/14) argued that liability could only be expected in the event of dangers typical of aviation.
The complainant had broken a knee disk at the fall.
However, the accident could have happened everywhere - it is a general risk of life, says the court.
The airline did not have to pay the man compensation.
Sickness: When paid by the organizer
Healthy holidaymakers will only get money back after their trip if the cause of the disease can be found in the hotel.
However, this is only the case if more than 10 percent of the guests have shown the same symptoms.
In the case at hand, a family on the second day of their stay in Turkey was severely affected by diarrhea and vomiting.
She spent almost the entire vacation in the room.
Their illness led the holidaymakers back to a defective treatment plant, which was said to have polluted the sea water.
The family felt that the journey had been flawed with it - and complained against the organizer.
In court, the defendants had no success.
Although the treatment plant was in fact defective.
However, the organizer only learned about it shortly before the complainants left.
He had to assume by then that the sea water was in order.
So he did not violate his information obligations, according to the verdict.
No impurities were found in the samples of the water.
The disease of several hotel guests - possibly by contagion with one another - belongs to the general risk of life.
Of 691 guests, only 38 were ill.
De Maizière said that after the acts of violence committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ansbach in July, many people were concerned about further attacks.
The state had to act rationally and determinedly at the same time to respond to terrorist threats.
Of course it is: Our land will not answer the violence of the perpetrators with hatred and division.
We won't be able to give this triumph to the terrorists.
If criminals had to leave the country more quickly, this would increase security and also strengthen the support of the population for refugee policy.
De Maizière aims to implement the proposals by the 2017 Bundestag elections.
He also announced a further strengthening of the security forces, "in the middle four-digit order over several years".
Sympathy advertising for terrorism must again be punished.
Video surveillance is aimed at improving the innovation of arms law in such a way that, in particular, the purchase of weapons on the Internet is made more difficult.
The most recently discussed silence for doctors is to be observed according to the Maizière's words.
However, in dialogue with the medical community he wants to look for solutions to reduce the risk to citizens, he said in view of mental constipation.
In order to combat radicalisation of refugees, the Minister considers that better social assistance is necessary.
Teachers should be better prepared to deal with traumatized people.
To persecute criminals in special areas of the Internet (Darknet) de Maizière plans to use hidden investigators.
SPD CEO Gabriel said: "The SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further increasing security".
It is important that the Minister of the Interior has clearly opposed actionism.
"This was an earlash for the sniper in the CDU/CSU," Gabriel told the radio media group newspapers (Friday).
De Maizière had previously rejected calls from the Union for a Burka ban and for the abolition of double nationality.
A general ban on full wear and tearing is a constitutional problem.
You can't ban everything you refuse, and I refuse to wear the Burka.
You can talk about rules such as road traffic or witnesses in court.
Green Chefin Simone Peter accused the minister that he would like to simulate action and action with ever-new anti-terrorism packages.
Left party chief Bernd Riexinger said: "Fleet sayings and a strengthening of the right of residence will no longer bring security to people in this country".
Better traffic flow on the motorway provider
It stands regularly on the surrounding road - here a picture of November.
But this is to be changed: the right turnoff track is to be extended.
This is a good news for all the drivers who are in traffic on the surrounding road every evening in the traffic traffic traffic traffic by driving over the motorway (A 43).
The state-run road construction will extend the right lane by 700 metres on Tuesday and Wednesday (16-17 August) in the area between Hammer Straße and Weseler Straße.
Carers can then catch directly from Hammer Street to the right.
The great advantage is that traffic is split up at an early stage, which improves the overall outcome on the frequent section of the Bundesstraße 51.
The idea with the extended exit had the CDU fraction in the district representation Münster-West.
The train narrowing on the car is driving the car especially between 17 and 19 o'clock.
Workdays the back store reaches to the bridge over the Albersloher road and sometimes beyond.
The reason is the needle tube on the B 51 just before the exit Weseler Straße.
From here, the traffic is only controlled one-track over the motorway bridge.
The second track had to be rebuilt well in the end of the three-quarters years ago.
The reason: Static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer had the necessary load capacity to take on heavy-duty traffic two-way.
How long this bottleneck and the associated daily traffic jam will last, the competent state-owned business cannot say.
However, it is expected that the bridge will last for years: the bridge will have an official remaining time until the year 2034.
For the extension of the legal mark, the state-owned company has consciously chosen the less traffic time in the school holidays because of the number of disabilities to be expected.
The traffic will be carried by the building site on Tuesdays and on Wednesdays.
Intercultural Travel: Cultural Offers for Schools
The international class of the forest school attended the play "The Invisible House".
The association Nima's and the Young Theatre are now planning a music project.
The association Nima's allows young people with migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster.
The "Class International" of the Waldschule Kinderhaus has visited a presentation of the award-winning piece "The Invisible House" of the Young Theatre Münster.
In the context of the "intercultural journey" initiated by Nima's association, 19 students between the ages of 11 and 15 visited the production in the Small House.
Since the beginning of the year, the association, which has set itself the cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee background, offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster within the framework of this project.
Most of the young people in the class came to Münster between September 2015 and March 2016, including Afghanistan, Iran, Serbia and Syria, and speak little German.
Thanks to choreographies, Scenic pictures and video animations, they have been able to follow the course of action anyway, according to the press release of the Young Theatre Münster.
The Nima's association, founded by Dr. Tannaz Westerberg from Sprafel, and the Young Theatre will work together during the coming season as part of a music theatre project.
From October to December, young people with and without escape and migration backgrounds between 14 and 20 years of age will be given the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the areas of singing, dance, acting and music.
Offers for children and families in the area of theatre play and theatrical language communication are planned.
The project "Intercultural Travel" continues.
In view of the increased numbers of refugees, the association expects to participate in many classes.
Rain instead of Stern Schnappen: Hope for weather improvement
The weather has brought a line through the bill to the Star Schnuppen-Guckern in the south-west of Germany in the night to Friday - but there is still hope.
The night had been poorly suited for observing the celestial spectacle because of clouds and rain, said the chairman of the Observatory Welzheim, Hans-Ulrich Keller, on Friday morning.
Our hope is on the night of Saturday.
The weather is supposed to be good, then we will surely see many star sniffs in the sky.
The star scales are persoids, which with 216,000 kilometers per hour are among the fastest star sniffs.
They have their name because they seem to come from the constellation Perseus, which rises in the northeast.
Restful Night: Tips for Sleep Disorders
In the evening you walk around forever, you are awake for hours at night, you can't think of sleep in the morning far from the alarm clock.
It's all but relaxing.
After all, one is in good company with such problems: According to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel sleep often or permanently as not relaxing.
How do sleep problems or sleep disorders express themselves?
There are several forms of sleep disturbances, and there can be many reasons behind them, emphasizes Hans-Günter Weeß, board member of the German Society for Sleep Research and Sleep Medicine.
What one understands as a whole is but the insomnia, that is, an insomnia disorder.
In particular, many people feel that sleeping through is unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the board of directors in the Deutsche Hausärzteverband with practice in the Lower Saxony Varel.
What's behind sleep disorders?
The causes of sleep disorders are complex.
There may be organic, mental or behavioural factors, but also medications.
Sleep disorder is an expression of another disease.
"Very early awakening is common during depression," Weeß says.
And it may be that different factors are interdependent.
Whoever has a disc incident, for example, can be bad, wakes up every two to three hours, and may start to grumble about everyday problems and concerns, gives Weeß an example.
This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.
When should you get to a doctor with sleep problems?
Whoever does not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and is affected the day should go to the doctor, advises Weeß.
The impairment can look quite different: one is beaten off, tired, insomniad, has difficulty with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical discomforts such as stomach or headache.
In order to relieve sleep disorder, it is important to find out its causes.
Treatment options include behavioral changes, cognitive behaviour therapy or medications - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - are called into question.
There are hardly any left-over sleep physicians in Germany, emphasizes Prof. Ingo Fietze, Head of the interdisciplinary Sleep Medical Center of Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin.
Therefore, in the event of sleep problems, weeß advises you first to contact the doctor.
He can, with investigations, explain whether the problems have a physical cause.
Who should go to the sleeping lab, and what happens?
For example, in the dormitories, physicians advise in snores with respirators, in sick daily tiredness, in sleeping students, or if you do not find the cause of persomnia, Fietze explains.
You really don't have to prepare for the investigation.
You should spend the day normally.
"Please don't sleep for lunch," says Bicycleze.
After the cabling, you go to bed at his normal time.
In addition to the electrodes on the body, you wear a noseglass, a chest strap and a feeler on your finger.
In addition, a camera on the ceiling records the sleeping person.
How can those affected get to grips with the problems?
There are quite a lot of plugs you can put on for a better sleep.
Weeß counts on: Regular bedtimes and uptimes, not too long in bed, not sleeping in the day, not watching TV for sleeping, avoiding alcohol and not looking at the clock at night - then you start to expect immediately, and that is not at all beneficial.
What the jungle camp has to swim with lack of medals
The former German swimmer Markus Deibler has expressed himself on Facebook to the disappointing cut off of the DSV team at Olympis.
In December 2014, he won the gold medal for the first time at the Doha Short Train World Championships and recorded his first world record at the same time.
Now, the former DSV athlete Markus Deibler, via Facebook, has put himself in front of his ex-team colleagues in the criticism.
"In a country where an Olympic winner gets 20,000€ premium and a jungle king 150.000€ should no one wonder about missing medals," the 26-year-old wrote on his Facebook page on Friday night.
The support system in swimming is bad, but the doping controls are very good.
This will not allow us to compete with countries that promote a great deal of work and are not looking at it or even doing it in the field of doping.
"I'm not saying the controls are to be discontinued here," he continued.
If he wanted to launch a comeback, Deibler would have to be reported nine months before his first launch of the National Anti-Doping Agency Germany (NADA).
That is exactly the same with countries.
"Who can't be controlled by independent WADA/FINA controllers for a certain time before WM/OS cannot participate," demands the electionHamburger, who now operates an ice-cream.
Airport: Bands of luggage thieves arrested
Professional Diebe at Düsseldorf Airport
On Thursday, Düsseldorf police officers succeeded in arresting two women and two men aged 50 to 61.
The suspects had committed several pocket and luggage thefts as gangs.
At around 21.30 p.m., civil officials in the airport of Düsseldorf recognized a gang known to the police from past thefts.
The two women and two men had committed several offences since mid-July of this year, and were carried out in a joint, labour and particularly professional manner.
The specialists of the crime commission 34 can prove four acts to the thieves who had come to Germany specifically to commit crimes.
They had gained more than 15,000 euros in total.
Altbauten, a few linden trees, in between a rest of the headstone road: Rigaer Straße in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not work like this at first sight, but the police count it among the "hazardly places" of the city.
Walking along the road from east to west, you pass playgrounds, a freshly painted kindergarten and a biostore.
On the facade of a gray house, someone has sprayed "wrong!"
Compared to a Lidl, which is to be demolished soon, it is already being built: by 2017 a house with high windows and 133 new rental apartments will be created here.
However, article about this "truthy district", as the competent real estate company Friedrichshain calls, is best illustrated with burning cars in the last few weeks.
The reason is the house with number 94: Once it was occupied, now the residents have leases, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and used for events.
Since the beginning of the year, especially the Berlin interior senator Henkel has repeatedly advocated a hard action by the police against the project, calling the area a "no-go zone" for police officers and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.
After the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadderschmiede, had been cleared with 300 police officers on June 22nd, the police patroled official statements for three weeks with 30 to 40 officers and three crew cars on the ground, locked parts of the street and stopped visitors from entering the house with number 94.
Meanwhile, on behalf of the unknown landlords, construction workers renovated the rooms.
On July 13, a Berlin administrative court ruled that the room had been illegal, and one day later police and construction workers withdrew under the jubilation of sympathizers and residents.
On this summer afternoon the street seems peaceful: parents walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others entertain themselves in late.
In the immediate vicinity of the house projects lies a primary school and kindergartens.
Left-wing violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in Kiez since 1999, and Jana*, who is raising three children here, are mainly inspired by the police presence.
With the inhabitants of the house projects, they share the concern about increasing rent and gentrification.
It does not sound like a Kiez, who mostly wanted police protection from vandalizing left.
The tomb, which the Berlin interior senator and the police are opening up between landlords and their neighbors, does not seem to exist that way.
Friedrichshain in the East of Berlin was actually a traditional working-class district, which has a low average income and high risk of poverty even today compared to the rest of the city.
House occupations and the projects that were born from them have long been part of Kiez: in 1990 numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, among them almost the entire Mainz Straße very close to Riga.
While the Mainzer had been cleared under a great police charge in a street battle, many of the projects were legalized in Riga and are still partly inhabited by the people they had occupied 26 years ago.
At the same time, in recent years the district has increasingly become a magnet for tourists and constituencies from all over the world: with them, residents from GDR times and former landlords now share their Kiez.
This is also evident in rents, which have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009.
Many of the new buildings in Riga are attacked as symbols for this development: They are recognized by cast-in discs or newly painted facades that have been applied with paint bags.
No other road was mentioned so often this year along with the words "left autonomous violence".
One reason why not all neighbors see this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: according to statistics, crimes such as physical injury are almost exclusively directed against police.
Most of the crimes are damage to property, which tend to hit the new buildings and newly renovated houses.
For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in a rental house next to the controversial 94, there can be no uncertainty about this.
When it comes to acts of violence, it is reprehensible: the people in the 94 are their neighbours, they certainly have not been.
Even the famous burning cars were no longer available directly in the Rigaer.
For the architect, her street is not a criminal focus, on the contrary: "Here you help each other, live together on the street and get more of each other than elsewhere".
Neugebauer is consciously pulled into Rigaer Straße - and remained.
That is why it was so important for the locals to get back their streets: from the police, from politics and the media, all of whom suddenly claimed the clarity of interpretation over the district in July.
However, in the eyes of residents such as Neugebauer, the road will continue to be taken away from them: through sightless new buildings in former buildings that disperse the old inhabitants.
"These are real estate apartments that are not interesting for many here - they are more likely to live here people who are not so well-trodden," she says.
"I absolutely cannot approve of violence and destruction."
But what should you do if you never listen to anyone?
There is frustration on all sides, including the police and the residents.
Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding for those drawn who are angry with color bombs: The house projects and the left scene belonged to Kiez.
Those who come back should be aware of this - just like someone who moves into a pub district can make bad complaints about noise there.

Urbach: Annika Deuschle is a new refugee officer
Annika Deuschle is the contact person in terms of integration and organizer.
She is also a local social worker.
Annika Deuschle has been the refugee officer for Urbach since July.
The social pedagogue supports the management team around Achim Grockenberger.
She sees herself as a contact person for all stakeholders: refugees, working group refugee assistance, administration, authorities and anyone else involved.
Regine's customer from the working group suggests that the voluntarys are more than grateful that Deuschle is now there, the egg-bearing wool milk sauce, which has above all a problem.
For example, some - less derisory than rather targeting the multitude of areas of responsibility desired - meant that the administration wanted to write out the job.
An administrative specialist was sought with a talent for languages and people, coupled with many years of experience in the field of social work, namely an eggy wool milk sauce.
However, administrative work is not her central area, says Annika Deuschle.
Above all, it is about organization, working with people on site and also behind the scenes as well as networking activities.
The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.
It has limited a 50 % position to three years.
"It was high time," says Regine client that Annika Deuschle supports honorary and main actors.
There are big and small problems, organizational, human and understanding problems.
New containers will soon be on Wasenstraße
A serious problem has been to find homes for those who have been recognized.
The municipalities are responsible for connecting.
They must accommodate refugees in their own or rented living rooms.
The cost of building, renting or renovation of these accommodations must be borne by the municipalities themselves.
The responsibility is shifted from the Landratsamt to Commune and Jobcenter.
Problem: There are free properties, but not every owner wants to offer his apartment.
The search has been very difficult for some time.
De facto finds the administration no private apartments.
It doesn't work until now, you're dependent on private flats, says Deuschle.
Therefore, municipal dwellings must be disciplined, as it is so beautiful.
So new containers will soon be installed on Wasenstraße.
But only with apartments it's not done.
Perspective is the keyword, Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree.
In addition to a firm stay, there are internships, training places, schools, one-Euro jobs and assistance activities for refugees and migrants who need to be found or set up.
"More places would be good," Regine Klant reports.
Many work in the construction yard or help housemasters, doing non-profit work - and that motivated and very neat, as Annika Deuschle reports.
It hopes that work for the community will lead to a positive outside effect.
This is "no employment therapy".
But work doesn't mean just work.
The day needs a solid structure, say Deuschle and customer.
People need to develop a sense of belonging.
So it needs offers such as sport, contacts with locals and especially language courses.
Professional courses are rare.
So here, too, administration and honorary.
It is essential that refugees get the feeling that they are wanted and welcome in Germany.
The long duration of the proceedings is a problem.
You have to explain to the refugees that it is just taking time to bridge the time, for example with language courses.
Whoever develops the feeling at some point, he can't help anyone in Urbach, can't work and be useless, he'll never integrate.
The clear majority is motivated.
However, there are also problems, says the customer honestly, "people who have nothing to do with them". Therefore, Deuschle's and customer's work is always to motivate others.
All of this is a mammoth task.
A difficult question: After the recent incidents, are the two afraid of radicalisation, even in a small community like Urbach?
"No," Regine Klant clearly says, "what some may call naïve." However, a residual risk cannot and will not exclude them.
But the helpers have been sensitized.
These incidents were also the subject of refugees.
They'd be afraid the assassins would call her completely into disrepute.
"They want to show that they have nothing to do with this," says Regine Klant.
Many would like to stay in Urbach.
So, on-site and in the region, the main and honorary needs to look out for activities.
They always have the background that soon a new shock of refugees and migrants could come to Urbach.
Does Germany need a ceiling?
The question of how to answer this question is apprehensive.
Actually, it is unfair to put them on site.
"We haven't arrived in Urbach where we can go," says Annika Deuschle.
No new refugees, that would relax the situation.
Regine Client also makes clear that the Urbachers are already burdened with integrating the peoples of the past in a reasonable way.
These are currently around 100 people, mostly young men.
But when people are in need, they need to be helped, both women agree.
The political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers.
Schorndorf: Breaker searched with helicopter
