What is she supposed to do, the ČSSD? Czech Social Democrats in Prague do not know the place of Voldem, nor the "Condition".
The new councillors of the capital from the ČSSD ranks will obviously have to overcome certain language barriers in order to be able to understand their old-new colleagues from the ODS in the Prague Council and in the city representation at all.
The Aktuálně.cz newspaper has once "knocked off" members of the new council from ČSSD, as it has mastered the notorical Serpent, who has been native in recent years, in which today's coalition partners in Prague were on the row.
The coded vocabulary, introduced by the Prague political elite in the lost era of Mayor Pavel Bém, is a source of some of the most famous actors, situations and causae.
Surprisingly, it became apparent that the new councils do something in the dark with regard to these new terms.
At least that's what they say.
"Who is Voldemort?"
"No idea."
"I am more of a novel in Prague's politics," replied Lukáš Kaucký, the new councillor for culture, to the test of "patent vocabulary".
But also the councillor Karel Březina - a political veteran - responded similarly.
For example, the term "golfloch".
"That's the only expression of those you're presenting to me here that I use back and forth."
"Otherwise, I don't like Serpent much."
From the vocabulary that Aktuálně.cz published in this year's June before the ODS election Congress, the editors picked out six terms, especially those that are not necessarily associated with the Prague Magistrate.
The S & Ds should define the terms "Voldemort", "the largest Prague Gulf hole", "go into the confectionery", "Stiernacks", "Treat of the Capital" and "bleach".
Three Prague councillors agreed to the test, the fourth - Antonín Wenert, the future head of Prague's school system - promised first his participation in the conversation, but then did not even take off the listener.
The fifth councillor, Petr Dolínek, rejected the test from the outset.
"I don't care about these things and how the civil democrats talk to each other, I don't judge it."
"For me, it is important how we understand ourselves in the framework of our programs," he protested.
As already pointed out, Lukáš Kaucký in the headline mentioned above would not have recognized that the influential entrepreneur and friend of the former mayor Bém, Roman Janoušek is speaking.
The term "voldemort" says nothing at all and the only term he correctly recommended in the test was "the largest Prague golf hole".
"This is the Blanka tunnel," says Kaucký, but to safety I added: "But I know that more from the newspaper."
And it's funny to say, "I'm going to have to take a language course."
The "golfhole" is not only specified by Matador Karel Březina, but also by the councillor for environmental issues Lukáš Plachý as a tunnel Blanka.
However, both Social Democrats also know who the term Voldemort stands for, and Lukáš Plachý even suspects where this figure is to be found, and thus also what it means to "go into the conditorial".
"I think that means going into some Prague gastronomy business," Plachý is quite close to the puzzle solution, when you know that this is the seat of Janoušek's company.
However, he agrees with Březina that he has drawn this knowledge out of the paper rather than being his own vocabulary.
According to the test participants, there really does not seem to be a similar populace among the Social Democrats.
"I also asked my colleagues, but obviously there really isn't such a thing with us."
"We also call ourselves by name, back and forth we also use accelerators or nicknames," says the president of Prague's ČSSD Petr Hulínský - called salopp "Hulda" by his party partners.
"In school I was called Bříza (Birke), but I don't know if my colleagues call me that," Karel Březina tells us his nickname.
The newspaper Deník Aktuálně.cz has tried the name and see - it works.
Ratsherr Wenert is kind to the party colleagues of the "Opa" or less friendly of the "old", the representative Miroslav Poche, who drew attention to himself before the elections by making at the party sponsorship, is called by some colleagues "Igráček" (known Czech Lego figure).
Spikes are the only ones that allow the Socialists to speak in the internal party.
Hulínský doesn't like to call him "Hulda", but Deník Aktuálně.cz registered another nickname of Prague's chairman.
His nickname "Doctor of the Rubber Knoop Rights" is supposed to do with the fact that Petr Hulínský acquired his title Doctor in law at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to stop the torture of "Hexen" and put out a brochure
Women who are stamped to witches in Burkina Faso usually have some common social characteristics.
They rather belong to the older generation, they do not find work - for example, for health reasons, they are done and have no children.
If one of these women becomes a witch, she will be strictly isolated so that she cannot become dangerous to the rest of the village.
"Men are quite rarely affected by this fate."
"This also remains the case for young and healthy women, as they help with their work and give birth to children," describes one religious sister, who, in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso, takes care of more than one hundred women who have been expelled from their communities in a specialist home.
The local government now decided to oppose this abnormal "social measure".
And for this reason, he published a brochure that should stop the "Witch Tracking".
But the thing has a hook.
"More than 70 percent of all adults in Burkina Faso cannot read," the newspaper "theStandard" pointed to the dilemma of written education.
But witchcraft is also going on in other African countries.
In Ghana, the neighboring country of Burkina Faso, 27-year-old Ammy Hemmahová was tortured to death by three women and two men - they overcame them with petroleum and simply lit them.
The BBC server also reported this incident.
The perpetrators claimed, however, that the case would have been just a meeting of unhappiness circumstances.
According to their version, oil is flammable, which is used for ritual anointings.
And indeed, after the group tried to "eject out an evil spirit" from the woman.
The isolation of "Hexen" supports people here without regard for their education.
"The standard" quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso: "Fressers of human souls are a danger earlier than today," he said.
While the government in Burkina Faso is at least trying to disintegrate the witch hunt, last year the Gambian President has co-med properly with the President himself.
"President Yahya Jammeh created a monstrous witch hunt after the death of his aunt, as these allegedly had a share in their death and would now try to kill the president even by black magic."
"For this, he called for the help of shamans from nearby Guinea who, accompanied by police officers, soldiers and the President's bodyguard, brutally kidnapped women and men from Zambian villages and brought them to the president's farm in Kanilai," said the organization Amnesty International in her report.
On the farm, the people were forced to drink an absud of plants with a hallucinogenic effect, but it also caused problems with the intestines and kidneys.
Two of the arrested people did not survive the stay on the farm.
Only because of international pressure were the nearly a thousand prisoners released again.
A tenant of Bakala: Although he heats in the oven - still pays higher rent
An elderly man leaves the client centre of the company RPG Byty of the "cool baron" Zdeněk Bakala, the largest private owner of rental apartments in the Czech Republic.
Under the arm a folder with three new leases to three apartments: for his own and the dwellings of his daughters and his son, who is currently in prison.
All three were increased in terms of the so-called "deregulation" just the rent.
Instead of 3500 kroons monthly rent, the son will cover next year for a 2-room apartment with kitchen of the second category 4100 kroons.
"And there is not even a fluent hot water in the apartment and you have to heat in a simple coal stove," he grapples with his finger on the new lease of the son, whose signature he has a power.
"But I've signed something," he explains half-promised and semi-resigned.
BytyOKD.cz, which referred to the new rental conditions as "correct and immoral", advises tenants not to sign the new contracts and wait until December 7th, when they intend to publish instructions on how to do so against such contracts.
But the man's just gonna wink off.
"One says this, the other says that," he makes a dark face.
The Ostrava region thus becomes the major "deregulation laboratory".
After New Year's deregulation is up to most of the rentals in the Czech Republic, whose tenants do not pay for a market rental.
Aktuálně.cz therefore decided to visit this "laboror" personally.
The RPG waiting room in Havířov is one of four in the region of Ostrava and already nine o'clock in the morning full on this Tuesday.
The bodyguards of a security agency stand right next to the door and there's a caller at it.
"Mite 2011", a special button lights on the touchscreen.
Just tapped and the device spits out a numbering set.
Hardly we have broken the number 157" and already squeezing it on the large display on the ceiling of the waiting room.
Half a second later, you're in line.
A little later, an older couple enter the waiting room to ask for the rent, but the alarm in the waiting room apparently does not apply to the new rent.
Most people are here to solve the usual problems - repair applications, insurance matters and the like.
Starting in mid-November, the Kuverts with the new leases will fly the most tenants of the 44,000 apartments of the portfolio of the RPG into the letter boxes.
The RPG Byty proposes in the letter a rental increase of about 15 to 38 percent.
The special switch for the new rents in the client center has been open since 18 November.
"The action runs a little over a week, that is, it's only the beginning," the ladies behind the switch replied after a moment of delay when the "client" appeared as a journalist.
Deregulation and bakalas former miners' apartments are a brilliant topic.
Before the elections, President of Parliament, Lubomír Zaorálek, from Ostrava, had taken up this issue rather loudly, no wonder that today the newspapers are full of it.
"Twenty years I want a new floor from them."
"They couldn't even change toilet glasses," the man mentioned at the outset airs himself.
So far, according to the employees, pensioners are mainly at the switch to convince themselves if they really receive the promised rental discount that RPG promises if they sign the special offer in time.
The benefit of a half discounted February rent is also intended for the other tenants who sign the new lease by 15 December.
Until now, "deregulatory switch" in Havířov is anything but overloaded by demand.
"From yesterday's 360 clients were only about 40 to 50 of the rental in 2011 because of this," the switch officials value.
RPG offers individual rental agreements on their websites, as well as wall panels, where it appears necessary.
However, if the rental parties do not agree on the new rental, they will be determined by an independent court.
"This is not to be a threat, but is to be understood as an information about the only possible and completely legitimate legal approach," explains RPG on its websites.
"There's no one in court here," says one of the employees of RPG Byty and a man on the street in front of the client center gives her at least partially right.
"I have 13,000 (crones) pensions, of which I have 5,000 left for food, where should I take the money for a court dispute," he says.
Then the employees will become insecure.
"Sometimes see."
"Mr Zaorálek tells them about the media that they should not sign and so the people are still waiting," she recalls.
The regulated rent ends most of the Czech Republic to New Year 2011 and RPG Byty states that the increase in rent is an economic necessity.
"The existing amount of rents is not sufficient for the maintenance of the housing fund," argues Pavel Klimeš, the director of the housing portfolio of the RPG Byty company and - especially the neglect of the housing fund criticised by the tenants is, in the opinion of the landlords, the main reason for the rental increase.
While RPG was able to invest four billion in the homes in the years between 2005 and 2010, in the four years 2011 and 2014 it is expected to be 5.2 billion.
On the large-format LCD display on the ceiling opposite the upholstered chairs in the waiting room of Havířov, a few red lighting information appears again and again.
"In 2011, rent increases of 15% and fewer affect 31 200 apartments, i.e. more than 90% of RPG's apartments."
"Always this means a maximum of 7,50 CZK per square metre and month", read on the LCD monitor.
Only with 400 apartments from the portfolio of RPG the rent increases by 38 percent.
"In these cases, it is about increasing extremely low rental prices of 19.66 CZK per square metre," argues RPG.
With 2600 apartments, the rent will remain at the same level next year.
RPG Byty promises that the deregulation does not drive rents in the heights of a jump, but takes place gradually within four and eight years.
What is more - the company imposes a further obligation: All revenue from the rental increase (see diagram) the company wants to get back into the apartments, especially in heat savings - in new windows and in thermal insulation.
But - priority should be given to those people who sign the agreements on the increase in rent.
The architects saw a - the office also belongs to a kindergarten
The Avriopoint office building in Brno is the new headquarters of the company Arch.Design.
But who would expect a mini children's garden here, with everything that belongs to it: colorful walls, creative furniture, a lot of toys and even a mini playground on the outdoor terrace.
This kindergarten has been available to Arch.Design staff since last year.
The projecting and architectural office Arch.Design, whose studios came from a whole series of renowned Brno buildings, calculated from the first designs for the new building Avriopoint with the premises for its company mini children's garden.
In a wise perspective, because most of his 90 employees (inside) are in the Babyboom-Alter and the company is committed to the fact that the projected women return to their workplace as soon as possible.
Together with the possibility to work shortened, the kindergarten is another bonus that Arch.Design has to offer its employees in the concept of its social program.
The structural engineers are so easier to bring their demanding career and child care into a hat.
The Minikindergarten is an original idea of Arch.Design's employees and with the support of the management, they have managed to win funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs for their project.
The Business Minikindergarten is financed by the Operation Programme Human Resources and Employment Policy from the European Social Fund and the Czech Republic's State budget.
Thanks to this funding ( grant of CZK 2, 8 million) the necessary facilities and equipment could be obtained and qualified staff and the holding was provided for 2 years.
The company Arch.Design is obliged to continue running the Minikindergarten 3 further years at its own expense after the use of the funding (2 years).
The preparation of this project took a whole year, with the company Economy Rating providing active assistance in the application process.
Children care for fully qualified staff - a nurse and a kindergarten teacher, the kindergarten can visit children without age restrictions, although most of them are over three years old.
And since this is a mini kindergarten, only 5 children may be present at the same time, but the day changes over several children.
The kindergarten business is flexiblely matched to the needs of parents, the children of all employees have the same rights in terms of the use of kindergarten - without regard to the company hierarchy and its respective position.
Although it is individual education and care, the content of the programme in the Mini Kindergarten is nevertheless comparable to the framework programme of preschool education.
The children play not only here, but above all they are offered excellent lessons - from basic knowledge to preschool education, by the way they learn English.
The classroom is not only equipped with toys and creative games, but also with a computer available to the children.
What's more - the presence of small children in the company contributes to a friendly and positive corporate environment.
The parents can take a look at the children at any time and thus the stress escapes from the late pickup of the children from a distant kindergarten.
The parents therefore use their working time more productively.
No wonder there are natural and loyal employers-employee relationships here too.
Arch.Design has thus joined the Czech companies, who offer significant benefits in the application of new employees, who are family-friendly and encourage their personal marketing through such programs.
A bone house fascinates even after 100 years. Look at the interiors of Gaudi
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric alcove, the stairs like the spine of a dinosaur and the balconies are broken up fish mills.
This is Casa Batlló of Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona.
From the local inhabitants, the house with its organic forms got the nickname "Knochenhaus".
Organic shapes, wild colors, the unusual use of stone, tiles and mosaics, the facades reminiscent of scales and omnipresent soft lines, all these are typical features of Antonio Gaudi's Art Nouveau style.
The facade of the house plays with dreamy lines, tender colors and textures that remind of nature and living beings.
It is only with a closer look that everything is dominated by geometry, rhythm and thought-out order.
In the night the whole facade looks even more plastic, dramatic and the special lighting enhances the shine of the colors.
The same winding lines and intertwined forms also dominate the interior of the house.
Wave-shaped wood copies the window frames, rails, decorative elements of doors, even bellholes and ledges.
The house Batlló in the Eixample district at the lively shopping street Passeig de Grácia No. 43 was built by the reconstruction of a house from 1877, executed by architect Emilio Sala Cortese.
The reconstruction took two years and was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrial Josep Batlló, originally stood on the demolition of the old building and the construction of a completely new building, but he finally agreed to Gaudí's idea of an unusual and also cheaper conversion.
However, the house Casa Batlló did not design Antoni Gaudí alone.
He worked with the architect Josep Maria Jujol.
The decorations for the representative home of the real owner and the use of mosaics on the facade were the result of his idea.
However, numerous other artists and artists also worked on the design of the facade.
The joint work on the drafts for Casa Batlló was the beginning of a fruitful collaboration between Jujola and Gaudí.
Jujol also participated in the construction of Gaudí's house Casa Milá in the Güell Park, in which other works of Antoni Gaudí are located.
Shortly after his completion, the house was given by the local inhabitants of his organic forms because of the nickname "Knochenhaus".
Others, in turn, called it the special window opening mechanism because of the "stairing house".
It is also said that on top of the building is the sword of Saint George, the Patron of Catalonia.
But other figurative elements also symbolize hidden religious motives.
Gaudí designed a central heating system with ventilating channels and typical fireplaces for the house for the time.
A little bit bizarre already mutates her 45-degree slope.
In his work Gaudí consistently ignored all the building regulations at that time and was not allowed to get away from them.
Before the construction began, he received from the city the corresponding building permit, but the information he had provided about the planned reconstruction was so vague that two years later, when the city fathers were finished, they were so horrified by the result that they demanded remedial action.
The councillors also insisted, among other things, on the fact that the construction with its pillars even intervened in the public sidewalk.
On the contrary, however, only fifteen days after the call of the district, Josep Batlló made an application to approve the renting of the two highest floors of the house - and it was promptly granted to him.
The owner himself moved into the lower floors.
On the second floor of the gallery there was a social salon, on the third floor there were the bedrooms and private rooms of the apartment.
The ground floor was leased to a jewelry store.
The entire six-storey building runs through a staircase up to the roof terrace.
Due to the basic elements of the conversion all right angles and straight lines were removed and replaced by curved and curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with a modern concept for the mutual connection of rooms.
The social part can be connected completely by opening the salon doors and thus a larger society could chat comfortably without having to give up a certain intimacy in more confidential conversations.
The house received a rather unusual roof and two more floors, apart from a new facade, by Gaudí's reconstruction.
It is also impressive Gaudí's play with the light as well as the blue and white glazed tiles with which the courtyard is dressed and the light courts.
The play of these two colours gives a high level of light to all floors of the house.
In doing so, he simply made use of the principle that white reflects the light better than dark colors that absorb sunlight on the contrary.
House Casa Batlló, which was included in the Unesco World Heritage List in 2005, can visit anyone today.
On the first floor the most spacious and magnificent apartment is made available to the public.
The landlords decided not to take this step until the year and this on the occasion of the 150th birthday of the famous Creator.
When it was found that this was a quite inclusive business, the visits were kept, yes, they were extended to other common and the attic rooms, including the roof terrace.
However, the price to visit the building monument is not a cardboard bar, it is 16.50 Euro, students, pensioners, groups and owners of tourist cards get 20 percent discount.
This amount exceeds the admission prices to other Gaudí buildings in the city.
If you want to get to know the real atmosphere of the house with its dragon towers, try to make friends with one of the householders and visit him at home.
The right mattress and the right bed rust? Women have different wishes than men
Not the best bed frame, but the quality of the floor space - so mattress and rust make the good bed.
However, they need to complement themselves harmoniously in order to meet the needs of the specific user.
Many things play a role in the selection - the weight, size, state of health and, last but not least, the sex of the sleeper.
The interior in which mattress and rust have to be subordinated is also equally important.
Typical example?
In a weekend house where there is no regular heating, latex mattresses are not well suited, as they need much longer to be "hot".
In addition, they are much heavier than usual polyurethane mattresses.
And - they should be turned over on a regular basis.
Because if they do not have enough venting canals in the core and are still on a solid plate, moisture is advocating: It is therefore not excluded that it is formed under its mold.
Of course, the choice also plays a role in what you are used to.
Whoever was a long time abroad, where very high mattresses with soft layer are common, will be able to get used to a low mattress with a hard surface.
"If all the ice hockey players who came back from the NHL have complained to me that they can't sleep right here anymore."
"For their hidden shoulders, heels and hips they simply need a soft layer of visco foam (memory foam - a mold memory polymer).
"I recommend this among other things also sugar-induced people who suffer from a nervous disorder so that they can receive the "information" from the joints and the skin badly," explains Sylva Hadamcziková, who specializes in upholstery furniture.
That's why I had many hockey players years ago, but also other customers got these mattresses with Visco foam (Memory foam).
"Today this is no longer a problem, as such mattresses offer, among others, the manufacturer Tempur, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico."
And you don't necessarily have to be a famous hockey player to appreciate the benefits of the visco foam.
This "wonder" actually works quite simply.
The foam optimises its hardness and shape according to the absorbed heat, in other words, it lubricates itself regularly on the warm body.
Nowhere does it press, at night you don't walk around like after a heavy fight.
You just sleep much better.
The viscoelastic foam also provides protection against decubitus (wonder fire).
When choosing the mattress size, you should still add the length of the soles, i.e. about 21 to 34 cm.
Man like woman who is 180 cm tall needs a bed of 210 to 220 cm.
Each of the slings should be at least 90 cm wide, together with 180 cm.
For single beds, for example, are 120 to 140 cm.
The comfort half and also for any visitors.
Otherwise, the following rule applies to the ideal bed width: "If you are lying on your back, you should still have enough space for the slightly angled arms," advises Mr. Helena Prokopová, the headmaster of the upholstery and room equipment, who has been dedicated to the problem of healthy sleep and ergonomics of furniture for many years and also presents this topic at technical schools.
With a double bed, each one needs its own rust and mattress, but watch out for the purchase so that the mattresses are equally high.
Otherwise there is nothing left but to assemble the rust at different heights and this is not possible with every bed frame.
foam mattresses should be at least 14 cm high, mattresses with spring skeleton 15 cm, of which at least three centimeters should fall to the shape layer and the fine cushion.
"You can't feel the feathers by hand or by putting them down," warns Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a special rust type.
Full-padded beds with mattresses and underlay as grown Siamzwillings have nothing to look for in the bedroom.
These mattresses can't be ventilated and you can't wash the cover what's going on and what's going on today.
And as you lose between 0.2 and 0.75 l of welding in a single night, it is clear that after five to seven years the mattress will slowly become a huge (and stuffed sieve).
This is also why experts reject advertising slogans, which in mattresses promise a lifetime of up to 25 years, even life-long warranty.
Every thing has her When and But.
And therefore, a practical advice from the dealers: in mattresses of 120 or 140 cm wide, one should not shy off the hygiene of washable, pullable containers, yet it is recommended to use a mattress shoe that can easily be removed and washed.
Even if today's mattress covers are usually made with circular zip so that after opening you get two halves (immens important for washing and washing machine size!), manipulation with larger mattresses, especially performed alone, often like the uneven struggle between David and Goliath.
Do they have a fixed plate in bed instead of a rust?
Get out!
Or at most for a bed for unloved guests and for a single night.
Also, they should prefer to use the plate with ventilation holes (if not already in it) and mattresses with spring skeleton and 15 cm minimum height with so-called pocket spring cores and fine pads.
Polyurethane mattresses do not belong to such a material.
Latex or sandwich mattresses (i.e. combinations of latex and coconut) are suitable for non-adjustable lattices with 14 to 18 spring bars (lats) while always paying rusts with a larger number of lattices, i.e. from 28 and more spring boards, with Lordosen support in the lumbar vertebrae area and the possibility to regulate the lattice hardness.
On adjustable lamella rusts no mattresses with feather skeletons belong, as they do not react to the ergonomic adjustment.
In addition to adjusting the stitch of the spring bars, special flexible shoulder modules are also offered.
This is about a special fastening of the spring bars, which allows you to press the spring boards or even to rotate them so that they allow for the punctual inserting of the shoulder of the sling.
It's an important thing for men with wide shoulders.
There are even mattresses manufacturers who have started using soft zones for the shoulder range for "herre mattresses".
Ladies are also thought of - these soft zones are given to them in the hip area.
For the most demanding customers, point elastic wing spring systems (lattoflex) or ruste with point elastic contact pads with so-called multitortion suspension are determined.
The pressure is distributed to several points, thereby reducing the voltage.
But - if you use a bad (too big and full) pillow to get the right mattress and rust, most of the benefits are lost again.
Here too a rule of thumb: the pillow should support the head, its tips should only reach up to the shoulders so that the shoulder muscles can relax.
Ideally, therefore, a 50 x 60 cm cushion appears, such as the Scandinavians.
In the side position, the pillow (together with the shoulder relief zone in the rust or soft zone in the mattress) should balance the shoulder height.
Our modern mattresses have something in common with the former straw bags filled with hay.
Modern manufacturers use more and more natural materials or at least their additions.
The new magic word "Bio" also means mattresses.
Instead of petroleum raw materials, it is used to produce polyurethane foams of increasingly natural oils - for example, rizinus and soy oil.
Soya is probably used by all known manufacturers.
"Bio is the name of mattresses, which are their core materials of pure natural origin," explains Petr Vašíček from Tropico Plus.
However, natural materials are also used in the production of mattress covers - one of the first was Aloe Vera.
You can also enjoy microcapsules that spread fresh forest or lavender in your sleep.
Here, too, you make a difference between man and woman.
While men use a "cooling" plant extract from birch leaves so that the mattress cover can absorb the heat and cool the body, the references for women have "heating" effect.
Extracts from red paprika shots stimulate blood circulation, so the weaker sex becomes warm when sleeping.
And today's favourites?
Mattresses made of cold foam (he has larger pores with destroyed cell structure and is therefore more breathable than commercial polyurethane and also much more flexible).
The combination of the different stiffness (hardness) of cold foams and visco foams creates multi-zone mattresses, which know exactly where the head, hips and heel are located.
For a high-quality mattress, however, you have 7000 crowns and more to catch.
However, health mattresses are usually burdened with lower VAT, as they are considered as medical aids.
Gumotex was the first Czech company to benefit from this advantage.
One sees saving on the mattress and rust is not so easy.
Occasionally, there are special offers from manufacturers and dealers who offer two mattresses at the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex brand offers the Duofreeze mattress with a visco foam in relation Memory for 11.990 CZK.
The second is free of charge.
It was the material tempur that introduced the era of viscoelastic foams with open cell structure and high density at almost cosmic pace.
No wonder they were developed for NASA, because the astronauts are exposed to enormous overloads during the start-ups.
Tempur becomes soft in the heat, in the cool environment it becomes solid.
So it adapts perfectly to the human body and distributes the body pressure in an optimal way.
It is therefore not only ideal for preventing pressure from burning, but in general increases sleep comfort.
Viscoelastic foams are used not only for mattresses, but also for other health products, such as special foot pads, which are intended to facilitate the legs and the vessels.
Local manufacturers, for example, use foams Eucatherm C, twinsaver or similar products.
More and more parents want human surveillance devices to have the kids under control
The fear of their own children grows, and so more and more parents are considering monitoring them via GPS.
The system, which was originally invented to fend for cars, can also include people, which would also be helpful in such cases, as was recently the case when nine-year-old Anička Janatková disappeared.
The device is currently about the size of a cigarette box, but soon it will not be larger than a watch.
Many people have put the case of the disappeared Anička in fear and terror, so they look forward to ways and ways to better protect their children.
Also for the price of impairment of their privacy.
"We are trying to tell everyone that this is not about herum pioneers, but about an effective means of reducing the likelihood of tragedy," says Petr Pilin from Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of GPS locating devices on the Czech market.
"I admit that it can be misused in individual cases, for example if you put it in someone's pocket without knowing it, but we had no such case yet."
"Most customers really buy it for security reasons," says Pilin.
In his opinion, however, the child should always know what purpose the "chachtel" serves and how to use it in an emergency.
However, the child psychologist Dana Bočková points out that if a child does not like to wear such a thing, he simply gets rid of it.
"Even very small children show great creativity when it comes to deliberately losing certain things if they don't want to be controlled."
"At first, the mobile phones aroused great expectations at the parents, but they can be switched off as easily as these new surveillance devices," says Ms. Bočková.
In your opinion, it is also controversial whether such an institution actually helps in case of an attack.
"In the case of planned abductions, the Kidnapper virtually always controls whether the child has any electronics with which it could be located."
"Today it's the cell phone."
"If such surveillance devices were to be used more widely, they would also look for them, as their sale would surely be accompanied by massive advertising."
"In these cases, police criminals are always one step ahead," says the psychologist.
However, it acknowledges that similar devices can be quite helpful in a sudden attack by a pedophile.
According to the company RC Monitoring, Roberta Čech, which offers location services both for automobiles and for persons, can also help the existence of such a device if it is destroyed immediately after the attack.
"The device can be adjusted in such a way that it reports the respective position in certain intervals."
"Even if it would be destroyed immediately, at least the last position of the data subject is available."
"In the case of more expensive devices, an angle meter is integrated, which means that if you fall down and stay motionless, the device immediately sends a warning indicating the position," says Mr. Čech.
In his opinion, similar services could also perform intelligent mobile phones with navigation, you just need to play a special software.
The problem of current locating equipment is that it is either about tools in matches, the trailers resemble, or about smaller mobile phones.
There's always such a danger of losing it.
According to Mr. Pilin of the Macro Weil, it is therefore tested in the present-day devices that look like normal digital watches.
"This has the advantage that the possible attacker does not have to realize at all that it is a surveillance or location device.
"Or he only notices after some time what the police give a time gap," he adds.
No matter what direction the development goes - to bracelets or trailers, the same technology is always used, as in the location of the vehicle.
So the combination of location function with the help of the GPS system (just as with the Navi in the car) and the function of a mobile phone that reports the current position.
The army has so many ignition cords that one could transform whole Czechia but only keep two years
The Czech army has bought 445 kilometers of ignition cords, lit with blasts.
In the year before, the Ministry of Defense had already delivered 224 kilometers of Zündschnur to the army camps.
It is already reassuring to know that the armed forces have provided for 225 years.
The problem is only the durability of the ignition cord - two but no more than four years.
The army bought the ignition cord from the stock company STV Group, a.s. for lavish 40 million crowns.
In its reasoning for the purchase of this huge quantity of ignition cord, the General Staff MF DNES replied that the soldiers would consume the 60 kilometers of Zündschnur every year.
According to army pyrotechnic researchers, MF DNES said it was clear from this statement that the whole army would have to complete an extremely intensive pyrotechnic training every year - from all the generals and officers of the Army Command, to the secretaries and cleaning women.
Minister of Defense Alexandr Vondra and army general Vlastimil Picek.
Only in this way could the considerable annual consumption of sixty kilometres of ignition cords be justified in half.
By the way, this length corresponds to 25 000 detonations.
But this too would be the case for more than ten years.
But if the old rule of experts still applies that, to train each new professional soldiers, two meters of Zündschnur, then the army has created a soothing stock for the already mentioned 225 years - even from the point of view of the increased needs of pioneer and special units.
In this context, soldiers of the Quick Use Brigade have recently complained to the Minister of Defense Vondra that they would have almost no more cartridges for handguns, so that shooting of the missing funds is severely restricted.
Not to mention the lack of underwear.
"I also don't think why they buy such amounts of ignition cords from us."
But that's finally their decision, they'll already know what they need."
"For us, the army is a good customer, whom we as dealers would like to meet most," says STV Group sales manager Jan Děcký.
Jan Pejšek, spokesperson of the Ministry of Defense, founded the purchase of hundreds of kilometres of Zündschnur, so that the army would have covered itself with this "munition" for at least ten years.
However, Jan Děcký of the STV Group speaks of only a four-year term of service of the Zündschnüre and police and army pyrotechnics only of two years.
"If the four years mentioned above are perfect, they are probably possible," one of them admits, but he wants to remain unnamed so as not to be accused of criticism of the army as a soldier.
After the period of use, any ammunition must be thoroughly tested whether it is still reliable and not endangering the life of the soldiers.
But these tests are not for nothing, they cost more money.
Another argument of the Ministry of Defense is the quantity discount for the 445 kilometers of Zündschnur.
"They cost us sixty percent less than the last year's delivery of 244 kilometres," told Spokesman Pejšek about the position of the buyers of the Ministry of Defense.
Just for comparison: The annual consumption of pyrotechnics from the police, liquidating the ammunition from World War II or the Soviet Brother Army, has hardly exceeded 1,500 metres for some years.
And the police always order only those amounts of this ammo that they can consume before the end of their life.
Even because of the safety of the pyrotechnics, it is also possible to buy more flexible and therefore also reliable ignition cords.
The Ministry of Defense already has huge problems in the liquidation of tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the times of the Warsaw Treaty, when the two hundred thousand-member Czechoslovakian People's Army prepared for its campaign to the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnicians who spoke to MF DNES, the Czech armed forces expect the same problem in a few years in the liquidation of hundreds of kilometres of old ignition cords, which they have bought so "finely" today.
Until today, I have been able to find the contacts I have won thanks to the competition
Lukáš Pytloun helped in selling the franchise of his hotel in the competition "Little Entrepreneurs of the Year".
The winner of the last year of the competition "Little Entrepreneur of the Year" was Lukáš Pytloun from Liberec.
The story of his success seems like a film scene.
Lukáš Pytloun was happy to travel.
Only abroad did he realize that Liberec lacks good accommodation at reasonable prices.
From the savings of his holidays abroad and with the help of a bank loan, he created a building house with five apartments.
Considering that he was then a college student in the sixth semester, this was certainly a courageous undertaking.
"The price-quality ratio at that time upset me and so I tried to do something about it," says Lukáš Pytloun.
The first reconstructed apartment he rented to foreign workers.
He immediately invested the entire profit back in the house, which he then converted step by step to the pension with 54 beds.
Since then, he has been able to open four pensions, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds of all types of accommodation in Liberec.
The most comfortable of them was until recently the four-star hotel "Pytloun Design Hotel".
This year another first-class hotel was added.
"We have already signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tisé, which we have sold our franchise concept and other interested parties to the franchise of the Pytloun hotels have already reported," says the entrepreneur number one of last year.
"A large share of this licence sale for the sale of hotels had just won the competition "Entrepreneur of the Year", added Mr. Pytloun with recognition.
The victory has brought him greater fame, even popularity in Liberec and the surrounding area.
"People recognized me on the street, often they even congratulated me on it, and I have to say that did really well," he remembers.
I really recommend all those who want to create something to participate in this competition.
You don't need to win at the same time, every visibility is good.
He says that he continues to benefit from the contacts and acquaintances to which otherwise it would not have come at all.
"I have regular business relationships with some of the people I have made thanks to the competition."
In his opinion, the fame associated with the success is also a bit on every one of his employees.
And there he has the seventy.
"I note with them greater loyalty and pride that they are part of something that is granted general recognition."
I don't really see this as just personal success, no, that's the result of the good work of all of us."
"My name is just a little in the foreground," says Lukáš Pytloun modestly.
I wish my successors a quieter year when we had it in Farmet
The victory euphoria was quickly replaced by the consequences of the crisis.
Thanks to its determination, Farmet has the worst behind itself.
The award for the first position of the competition Vodafone company of the year last year was awarded by Karel Žřárský, the company owner of Farmet.
At the time, the jury appreciated the efforts he made to stamp out of small toolmaking in Česká Skalice a company out of the ground that makes hundreds of millions of sales.
"I can say that this appreciation not only encouraged myself, but also all my employees and strengthened our self-confidence in the fight with the competition," says the previous year's winner.
At the beginning of the company history of Farmet was the effort to do something useful.
And when the state offered his father Karel Žřárský as compensation for the property seized by the Communists a small workshop to lease, he did not hesitate for long, let his career in the company in which he had been employed until then, swerved and founded a company of his father's own with a few comrades for the production of plastic tubs.
A short time later, they began to focus on vegetable oil presses.
Within 18 years they have risen to the largest manufacturer of automatic presses throughout Central Europe.
But only through the success in the mentioned competition and its medialization did it also come into the awareness of non-speciality.
"Not only that our customers now perceive the Farmet brand much more intensively, our foreign partners also began to work together with a company that achieved the greatest possible success in their country to give greater value," says Karel Žřárský.
The last year, however, was not only in the sign of victory euphoria at Farmet.
The assessment was based on the economic results of the company in 2008 and part of 2009.
And just 2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of tool building products.
The crisis at that time, which was even less shaking the citizens, was reaching its peak, and many companies were forced to stop their investment projects and to restrict the purchase of new facilities and technologies.
"We couldn't escape this situation either."
"The sales decreased by 40 per cent, we had to limit production and even seize redundancies," explains Karel Žőárský
A viable company must sometimes also take such unpopular measures.
However, it succeeded in getting to grips with the situation and keeping the company in black figures, even with lower profits than before the crisis.
In one case, the company was not willing to demarcate - investment in research and development.
"From the grant we built a research and training centre, we strengthened our presentation at international trade fairs, and acquired main prizes at domestic exhibitions," says Žőárský.
Everything shows that we have overcome the crisis.
The sales increase again and with them also the number of new employees.
"I wish my new winner much joy in winning - but in a calmer atmosphere", Karel Žőárský has done.
A survey of views, which deals with unreasonable rules
The survey on "Absurdity of the Year" is a fourth part of the entrepreneurial competition.
Some senseless regulations have succeeded in getting out of the world.
To the dubious winner of the next year's poll "Absurdity of the Year", the obligation to create documents on authorities available on-line.
Thus, more than a third of not quite four thousand entrepreneurs decided.
For example, the Social Security Office requested a paper extract from the Commercial Register, even if the official could have called it through two clicks.
Thanks to the survey, this is changing now.
"In the future, the Czech Social Security Administration will not require any extracts from the Commercial Register for the controls of social security payers," said ČSSZ Jana Buraňová spokesperson.
The purpose and purpose of the poll "Absurdity of the Year" is to take all the regulations and regulations into account, which entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic have to comply with, and to remove the senseless.
This year, for the fourth time already, this is part of an entrepreneurial competition organised by the Swiss Economic News (HN) and enjoyed by the public a growing popularity.
If last year the three thousand people participated in the vote, it was already four thousand this year.
No wonder, for there are still a lot of legal obligations that only and alone serve to hinder business activity.
"As regards, for example, the number of income tax forms, we take a leading position in the world," says Karel Havlíček of the association of small and medium-sized enterprises and tradesmen of the Czech Republic.
The simplification of entrepreneurial activity has been the declared objective of all governments in recent years.
However, the situation in the Czech Republic has hardly improved compared to the world.
According to World Bank data, the Czech Republic takes 74th place in terms of corporate conditions, compared to the previous year, with a lower ranking of eight.
The competition absurdity of the year was first proclaimed in the year and is based on the same scenario each year.
Anyone can report administrative and bureaucratic nonsense from April until the closing of the competition in late September.
The web address is www.firmoku.cz. After that, the organiser of the competition selects seven candidates for the "anti-price" and lets the public vote on the Web pages www.firmoku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
It wins the absurdity that most voices get.
More than one hundred, 105 senseless regulations and orders have already been notified to this year's poll.
The tips are not only from entrepreneurs, but also from professional associations and journalists.
Among the nominated "Finalists" of the competition are for example also provisions that maintenance vehicles have to pay for highways and highways tolls or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets have to notify every two years.
The list of this year's "seven" is published on the sides of the competition.
The call for the competition at the beginning of November at the Prague Wenceslasplatz is part of a happening, in which individuals of political and public life regularly participate.
This year, for example, was Eva Svobodová, the director of the Association of Small or Medium-sized Enterprises and Commercials of the Czech Republic, as well as Petr Kužel, the President of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic at the height of the competition with of the party.
"Where the state throws the entrepreneurs a bottle between the legs, there can be no real economic upturn, so it is my goal to remove at least thirty paragraphs each year that make it unnecessary for entrepreneurs to make their businesses difficult today," said Martin Kocourek, the Minister for Industry and Trade.
The efforts to create senseless orders from the world have an effect.
In 2007, the people most disturbed the entrepreneurs' obligation to report three days in advance to the commercial office in their permanent establishment, in advance, to want to go to an exhibition booth or Kirmes.
This duty was abolished by a novel of the Commercial Act.
The obligation to have the second largest number of votes in 2007 - the duty to report up to 30 days to the employment office of employees - was abolished by the law on them so-called "Green Card".
And - all good things are three:
As regards the absurdity of 2009, the regulation imposed by physiotherapists was chosen to have a mirror, refrigerator and two personal scales in the speech room.
This regulation has been reduced by the Ministry of Health this year, and the requirement for refrigerators has been abandoned.
A new category honors socially responsible companies
Evaluation criteria are humanitarian, environmental, educational or sport projects
A novelty in this year's fifth year of the competition of the Wirtschaftszeitung (HN) is the category "Responsible Company of the Year 2010".
The basic idea of this competition is to promote reasonable and fair enterprises.
"We want to support such companies that are aware of the consequences of their business on the environment and support socially responsible initiatives," says Patrik Bartholdy, the regional manager of the mobile company Vodafon, who is the operator and guarantee of this competition, as well as the competition "rebell of the year".
For this year's first year of this special subcategory of the main competition Vodafon Company of the year, companies reported themselves, for which success is not the only long-term goal.
The story of each of them is extremely inspiring and bouts enough material for an independent article.
Although they differ diametrically with regard to the subject matter of their activity, their efforts nevertheless have a common denominator - support and consideration.
This concerns people with disabilities, for example, because of personal problems or the health of their own employees.
Among the fourteen finalists from all over the Czech Republic, for example, the Prague software company Et Netera also appeared, which promotes the creation of non-formal sports teams among their employees, who then participate in numerous tournaments in various sports.
Another example of a responsible company from the Pardubice region is the company Isolite-Bravo, which has been the main sponsor of a foundation fund for disabled children for seventeen years.
A paper factory from Poděbrady is also exemplaryly responsible for its healthly disabled workers, who make up 70 percent of their workforce, for which she was honoured by the title "Responsible Company of the Mittelboehmen Region", and in the competition Vodafone of the year she took third place in the context of this region.
In the Olomouc region, the accounting company MiRyz Soft won, among other things, a flowing and also reduced working time to an average of 35 hours a week, without a proportionate wage reduction.
During the title ceremony, the jury also honored the fact that the company buys mainly from Czech manufacturers, supports citizens' initiatives in its area and works according to environmentally friendly principles.
"We strive to recycled as much as possible to minimise the consequences of our entrepreneurial activities and administration for the environment as possible," explains her CEO, Miluše Ryznarová.
Enlogit, a responsible IT company from the region of Ústí nad Labem, in turn is located at the health of its employees and therefore has acquired them to all notebooks ergonomic seats and keyboards, as well as to promote home work for its employees and to use catering services offered by a local sheltered workshop.
"In addition, we support the foundation "People in need", which provides concrete assistance to the local Roma community," says Ondřej Suchý, the company's representative.
Last but not least, the activity of the cleaning company "Praní a čištění" from the Karlsbad region is worth mentioning, which contributes to the pension insurance of its employees in the form of extra bonuses.
"We provide our employees with contributions to the food, to the working path, to increase their qualification and to the holiday," says Josef Strapáč of the construction company Czasch from Bruntál, the winner in the Moravian-Silesian region.
To the category of responsible company of the year, all district finalists of the competition Vodafon Company of the year were automatically registered, answering the questions of the questionnaire submitted to the application and sending it to the organizer by 15 August at the latest.
False or incompletely filled answers in the questionnaire were excluded from the evaluation by the organizer.
"If the representatives of the competing companies left the questions unanswered, they were excluded from the competition "Responsible Company of the Year", but in the main competition Vodafone of the year they were not disqualified."
"A separate registration only for this competition is not possible, as it is just a subcategory of the main competition company of the year," explains Karel Goldman from the organizing agency Bison & Rose.
Pilsner Soil Fund - Police arrests in public tender
In the building of the Soil Fund in Pilsen, the anti-corruption police have been taking arrests in recent days.
The local media entrepreneur and real estate dealer Luboš G. was removed from the detectives in handcuffs.
He had allegedly tried to manipulate a public competition that was currently taking place in order to resolve restitution claims in such a way that the land offered in the competition belonged to a specific interested party.
This one is said to have paid Luboš G. half a million for that.
"At this point, I can only confirm that the police are persecuting a person because of the crime of fraud in a public competition," said Antonie Zelená, chief of the Pilsner prosecutorship of the newspaper "Právo", she could not provide further details with regard to the ongoing investigations.
24 hours later, the 46-year-old entrepreneur was released from the police again.
The way in which he could manipulate public competition can only be speculated in the light of sparse official information.
The Spokesperson of the Lubomír Černá Soil Fund raised the question of Právo that the police had actually taken arrests in the Pilsner side of the Soil Fund and this during a public competition.
"It was about a client and not about one of our employees," she concreteized.
According to the public competition, Ms Černá had the correct designation "Requirement for the supply of claims for the transfer of land under the Land Act" and would take place in cases where several applicants show interest in the land offered.
"These persons shall, in the context of the request, offer a higher value of their restitution claims to be settled by means of the transfer, than the declared land value."
"According to the claims offered, the order of the potential acquirers is determined, and then the Land Fund transfers the property to the person with the highest offer," explains the speaker of the Fund.
Luboš G. obviously had information available to anyone who had applied for the request and since he himself was a legitimate person, as he had bought a number of restitution claims, he offered a land interest that he withdraw from the competition.
Obviously against a fat pick-up.
This would also be a sufficient explanation of why he had such a large amount of money in his arrest.
Luboš G. had already had too good contacts with the Pilsner Soil Fund in the past.
He also played a role in the Causa of the former head of the Soil Fund Václav Sankota, which was prosecuted by criminal law because he spent land on replacement refunds, which had already been chosen as site decisions for construction projects.
At that time, Luboš G. of the Land Fund also acquired land intended for the construction of public roads, more precisely, at the site where the construction of the access power station was planned for the Borské Pole commercial area.
Later, he exchanged this very cheaply with the magistrate against a house directly in the historic center of the city, which exceeded the value of the plots far.
At the time, the town hall had to give a heavy heart to small bees, so as not to endanger the construction project by blocking the plots.
The housing costs of households rise by a few hundred monthly
As of January, households will have to expect not only higher costs for all types of energy, but also higher water and wastewater charges, and for district heating and some places also rents.
Families will have to pull several hundred crowns out of the wallet each month from January onwards.
Electricity becomes more expensive by 4.6 percent, gas by 2 percent and more, in some cities you will have to pay up to a tenth more for water supplies and some places also consume district heating supplies.
Only the electricity cost the housing households a few hundred crowns more each year.
The high electricity prices were reduced by all the main suppliers, so debt is the significant promotion of electricity generation from renewable sources, especially from photovoltaic installations.
Although gas is only slightly more expensive, this is exactly when people have to heat the most and have the highest consumption.
So here too, there are several hundred crowns to be expected more per year.
While electricity and gas are becoming more expensive throughout the Czech Republic, prices for district heating vary from city to city.
In particular, larger places plan price increases.
For example, from January on, households in Pardubice and Hradec Králové will have to pay up to 50 crowns more for district heating, more than 1000 crowns a year pay families in Liberec.
The inhabitants of Prague, in turn, threaten 9 percent higher water and wastewater charges, and this in case the city increases the infrastructure rent.
If the rent doesn't change, it's only 6.8 percent.
However, the price in Prague is still one of the lowest compared to the whole of the Czech Republic.
In the North Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and wastewater charges are expected to rise by 7.4 percent.
Large rental price increases are expected, for example, in 140,000 rental apartments where, from January, the so-called rental regulation will not apply.
For example, the housing company CPI Byty, which has 2500 apartments in Ústí nad Labem, plans to increase the rents by a hundred percent from January onwards.
If you do not agree to this rental increase, the company wants legal interests.
The regulated rents, which are still paid in almost 300,000 homes today, are expected to increase by more than 10 percent next year.
Czech children are drinking with Fernet and Rum Bier is out - it just seems too slow
Fernet, Rum and Vodka, invariably also a good whisky, which you stole from the house bar.
These are the drinks, after whose consumption Czech teenagers must be most frequently treated under fifteen.
No exception are children who have to sleep in the hospital repeatedly.
This is evident from the experience of doctors confronted with similar cases in the admission of the children's departments of clinics.
"Bier or wine are completely out of fashion, because it just takes too long to get drunk."
"Today's trend is clearly a tough alcohol," said Právo Luděk Pelikán, head doctor of the Children's Department in the Central Bohemian Clinic Hořovice.
"Whisky, if he succeeds in turning a bottle out of the house bar, and if not, at least fernet or vodka.
"Wodka has the advantage of mixing it with Juice, he doesn't smell so strong," explains the chief doctor.
The spokesman of the Faculty Hospital Motol Eva Jurinová gives him the right.
"It's about Fernet or Rum."
"This is the present alcohol trend, especially at primary schools."
"It was also about Slibowitz, who was taken from home," Ms. Yinová said.
According to Chief Doctor Pelicán, thirteen or fourteen-year-old drinkers in hospital admission have long been no exception.
Before the hospital in Hořovice, which he has been working on since this year, he worked for ten years in the Paediatric Department of the Motol Hospital, where the rescue cars delivered drunken students from close and distance.
"A girl had to be hospitalized four times."
"Your career began at the age of 12 when she was first given 3.5 promille alcohol in the blood and also in combination with "extase", the doctor described a particularly severe case.
"She was at the exhibition site in Holešovice at some dance party."
"The interesting thing was that her mother didn't seem strange at all, that her daughter didn't come home for 48 hours," the chief doctor wondered.
Especially the lack of interest of parents or their incredible tolerance when invoking with their own offspring is regarded as one of the main causes of the growing alcoholism of children.
According to experts, there is no real dependence on children in the real sense of the word.
"By alcoholism, long-standing chronic dependence on alcohol and all related phenomena is to be understood, and that is not the case with these children."
In those who enjoy alcohol repeatedly, a negative family-social background is usually characteristic," explains chief doctor Pelikán.
According to Ms. Jurinova, the spokesman of the Motol Hospital, about forty drunk children were sent to the local department of child and youth medicine until mid-November.
However, only cases of severe alcohol poisoning, which required hospital stays, are included in the statistics.
Drinked children, who are brought home after outpatient treatment by the parents or, where appropriate, by the police, are not registered.
In addition to the cases where children only drink such a bottle of schnapps in the school bench, there are three seasonal amplitudes, which are one hundred percent abandoned: Walpurgisnacht, New Year's Eve and the end of the school year.
"The latter for two reasons - either because of grief because of bad testimony or because of joy on vacations."
"On Walpurgisnacht I have experienced seven drunken children at once in the recording," says Dr. Pelikán.
Paradoxically, a drunk child who spends the night under medical supervision is better off than a child who only has to fight with an unpleasant hangover the next day.
The headache in the morning after, which comes from dehydration and glucose deficiency, can be driven out in the hospital with a fluid infusion of glucose and nutrients missing from the organism.
"They are clearly better off, because after the "beautiful" experience in the evening, they wake up with good mood, without hurting somewhere."
"They're just a little confused about where they are," says Dr. Pelikán, killing the patient at least the good mood by counting on them the costs they will cost the treatment.
Because the transport with the rescue car and the night in an acute bed are good and happy to get to a few thousand crowns.
"And again and again, I used this as a means of education, if I directly predicted to the children at the visit, what their drunkenness cost, and that it may well happen that they have to work over the whole holiday to earn the money for a single such fete," added Dr. Pelikán.
In his opinion, however, the health insurance companies do not apply for the right to demand the parents' costs necessary for the recovery of the drunk children.
Two L-159 training aircraft in foreign hand for the first time - in Spain
Two light fighters L-159 out of a total of five that the Czech Ministry of Defense exchanged against the transport aircraft Casa C-295M, flew to Seville on Tuesday, where the Spanish aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS settled.
It is the first time that machines of this type are owned by a foreign army.
To date, they have only been shown at maneuvers or flight shows abroad.
This concerns the flightable two-seater version L-159T1, operated by the Czech army.
The remaining three aircraft are one-seat L-159.
These are still preserved in the Aero Vodochody, the mediator of this business - the company Omnipol - has taken over them last week.
According to the president of the Ministry of Defense, when she physically extracts the aircraft from Vodochody, Jan Pejšek is not yet known.
In turn, the L-159 single-seat fighter aircraft was separated from long-term aircraft, without further deposits and investments from the Ministry's place of business.
"The two-seat L-159T1 were exchanged in the current state and appearance," said Pejšek of Právo newspaper.
He added that the army would not have to get out without two-seater fighters, as the Ministry of Defense signed a 200 million contract with Aero Vodochody in May 2009 on the conversion of four superfluous L-159 to the two-seat version.
A new plane took over the army in July, the second one wants to take over until the end of this year.
According to Pejšek, EADS has committed itself to putting the fighter aircraft into the equipment of one of NATO countries.
"The contract clearly states that EADS is the buyer of the aircraft L-159 and that it is intended to train pilots from NATO countries.
"It is therefore a matter of the customer how he realizes the matter," Pejšek said.
The economic newspaper (HN) had previously reported that the Spanish government had no interest in the L-159.
The five-L-159 trade against a Casa and the purchase of additional aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns was approved last year by the government of Mirek Topolánek.
At the time, the Ministry of Defence had not issued a tendering procedure for purchase, but had addressed EADS directly.
The Defence Office at that time argued that this exchange would support the future export of L-159 abroad.
The Czech army bought out 72 machines, of which they only used 24, and the rest wanted to sell them.
By the way, the purchase of the aircraft Casa should also have a judicial replica.
The European Commission sued the Ministry of Defence of the Czech Republic at the European Court of Justice, because it would have had to select the aircraft on the basis of an all-European invitation to tender and not by a single manufacturer.
The army has already taken over three aircraft Casa, the last one is supposed to land at Kbely Airport within fourteen days.
A longer toe finger than ring finger means a lower risk of developing cancer
Men whose index finger is longer than the ring finger are apparently less at risk of developing prostate cancer.
This is the surprising result of a study published on Wednesday by the British Journal of Cancer.
This is to be related to the mirror of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our results show that the relative length of the fingers can serve as a simple test for the risk of prostate cancer, and in particular in men up to sixty," said the co-author of the study, Ros Eeles, professor at the cancer research institute at the University of Warwick.
The finger could help determine which men should necessarily undergo a prostate cancer test, especially if there are genetic risks or other risk factors such as family health stress, Mrs Eeles added.
During the period 1994-2009, with her colleagues in Britain, she persecuted more than 1500 patients with prostate cancer, but at the same time 3000 healthy men.
In more than half of the participants in the study, the pointing finger of the right hand was shorter than the ring finger.
For these men, the same probability of prostate cancer, as for 19 percent of those men whose ring fingers and toe fingers were the same length.
However, in men whose index finger was longer than the ring finger, this risk fell by 33 percent, even by 87 percent in men.
The ratio of the length of the two fingers mentioned, which are already prenatal, clearly reflects the different levels of sex hormones to which the child was exposed in the womb.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer index finger.
Previous research showed that the testosterone is currently accelerating the growth of prostate cancer.
Václav Pačes, a leading Czech geneticist and former chairman of the Academy of Sciences, said ČTK that he is aware of this study in a fleeting way, yet he does not consider the relationship between the length of the finger and the risk of cancer to be "fully proven".
Czech Republic in snow - D1 and D5 are locked
Like most of Europe, the Czech Republic is also under a snow cover on Thursday morning.
On the streets and walkways there is mostly solid snow, the winter workers were on the axis all night long.
The D5 motorway between km 89 and 90 towards Rozvadov is blocked due to some accidents of trucks and cars and also the D1 at Brno "stands" towards Prague.
This said Novinky.CZ the dispatcher of the Central Auto Moto Club (ÚAMK).
At kilometres 91, a truck crashed, at kilometres 93, two trucks hit each other, and in this accident there are injured.
There are also a few cars in the tomb.
There are also problems at kilometres 185 of the D1 motorway towards Prague.
Here, too, two trucks have come together.
The drivers should leave Brno at kilometer 190 or drive through Brno and drive up to Kývalka for kilometers 182.
There are kilometres of traffic jams there.
Also on the D11 an accident happened and that happened right on the way to Prague.
In Prague there is a two-centimetre thick snow cover and the thermometer shows less than seven degrees Celsius.
Autocolons are formed, for example, in Prosek's city rope, and Štěrboholská street is also completely clogged.
The safest transport is definitely the metro.
The trams drive with delays, for example on the line between Karlsplatz and Friedensplatz.
At 8 a.m., the Prague crisis staff meet.
There are also problems with the railway and airfield.
The Czech State Railway had to cancel seven high-speed trains because of snow pollution.
There are problems, for example, on the route Prague - Kralupy or also Prague - Beroon.
Travelers should be informed about the current situation.
Ruzyně Airport is closed at 11 a.m. on Wednesday until 5 a.m.
Most roads in Southern Moravia are only manageable with increased caution.
Around Vyškov, three sideways are completely unmovable, in Brno's vicinity snowsweaves and in the area of Blansko you are forced to use snow milling on some higher streets.
One of the most affected areas is Výškov.
There are three streets still completely locked: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Šaratice - Milešovice.
Here too you will have to use snow milling.
When they become reusable, it is not possible to estimate until now.
In the Hodonín region, caution is recommended in the field of white carpathic patients.
On the streets, which can only be spread with inert scatters for reasons of nature protection, lies one to five centimeters thick snow cover, led ČTK.
In the Czech Republic, from two to ten centimetres of new snow, most of it in North Bohemia, fell to 18 centimetres.
In the Moravian-Silesian region, up to 15 centimetres of new snow fell.
In the Czech Republic, however, it is slow to slow down.
American soldiers have a new "intelligent weapon".
The American troops have for the first time used a new "intelligent" weapon in Afghanistan, which has so far been known only under their code name XM-25.
The generals hope that this new automatic weapon will influence the conflict there with the Taliban and shift the balance of power in their favor.
The new weapon is something like a super-accurate cannon.
Their projectiles are directed to the target by lasers with a safety of only a few metres.
The special shots of calibre 25 mm, which were developed for this rifle and contain highly explosive explosive, work practically like small grenades.
The shots can be programmed in such a way that they can explode at any point in their ballistic flightway not only when impacting on the target.
That is, you can use it against an enemy who is hiding behind an obstacle - a wall or a gunshot.
From above it is usually not protected, so the murderous steel scatter rain from above can easily put it out of battle.
According to Richard Audett, who was involved in the development of the XM-25, the new combat rifle is the first infantry weapon to use "intelligent" technologies.
"The soldier basically assumes this: he visualises the target and sends out a laser beam that determines the distance, so he wins a precise visualisation point after which he corrects the angle of increase, then he only needs to print it out.
"Let's say you've measured 543 m."
"When you push down, the weapon invites you and shoots the shot at the distance of 543 meters plus minus one, two or three meters.
Moving 400 jobs
Fujitsu has moved its branch to Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July next year, 400 employees will move their work from the previous office building at the Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to the Astro Park.
The Japanese group Fujitsu moves its branch to Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July next year, 400 women and men will move their work from the previous office building at the Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, which is a large office complex on Lyoner Straße in the low-wheel district of Frankfurt.
One of Fujitsu’s spokespersons explained that in the medium term there should be additional 100 jobs in the Group, which have so far been distributed to the region.
The rental offer had been extremely attractive, and the large-scale offices in the Astro Park were better opposed to the employee's working methods.
Even in Bad Homburg Fujitsu had been only tenants.
The responsible managing director Bernd Wagner said, "With Frankfurt-Niederrad, we have found a central location with excellent infrastructure."
The excellent access to the airport is particularly important for a global company such as Fujitsu.
The new move of an important company within the region brought joy to the winners and disappointment to the losers yesterday.
The Frankfurt business manager Markus Frank (CDU) said that once again a "global player" was won.
That's a "great site confession."
Fujitsu passed to the city that the settlement was an important impulse for Niederrad.
The Bad Homburg mayor Michael Korwisi (The Greens) regretted Fujitsu's decision.
The city had been informed early by the management of its intention.
"We naturally offered the company our help," Korwisi said.
However, the friendly contacts could not have changed the difficulties of the computer manufacturer with the owner of the property at Marienbader Platz.
Finally, economic reasons would have given rise.
Now it is about preventing a long void in such a prominent place.
"I hope the owner and landlord of the building shows themselves cooperative."
The house used by Fujitsu so far at the town hall square and the neighbouring "Little Vertical" were among the most controversial construction projects of the Kurstadt with the other buildings at Marienbader Platz ten years ago.
As a joint project of the city and a private project developer, a new city entrance was created between the station and the town hall, which caused criticism both because of the massive construction of the previously partly used areas as parking space as well as the height of the buildings.
In 2001 the investment consulting and rating company Feri, the software manufacturer for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, as well as the computer manufacturer Fujitsu, still connected with Siemens.
The building used by Fujitsu was purchased in 2006 by the Frankfurter Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Group together with Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund and sold one year later to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
The Fujitsu Konuzer, based in Tokyo, is the third largest IT provider in the world.
For example, it provides companies with computers and servers and also provides the necessary service.
The branch in the Rhine-Main area is one of the largest in Germany, but much more employees are Fujitsu in Munich.
From Bad Homburg, Fujitsu Technology Solutions is a subsidiary in Frankfurt-Niederrad.The other subsidiaries at this site are to be Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
For this purpose, the office building Astro Park rented 7000 square meters.
In the twenty-year-old complex - the name plays on its star-shaped ground plan - the Central Association of Electrical Engineering and Electronics has its headquarters, among other things.
Amazon Locks Server - Threats Against Assange
Wikileaks are increasingly in distress.
The Internet service provider Amazon has banned the revelation platform from its servers.
There may be political pressure behind it after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomats.
Wikileaks founder Assange is said to be in England.
Wikileaks is increasingly under attack in the United States.
The Internet activists lost access to their previous American server and are now looking for an Internet home in Europe.
The prominent American Senator Joe Lieberman called on other countries and companies to become the boycott of Wikileaks.
And Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is on Interpol's list, is supposed to stop after a newspaper report in the UK.
"Wikileaks from Amazon server banished."
"Free speech in the country of the Free," the Enthulungs Activists informed Twitter on Wednesday (local time) via a short news service.
Shortly before, Amazon had banned Wikileaks documents from its servers.
The Internet activists had resorted to the Amazon Web Service (AWS) in the publication of the secret diplomatic depes in order to handle the high number of access to the documents.
Using Twitter Wikileaks further stated: "Excellent - our dollars are now spent to employ people in Europe."
If Amazon had such a problem with freedom of speech, "they should stop selling books."
Amazon has stopped the use of its servers by Wikileaks after Senator Joe Lieberman's staff had been investigating, reported CNN on television, calling on Lieberman's office.
The president of the Senate Committee on Home Protection had threatened Amazon with a boycott, reported the British "Guardian".
"I wish Amazon had taken this measure earlier in view of the previous publications of classified information by Wikileaks," said the Senator.
Lieberman called on the platform to refuse to use servers in other countries as well.
"Wikileaks' illegal, incorruptible and reckless approach puts our national security at risk and endangers the world's life," said the partyless Senator.
"No responsible company - whether American or foreign - should help Wikileaks spread stolen material in his efforts."
Wikileaks founder Assange, who is being sought for rape by the authorities in Sweden, is on the interpol's campaign list.
According to a report from the London newspaper "The Independent", 39-year-old Australians in the UK are present, the exact place is known to Scotland Yard.
The Internet activist has always described the investigations in Sweden as the intrigue of his opponents.
Wikileaks speaker Kristin Hrafnsson said in London that there were threats.
"There were even calls for a murder of Julian Assange."
That's why Assange was right for his safety, said Hrafnsson.
The Wikileaks founder will therefore continue to be hidden.
Hrafnsson apparently responded to statements from North America.
In America, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, had demanded that the controller be charged with and executed for the Wikileaks revelations for betrayal.
In Canada, an advisor to head of government Stephen Harper - obviously ironic - said on TV, Assange should be "killed" and Obama could "use a drone".
Between the White House and Assange a hit exchange was born.
The U.S. President Barack Obama, Robert Gibbs, called it "laugh and absurd" that Assange had called for the resignation of Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton, if she is responsible for recently announced espionage demands for diplomats.
"I'm not sure why we care about the opinion of a guy with a website," says Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more significant than its one website."
The U.S. government is now fully investigating the protection of its databases.
As the Special Representative, Russell Travers, the Vice Director of the Anti-Terror Action Centre, informed the White House.
Travers was responsible for developing "necessary structural reforms" that had become necessary following the disclosure of the messages by Wikileaks.
The White House also wants to have the ways in which the entire government exchanges and protects information.
The U.S. government also announced its intention to ensure the security of dissidents and activists should be put at risk by the Wikileaks release.
"We've done everything we can to get in touch with them," said Philip Crowley.
"We are ready to protect them if necessary."
The Ice University
At the "Gelato University" at Bologna, ice conditioners are prepared for better seasons.
The three-day basic course for future Geatier has the largest entrance and visitors from all over the world.
Where's the whole ice cream coming from?
From the Gelataio and the Gelataio.
The Gelatiere, in German a little agely of the ice conditor, produces the cream according to all the rules of Italian icemaking.
With a spatula, the Gelataio removes the ice cream from the refrigerator, puts it into the waffles and then sells it.
To know this, you don't have to drive to Anzola dell'Emilia in Bologna Province.
But anyone who wants to know more about ice does not pass the "Gelato-University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The Ice University set up the manufacturer of ice machines in 2003 to ensure that the ice cream from its machines meets the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day basic course for future Geatier has the largest entrance and visitors from all over the world.
However, there are also multi-day special courses around chocolate news and internships in the on-site ice cream parlors.
Some people dream of a new career in the Midlife crisis, others just venture on the smooth ice of their vague longings.
This time it is 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents - from Brazil to Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, art teacher from California, loves the Slow Food movement and in the future wants to offer a European quality product in the country of the industrial ice cream.
Anke from Berlin is a business consultant and wants to do something of his own after years in a nervous job.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an ice parlour in Cairo.
A man from Malta and one from Brazil wants to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars - and Canadian housewife Julia comes because her children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro-Glatier Luciano Ferrari first explains to the participants the ideal properties of the perfect ice cream.
Decisive is not only good taste, but also silky suppleness and good consistency.
Luciano does not forget when he is training, but he does not forget the cream of the national and even southern superstructure: "Italian gelato is simply the best - and then there is still a lot of romantics."
The first step to manufacturing seems simple.
Luciano kicks the basic ingredients of milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large blender, which heats everything to 85 degrees with an electronic program and then cools it to four degrees.
Then he turns a cock on the machine, and out comes a pasteurized white base cream, basis for all dairy varieties.
Immediately, the lecturer is bombarded with questions: Can you produce ice cream only with natural substances without stabilizer?
How can you let your own experimental desire run free?
Luciano warns of being led astray by the spirit of time.
Anyone who speaks of ice cream "only from natural ingredients" may still have used stabilizers - usually a natural product, such as gurky flour from the guarbean.
Of course, you can also make ice without a stabilizer, only it must be sold within one day, otherwise it will collapse together, and the customer bites on loud ice grains.
Some variations on the base mass are allowed.
It's going to be more exciting with the aromas.
For the taste in the ice maestro Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients you buy in the fruit department or in the sweets of the supermarket.
There are also powders and paste.
"The suppliers will all try to turn on dozens of aromatized additions."
"But you should just experiment."
Either in the fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or just with the ice cream from the white ground mass, which with eggs becomes a yellow cream and with cocoa powder the basis for all possible chocolate seductions.
Now the coursers are allowed to attend the ice machines.
Luciano lets them produce four different types of vanilla, chocolate, mocha and hazelnut ice - with or without eggs in the basic mass, with more or less vanilla aroma or other natural additives.
The same experiment is also subject to the varieties of fruit ice.
More flavourings, more fruit-purée - tasteful that's not necessarily better.
Hazelnut ice does not taste more nutritious when it contains more hazelnuts.
The most popular Kiwi ice produces the working group that uses more fruits, less water and a little less stabilizer.
Only a balanced mixture properly emphasizes the taste of a gelato, says Luciano.
Ice production is a calculation task: If peach-purée is used with a lot of sugar, the sugar content must be reduced in the basic recipe.
An extra portion of sugar is needed for lemon ice.
Luciano draws out a device by which he determines the sugar content of the fruit varieties (winzers thus measure the oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately, tables make it easier for computers.
Making ice does not require as much physical use as it used to be.
Not only the device helps to produce the basic mass automatically.
There is also a device in which the finished ice blend is smoothed at the same time and cooled to minus temperatures.
Despite all automation, small pans do not stay out.
The Brazilian Gustavo clasps himself and his classmates from top to bottom with fruit puree as the overdimensional bar mixer out of control.
"In every course," says Maestro Luciano, "it's just a matter of time until something like this happens."
On-the-spot controllers
The European Food Authority (Efsa) has been subdivided by the industry experimenting with gene plants.
This allegation is now formulated by the Testbiotech Expert Group, which sees itself as an independent institute for the impact assessment of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we have well documented it," said Testbiotech CEO Christoph Then on Wednesday in Munich.
The head of the Efsa expert group for genetically modified plants, Harry Kuiper, and another Efsa expert have been under contract with the Ilsi Lobbyist Association for many years.
It is paid by companies such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper has worked significantly on the Efsa test regulations for gene plants, thus being in a clear conflict of interest, criticised Then.
The Efsa regulations are, as is the case with Ilsi's position papers, the handwriting of the industry, which is intended to be controlled by the authority in the Italian Parma.
It was already the second time that Testbiotech challenged a conflict of interest.
Thus, a high-ranking Efsa manager has recently been Syngenta, a Swiss agricultural group, without any conditions or transitional time, and has changed sides.
The Central German Radio (MDR) had also recently revealed personal links between controlling EU authorities and industrial lobby, which has made the Federal Environment Agency and EU Parliamentary members very bright.
However, the Efsa cannot recognise any conflict of interest.
It is said in an opinion that all serious data, including those of industry as long as they are of high quality.
The experts who work for Efsa do not require that they have any contacts with industry.
But they would have to reveal it.
Kuiper accepts his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the USA.
This describes itself as a neutral forum for experts from science, industry and politics, including the risk assessment for biotechnology without lobbying.
In this case, independent experts such as Then criticise that genetically modified plants are currently approved in animals without any feeding attempt and that the response of gene plants to environmental influences is not tested.
"We want to know what for example makes genetically modified maize on the field," says Then.
Current practice is to test only isolated proteins, but not the whole gene plant, which does not produce reliable results.
"If you don't look for the risks, how can you find them then?" Then indictingly asks.
Angelika Hilbeck also sees that.
The scientist has been researching genetic engineering since 1994 and is currently working at the Zurich University of Technology.
Industry is increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists in Europe, as in the US.
There are hardly any researchers, therefore, who are not intertwined with corporations.
For companies critical studies would not normally be published.
"Industry controls security research," says Hilbeck.
The track of the stones
Uli Gsell has also worried about which, a total of about 400 kilos.
On Monday evening he stood in Stuttgart train station, the tuba on his back.
It was demo.
It snowed.
The story is known: In September the excavators were moved and had begun to break off a large portion of the northern wing.
The Stuttgart world was no longer the same: Zig thousands demonstrated against S21, the milliard-heavy depth of the railway station.
When construction stopped, much of the wing lay in ruins.
Broken in 6000, 7,000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a soft coarse stone, was built between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in East Fildern, 43 years old.
He's secured some of the broken pieces.
"These stones are relics."
"You mustn't go."
He warms: "A cheaper and poor stone, simple and imaginable."
When he saw one, he smelled like cigarettes.
He doesn't know what he's going to do with the broochs yet.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell too.
The trail of the Stuttgart Steine leads to a forest near Tübingen on a former ammunition depot of the French army, where Manuel Rongen has built his stone-rich.
The 44-year-old deals with old stones.
He has bought all those who were affected by the demolition in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame, they would be ground into gravel or disappear in the deposit," he says in his office, a wooden bay that was once a watchhouse.
Insolent and threatened him, he says, when in September in the newspapers, he was told that he had bought the rest of the North wing from the demolition contractor.
But he talked to the S-21 opponents for days.
And he told them that he couldn't do anything for the demolition.
And if it were possible, it would be the wisest if the stones were to be used again.
About 200 S-21 opponents then participated in one of the quarries, which averaged 80 kilograms, with a unit price of 6,50 to 14 euros.
As a reminder, but also in the hope of being able to return him during a reconstruction.
500 tons had bought Rongen, 25 large truck charges.
About half of it is still stored in the forest, the rest is sold long ago.
Garden owners, landscape gardeners, house builders.
They had come from all parts and had been dragged away, which could have borne the trunk and the trailer.
The Stuttgart stones of the attack have long been transformed into "mowers" or into limits of herbbeds.
"There's nothing special about this stone," says Rongen.
"Wouldn't be the political component."
He rises in his offing car, making a tour through his 20-hectare empire.
He studied and canceled, later biology, then he became interested in computers and eventually became a stone dealer.
And stone lovers.
There are 40,000 tons of stones stored.
He carries his treasures together from all over Germany.
He says he is the Republic's biggest wholesaler.
He's slowing down.
In the snow lies artificially happy sandstones.
"They once belonged to the Dresdner Marienbrücke," he says.
Elbsandstein, yellow, warm, he's shimmering.
"My favorite stone."
It goes up the road through the forest.
He shows on a pile: red sandstone, formerly part of Karlsruhe Railway Station.
Keep going.
"Beautiful Travertin."
At one time the Quader were part of the gallery of the Stuttgart Neckarstadion.
Rocks and stories everywhere in the snow, Cannstatter Travertin from the Stuttgart police presence, red granite from St. Blasia Cathedral, Tuff from the Heilbronn Hospital.
What work, what troubles, what sweat.
When Rongen thinks about how the stones used to be hacked by hand and moved with simple bottles and ox carts, he becomes very respectful.
"It would be a shame if you were to be a little sloppy."
He didn't become rich, he didn't get rich at all.
But 14 people occupied the stone dealer today, and also settled in the forest of Steinmetze, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glassblower and a gardener.
"We work hard, but it's satisfying," says the restorer.
He'll have to go to Cologne soon.
There are stones there too to save.
Talent battle for high potentials
There's a lot of pressure on the buffet.
16 students push around salmon candies, tomato soup and sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the Autobauer Volkswagen have invited mechanical engineering and design students to a workshop.
In a kind of idea competition they are supposed to get to know Volkswagen together with VW developers through the car of the future - and by the way.
In the competition for the smartest heads, many companies now go into the near battle and, like VW, rely on cooperation with the universities.
Their mission: to recruit the most talented graduates as early as possible in the hearing rooms before coming to the labour market and being recruited by others.
And because the universities do not publish statements about the performance of their students, one tries to identify and bind the exceptional talents in practical projects.
On the second day of the workshop at TU Braunschweig, the car company is throwing around the talents.
A young lady from the personnel department distributed ballpoint pens, rubber braids and folders with VW logo.
She tells the hopeful young talent of internship programs and student jobs and shows them ways to the group.
Nico Selle from TU Braunschweig is monitoring the project with VW.
He sees the advantages for both sides: "The students come in contact with the industry and gather experience."
"VW can get to know students at the same time, look at interesting candidates and think about who would be in question as an employee."
Such cooperations, so Celle, are not unusual.
It is new that students are so offensively paid.
"In the end, the focus was more on the technical project," says Selle.
The fight for the freshly graduated will probably get even harder.
In many industries, companies can no longer choose their employees from a large number of applicants.
But they must pay off, and in particular they must balk for highly skilled workers.
In particular, graduates from the engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiating position.
According to the Association of German Engineers VDI, more than 40,000 engineers remained unoccupied in October.
And the so-called engineering gap will grow even bigger according to VDI forecasts.
For the accounting and consulting company KPMG, Roman Dykta is going for the talent hunt.
He organizes elaborate recruiting events such as the KPMG race, a kind of modern carpentry hunt in which participants have to find their way through GPS coordinates.
Eight promising students want to send the company this way across the US next year.
By the way, participants can look at KPMG's facilities and get to know the company.
If you are allowed, you decide in two selection rounds in advance.
Only the cream de la crème of the many applicants flies to the USA.
The guns, according to Dykta, are getting bigger and bigger when you climb around the high potentials at the universities.
"We want to take the race out of the crowd."
"Only a simple sailing session was too little for us."
For talent hunter Dykta, the bill seems to go.
"We still have contact with all participants of a similar action last year."
"Some are about to finish and want to apply with us soon," he says.
In addition to the direct bowling on campus, small and medium-sized companies also go on the pirsch in a classic way at professional fairs.
"We are trying to reach graduates at trade fairs."
"Etwa on the Intersolar", reports Sitha Stübe, head of personnel at the solar technology manufacturer Solarworld.
The Bonn company employs around 1500 employees in Germany.
Stübe wird um die Jugendproblemtik.
Currently 35 posts are posted on the company website.
"It's very difficult to occupy professional positions right now."
"It costs a lot of time and money," she says.
Another way is to contact the university professors.
Solarworld cooperates with various universities, such as the University of Freiberg.
"The professors suggest that you can make internships with us or write your diploma thesis."
Fair promotions are not reported to the solar specialist.
For this, the company tries to advertise with other advantages: personal atmosphere, flat hierarchies and light communication.
"A large group can't often offer this," says staff manager Stübe.
Money doesn't play the main role in job searching.
Flexible working hours, babysitting or good climbing opportunities are other crucial factors.
Solarworld placed 55th among the 100 best employers in Germany at a study by the Great Place to Work Institute.
The Institute creates an annual best list of German employers.
For this purpose, employees are asked how satisfied they are with their work and their job environment and are looking at the framework conditions for the employees.
Staff leader Stübe also hopes that the job seekers will receive additional points from the placement.
"I think applicants are looking at external assessments about a potential employer," she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler from the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies who want to build up a good reputation as an employer with a long-term strategy.
He advises his customers to become more authentic.
And that means, according to warriors, above all internal measures.
"The best way to make yourself attractive as an employer leads through their own employees," he says.
In the industry jargon the internal employer is branding, i.e. employers' branding within their own workforce.
"Satisfied staff are the best ambassadors."
If you treat his people well and identify them with the company, they would advertise for their employer by themselves with friends and acquaintances.
"That's like a game with gangs," says Kriegler.
Obama stops new oil drilling
There will be no new oil drilling in the coming years off the coast of the U.S. state of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico.
A similar ban has been imposed by the government in Washington - and with that their previous plans have finally been withdrawn.
Also in front of the Atlantic coast, new drilling remains prohibited for the first time.
This was announced by Interior Minister Ken Salazar on Wednesday.
The explosion of the Deepwater Horizon drilling platform in April is the starting point for the strict prohibition, which is to apply for at least the next five years.
Before the disaster that eleven workers cost to life and led to the biggest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama, at the pressure of opposition and industry, signaled his willingness to allow new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
The proponents therefore want to reduce U.S. dependence on oil supplies from abroad.
Whoever carries responsibility for the devastating oil plague in the Gulf is still not fully clarified.
At the heart of the criticism is the British energy group BP, which faces billions of demands.
A Commission of Inquiry on Obama's mission is to present its results during December.
In October, Interior Minister Ken Salazar lifted the drill stop imposed after the explosion.
Several oil companies had immediately filed applications for new drilling projects.
With sharper controls and more stringent safety regulations, Obama and Salazar want to exclude a newer catastrophe.
At present, the competent control authority, which has been called into question in numerous cases of corruption, is fundamentally reformed.
In parallel, Obama has announced that he will close profitable tax loopholes for oil and gas companies.
The industry is now publicly warning that the volume of funding in the Gulf would be much lower due to a more stringent regulation than before.
"The government's plans are the biggest brake for the growth of the oil and gas industry", is the result of a current industry survey by the consultant firm BDO - even before Wednesday's drilling ban.
The American Energy Alliance also laments the uncertainty in the industry: "No one knows what will change precisely with the regulation."
Investment in new funding projects would continue to increase until further growth.
Ogoniland is burned off
The water in the rivers is oil-brown, it smells like at the gas station: billion liters of drained crude oil have destroyed nature in the Nigerian Ogoniland.
People live on theft, corruption and illegal oil cooking.
Celestine Akpobari means well.
"Don't stop," the eco-activeist calms the journalists, "you'll still get enough oil mud in front of the lens today."
The 37-year-old Nigerian has tried to light up a young boy who is growing up to the breast in the water with the loops surrounding him: The scene is almost pretty in the rainbow-colored water shine.
It is not possible to see that, under the surface, brown crude oil swabs float.
Previously, she had collected shrimp here, Esther Badom tells us on the shores of the Bodo Jetty River.
In the meantime, the flowing waters are completely dead.
Five years ago, a brushed pipeline engulfed vast amounts of crude oil into the huge wetland.
Fischer from the nearby town of Bodo now have to row for six hours to reach fish-based waters: Ogoniland, located in the heart of the Niger delta, is considered one of the world's worst ruined regions.
On the journey through the mangrove swamps that flow through the river, the entire extent of the destruction becomes apparent.
Instead of bright water, the motor boat is awakening brown bridge, who turns his hand into the water, pulls oily fingers out.
The roots of the mangrove trees are like black licorice poles from the ground, causing sad palm trees to hang their bets.
Birds, as they are otherwise common in wetlands, are far removed: As soon as the outboards keep silent, the former paradise that smells like a gas station spreads out spooky peace.
"What's happening here is ecological warfare," says Celestine Akpobari Finster: "We live in constant danger to health."
The comparison of the war is appropriate.
The Ogoni settlement area has been a battlefield that has been fought for decades: more than 60 years ago, the first expeditions from Europe invaded, and in the 1980s, with the later executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, the first resistance, the Shell Group had to stop its production in 1993 because it became too dangerous for its oil workers.
The company is still denied the return to Ogoniland: While more than two million barrels of black gold are pumped out of the entire Delta region of the triple size of Switzerland with more than 5,000 drilling sources and 7,000 kilometers of pipelines daily, the oil fields in the Ogoniland are broken, too unstable the Group is the situation.
Every few hundred metres of steel-thinged structure such as bizarre sculptures from the water: "Christbümchen" the heads of the drill holes are called much too tender.
They are up to 50 years old, most of them corroded to the mark.
Again and again, such a drill head breaks apart, says Akpobari, then a constant stream of crude oil runs into the water.
According to expert estimates, more than two billion litres have flowed into the Delta ecosystem in 50 years: year after year, the quantity of oil, as it did in the havari of the super-tanker "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago, was forced into the sea before Alaska - one of the greatest environmental disasters in the history of humanity.
Whoever is responsible for the ongoing eco-GAU, is argued about it.
During the Shell Group of Sabotage and the organized oil theft account for more than 90 percent of the pollution, environmentalists see bursting drill heads and leak pipelines as the main cause of pollution.
Shell in Nigeria places much lower safety standards than usual in the world, US scientist Richard Steiner proposed to the company in 2008: "only the rate of defects in the lines was much higher than elsewhere".
In a place that looks like an abandoned, oil-smelted workshop under the open sky, mangrove shapes appear: they are fragmented and oil-smelted to the neck.
Under one of the many barrels, which are partly connected to tubes, partly arbitrarily scattered on the site, a fire flickers: an illegal little refinery.
In the barrel, the crude oil is heated over the fire for several hours, explains Michael, the head of the group.
First, petrol penetrates through the pipes into the pot, later dripping at the end of the line Kerosin and finally Diesel out.
Michael and four employees produce up to four barrels of diesel of 300 litres daily: "This brings us 34,000 Naira" - about 22 dollars.
Delta residents use the chronic fuel scarcity in the largest oil state of Black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
The illegal cooks can still subvert the price of the diesel at just under 40 Euro cents per litre: for they get their raw material for free.
It comes from "Bunkerers", which tap the pipeline network across Ogoniland: According to experts throughout the Niger delta, at least 16 million litres of crude oil are lost in this way every day.
However, only a disappearing small part of the provisionally intermediate raw material is illegally refined: Lions fill organized criminal networks, including politicians and high-ranking military forces, in tankers and squawk them on the world market.
The debate on whether the environmental disaster is more due to the turnover of the population or the lax production mode, considers the activist Akpobari to be purely academic.
"If the oil companies were not perceived as intruders and they would not have destroyed the livelihood of fishermen so thoroughly, there would be neither sabotage nor theft and illegal refineries."
In the meantime, the relationship between Ogoni and Shell is so destroyed that only a deduction of the Group would be in question: "Maybe, other nationalities like the Chinese are more apparent than they are."
Michael gets nervous.
"The maximum time you disappear," says the muscular oilman.
"Every minute the soldiers can come."
If the illegal oil refiners are caught by the special unit of the armed forces, they are not threatened with arrest, but with a painful lubrication.
The soldiers from the Landesordnung, like all Nigerians, also want to benefit from the raw material.
"This damn thing has brought our country to the dog in every way," says Akpobari.
Investigators discover dangerous building faults in A380 Triebwerke
The A380 seems to have a major security problem.
Researchers have discovered a possible fault of construction in the investigation of a not landed machine, which could lead to a "catastrophic engine failure".
The Qantas airline now wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
The passengers of the emergency Qantas-Airbus at the beginning of November apparently had much more luck than previously known: The Australian Air Safety Authority has identified a major safety problem in its investigations in the engines of some A380 machines - and now warns of a possible fault of construction.
The potential defect would have serious consequences: in the case of an oil hose connection, it could produce fatigue cracks and leaks, said the Authority's opinion published this Thursday.
This could have led to "a catastrophic engine failure".
These engines were designed by Rolls-Royce in 20 aircraft of the A380 series.
Among them is the Qantas-Airbus, which had to land in Singapore on 4 November.
The Australian airline has now taken legal action against the British turbine manufacturer.
It submitted a statement of reasons to an Australian Federal Court in Sydney, allowing it to take further legal action against the company.
Qantas CEO Alan Joyce said his airline would demand damages for the incident at the beginning of November.
During the engine's fire, parts had dissolved and the support surfaces had been damaged.
Rolls-Royce made an oil fire the cause of the damage.
After the incident, up to 40 engines must now be replaced worldwide.
The Australian investigators announced that they would carry out further safety tests at the superjumbos equipped with the engines concerned.
The safety recommendation was the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, said ATSB speaker Martin Dolan.
The security problem has been considered sufficiently important in order to inform all interested parties.
Following the emergency landing of the Qantas machine, the airline had kept its A380 fleet on the ground for weeks.
Singapore Airlines temporarily left about three of its 11 A380 on the ground.
The Lufthansa switched the engine as a precautionary measure in an A380.
The double-story plane is the largest passenger aircraft in the world.
Statewide snowfall triggers traffic shocks
Germany in white: Night snow has fallen almost in the whole country.
On many roads there are chaos, trains and flights.
At least three people were killed in car accidents.
Winter freezes Germany: At icy temperatures, almost the whole Republic is snowed on Thursday at night - which leads to traffic shaos many times.
In the north and the east there are sometimes 15 cm thick snow covers.
Transport is severely limited on several motorways and many roads.
At the A7 near Flensburg, the winter service was in continuous use, but was not finished with the snow constantly rethinking.
In addition, heavy trees swept across the Baltic Sea coast.
On the Baltic coast of Schleswig-Holstein, the Federal Office for Maritime Shipping and Hydrography (BSH) expects storm floods with water levels of 1.2 metres above normal level from the morning.
In Saxony, snow pollution on the motorways and highways caused considerable problems.
According to the Meteomedia weather center, in Saxon Switzerland, the level of the alarm was then violet - the highest level at all.
Partly there fell 30 centimetres of new snow, fresh and strong winds caused confusion.
There were several trucks and cars there at night.
In Saxony-Anhalt, the police authorities also reported major disturbances on the streets.
On the A2, snow and wind led to high traffic and traffic jams.
The snowfalls affected the A4 and A9 in Thuringia.
In Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and in the north of Bavaria, German Railway states that there are considerable disturbances.
Snow on the tracks, overturned trees on the rails or destroyed overheads and tracks are the main problems.
In Saxony, the long-distance traffic from Leipzig to Nuremberg had to be stopped.
In the Thuringian Saalfeld, an ICE to Munich had to stop his journey.
The 165 passengers were supplied by firemen and rescue workers with wool blankets, food and drinks on the train.
Snowwinds swept over the streets.
At large German airports, the snow winds lead to numerous flight failures.
In Munich, according to a spokesperson of the Air Information Centre, some cancellations have already been reported.
According to a Fraport speaker, 40 flights have already been cancelled in Frankfurt am Main.
The winter service was in continuous use.
Although only a few stranded passengers are at the airport, there are still almost 400 beds available for them.
On many roads there were accidents already on Wednesday evening.
In the evening, a truck driver was killed in the collision with a train on a train crossing in Ostholstein.
The locust was easily injured.
Near Nuremberg there was a similar accident due to snow-covered roads: Here, too, a truck was detected on a railway crossing because the vehicle remained stuck.
The driver died.
Four passengers were injured on the train - the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was closed until the morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after crossing her car at Aschaffenburg on a smooth road.
However, the meteorologists have a good news: Although the snow will still be loose and powdery, it will soar in light trees.
But the wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea is struck by fast and stormy winds.
However, it remains very cold - locally up to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for their twin towers
The Deutsche Bank wants to separate itself from its landmark: According to a newspaper report, the Cashhouse is looking for buyer for the two office towers at its Frankfurt headquarters.
Up to 500 million euros could bring in the property.
Just now, Deutsche Bank has made its corporate headquarters pretty: the twin towers in the Frankfurter Bankenviertel have been modernised; the bankers have now been able to return to their old workplace.
But now the financial group apparently wants to recover the costs for renovation - and looks for a buyer for the two high-rises, as the Financial Times Germany writes in appeal to a speaker.
The speaker did not mention reasons for the proposed sale.
"We always check if it makes more sense to own or sell real estate and then rent it back," he said.
Thus Germany's largest credit institution will be returning its corporate headquarters in a short time.
The bank had only taken over the double towers in mid-2007 for 272 million euros from the investors of an own fund and subsequently heavily renovated.
The energy conversion slowed down according to the figures after about 200 million euros.
A sale would probably bring the bank a lot of money.
Industry experts estimate the value of the newspaper's towers now renamed "Greentowers" to around 500 million euros.
Whether the buildings are sold again to a fund owned by the Bank or to an independent investor is still open, said the speaker.
Thousands mourn for dead pals
More than 10,000 people in New Zealand have thought of the shed miners who have been declared dead for several explosions in one mine.
The bodies were still unable to be rescued because the security situation in the accident shaft is still precarious.
Nearly two weeks ago, a violent explosion occurred in the Pike River Mine near the city of Greymouth.
29 miners between the ages of 17 and 62 were shed underground.
A probe had been dropped into the disaster shaft, but had not discovered any trace of survivors.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and other subsequent explosions, no rescue forces could descend for safety reasons.
After the second strong detonation, the authorities and experts assumed that there was no chance of survival for the traffickers.
The bodies could not be rescued so far.
Now family members and friends remembered the dead with a memorial celebration.
Ten thousand people had gathered on the New Zealand South Island during the radiant sunshine in Greymouth.
They'll be silent for two minutes.
In honour of the shed miners there were 29 tables on which helmets, lamps and the names of the traffic lights were on display.
Images and personal objects, including clothing and surfboards, also found their place here.
In front of the country's government buildings, the flags were half-mast.
New Zealand had hoped that the miners would come back to the surface "from the depths of the earth," said New Zealand Prime Minister John Key to the participants in the commemorative celebration.
"But they never came home."
He could not conclude with the death of his son until he had seen his body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was thrown into the pit.
In addition to the Prime Minister and family members of the victims, several foreign diplomats took part in the commemorative celebration.
At the first explosion on November 19th, even miners of British and South African origin had been shed.
Rescue workers began to clear a fire inside the coal mine on the South Island of New Zealand.
Once the explosive gases have been suppressed, it will begin to cool the glowing temperatures inside the mine, said police president Gary Knowles to journalists.
Hell, warrior!
Does Splatter fit into the art cinema?
The director Nicolas Winding Refn, with his fighter-epos "Walhalla Rising", re-emerges old genre limits.
What audience might Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have thought of when he shot "Walhalla Rising"?
A prisoner Viking warrior with only one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his torments and, with almost superhuman forces, changes his opponents in order - sounds ideal for young male viewers in search of bloody action, precisely because our hero likes to use rabid killing methods and already pulls his enemies out of the living body when he has bad moods.
On the other hand, Einauge says how he is actually called, that he doesn't have a word for the whole movie, and the other characters can at most be torn to one or two sentences or a few painful death cries.
Otherwise, it is silenced and soaked in the gracefully beautiful hills of Scotland, which the Viking world from about a thousand years ago offers the scenery.
Ideal for adult cinematographics with interest in existentialism and very quiet camera rides.
Beautiful if a film has several target groups, only if they exclude each other.
Director Winding Refn has been considered a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino since his wild and stylish drug dealer trilogy "Pusher", but he refuses to make his works accessible to Arthouse with a little more humor to the mainstream or a little less brutality.
Most art cinema friends should be deterred from the brain mass and the intestines around.
Action fans die not later than bore boredom, if one eye is free to interpret with a forceful Christian missionary force through ship to Jerusalem, and if an eternity is fixed in lettuce and fog before the team apparently arrives in America and keeps silent there.
So no wonder that "Walhalla Rising" in Germany did not find a cinema rental and now only appeared on DVD.
This is particularly a pity because of the magnificent pictures, but also because behind the pretentious to bloody facade a sometimes exciting piece of cinema hidden that deserved some attention.
In this film it's not about dialogues or a strict action, it's all atmosphere, a film-making fever room.
And out of it there is no escape for the viewer.
With his icy pictures and the dark trance-like soundtrack, Refn hardly gives him a moment of relaxation, but especially with the insurmountable hatred that beats him from the hearts of the figures.
Only a little blond boy, who faithfully stands by the eye of the eye, saves himself something like innocence, all the others are driven by anger.
On most of the one-eyed hero whose motives are never explained, but who eventually becomes a warrior from hell for enemies and temporarily allies, possibly as the ambassador of the devil himself.
He means corruption, but perhaps only for the depraved.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that you can hate and admire to anger, excitement and amazement.
An experience.
Mysterical Earthwork
The IAEA Atomic Energy Authority has new evidence of a secret nuclear programme in Syria.
However, the country is unable to comment on this - nor does it allow for controls.
At midnight from 5 to 6 September 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighter planes attack a mysterious, cube-shaped building in Syria.
It is located on the shores of the Euphrates River; the next larger city, 30 kilometres away, is Dair as-Saur.
Its name appears in documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) when it comes to the reactor, which Syria has allegedly built with the help of North Korea in the quader, hidden in a valley that runs off the current.
According to a briefing by the US foreign intelligence service CIA of late April 2008, the reactor common to the nearby village of el-Kibar would have been well suited to produce plutonium - from which nuclear weapons could be built.
For other purposes, however, technology from the fifties hardly suffices.
The CIA presented a video presentation with unsharpened satellite images.
Through computer animation, she blended into which components of the reactor were supposed to have been before the destruction, which was a reduced copy of the North Korean model from the Yongbyon nuclear center.
In addition, she presented photos showing the building close by or even the interior.
The reactor was located shortly before commissioning, but it was not yet fitted with fuel rods.
Today, more than three years after the bombardment, is hardly known more than at that time, yes, the puzzles became rather larger over time.
The former U.S. President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that the CIA was quite certain that Syria was building a reactor in el-Kibar before the attack, but hardly saw evidence that there was "an active nuclear weapons program" in the country.
Some intelligence officers in Europe prefer to be more cautious and speak only of an "appropriate reactor", even if they consider the CIA presentation "plausible".
They lack strong evidence, as do the IAEA.
Asking how sure he is to have a reactor in front of him, a high UN diplomat in summer answered only lapidar, the IAEA had "suitable material to ask questions".
Although the Syrians quickly stood aside from the remains of the alleged "unused military building", they planned the site thoroughly.
However, in June 2008, an IAEA team under the former chief inspector Olli Heinnen found traces of uranium produced by humans in el Kibar.
In addition, through a Member State, the IAEA received satellite images of commercial providers from the time immediately following the attack which is likely to be more meaningful than those presented by the CIA.
However, these recordings are not available on the market because the unknown client - perhaps Israel - bought them exclusively.
The IAEA therefore cannot independently verify its authenticity.
Syria has always proved to have never operated a secret nuclear program or built a reactor.
The uranium tribes of the Israeli weapons, Damascus declared.
But after analysis of the particles, the IAEA rejected this as unlikely.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss it - as well as satellite images.
It also refuses the controllers a second inspection in el-Kibar and access to the debris of the broken building.
But Israel too is silent.
"We will never comment on this," recently the Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, who is working at the time of the attack, reaffirmed the official position.
Thus, since June 2008, the investigation of the case has been without results and "is increasingly developing into a serious problem of credibility for the authority", as a high western diplomat at the headquarters of the IAEA in Vienna states - after all, there is a serious violation of the nuclear barrier agreement in the area over which the IAEA is waiting.
As a key to progress in education, the IAEA apparently sees three other facilities that should be "in functional connection" with the alleged reactor - and unlike that still exists.
Until now, inspectors have not revealed what equipment they have or what function they have or what they might seem suspicious.
According to information from the Süddeutsche Zeitung, they are referred to internally as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah at the IAEA, in turn derived from nearby cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Issis) has identified these places and has made a complex of Masyaf buildings on satellite images, most likely one of the suspect objects.
It may be located in or directly beside a military base - precisely with this reason, Syria is refusing access to the three locations of the IAEA.
In Vienna it is said that the Syrians feared a fishing expedition - that the IAEA was sent by the U.S. to banish military facilities.
Because the nuclears had become aware of the facilities through a tip of the U.S. intelligence services.
The IAEA has evidence, including satellite photographs, that material has been transported back and forth between the three locations and the quader at the Euphrates material.
A high Western diplomat in Vienna said that at least one of the plants could be "related to fuel production".
However, there is "no evidence of sensitive activities", i.e. uranium enrichment or reprocessing; processes necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The reactor type is operated with uranium that is not enriched.
But where the uranium should have come from and where the plutonium should later be separated for the bomb, on these central questions there are always plausible assumptions.
It is also unclear whether debris, which could store valuable traces, was stored in three places.
As if the hundreds of trucks had disappeared from the ground, no one wants information about where the shot has remained.
The only few kilometres of el-Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates salt mine al-Tibni, which Syria examined in 1998 for its suitability as a camp for radioactive waste, is considered unlikely.
The former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley had recently linked her to the reactor in an analysis of satellite images for the renowned magazine Jane's Intelligence Review.
However, recordings from the orbit show that Syria made earthwork at the three suspicious places and removed large containers after the IAEA had requested access.
This may be a coincidence, but it has hardly helped clear the suspicion.
It is also said in diplomatic circles that the IAEA used several months to develop a plan for inspections there that should allow Syria to maintain any military secrets - the only effort is to show how much interest the inspectors have.
In the meantime, Damascus was also buffling up this proposal.
Had Western diplomats in Vienna been appalling a year ago that the reactor had been destroyed, so the matter did not have a high urgency, for example, U.S. ambassador Glyn Davies has been playing so-called special inspections for a few months, one of the strongest means the Vienna nuclear authority has to carry out controls.
IAEA chief Yukiya Amano, who would have to propose these inspections, has already spoken of "an option for which I am open in the future", but he still hesitates.
There is a high risk in this way: firstly, there is a majority in the IAEA Board of Governors, and a number of the 35 countries represented there are far from an escalation.
On the other hand, as one diplomat says, "What if they find nothing at all in the end?"
Love in the Times of War
Since Angelina Jolie began working on her still nameless debut in summer, there is trouble.
The script has written it itself, a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a Serbian man.
Much more you don't know about it - but that's enough for trouble.
Hardly, the rumor, the woman, a Muslim, falls in love with her Serbian rapist during the Yugoslavia war.
Bosnian women's associations immediately protested, and then some day of shooting planned in Sarajevo were moved to Hungary in the short term.
Meanwhile, the film has been shot in Hungary and in post-production, but it is still protested in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the organization of female war victims wrote about the UN refugee aid UNHCR to Jolie and demanded a meeting with the actress, a Bosnian newspaper has now reported - Jolie is even the ambassador of the UN refugee aid.
She is not diplomatic - she offered women a meeting in Hungary weeks ago, but they refused.
The meeting had to be held in Bosnia, Hasecic said.
There was no love stories in rape camps, and Jolies' attitude to the victims told her enough about the script.
According to her organization, according to the UN refugee relief agency, she recommended that Jolie be released as an ambassador, reports the Guardian.
What exactly did Jolie write for scenes?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which received its screenplay, has, after some time, granted a shot permit for Sarajevo - it is not quite clear why Jolie didn't come then.
The young author herself argues that she does not pursue any political intentions with her film, has worked with much effort into the Yugoslavia conflict, wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and give a voice to all the parties involved.
On the content, however, it remains vague.
This is how a second synopsis of the film in the net, which sounds quite different: the loved ones knew themselves in it before the outbreak of war, and meet again when they, a Bosnian Muslim, are dragged into a Serbian camp in which he works as a guard.
What sounds a lot different than the variant " Rape Victims Clap in Torture".
That Jolies film actually starts before the war - so much is safe.
The pressure on her, says Jolie, is "unfair and based on misinformation".
Now you can only bring peace to Hollywood's hackers: by placing the script, as many before, in the web illegally.
Nothing like getting out of here
On that evening, it's finally going around right for the Irish.
No trace of trouble.
For this, the home team dominates its guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA too much.
The fans jolt with joy at cracking loud music, they stamp with their feet.
The Bailey-Pub in the southern Irish Cork trembles because the players throw table tennis balls over a three-meter distance in beer cups - and meet.
"Bierpong" calls itself the bizarre spectacle, there are 500 Euro victory premium plus tickets to Las Vegas for the beer pong World Championships in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy; this shrill drinking game and the restrained computer scientist, that doesn't really fit together.
And yet the 26-year-old is trying to amuse himself, to divert himself from the drilling question of what the future will bring.
On his plan is not game fun in Las Vegas, he will conduct application talks in New Zealand in January.
"I have a merciless feeling with it," he says.
"It's so far away from home and yet I don't have a job there."
After all, his girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland - "She had ruck, Zuck's job as an event manager, perhaps a good sign," says the young man and smiles.
Because of bad perspectives at home, two of Tanners have already sought their luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a job as an IT consultant in London.
The boys go: As with the tanners, it looks on the island in many families.
100.000 Irish will probably leave the country in the near future, say experts from the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) in Dublin predict.
By 2015, they are even expecting 200,000 immigrants.
A heavy loss for the small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants.
Where there are forecasts, there is a wave of immigration comparable to that suffered by Ireland in the 1980s.
After a decade of recovery, which brought great prosperity for the Irish people, Trisesse is now making itself broad again.
The economic crisis is particularly uncertain for the young, well-trained Irish, for which it has only been uphill.
Job loss and social decline seemed absurd in the boom years.
Everyone was needed, there was money in abundance.
In the meantime, however, three out of ten women and men are thirty without work.
In the Irish Times there are on top of readers' letters of young immigrants who complain: "All goes down the stream in Ireland."
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers - but who can go away and our country loses an entire generation."
"The last one, please, makes the light out."
Jura-Student Leanne Caulfield, President of the Irish Student Union, sees a gloomy future rise because the government only has eyelashes and the young people no longer offer prospects for the future.
"They reduce minimum wages, but they have no strategy for creating new jobs," says the 20-year-old.
She observed her commilitons hanging from an unpaid internship to the next.
Her greatest concern, she says, is to have to migrate in four years.
"This thought is sad and depressing."
Men like Stephen McLarnon are trying to occupy the topic positively.
McLarnon organises the Working AbroadExpo, a trade fair that offers a round-by-round service on working abroad.
"For professionals, work abroad is a great opportunity to take the first steps on the career leader," says the manager.
On his website, photos show surfers in Australia and snowboarders in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not a mental service, but also brings freedom and fun.
Seán O'Donovan has been aware of how it feels to build something else for half a year.
Because there was nothing more to do for the 29-year-old engineer in Ireland, he is now working with 15 Irish colleagues on construction in Germany.
In Gelsenkirchen, they are pulling up a fashion house.
In January, we will continue to Hanover or Berlin, to the next project.
His homeland now sees O'Donovan only rarely, for he makes extra layers to pay off the credit for his home at home.
"The situation is a bit crazy," he says, when he first comes across the threshold of his house after a long time.
"I earned money in Germany for a house in Ireland where I am almost never again."
He laughs a little shy and goes through cooled rooms.
The small house is located in a fine residential area with well-kept gardens, parked in the entrances large expensive cars.
Together with a sister, O'Donovan bought the house for 380,000 euros for four years ago - 100 percent credit-financed.
"There were crazy times, there was simple money without many questions," he says.
Is he afraid it could go wrong with the loan?
O'Donovan thinks for a while, pours hot tea and says, "I don't have children I have to feed through and I'm young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start from new."
The civil engineer doesn't like the lamentation he's hearing many times.
"No one has to starve - our situation is by far not as dramatic as in earlier times here on the island," he says.
"Work abroad for a while, that's not the worst thing that can happen - maybe we feel like it only as Irish."
He laughs and tells of his father who went to England in the last major economic crisis.
"After seven years he was back and life continued in Ireland, quite simply."
Cian Tanner likes this thought.
Let the future open and just look at how the life is going elsewhere.
A few years of work in London he has already been behind and why should it not work well for him and his girlfriend in New Zealand?
But one thing is still there that concerns him in these days: the celebration for his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
He's afraid it could turn out to be a life party.
"Don't go too many emotions," he says, drinking a big drink from his beer.
"Well, that sounds frightening."
"Let's call it a walkaway party, very loose, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games."
The Democratic Routine
The democratic movement in Latin America is becoming stronger, as is the support of private companies.
Crime is a more serious problem than unemployment.
In many parts of the region, the influence of Brazil is greater than that of the United States.
To these results came the Latinobarómetro survey, which was carried out in 18 countries and published exclusively in The Economist.
This survey has been conducted regularly since 1995 and shows the change of opinion in this region.
Two facts are particularly relevant in this year's September and October survey.
First, the good mood in Latin America
and, secondly, the growing interest in democracy and its main institutions.
In many countries on the South American Pacific coast, the democratic movement has increased greatly (see Table 1).
In Peru, for example, where the economy has grown by about 6% annually since 2002, the number of democrats has risen from 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
Such a trend can also be seen in Mexico, where the economy has recovered since the strong collapse of last year.
However, only half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the most populous countries in the region, are convinced democrats, which lowers the regional average (see Chart 2).
About 44% of respondents said they were satisfied with their country's democratic practice, as many as last year, but 25% more than in 2001 (diagram 3).
About 34% trust the Congress of their country and 45% of their government. Both values correspond to those of last year, but show a significant increase compared to 2003 (17% and 24% respectively).
A decade ago, Latin America's economic crises undermine the efforts for more democracy.
The fact that this continued during the global economic crisis may be due to the fact that Latin America's countries experienced only a short recession phase and recovered quickly.
In addition, the poor were picked up by a stronger social network.
(As reported by the UN Economic Commission for Latin America this week, the poverty rate in Latin America rose only slightly in 2009 and fell by 32% this year again.)
But there are strong mood differences from country to country (see Graph 4).
Brazil's strong economy and the popularity of divorceal President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is reflected in a widespread thought of progress.
In Mexico and Central America, where recession was more noticeable and violent crimes increased, this is less the case.
Only for the second time since the start of the survey have many respondents in Latin America seen a greater problem in their country than in unemployment (see Graph 5).
About 31% say that either they themselves or a family member were victims of a crime last year. However, compared to 38% last year, the values have fallen and thus reached the lowest level since 1995.
The increase in economic performance is reflected in the stronger support of the private and market economy: about 71% of respondents reported that the private sector is essential for development, with 56% in 2007 (see Graph 6).
About 58% said that only the market economy can bring progress to their country, compared to 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of Venezuelan respondents have maintained this view (and 80% are for a private economy), although their left-hand president, Hugo Chávez, sets many private companies nationally.
According to 19% of respondents (18% last year) Brazil has the highest weight in the region, followed by the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9% compared to 11% last year).
The respondents in Mexico and most countries in Central America, on the other hand, see the most influential country in the United States, taking over this role in Venezuela's Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
A constituency of elections
No one had expected the elections on November 28th in Haiti to be perfect.
But the facts were far beyond the fears of the election assistants who were hurrying to help the affected country.
Overcrowded electorates, multiple votes, elections in the Rinnstein, destroyed constituencies and intimidation were only part of the problems.
Election halls opened with hours of delay.
Many Haitians, many of whom had become homeless by the earthquake in January, have wandered around in search of an option.
Some finally gave up entirely.
A dozen presidential candidates, including some suspected leaders, demanded the withdrawal of the election results because of an alleged fraud.
Some violent protests occurred throughout the country.
Nevertheless, Edmond Mulet, head of the UN Mission in Haiti, referred to the election "as quite good in many concerns".
According to a cautious statement by observers of the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community "these irregularities, however serious they may be, do not necessarily invalidate the process".
In other words, the show goes on.
The Electoral Authority, which is supposedly committed to the unpopular President René Préval and his candidate, Jude Célestin, will announce the preliminary results on December 7.
The expected turnout is valid for January.
There is still hope in the election.
The two leading opposition candidates, the rap musician Michel Martelly and the former First Lady Mirlande Manigat, have withdrawn their initial indifference.
If Jude Célestin, who finds little or no agreement with the voters, explains from the constituency to the winner of the election, this could lead to problems.
Due to the cholera epidemic and the fact that more than 1 million of the earthquake victims still live in tents, a small number of votes were feared.
On the day of the election, many Haitians were hindered by lack of organisation to pay the vote.
About 250,000 ID cards required for election were not yet distributed shortly before the start of the election.
It's a lot at stake.
The donor countries consider a legitimate, recognized government to be an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
The Haitians themselves are of the same opinion.
Secret in the middle
In the weeks following the sudden death of your husband, Argentina's president, Cristina Fernández, experienced a wave of sympathy that drove their popularity by 20 points to over 50%. That's the highest value since their election in 2007.
However, whether this will help you to re-election the next year depends on whether Cristina Fernández, who is clearly mourning, is more compromising than her late husband, her predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner.
The signs for this are not clear.
Néstor Kirchner, who also led economic policy after the election of his wife, often set up budget plans which did not fully take into account tax revenue, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the president to issue the extra revenue according to his own discretion.
On the paper, the Fernández government lost the majority in Congress last year.
But the opposition is divided and Kirchner's death after a heart attack on 27 October led to further destructions.
Some regime critics from the ranks of the ruling Peronists stood behind Cristina Fernández.
But after chaotic meetings (with one parliamentarian in the face of another and others calling on the government to bribe) Congress failed to adopt the budget for 2011.
"I will not discuss it," the President said.
The 2010 budget is now also valid for the next year, which gives the President even more opportunity to spend money on his own behalf.
The economy is running hot: it is likely to grow by up to 9% this year.
For example, the official inflation rate is 11.1%, but numerous private estimates - and wage demands from the trade unions - drive the value to almost 30%.
Kirchner, who took office in 2003 when Argentina was shaken by economic crises, declared growth and poverty reduction his main goals, not inflationary.
He refused to cooperate with the IMF, harassed the private sector and cleaned the National Institute of Statistics and Population INDEC, which was then beautiful to official inflation statistics.
Can Fernández now take a more moderate path?
She called on the private sector and the trade union leaders to speak.
According to official statements, wage increases are to be limited to 18% next year.
The high world market prices for Argentina's agricultural products have boosted the economy.
Inflation, however, undermined growth through a large devaluation in 2002.
For this reason, Cristina Fernández may want to join the rest of the world financially again.
At the beginning of this year, the government reached an agreement with securities owners who had rejected the country's former debt in 2001.
Now, Fernández seems to press for an agreement with the sponsors from the Paris Club, to which she owes about $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners had always rejected a review by the IMF, as is usual elsewhere.
But last month, Minister of Economic Affairs Amado Boudou announced that the fund will provide technical support when creating a new national consumer price index, as if this were the first step towards cleaning the INDEC.
It is not known whether Fernández will be politically active even after the end of her term of office without the support of her husband.
If so, it needs the support of the middle class, most of it has of churchism.
When the Argentines return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy it received will have fallen off.
If she wants to win another election, she has to decide whether she is silent and quiet in many political decisions of her husband.
Weak applause for China
Taiwan’s voters are slowly approaching a closer connection to the mainland.
What does Taiwan think of his great brother beyond the sea den?
On 27 November, more than 7.5 million voters, 70% of the electorate, went to vote in the five districts of Mayors and City Councils, and this was rated as a broad rating by President Ma Ying-jeou.
By establishing ongoing business relations, including a partial free trade agreement, Ma himself is a symbol of relations with the mainland. His policy has for the first time changed the relationship with China's mother country for the first time since 1949.
Ma passed the test, but only barely.
Although his Kuomintang party (KMT) represents three of the five mayors, she received no majority vote.
Instead, the Democratic Progress Party (DPP), which supports greater independence of Taiwan, received almost 50% of the votes that KMT received 45%.
In a presidential election, this would have meant problems for Mom.
Since his election two years ago, the majority of his party has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP even joined the city councils with the KMT.
During the election, there came to the usual events in Taiwan such as truck convoys with scratchmakers, flag-swiveling mass circumferences and only sparsely dressed dancers.
There was even the mandatory, mysterious murder attempt.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan and honorary chairman of the KMT delivered a speech on the eve of the election to a KMT candidate,
When a man shot him out of the crowd in the face. Line was wounded and a surrounding audience was killed.
Bizarress is not clear whether the shooter wanted to kill Lien or settle a dispute with the candidate.
No matter what the attack, as Tsai Ing-wen, the DPP leader, has affected the election and the DPP has turned into a bad light, which has led to more votes by the KMT.
China may have been the biggest winner of the campaign.
Remarkably, relations with the mainland were not addressed.
Instead, the candidates discussed plans for social housing and job creation.
The Taiwanese love their actual independence and reject China's military threat.
For this reason, the KMT does not like to highlight its relations with the Beijing government.
This time, however, the DPP also avoids excruciating the anti-Chinese feelings too much.
She responded to the new awareness that Taiwan's economy can't survive without China.
On the other hand, the majority of Taiwaneses would like to confirm their support for China's policy.
The Beijing government will continue to pursue its strategy of attracting Taiwan back to the Community with economic incentives.
China immediately sent a negotiator to Taipei to prepare a summit on investment security and medical cooperation.
Of course it also wants political integration. But the most important first.
It prefers to wait until after the 2012 presidential elections.
The DPP has now reinvented itself.
Two years ago she was severely weakened: former party leader Chen Shui-bian sat in prison for corruption.
During his presidency from 2000 to 2008, he was vehement to absolute independence.
But under Tai's rule, a new generation of moderate politicians developed and the DPP struggled for the voices of professionals and youth.
Tsai found great approval as the DPP's presidential candidate, like Su Tseng-chang under Chen.
Her party is now doing everything to show that she too is able to build close relations with Beijing.
Tsai plans an idea forging as a contact point between the DPP and China. However, this presupposes prejudice-free discussions.
Tsai publicly stated that her party offered a "trustworthy alternative" to Mas for quick approach to China.
Chen seems very upset about this change.
From his cell he explained that DPP candidates would have done better to insist on Taiwan's independence.
He even called on Pragmatist Su to give up the presidential candidate.
Even without Chen's interference, the DPP is difficult to choose its potential candidate.
The KMT will have to undergo its own self-analysis.
Mas values are bad, despite rapid economic growth; the KMT candidates wanted to lead their campaign without him.
The main reasons for his unpopularity seem to be unemployment and the ever-increasing difference between the poor and the rich.
According to a KMT speaker, he will transform his cabinet as well as the local facilities.
The strong occurrence of the DPP suggests that Taiwan only supports a limited approach.
At the same time, most Taiwanese people see economic cooperation with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, "there is no return."
Grammy nominations: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding was surprisingly awarded in the Newcomer category of the year
If you appear on request of a president, people will notice.
President Obama himself asked Esperanza Spalding to perform at the 2009 Nobel Prize Ceremony. Now the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer has been nominated for this year’s Grammy in the Newcomer category of the year.
In view of the fact that Spalding has already been a celebrated star in the jazz scene since her album "Esperanza" in 2008, the nomination appears a little unusual. However, it corresponds to the Grammy rules, according to which an artist may have released at most three albums before the release of the album with which he became known in the general public.
Her ambitious 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society", is certainly a step forward. And with her shrouded voice and a good feeling for pop, funk and Latin music, one can compare spalding quietly with Norah Jones 2003, whose great success in 2003 comes next as jazz performer in this category of nomination spaldings.
In addition, the album "Historicity" of the Vijay Iyer Trios was nominated in the category of instrumental albums, which resulted in a huge success for the critics.
The competitors Iyers include "Moody 4B" by the experienced saxophoneist James Moody and "Positatly" by the keyboarder John Beasley.
Trombone Shorty, a rough favorite from New Orleans and a frequent guest in HBO's "Treme", was awarded in the category of Contemporary Jazz, in which more albums of Stanley Clarke, John McLoughlin and Jeff Lorber can be found.
The Secret Societ of the wild Stampunk musician Darcy James Argue was well-reserved in the category of the big group. He is thus opposed to the Billy Childs Emsemble with his chamber jazz and the adventurous Dave Holland and his octet, whose life-ablum "Pathways" is a good example of a bassist as a democratic band leader.
Grammy nominations: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey lead to classical categories
The classic nominations for the 53rd Grammy Award contain a colorful mix of musicians and composers from all over the world.
Michael Daugherty's "Deux Ex Machina" for piano and orchestra is listed with five voices, and Steve Mackey's "Dreamhouse", an eclectic orchestral work, with three voices.
Among the nominees with links to Southern California is the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt with his symphony No. 4 "Los Angeles". This piece was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and premiered in the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The composer Avner Dorman, based in L.A., was also nominated for his Mandolin concerto.
Classical nominations are divided into 13 categories, from orchestra, opera, choir to solo recordings.
In the category of classic producers five artists were nominated this year - Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Among the nominated classical albums are Bruckner's symphonies No. 3 and 4 of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty's "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" played by the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey's "Dreamhouse" by Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati" performed by various artists; and Verdi's "Requiem" by Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Choir.
In the opera category, Berg's "Lulu of the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasses "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariahos "L'Amour de Loin" by the German Symphony Orchestra Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin's "The enchanted Wanderer" by the orchestra and choir of Mariinsky Theatre; and Arthur Sullivan's "Ivanhoe" nominated by BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
As composers, Pärt was nominated for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appasionamente Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enhanced Wanderer" for a Grammy.
Pärts Symphony No. 4 was first performed and recorded in Disney Hall on January 4th, by the L.A. Philharmonics under the direction of Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The ca. 30-minute piece bears the title "Los Angeles" and is conjured to the former oil magnate Mikhail Chodorkovsky, who is in prison in Russia.
Dorman's "Mondolins Concerto" received a nomination in the category Instrumentalsolo with orchestra.
The composer from L.A. said he wrote the 15-minute piece especially for the mandolin artist Avi Avital, who performed the concert with the New York Metropolis Ensemble.
"I used sounds from the Middle East and numerous North African sounds and rhythms," Dorman explained in a telephone interview.
The conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the orchestral performance category for a recording of Strawinski's works with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under his direction.
The pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin, organist Paul Jacobs, violinist Julia Fischer and Harfinist Sarah Schuster Ericsson were nominated as instrumental soloists.
This year, only women were nominated as vocal soloists, including Anne Sofie by Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Precisex and Measha Brueggergosman.
The soprano Jessie Norman was nominated for her recording "Roots - My Life, My Song" in the category Klassik-crossover.
Mosque in Temecula wins approval of the Planning Committee
The construction of a mosque in Temecula was the unanimous commitment of the local planning committee after a five-hour, often hot public hearing.
Criticists have been calling on the project to promote terrorism as well as traffic congestion.
However, according to a statement from the Commission on Wednesday evening, the new religious centre is in line with local regulations and will become an aesthetic eye-catcher.
"The project is supported by many good people - by Christians, Jews, Bahais, and many others," said Hadi Nael, Chairman of the Islamic Center of Temecula Valley on Thursday morning.
"As an American, that makes me proud."
"It shows that justice reigns."
"There are only a few opponents," he added.
"They're just very loud."
"In this valley wonderful people live."
The meeting began at 18:00 and the discussions for and against the construction of the center lasted almost until midnight, with the votes on both sides being fairly evenly distributed according to press enterprise.
The debate was continued on the newspaper website.
"There's no America anymore," said one comment.
"It is another planet of monkeys, and the statue of freedom is dead in the sand."
"America is in the end."
Planned Islamic centers have also led to protests in other parts of the country, e.g. near Ground Zero, the scene of the terrorist attacks on the City of New York on September 11, 2001.
In the Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush called for nonviolence.
His community with about 135 families has been living peacefully in Riverside County for years. But they wished for a larger and better place than the camp they rented together with a manufacturer of water filter systems.
The new, approx. 2,300 m2 mosque in Mediterranean style is supposed to have two minarettes and become about 13m high.
It is expected to be built on the approximately 17,500 m2 plot on Nicolas Road near the Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still object to the project at the City Council.
Arsen-resistant microbes could enable new life forms on Earth or elsewhere
The discovery of a foreign type of bacteria, which can live by arsen, opens up new possibilities for new forms of life on earth and elsewhere.
Although scientists discovered this unusual bacterium here on earth, it is, in their view, a sign that life is possible even without the elements considered vital to date.
"This organism has two possibilities."
"He needs either phosphorus or arsenic to grow."
"This makes it something very special, although it's almost a kind of 'foreign' form of life," said Paul C.W. Davies of Arizona State University and co-author of the report, which appears on Thursday in the online issue of Science magazine.
So far, six main elements have been considered vital - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur.
But as the scientists found out, the bacterium in the California Mono Lake grows even further when it replaces phosphorus with arsenic.
"You can ask yourself what else is possible," said the co-author of the Ariel D. Anbar report from Arizona State University.
The discovery is an important step in the search for extraterrestrial life, as scientists have to recognize life and its forms, so Anbar.
The study deals with microbes found on Earth.
The announcement of a press conference, in which no details of the discovery were announced, gave rise to widespread speculation on the Internet that the report of discovery of extraterrestrial life could act.
This is not the case.
The discovery "shows that organisms can start with the help of other elements of biochemical processes in other planetary systems and that the 'standard elements' that we believe are absolutely vital to life are not necessarily specified," explained Charles Cockell, professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute of the Open University of Milton Keynes in the United Kingdom.
Cockel was not a member of the research team.
"This work is a novel because it shows that one element can be replaced by another in basic biochemical processes and structures," Cockell added.
This discovery was not random.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon from NASA's Astrobiological Institute, which conducted the study, chose the Mono Lake due to its high arsenic content.
As arsenic and phosphoric were chemically similar, it assumed that microbes exposed to both might be able to replace one element with the other.
"The toxicity of the arsenic is mainly based on the chemical similarity of the arsenic to phosphorous."
"This makes it difficult for the organisms to distinguish one element from another."
"But the difference is so great that arsen has a different effect than phosphorus. It comes into our biochemical system, where it's almost all smearing," explains Anbar.
The researchers excluded the bacterium GFAJ-1 from an increasing arsenic concentration. It adapted and grew.
The microbe grows better in phosphorus, but that it can survive also in arsenic shows that an arsenic-based lifeform can occur naturally, either on earth or on another planet or moon, on which arsenic occurs more frequently.
According to Jamie S. Foster, lecturer for microbiology at the University of Florida, the idea that phosphorus can be replaced by arsen is not new. But so far there has not been a working example.
Arsen was more common in the early years of the earth, she says, so science has assumed that early life forms used it.
"This is the reason why life may have developed differently from the early age," said Forster, who was not a member of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research has been supported by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the national health authorities.
Other stolen exhibition dogs found in Compton
The remaining two of the four show dogs, stolen from a bellflower motel, were found on Thursday, according to Los Angeles County sheriff.
The four exhibition dogs - two Akitas and two Pembroke Welsh Corgis - disappeared on Tuesday when unknowns stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express van, where the animals were housed in front of a Bellflower Motel 6 night, according to the authorities statements.
Two of the dogs were discovered on Wednesday afternoon, and the last two on Wednesday evening, explains Steve Whitmore, a speaker at the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
"The good news is that the dogs are good at home," says Whitmore.
"They're in good condition."
"They were returned to their legitimate owners."
Whitmore did not give any detailed information on the dog's location yet on the circumstances that led to its discovery.
"The investigations are still underway."
"We don't want to say that anymore," Whitmore explains.
"We're following some traces."
The dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not available for information on Thursday.
They received their two dogs on Wednesday afternoon at a district animal home in Downey.
Representatives of the sheriff found the delivery car and the two dogs in different places in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a 3-year-old male, and Didi, a 10-month-old bitch - were unhapped according to the government statement.
But the Corgis Bunny and Peter, who wanted to present Rickard and Peek this week on behalf of their Japanese owners on the competition, remained missing until Wednesday evening.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were in the city on this weekend because of the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship in Long Beach because Trace was to participate in the competition.
As Peek told the Times on Wednesday, the other dogs should participate in other competitions on the days before the AKC/Eukanuba show.
Southern California is a stop on the almost one month tour of the couple from dog show to dog show.
On Monday evening, Peek and Rickard checked in in the motel.
They often stay in motels and park their van in front of their room window.
They took three more dogs - a boxer cap, a Parson Russell Terrier and a Brittany - into their motel room.
The thick Akitas and Corgis stayed in the delivery car because it was cooler there.
They opened the window a split wide, so that the dogs had fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported their car stolen on Tuesday at 6 a.m.
Peek promised anyone who could give an indication of the Corgis, a finder's wage. Microchips were implanted to the animals for identification.
On Thursday it was not yet determined whether a finder's pay was paid.
The lion roars again after the judicial approval of the MGM restructuring
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM finally got green light for a new start.
On Thursday, a New York bankruptcy judge officially blessed the "prepared" glass plan to eliminate the debt of $5 billion and pave the way for the 86-year-old entertainment company for new movies and television shows.
According to Thursday’s statements, the plan fulfils the requirements of US bankruptcy law, so that MGM’s reboot under the direction of Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, founders of Spyglass Entertainment, is no longer in the way. Barber and Birnbaum will be the leader of the slightly speculated studio.
The number of employees is reduced from over 400 to about 320.
For MGM, Chapter 11 actually does not enter into force until JPMorgan Chase has completed a planned bond of $500 million to finance the new MGM productions.
At the moment, a consortium of the investment bank, which itself brings in $75 million, is headed by the company. The financing is expected to stand by mid-December.
The restructuring of the studio began in May 2009 with the order to help the investment bank Moelis & Co, the management who fought interest payments worth $300 million/year to solve their financial problems.
In August, the managing director Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO of Enron and restructuring expert, who became known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis & Cooper's efforts to solve MGM's financial concerns and pay the studio's more than 140 glassglasses lasted longer than expected.
After months of discussions, the parties decided at the end of 2009 to offer the company for sale.
But the auction attracted only a few bidders and no one wanted to pay the $2 billion required by creditors.
In spring of this year everything began from the beginning when the MGM team started the restructuring plan, which after months of debates and internal disputes was finally signed by the creditors at the end of October.
If MGM has officially passed the bankruptcy in the next few weeks, Moelis and Cooper will receive a bonus of several million dollars for their work.
The share of Moelis & Co. that has already received $1.2 million amounts to $9.5 million.
Cooper, who has been paid $375,000 a month for the management of the company, receives a $4 million "success bonus".
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM. This year, the studio released only one film and created a year plan with seven or eight films to come to the cinemas in early 2012.
They also plan two films after "Der Kleine Hobbit" in co-production with Warner Bros.
The studio needs a separate bond between $265 million and $275 million for its financial share in these two films, which are to be produced under Peter Jackson's direction.
The investor Carl Icahn, who financed about 18% of the MGM loan, tried to merge the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, whose main shareholder he is.
However, the final negotiations between the two companies did not lead to any result.
Tech Toys keeps your gift budget in balance
This year’s favorite among the gifts is iPad, possibly followed by a Microsoft Kinect video console. Both games can tear a considerable hole into your gift budget.
An iPad costs as much as five BMX wheels for $99, while the price for a Kinect game corresponds to about 10 classic jumping ropes or about 48 doses of play doh.
But you can save your gift budget.
Recently I visited three electronics toys under $80 three national toy dealers - a whale mart, a toy "R" us and a BJ's wholesale club.
I immediately realized that Moore's law had entered into force. This year the technology toys are more powerful and cost at the same time slightly less than last year.
And while fewer new toys appear with their own website, you will find a wider offer on the most famous of these types, Webkinz and Club Penguin.
There are more and more button cell-powered toys on the market, and many contain rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(If not otherwise specified, all prices of Toys "R" Us.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, for children from 3 years of age) are plush figures, as large as guinea pigs that sing a note when you press their belly.
One time press corresponds to a note, by multiple pressures you can play a song.
Several singing-a-ma-jigs sing in harmony.
Attention: If you have once started pressing, you can no longer stop.
For a combination of singing and dancing, the Dance Star Mickey (Fisher Price $60, for children from 2) is the best choice.
Based on the Elmo live technology developed last year, the animatronic doll offers interplays like 'Simon says', and thanks to the new hinge feet with wheel blockage, it dominates the Moon-Walk.
Children who test the device use Mickey as a dance teacher. Your parents, however, complain about the lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 80s, remember Alphie, one of the first computerized learning toys.
Now he's back (Hasbro/Playschool, $40, for children from 3), with a whole bunch of questions with which a car ride can become an hour of instruction, with a better doubter with car correction function as a teacher.
If you don't want to entrust your child to your smartphone, here are three independent alternatives.
MobiGo from VTech ($60 for children from 3 to 8) is the cheapest and most user-friendly solution, equipped with a qwerty keyboard. However, the games contained therein are not as instructive as the one on the Leapster Explorer ($70, for children from 3 to 12), which is equipped with a new brighter screen according to Leapfrog's first major revision of the Leapster series.
None of the versions is compatible with older cassettes.
iXL of Fisher-Price ($90 for children from 3 to 7) uses a system similar to iTunes for games and eBooks, and thanks to the SD card drive, family photos can also be viewed on it.
Last but not least, there is Scrabble Flash ($30 of Hasbro, for children from 8). The five blocks are no larger than a matchboard box and have their own LED screen.
The game is about bringing together the blocks to words before the time runs out. It is great for an improvised bookstick competition.
More and more toys have some kind of online connection.
If you go to the toy stores alone after the offer, Webkinz and Club Penguin are the most important.
To give your child an online animal at Club Penguin, you can buy, for example, a Disney Club Penguin 2 Mix 'N Match Figures Package ($5 for children from 6 to 12) containing a coin with a secret code.
When you enter the code online, your child will receive enough credits for two more parts at the Club Penguin Store.
These can be roller shoes or a puff-puff.
The latest head cell-powered micro robot, Hexbug Nano ($10 for children from 5) is no greater than the head of your toothbrush.
The beetle quickly moves on 12 vibrating silicone legs in any direction.
It's fun to send him through a cavities of cavities.
And he stops a lot.
Ours fell from the kitchen table and even survived for some time in the mouth of our dog.
Police forces in China are getting softer
Like a training officer, Tang Shenbin stepped over an urban square, checked his nervous subordinates and gave orders with military authority and damped voice.
He wanted his female members of the Chengguan - China's robust guards of the urban order, afraid and despised for their arbitrary raccia and their dependence on violence - to impress viewers.
"Stand!"
"Look straight!"
"Show them," he whispered to them, "how pretty girls are!"
Four girls, barely the teen’s age, with white gloves and identical olive green jackets and pants stood firm.
Four pairs of black pumps were in straight order.
Four neat hats sat perfectly on the hair held with blue-white striped loops.
"For me, they look on average," says Mr. Tang.
"Models are pretty."
Several governments have already tried to polish the image of China's city inspectors.
In a city, all new applicants must have a university degree.
The province of Guangzhou introduced a bright blue uniform instead of the grey-green ones.
Wuhan in Central China replaced violence by Niederstarren: in 2009, 50 officials circled around a incorrectly positioned snack car and stared at the operator until it packed in after half an hour and left the place.
Xindu, a district in Chengdu with 680,000 inhabitants, wants to change the image fundamentally.
Since 2003 13 women have been strengthening the urban police stripes. They have been selected specifically because of their appearance, their good figure and their youth.
They're supposed to give the gross police a softer, feminine aspect.
Unfortunately, too, Scarlett Johansson would hardly succeed in improving the bad picture that the Chinese have of these city orders.
That's right, the critics say.
Unlike the police, these officials are only allowed to enforce municipal law by means of fines or other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese media routinely show another picture.
In January 2008, officials in the province of Hubei beat a viewer to death when she filmed a protest against a garbage dump with his cell phone.
Last year, a training manual of Beijing officials was stolen and published on the Internet, describing how criminals can be beaten without bloodshed.
This year a Shanghai watermelon dealer suffered after a handful of five officials brain injuries.
A violent video game that can be downloaded from the Internet shows officials trained in China in an attack on street dealers.
"Chengguan frightens the government," the national newspaper China Daily last year, after further controversy regarding tactics.
The newspaper demanded a "really thorough cleansing".
Skeptics are clearly inadequate in the current approach.
When the district sought eight female recruits per ad in October, an editorial in the Beijing Evening News asked whether the women had real tasks or should only serve as an optical distraction.
Probably both.
According to job listing, women aged 18 to 22 were sought with good figure and "harmonic facial features".
They should be above average - over 1.5m or 5 feet, 2 1/2 inches.
The employment relationship ends with the age of 26.
According to officials, the work for women over 25 is too hard physically.
"The most important thing is her image," announced an unnamed district official at the quasi government website Rednet.com.
"Whether the female candidates get the job, they first depend on their outer appearance, such as size, weight, facial features, etc."
Then come temperament and "inner qualities".
"Women Chengguan are like flower vases," he said, adding, "but they still have other duties."
Zheng Lihua, deputy head of the district's city administration, does not wish to agree with this description,
However, it admitted that in China scale specifications in job advertisements are not unusual for both sexes.
The same applies to uniform facial features.
Whether that is to be equated with good looks is controversial in China.
But people with disabilities or physical upsets do not need to apply.
"Unfortunately, we cannot use lambs or Buckliges here," said Mr. Zheng.
"Your image wouldn't be good."
Liu Yi, who patrols on the Baoguang square near a monastery, is 22 years old, has apple bags and a probably shaped mouth.
It did not feel as a sexist that so great a value is placed on its appearance.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asked with an ironic look.
Her colleague with the dikes, 21-year-old Xu Yang, commented, "We have the task of representing the image of the city."
According to their figures, they do not regret the short attitude, as they would have more ambitious career plans than simply to frighten dealers through the streets to prevent them from doing business.
Every morning the stretch deals with about twelve street dealers who try to sell as many breads and tofu dishes as possible on foot or on a bike before they are chased.
"Mr. Wang, please get out of here."
"We have told you so many times!" says Ms. Xu to a dealer who had fled on foot and had left his noodle kitchen attached to a bicycle cart temporarily in his wake.
According to officials, the activity is more monotonous than strenuous.
"It's almost every day the same," explains Huang Jing, 20, who studied sales in leisure time.
"All routine."
One reason for this is that the female officials are not allowed to confiscate the merchandise of the dealers, as their male colleagues did.
They can only threaten criminals to report to their male superiors.
This is intended to protect them from public outrages that officials in China are often exposed to.
This year hundreds of people ransacked from Kunming, the capital of Yunnan Province, after the rumor had curated, Chengguan officials had killed a dealer.
More than a dozen police officers and Chenguan officials were injured during the night incident, 14 government vehicles were thrown or burned.
Xindu has been spared by such acts of violence so far.
But unrest is not to be ruled out.
Only two blocks away from the quiet Baonguang square, where the female officials patroled this morning, gathered more than 50 people on one street corner.
Officials had confiscated a motorcycle that was repaired against the rules on the sidewalk instead of in a workshop.
The owner shouted Zeter and Mordio.
After 15 minutes of hesitation, the officials with a gruesome face set out for their vehicles and continued with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator of the male streife, remained behind. He turned his white name tag around to remain anonymous.
Like their colleagues, the coordinators - men over 40 - play a purely supportive role.
But they were not trained to present a clean image.
"Sometimes we go verbally."
"Sometimes but also physically," explains Mr. Li soberly.
"Most of the time the people begin to fight."
Prosecutor will not sue Senator Ensign
Public prosecutors of the Ministry of Justice have acquitted Senator John Ensign of the accusations that were raised against him after his affair with a former election assistant and his attempt to provide her husband with a lobbying activity, announced the senator's lawyers on Wednesday.
This decision ends the most serious accusation against Senator Ensign, the Republican from Nevada. Until the scandal that caused headlines across the country and put a damper on his career, he was considered the Republican candidate for 2012.
As Senator Ensign's office announced, he was "highly pleased" about the judgment after the one-year investigation.
However, the Senate's ethics committee could still impose a discipline.
According to Ensign's lawyers, they were informed by the Ministry of Justice that the investigations against Senator Ensign had been terminated and that there were no further charges in this case.
The Ministry of Justice did not want to comment on the case.
The verdict was a surprise for many ethics lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice. In your opinion, there was sufficient evidence that Ensign had ignored the lobbying ban.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents that were published for the first time in October 2009 in the New York Times gave rise to the assumption that Ensign Douglas Hampton, one of his constituencies, helped to make random orders to buy his silence over an affair with Hampton's wife Cynthia.
Cynthia Hampton worked as treasurer during an Ensign election campaign.
Ensign contacted some political friends to provide Hampton with work. According to the documents and interrogations, he took over for her after setting Hampton's lobby work.
Since Hampton was recently in Ensign's election team, he was not allowed to do lobbying for his former employer or the entire Senate for one year.
According to Ethics experts, the unusual agreement between Ensign and Hampton, which were closely friendly before the affair, opposed the so-called ban on the rotational-lobbykration.
According to the published indices, "it all seems to be an agreement and a violation of the rotating-door statues," says Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in the defense of clients who are in the hands of the government.
While the Ministry of Justice officially refused to announce the reasons for the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethican lawyers said that the Ministry appeared very cautious in taking up political charges after a large number of defeats followed by the media with great interest, including the decision last year to drop the charges against former Senator Ted Stevens for misbehavior's misbehavior.
Public prosecutors "are obviously terrible," said Melanie Sloan, president of the "Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington" Association (an organization whose aim is to combat corruption in US parliamentarians and governments), a group of lawyers who brought various charges against Mr. Ensign.
"This basically means that senior government officials can now assume that the laws do not apply to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, chief defender of Mr. Ensign, said in an interview that he had received a telephone call from a prosecutor on Monday and another day when he was told that the ministry would not raise complaints against his clients.
Mr. Ensign's defenseman had cooperated with the prosecutors to convince them that, as his office repeated in a statement on Wednesday, "acted in accordance with the law."
Mr. Coggins refused to explain more precisely the legal arguments he had made against the prosecutors.
"I'm not sure to go into the discussion details between the Ministry of Justice and me. Only so much is it said: We believe we have made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to terminate the investigations for a separate appeal by the Ethics Group, after which a payment of $96,000 from Mr. Ensign's parents to the Hamptons violated the Federal Election Act.
The election commission said there wasn't enough evidence that the money was anything but a gift.
NV Energy, a large company in Nevada, which for a long time supported the Senator, was one of the companies in which Mr. Hampton found help from Mr. Ensign lobbyists.
An e-mail from December 2008 shows that after Mr. Hampton was brought forward as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensing's Chief of Staff, John Lopez, had an interview with Mr. Hampton, in which he told him that he was "knocking" at the Ministry of the Interior because of a matter.
Mr. Ensign was also appointed for lunch with Mr. Hampton and another customer from Nevada, Allegiant Air, and asked the Transport Minister to agree to a meeting on behalf of the airline after this Mr. Hampton had ceased lobbying.
When last year for the first time information about this affair came to the public, Mr. Ensign apologized to his voters and gave up his position in the Senate where he had fourth in the rank of Republicans.
After many months of not being noticed, Mr. Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he was calling for a third term in the Senate.
In the announcement that Mr. Ensign is no longer the goal of police investigations, his press speaker, Jennifer Cooper, said that the Senator hoped that the Ethics Commission would follow the example of the Ministry of Justice very quickly and put his investigations in place.
"Senator Ensign is looking forward to continuing his hard work in the service of people in Nevada," she said.
Cheshire's call makes Twitter attentive
Half a dozen of them were typing in the crawalls in the courtroom.
In the minutes they sent their reports on cruel witness statements via Twitter.
At the end, according to the defense, there were more than 140,000 Twitter messages about the process of rape and beds chained children in a house that went up in flames.
On Thursday, the closely followed trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was accused of killing three members of a Cheshire, Connecticut family, will find an official end when the judge's appeal falls on the death sentence that the jury has pronounced.
However, Mr. Hayes lawyers have already filed applications before the court, which set out the reasons for an appeal and which will employ the courts for years.
One of the most provocative reasons is that due to intensive reporting on the process - even by the extensive use of Twitter by average reporters - there has been a "circus atmosphere" and so widespread, continuous penetration of lubricating details, so that the jury has been unreliablely influenced by public disarmament.
This opposition could lead the appellation courts to address the question of whether the new technologies will require new rules in the courtroom.
"Just as I have experienced it during this process, I believe that it is really a danger if the introduction of new technologies into the courtroom affects the right of every individual to a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Hayes' chief defender.
The presiding judge, Jon C. Blue, from the Supreme Court of the Chamber, rejected the requests by decision shortly last week, when he said that the New Media would be "prescribingly controlled", and that there was no evidence that the jury had been driven by passions.
But that was certainly not the last word in this matter.
For decades, court rulings have found that reporting on famous-infamous cases raises doubts about the fairness of a process.
In its historical decision of 1966, the Supreme Court of the United States lifted the judgment against Dr. Sam Sheppard, an osteopath from Cleveland, who was supposed to have killed his wife, and said in his decision that there would have been a "carneval atmosphere in the courtroom" because of the new media.
Some believe that the TV series and the feature film "On the Escape" are based on this crime.
Some lawyers say that court proceedings, which Mr. Haye's conviction considered half a century later, could follow the argument that new rules have become necessary to regulate the communication routes from the courtroom that were still unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard's fall.
"There is a good reason to worry about the influence of the new media in processes that are being persecuted by a broad public," said John J. Donohue III, professor at Stanford Law School, who has examined the death penalty in Connecticut. According to his report, it is arbitrarily imposed.
Professor Donohue said that some appellation courts could be fascinated by the idea that the restriction of surrounding communication from the courtroom could make the processes fairer.
The Twitter issue is only one of many who present Mr. Hayes' lawyers' lawyers to discuss for years and thus delay a conviction.
The defenders also claim, for example, that Mr. Hayes might have been pre-condemned when Judge Blue had not allowed them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them cruel crime photographs during the jurors' selection.
Some of the jurors have said to have photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48 years old, and their breeders, Hayley, 17 years old, and Michaela, 11 years old, they had filled with abominables.
The defenders say that they would also call into question the constitutionality of the death penalty constitution, and argue that the judge falsely exchanged a juror who had been a critic of the prosecutor, and that he would have exerted undue pressure on the verdict when he made the irregular decision to release the jury over the weekend.
The jurors were not isolated.
But their arguments about the influence of the detailed reporting on the process may be of the greatest interest.
In a verdict they filed last month, they noted that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed by the candidates during the election for the office of the governor and for the U.S. Senate.
They argued that the New Media had continuously rekindled the flames of emotions about the case.
"One such day-to-day drive of media pipes, cameras and reporters outside the courtroom," the lawyers wrote, "you haven't experienced it in New Haven before, and perhaps even nationally."
Your focus on Twitter reporting is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists said that the claim that these direct messages are more obese than reports, which are more slowly refunded, is a technical anti-terrorist view that is impoverishing reporting on future processes.
However, some lawyers said that appellation courts would often face the argument that social and technical changes require adaptation by the courts.
Mr. Hayer's lawyers reinforce this claim.
In her opposition, she referred to the decision of the Supreme Court in 1966, in which the conviction of Dr. Sheppard was withdrawn on the basis of the reporting and made it clear that the New Media required new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "represents Sheppard against Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can Holiness connect the separator?
After a campaign of swearing words and negativeity this week little courtesy broke out in Washington.
Is it the goal of a real two-party cooperation or a moment of illusion before you quickly return to the struggle of the parties in the capital?
The meeting on Tuesday between President Obama and Congress's leaders did not break into the major questions that were to be addressed during the so-called "lame duck session", which was held at the end of a government period in which no decisions were made.
According to all that one hears, it was not a polite discussion between two different sides nor a consideration of their shared responsibility to rule, but rather an empty episode of a party score collection.
The public meeting of the President's Budgetary Commission on Wednesday was also civilised, despite the political differences that persist between the members.
It seems clear that close interaction over a period of months creates mutual respect that conceals the ideological gap, which continues to separate members.
This is hardly enough to claim that a new era of cooperation has begun.
Both sides are now in a test phase - in which one of the other signs of willingness to cooperate and compromise, while one tries to weigh the limits of public opinion and the patience of the voters for a renewed party warfare.
Therefore, the meeting on Tuesday itself and its assessment by the participants was limited to a minimum of claims or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and too deep, as if one could expect a rapid change in the atmosphere that has dominated over the past two years.
Whether it's taxes, donations, health or expectations, the two sides are miles away.
Last but not least, the November election Washington voted mildly for a short time.
"No question, the tone has changed," said Pete Wehner, an official representative of the Bush government, who is now working for the "Ethics and Public Policy Center".
"This is inevitable after elections.
Elections arouse party passions that die again.
And that's good."
In some questions, especially in those on the agenda for the "lame duck session", Republicans and Democrats have little choice but to find a solution."
Bush's tax cuts end of the year, and no one supports that.
Both sides want to find a way to get some or all, whether temporarily or permanently.
Similarly, a compromise is to be expected with regard to the increased unemployment benefit, although only because Republicans cannot afford to believe that the preferred tax reductions for the rich, while refusing to support unemployed workers.
After the meeting on Tuesday in the White House, optimism has increased that one can agree on these questions during the "lame duck session" and at the same time ratify the New START Treaty.
But William Glaston of Brooking's initiation warns that successful cooperation on urgent issues of the lame duck session must not necessarily lead to permanent cooperation between the parties when the new 112th Congress is convened in January.
Instead, he says, a phase of nonconformity is likely, perhaps even inevitable.
"After the things that need to be done are done, this short-term psychology will turn into confrontation," he said.
Wehner is also skeptical - and this scepticism is shared by many - leading the courtesy to true cooperation.
"I see a lot of what is happening from today until 2012, as an advance, or shadow boxes, for the main event of 2012," he said.
The reasons for this have much to do with the presentation of the new Republican majority in the White House and with the tea party voters who have been serving their education.
However concerned the Republican leaders may be that they are too high poker, they know that they have to try to lower their promises to reduce government spending and put the health reform out of force.
These party lines are already evident in the first reactions to the recommendations of the Committee on Budgets, which include a tax reform and the raising of some taxes, the raising of the retirement age and the reduction of government expenditure.
Vice-Chairman Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles took over one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, in their own opinion, insisted so much on putting the deficit issue on the public agenda that they can no longer be ignored.
But they need 14 out of 18 votes within the Commission to make their plan an official recommendation and they fight very much to reach this figure.
The greatest resistance is found in the elected representatives of the panel, as in financial matters, at least today, there is little scope or little sympathy for compromises.
Galston predicts two phases in the fight between the White House and the Republicans in Congress.
The first battle will take place next year in the form of party conflicts when Republicans challenge Obama with regard to the state budget, taxes and the health system, later followed by a phase of greater two-party cooperation.
What will lead to this change?
Public opinion.
It has been proven that, despite the partyism of the current election, the majority of Americans still wish the two parties to work together.
If confrontation leads to a deadlock, as was the case in 1995, both parties must carefully pay attention to the public reaction.
Anyone who is always condemned to lose will have to change the course and seek the compromise.
In fact, this may be an optimistic view.
Participality and polarization are now larger than in the mid-1990s, and they seem to be a larger ideological gap between Obama and the Congress Republicans than they were then between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
At the same time, the activists of both parties see 2010 as a pure prelude to a far-reaching election in 2012.
In this way, the courtesy shown this week may be welcomed by many Americans.
But on both sides it will take much more effort to find a common denominator in the questions that remain separate from each other.
Transmitted US document portraits Moscow as port of corruption
The control of the city lies in the hands of the "Kleptocratie" and it passes on to Kremlin some of the bribery and protection money it collects. Thus, in February the American Embassy in Russia reported in a memo.
Both the police and the state security service extorted high protection funds so that they can maintain their expensive standard of living in Moscow, that is to say.
They collect money not only from legitimate transactions but also from organized criminal gangs.
Every layer of bureaucracy - what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called "the vertical authority" - takes its part from the money that the ladders travel up.
The memo sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle was published on Tuesday by WikiLeaks on his homepage.
The memo is based on sources whose names were edited.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still Moscow's mayor, and it accuses him of corruption.
He was fired by President Dmitry Medvedev in October, but there is hardly any evidence that in the meantime had been cleaned up.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a well-known construction firm, have repeatedly rejected corruption accusations over years, and he has won numerous slander charges against such accusations.
In September, he explained to a Russian television station when he was asked for a documentary that suggests he's corrupt: "It's crazy, it's dirty, it's dirty."
> An incredibly large number of Russians believe that their society is corrupt.
But it is unusual that, as in the Ambassador's report, individuals are called, and it is not heard that this is done by a diplomat of a foreign country.
"The direct link between Moscow's government and crime has led some to call them "distorted" and to the conclusion that the government acts more like a claptocrat than a government," says the memo.
"Criminal elements enjoy a "kryshna" (a term from the world of criminals/mafia, which literally means "roof" or protection), which extends over the police, the state security (FSB), the service authority (MVD) and the office of the prosecutor as well as through the entire Moscow government bureaucracy.
Experts have discovered a three-layer structure within the criminal world of Moscow.
"Luzhkov is at the top."
"FSB, MVD and the Miliz are on the second level."
"Recently, the local criminals and the criminal inspectors are following on the lower level."
"This is an incompetent system in which criminal groups in some areas close a gap because the city does not offer any help."
The report goes on to say that the FSB collected money from the largest companies and arrested the police small businessmen.
A source, that is to say, "explained that Moscow's business owners understand that it is best to get the protection of the MVD and FSB (and not the organized crime) because they have not only more weapons, resources and power than the criminals, but also because they are protected by the law."
"For this reason, the protection from criminal gangs is no longer in demand as it used to be."
The memo notes that while collecting the money is comprehensive, the protection itself is not very modest; even those who pay are sometimes arrested.
Those who do not pay find their business very quickly closed - due to one or other pretext.
Medvedev has talked several times about fighting corruption, but at the same time has noted that he has made little progress.
The memo of the message contains descriptions of men who go to Kremlin with suitcases that were probably full of money.
"In his fight against corruption Medvedev has to rely on the bureaucrats," said Georgy Satarov, director of Indem, a Moscow expert commission, recently in an interview.
"But he's part of this bureaucracy."
"It is no part of the political class because a political class in Russia no longer exists."
Without politicians, without opposition, without a separation of powers, he says corruption is inevitable.
Worldwide, as estimated By the way, corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
The country ranked in place 154 of a recent study on the global perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (country is listed by "most corrupt" as "most corrupt".
The revelation of the memo of the American Embassy, which happened late in Moscow in the late evening, will certainly trigger misdemeanour within the Russian government, although, as Luzhkov can be accused of the Moscow errors, it may also be a possibility for the Kremlin to claim that one solves the problems.
In an interview with Larry King for CNN, Putin claimed that WikiLeaks documents could be falsified and responded angryly to the revelation that American diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth is that it is about our interaction, which is an important factor in internal policy in this country," he said.
"But to be honest, we would not have expected this to be done with such an arrogance, with such pressure and so unethical manner, you know."
Khmer Rouge Veterans Forced to Confront with the Past
In a slightly lit, concrete classroom with dirty and flattening walls, the director of the Anlong Veng High School reminds the man who built him of the later Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader and he took care of his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42 years.
Because of his brutality during Khmer Rouge rule known as "the butcher", the commander remains popular in this remote former Khmer Rouge-Hochburg in north-western Cambodia, where he has built hospitals and bridges that have developed infrastructure and where thousands of former soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the capitulation of the Khmer Rouge to the government, many years of followers in Anlong Veng are challenged.
In April, a local truth and reconciliation forum allowed victims to face public confrontation with the people who once supported the regime.
In June, the government distributed a school book, which for the first time tells children of former soldiers the history of Khmer Rouge.
And in July a joint tribunal of the UN and Cambodia for the first time condemned a former member of the Khmer Rouge when it sentenced the former chief of the infamous Tuol Sleng torture chamber, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duke, to 35 years in prison.
With each of these developments the fear of Khmer Rouge Veterans Alnlong Vengs increased, making their efforts to reconcile and reintegration into Cambodia's society difficult.
"There is still rejection and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything," said Zhang Youk, head of Cambodia's Documentation Centre, an independent organization that researches the regime.
"For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"It divides even families."
During the Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, it was estimated that 1.7 million people were executed or that they died of diseases, overwork or hunger.
When the Vietnamese invaded and in 1979 the Pol Pot-Ied government fell, the remains of the regime and its military fled to the border of Cambodia to Thailand.
Here, until December 1998, when the last movement capitulated, they spread unrest.
When Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerilla war from their base in the west of the mountains and jungles of Cambodia, Ta Mok moved to the next generation in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, when a UN-funded peace agreement led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to pass over to government, leading to the capitulations of Ieng Sary 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan 1998.
Pol Pot died in 1998 of a natural death, and Ta Mok, who had not surrendered, was arrested by government forces at the Dang Mountains in 1999.
He died in 2006 in the prison of Phnom Penh, where he was waiting for his trial.
When their patrons no longer protected them, most of the former Khmer Rouge fighters fled into the crushing poverty of rural Cambodia and many kept the movement in nostalgic memory.
Although a few elite officials of Khmer Rouge kept their local government posts because they laid down their weapons, the simple soldiers remained poor, uneducated peasants.
"These people have benefited very little from the surrender," said Sok Leang from the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation, which holds public forums throughout Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
"They are rooted in the utopian agrarian ideology of the regime."
"They grew up without any professional knowledge."
Sor Lim, 55 years old, who had joined the Rhmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought for Anlang Veng in the jungle before he settled in 1998 to lead a life as a poor rice farmer.
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"Ta Mok has given everyone something to eat."
"But now life is hard because we have to take care of ourselves."
The running Khmer Rouge Tribunal has raised concerns here as well.
In the beginning of next year, the court will try to bring Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife as well as Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister to court.
The order of the court is to condemn the old leaders and those who are primarily responsible for the atrocities, but it is not said whether it will pursue further actions beyond these four cases.
This has contributed little to mitigating the fears in Anlong Veng.
Current media speculations have concentrated on Im Chaem, 64 years old, who had been district chief in Manteay Meanchey Province during the Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she had told the documentation center of Cambodia that she had led the construction of the Trapeang Thomms, a project in which thousands of forced workers probably died.
On a hot evening In the Chaem from work on the fields came back to their wooden house on a dirty street outside of Anlong Veng.
When the sun threw long shadows on the withered grass, In Chaem, it turned out to discuss their past at the Khmer Rouge.
If the court charged her, she would refuse to go, she said.
"Cambodia lives in peace and stability," she said.
"If there were no more persecutions, there would be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who fled the Khmer Rouge in 1878, also repeatedly warned against the fact that the situation would become uncertain, the court would charge more suspects, although experts and historians discuss this.
"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But the confrontation with the past is what Cambodia has to do in order to be able to move forward, said Zhang Youk of the Documentation Centre.
"Reconciling with Khmer times means bringing together the broken pieces," he said.
"It's our duty to put these broken parts together, so that we can understand how everything is done."
The Centre created the first government-approved schoolbook on Khmer Rouge, the 75-page "History of Democratic Cambodia".
It distributed the book in June in Anlong Veng as an annex to the history book for the High School of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
As often in Cambodia, the young people in Anlong Veng know little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the connections of the city to the regime.
Touch Valeak, aged 19, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said that the new schoolbook helps students to understand an important part of their history.
But his parents responded skeptically when he brought the book home to read it.
"My family rejects many parts of the book and the court," he said.
"They are suspicious because they are not sure how many people are condemned by the court."
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process complex and complicated, said Sok Leang.
But the public forums, the school book and the court gradually gain influence," he said.
The Khmer Rouge still has a powerful attraction here.
Upstairs in the Dang mountains lead a path that is overcrowded with plastic garbage to a rectangle of black rust, covered with a rusty sheeted roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned here after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31 years old, a mobile salesman on the street, said she didn't know much about the man who had been burned here.
"But he has a strong spirit and many people here go to him to pray," she said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday, and later on the day she wanted to go to Pol Pot's last retirement place, where she's going to take a bush of mature bananas - hoping to bring her luck.
Belarus agrees to cease collecting weapons-capable uranium
In a surprising victory for President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear materials worldwide, Belarus's government announced on Wednesday that one will no longer collect highly enriched uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was announced in a joint statement following a meeting of the Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton with the Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov in an additional article of the Security Summit.
The U.S. government had tried for years to convince Belarus that it would no longer collect highly enriched uranium, and it seemed that last spring it was a obstacle.
But official US government told Washington Post that over the past two months two secret agreements have been concluded with Belarus to remove 187 pounds of weapons-capable uranium from a Belarusian research institute.
This prepared the stage for the agreement on Wednesday to remove the rest of the material – according to an official employee who remains anonymous due to the sensitivity of the topic, about 500 pounds.
The agreement seems to be one of Obama's most important findings "Nuklearm Security Summit of the 47 Nations" of April, which had excluded Belarus.
And it was obviously good enough to secure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next summit in 2012.
"I was really thrilled by the fact that they want a seat in the nuclear safety summit (from 2012).
"This proves to me that it works," said Ken Luongo, President of the Global Security Partnership, a group to promote nuclear safety.
Clinton called the agreement "a very important, important step" of Belarus.
Obama promised in April 2009 in Prague to secure all precarious nuclear material within four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries to get rid of their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A dozen countries did so under the government of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama's nuclear security summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko explained that the nation will never give up its uranium.
"How do you keep high enriched uranium - hundreds of kilos, which is basic weapons, and less enriched uranium," said Lukashenko back then.
"This is our raw material, we won't make any dirty bombs and we won't sell it to anyone."
"We use it exclusively for research purposes, that's all".
Belarus still approached the US a few months ago when it showed interest in the meeting of an agreement.
The first start to remove the Uranian Belarus in October was particularly complicated because the material was slightly irradiated, say officially.
It was loaded into a special train, which takes more than 1,300 miles to a Russian factory for storage and disposal, say officially.
The second launch was decided on Monday and was carried out by plane according to the official.
The US government pays $14 million for these efforts, with much of the money flowing into Belarusian research with poorly enriched uranium, which cannot be used for nuclear weapons.
"This was extremely cautiously coordinated and coordinated to build confidence", which led to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, a representative of the Ministry of Energy, who is working on the reduction of global danger.
The James Martin Center for Non-Extensive Studies estimates that Belarus had at least 88 pounds of weapons-like uranium this year and hundreds of pounds of high enriched uranium.
Belarus intends to disband its warehouse by 2012.
The relationship between Belarus and the United States has been tense for many years, mainly because of Lukashenko's misrepresentation of human rights.
But the statement from Wednesday suggests a possible approach.
"In welcoming the progress of these global security issues, the United States of America and Belarus announce that increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central issue in improving bilateral relations and it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens," she explains.
No objections from the Spanish Government against CIA flights
The Spanish government had no objections to the CIA flights with Taliban and Al-Qaida prisoners over Spanish state territory to Guantánamo, as shown by a telegram of the U.S. ambassador in Madrid.
This reflects the documents revealed by Wikileaks and forwarded to the daily newspaper "El País" (by cable). It is added that the former Deputy Governor María Teresa Fernández de la Vega demanded that the Spanish government be informed "to prove that foreign aircraft flying over Spain are adequately monitored."
The former North American Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega met in June 2006, following the publication of a report from the Council of Europe in which aid for human rights-absorbing practices in a dozen countries, including Spain.
The Deputy Government Secretary admitted that the Council's report "has taken Zapatero off the ground" and confirmed that Spain had nothing to hide on this matter.
"De la Vega underlined that Spain had no objections to the intelligence flights over Spanish territory."
"You just want to be informed", so as not to be "unpreparedly surprised", reports Aguirre via cable.
The former Foreign Minister, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, also pointed out to the ambassador that the Spanish government "does not want to pay great attention to this matter, although the government has little influence since they lie in the hands of the judges."
In January 2007, the prosecutor Vicente González gave the message that he would not block the judicial initiative to request the declassification of the documents of the Spanish Secret Service Center (CNI) and the Minister of Defense on CIA flights.
"These reports do not contain any critical or sensitive information," the ambassador explained after a conversation with the prosecutor.
Nevertheless, the US was more concerned about the "apparent coordination between the Spanish prosecutor and the German prosecutors" than about the declassified information of the CNI and the Ministry of Defense.
"This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to use discreetly between governments," laments Aguirre.
At a lunch in March 2007, when the U.S. ambassador and Spanish Interior Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba took part, the latter commented that "although the Spanish judges are madly concerned about their independence and do what they consider appropriate", he gave his employees instructions to "avoid rhetoric comments in order to defuse the tension."
The ambassador also expressed concern about the PP's approach to this matter.
"Despite their generally pro-American attitude, our experience teaches us that the PP will not doubt it, in an indication that the government of Zapatero's US actions, which could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, will tolerate or deliberately ignore capital, even if these revelations could have a negative effect on the US government," he emphasizes.
The child murderer confesses that she has been on the Internet over the "mortem" of the motherhood.
The young woman spoke of the child when she was already dead and she had a blog: "Terror in a Galician way"
Monica Juanatey Fernández is on the Internet "Muki".
Under this nickname, which she shows up from a small age, she keeps in touch with a cusine and at least one friend. Both come from Noia, a village in the province of La Coruña in which she was born.
The notifications are from 2008.
To understand these, you need to know their love life, which the daily ABC reconstructs on the basis of testimony from their family members.
The 30-year-old Galician woman started a relationship with Iván Túñez, an industrial.
She held a year.
Shortly after she dissolved her relationship, she was known to be pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his, but his former never let him perform a DNA analysis.
Just after that, she started a different relationship.
The chosen was Alberto, a young man from Lousame, a neighboring municipality.
She lived with him for a long time.
César lived with them.
When the young woman went to the Balearic Islands to look around on the labour market, the little one stayed with her partner, who even accompanied her to Palma for a week.
But from the content of their messages it can be concluded that their love relationship broke and they separated.
In March 2008, she is alone on Menorca and writes: "Alberto is very strange and mad because I came here to work."
"When I told him that, he found it good, but now he sees, of course, what it means to be alone with the boy all day long and not to be free, to be able to do and leave what he wants."
She later mentioned a message she just received on the phone: "I want you to come back this month or give me an address to which I can send you the boy."
She complains: "If he doesn't like me leaving the boy with my mother, I'll pick him up when I get back."
In May she says of returning to her village: "This week I'm going there, but I'm only going to stay there until the 19th because I have to introduce myself to a job on 20th if I don't want to lose it."
She explains she'll take her firstborn with her when everything goes well.
"He will be with him where he must be, that is, with me. Never in life will I leave him with anyone but my mother," a dubious intention when considering their bad relationship.
In July there is another mail.
When she writes it, it is assumed that the boy who came to the island on the 1st of the month and was allegedly murdered on the 10th is dead.
"On the one hand, César is satisfied, on the other hand not."
"On the one hand he's with me and the place he likes a little bit, but on the other hand he has to go to school every day."
She's talking about moving to Mallorca.
"There he (the boy) will attend a summer course, so I have fewer expenses for the child girl."
On 17th: Memories and Complaints.
"A giant kiss from César who asks me when you're coming."
"Alberto says he sent me some videos on the e-mail. You see, if he wants, he finds me such a shit."
On 30th another: "The boy is doing well. He goes to a summer course to learn Catalan."
From Víctor, her current partner, there is one: "He shoots me money."
On the Internet, in Anime and Mangabelogs, there are messages from her.
She even had her own blog in MySpace, which is now locked, and in which she called herself "Muki, the prisoner."
"Terror a la gallega (heading) ".
The last man who lived with her, a sworn huntsman, explains having a conscience bite because he feels guilty.
He can't believe everything happened because she hadn't told him that she was a single mother.
Last night, Monica was transferred from the Center for Prisoners to Menorca to Palma Province Prison.
The defendant, Carlos Maceda, said that she could not remember the outcome of the case, "and she had no intention of harming the little one."
Before, however, she had been able to drown César in the bathtub and store his body in a suitcase.
Defense and prosecution requested a psychiatric opinion.
Partido Popular won 4 seats in Congress and PSC lost 9
With the results of 28 November, PP could play a decisive role in the cities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona
Following the significant increase in votes and MEPs in the last regional elections, the PP is already looking at the parliamentary elections - preferring or not. Its expectations are more than positive, because the number of votes this party has achieved in these elections is usually twice as high as in the elections in Catalonia.
For example, the Catalan People's Party received 610,473 votes in the 2008 parliamentary elections, while in the 2006 regional elections this figure was only 316,222.
On the last Sunday, the PPC scored 384,091 votes.
If this rising trend - the result of the redirection of the PSC's share of votes and the binding of the PP election - should persist, the PP analysts predict that the PPC could rise from 8 to 12 Congress members during the parliamentary elections, while CiU would also win four (it now has 10) and PSC would lose at least 9 MPs (from 25).
These calculations demonstrate the fundamental importance of Catalonia for PP and PSOE.
According to the People's Party's analysis, the ERC would lose a Member - at present it has three - while ICV would hold its Members or gain one.
However, if the election calendar is maintained, the next date with the municipal elections will fall in May 2011. Even then the People’s Party (PP) can be the tongue on the scale to put an end to socialist domination, in four provincial capitals and with its majority in Barcelona City Council, one of the largest city administrations: 661 million euros for 2011.
Both the Nationalists and the People's Party agree that PSC will lose the cities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, in which the Socialists will not achieve a majority or have access to their traditional allies (ERC and ICV).
According to the Republican debacle, it is not predicament that this party will lose its representation in the Barcelona City Council, in which it will have to reach 5% of the votes.
The PP, on the other hand, recorded an increase in its vote in the four provincial capitals and could become a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced to be able to play the main role in Tarragona’s revolution. There they had ruled in front of the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros, together with PP.
And Lérida, the PP is only 500 votes behind the PSC. The mayor, Angel Ros, has good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during the last campaign they met several times.
In other important places, such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus, the People's Party has also been able to show a significant increase.
The PP is currently represented in 34 city councils of Catalonia and aims to create lists in as many places as possible.
The Catalan cell provided Al Qaida with thousands of passports
In addition to the seven arrests in Barcelona, there were three more in Thailand
The seven Pakistanns arrested by police officers from Barcelona and Nigerian formed the jihadist cell controlled by Thailand, the various al-Qaida groups, including the "movement to the liberation of Tamil Eelam" (LTTE) and "Laschkar e-Taiba" (Let) - the latter was author of the attacks in Bombay, which demanded 106 dead in 2008 - with passports.
The Spanish Ministry of the Interior attaches great importance to these investigations, which goes so far as to ensure that the Al Qaida counterfeiting apparatus has been "weaked" with the "Operation Kampai" and "so with its ability to act".
The researchers assume that in the two years when the cell was active in Catalonia, thousands of passports were sent to Thailand, where they were faked and then sent to the groups from which the criminal galaxy Al Qaida is composed, so that their "combaters" could easily cross the borders of European and other Western countries.
The detected cell is not the only one in the jihadist network that was active in Europe. Therefore, other European police units have also participated in the investigation, in addition to the Thai investigation bodies. It is not excluded that in the next few days, there will be similar attacks in the EU, such as those carried out last Tuesday in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (the Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Ifikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were arrested) another was carried out in Thailand where the Pakistan Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt as well as the Thai Sirikanlaya Kyibumung were arrested.
They had been led by Bangkok from the cell established in Spain and other European countries.
The Catalan network - some of which had been destroyed in 2009 - was especially stolen by tourists passports according to the requirements of the so-called "International Islamic Front".
This means that the documents were issued on the names of men aged 25 to 45 and had to be valid for several years; they were not allowed to display a visa stamp.
In the research circles, it is underlined that until now no links have been established between the people arrested in Catalonia and the attack in Bombay, although the author of this attack, "Laschkar e-Taiba", was one of the recipient groups of passports stolen in Spain and falsified in Thailand.
Nevertheless, it should be recalled that several thousand dollars had been sent from a money transfer company a few days before the Catalonia attack, which were "invested" in the purchase of prepaid cards for mobile phones, which were later used by the members of the "command" that put an end to the lives of 106 people.
The police confiscated an extensive documentation.
PP calls for a postponement of the tax agreement by Mas
The president of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, yesterday took the opportunity to present Artur Mas personally their conditions in support of his accession as Prime Minister of the Generalitat, which are not different from those already established during the campaign and can be combined with the priority of the economic recovery and the omission of regionalist independence adventures, such as a financial compensation agreement proposed by the regionalist leader at the height of his mandate.
The president of the Catalan People's Party turned to Artur Mas, who gave her the 18 MEPs who had won her last Sunday - a point that is more than sufficient to feel indispensable, because the candidate of the bourgeois-regionalist CiU party is dependent on the fact that at least one of the opposition parties is present in the vote when he takes office.
The future alliances that the regionalists want to enter the Congress during the forthcoming parliamentary elections depend on a possible event with the PP. However, the talks that Mas is currently holding with the other party leaders are about Catalonia.
With regard to PPC's party chairmen, the PPC demands that, in support of the accession of the PPC, "all discourses concerning the sovereignty and independence of Catalonia" as well as an agreement on the financial balance between the State and the Autonomous Region - similar to the Basque Country - and which the party leader of CiU even wants to subject a referendum to the back.
Both political leaders are in common that they want to make the built-up political apparatus of regional administration slender and abolish inheritance and gift tax.
The details of the negotiations on Mas's entry into office are dealt with by PPC Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who announced a hard opposition - and Joan Herrera (ICV). Today he will meet with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidariat Catalana).
The Altenpflege confirms that the deaths are not due to "missing measures"
The owners of the Altenheim in Olot do not rule out that their caregiver killed over eleven elderly people
The officers of the La Caritat in Olot, Gerona, gave a press conference yesterday, in which they found out what damage the criminal acts of Joan Vila Dilmés - the caregiver who had killed at least eleven old people during his work for which he was responsible - had caused the establishment.
The head of the Old Care Center, Joan Sala, joined his lawyer Joan Cañada, in court and announced that "La Caritat wants to sue the responsible person (for the deaths)", but "the law and our liability force us to accept the trial and civil liability".
The institution must not only lose a social reputation, because it did not determine the criminal acts of the caregiver in time, but now pay a high amount of compensation calculated by the legal representatives of the victims' family members.
Joan Vila Dilmé stated that the first crime dates back to August 2009 and that he has continued to murder since then.
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the old nursing home - since he suspected that no doctor had personally examined the deceased, but the formalities due to their age and illness were processed by telephone.
The head of La Caritat denied this point all around and stated that "definite measures could not have been the reason for the incidents."
La Caritat's lawyer added that "in the dispute there were no indications of negligent acts of a person other than the accused."
He was baptized as a "death angel" before yesterday 11 murders and declared that the first crime was committed on August 29, 2009 and that he had murdered the second old lady one and a half months later.
In this case, he killed with an overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime in which he had administered a mixture of various sedatives.
The head of La Caritat stated that the access of the staff to the medications is only difficult to control.
The insulin syringes and the sedative cocktail used the caregiver in six out of nine crimes committed to free the patients from their suffering with death.
But the results of the laboratory tests will show whether Vila is lying and actually chooses for his first victims a less cruel death, or whether he burned it from within, by administering it to them, as he did, according to confession, to three women he murdered between 12 and 17 October.
In La Caritat one does not give the caregiver’s statements any faith, not even as to the number of committed murders that could be quite more. This attitude is justified by the fact that Vila had made very different statements in court and that it makes no sense to change his procedure suddenly after eight successful murders.
They say they made themselves available to justice for this reason and to clarify the scope of these incidents.
European Central Bank Draught Bearings (ECB)
Yesterday, investors strongly responded to the threat of the ECB President Trichet, who warned that "markets should not underestimate our response."
The risk increases of the euro-persipherians have increased dramatically and the shares of European banks have increased by more than 5%.
However, we should not underestimate the possibility that the ECB may be able to deceive itself and that the euro has hardly given rise to concerns.
The events of yesterday are typical of an illiquid market, which to the extent that it breaks up again, but due to the closure of short and highly speculative positions.
The institutional investor will not lose his fear for a long time.
Today, a month ago, the European Central Bank called on us to reverse our liquidity measures, which the ECB will have to withdraw for the fourth time in two years tomorrow, and probably a number of times in the future.
The Bundesbank called for the termination of the plan for the purchase of sovereign debt as these were ineffective, as well as for the abolition of all exceptional temporary liquidity measures. Only a week-long access should be maintained.
Following the crisis in Ireland, we expect the current liquidity measures to be extended "at least until March" and the quarterly calls for tenders with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity by at least June.
We also expect the bond purchase program to continue and give a strengthening signal.
If the expectations created are not met, the excellent response of yesterday's markets will be thrown back and when stubbornly insistence on taking back our liquidity measures, only God can help us!
Just as at the ECB meeting in May, where the bank confirmed that the purchase of government debt would not be considered and the markets would collapse, this story could be repeated tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May, she showed her teeth and on Wednesday she said she had already bought a lot of them, thus provoking a new collapse of the market.
Yesterday, the auction of one year's national titles in Portugal was quite weak.
The government asset management accounted for only 500 million to 5.28%, compared with 750 million to 4.81% in the previous auction.
Nevertheless, the interest rates in Portugal fell by 30 basis points throughout the curve, reflecting a change in perception of the markets according to the words Trichets.
Allied and Bank of Ireland's debt log figures have been published in Ireland.
The sum is estimated at around 10,000 million short-term and possible additional 15,000. There is time to February to acquire private capital or these banks will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has lost its credibility completely after it has not recognized the problem of stress tests in July, the figures in the rescue plan are acceptable and help to reduce uncertainty.
However, the government will have to receive parliamentary consent to its new budget next Tuesday, and since it still does not have sufficient support, Ireland is still a source of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel made its discourse more moderate with regard to the Summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December. There, political unity is required to show that we play the same score together.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the other countries want the ninth symphony of Beethoven.
The Spanish President of the Government presented yesterday the plan of action to be adopted by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous regions, such as financial institutions, the reduction of government deficit, liberalisation, privatisation and employment creation measures.
The double effect of Zapatero and Trichet explains why the Spanish stock exchange has increased by 4.5 percent, twice as much as the rest of the European stock exchanges.
Compared to February, the response of the government and the Spanish Central Bank was fast and convincing, and we benefit from the surprise effect.
Today, there is a significant auction of a three-year government bond that will benefit from the Trichet effect. That is why we are relying on a strong demand that will eliminate all doubts about our debt.
For Spain, the application for an aid plan would be a self-official.
We would receive liquidity that we do not need. The Treasury has 40 billion euros available, three times as much as in March. Interest rates are extremely expensive and access to markets would be closed in time.
Nevertheless, our strategy should correspond to Caesar's wife's motto: "Now not only counts being, but also the appearance."
Only courage, we can do that!
The Chairman of the Board of Directors of Eulen, at the request of his children, will convene the company meeting of Vega Sicilia
The storm in the open conflict of the Álvarez family, owner of the companies Eulen and El Enebro, does not fade away.
David Álvarez, founder of the company, will challenge the shareholder meeting of El Enebro, which will take place at the request of five of his seven children on the 16th, as he considers them to be "absolutely void". His children will try to obtain a majority to control the company's administrative bodies - the owner of the estate Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his children Jesús David and María José prepare the legal measures for a new judicial chapter in their fight for control of part of the group.
The founder of the largest holding company services seems not to be ready to give up the control of El Enebro's institutions in his legal dispute.
He was expelled from the Board of Directors by five of his seven children, who were appointed members of the Board of Directors at the Shareholders' Meeting of 18 January of this year, which is already registered in the Trade Register.
El Enebro's shareholders' meeting, which was convened for 16th by the Court of Commerce No. 2 of Madrid, has triggered a new thunderstorm in the district of Álvarez's family.
The Judge's appeal to the assembly is the only legal way to ensure the convening of the Society's Assembly.
The last strategy of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta y Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is designed by David Álvarez as a "severe means of the applicants - his five children - to recognize by means of legal constituencies, fraudulent craftsmanships and legal abuses the annulled assembly of 18 January" as official spokespersons declare.
This argument is the basis for the attack of the assembly in the afterward, in order to declare it "absolutely void".
In June, the same protagonists, encased in discreet silence, tried unsuccessfully to convene a congregation on a judicial basis.
At El Enebro - the asset company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, alongside other assets - David Álvarez's seven children control 100 percent of capital.
On the other hand, according to family protocols, the founder of the service group calls for the right of use of 51% of the capital.
This is the actual background to which the judge has to decide in the hearing on the handling of the appeals for which a date has not yet been set.
Red Bull wins in the F1 with a secret weapon of Siemens
The cars are improved with a software in real time.
Since 2004, Red Bull has been entering the world of Formula One, her story has been marked by surprises and successes in this grand universe.
At the beginning, no one paid attention to the newcomer and despite his steep rise during the last season, during the final track in November, all of them placed on the victory of Fernando Alonso's Ferrari.
Without wishing to lower the abilities of the German pilot and world champion Sebastian Vettel or the power of the Renault engine, the "secret weapon" that the Multi Siemens Red Bull held has become a legend and thus created a winning team.
In reality, a powerful software for the simulation of processes put on the market by the German company for purposes that do not have to deal with car races in 2007.
This software program, called PLM, was used for the development of assembly chains in factories around the world, energy plants and high-precision instruments.
A faithful reproduction or simulation of a product or process is intended before it is actually built to avoid errors and unnecessary costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon’s cameras, Sukhoi’s aircraft and Nissan’s most famous commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of the Siemens Industrial Department, explains that with the use of this software in Formula 1 - Factory Red Bull "in a few hours, almost in real time" can design and execute the changes and improvements found on the races and during the tests.
Russwurm argues that in 1992 the average number of technicians worked in the racing stables, which were able to introduce no more than three or four improvements in one season.
Today, 180 highly qualified young people are employed in Red Bull's team. With powerful computer systems, they carry out analyses and all possible changes to the racing car.
Siemens Manager stated that the PLM software was able to analyse and improve all components of Red Bull racing cars, except the engine for which Renault is solely responsible.
The materials, the fuel, the aerodynamics and the safety elements are changed.
Thanks to advanced production facilities and high-tech autoclaves, the changes can be transferred from the virtual reality of the simulator to reality within less than 24 hours.
The only limit set for this crazy technical perfectionism is the 40 million dollars that a Formula 1 team is allowed to spend for its race in a season.
Red Bull has built its high-tech factory for the development and manufacture of its racing cars in a location 50 kilometres from London.
These are two buildings where visits - especially by journalists - are strongly restricted.
All that's happening there is Top Secret.
The workforce comprises 580 people, including the two pilots, the world champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
But Red Bull's true Formula 1 - Hero is undoubtedly the latest world champion Sebastian Vetell.
Further protagonists, whose support is invaluable and their reputation is zero, are hiding behind the enormous technological resources that the energy-drink manufacturer places in the service of his participation in race routes.
The plant's technological director, Steve Nevey, stressed that five years ago it was possible to say that the F&E R & D progress contributed 50 percent to the victory and that the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today, the share values have changed. Technology accounts for 85 percent of the success, while the contribution of the pilots is estimated to be 15 percent.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel and Webber can never be replaced by EDV because they are "unpredictable gladiators".
HP will open 20 own stores in two years with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) made his first exclusive shop in collaboration with his partner Ront Reyes yesterday in Barcelona.
It is the first of a network of sales of between 80 and 100 square metres, which the Multi intends to open in Spain for the next two years.
The company agreed this initiative with the already existing 16 multi-brand sales areas such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The vice-president of HP España, Helena Herrero, referred as an example to the converted shop at Gran Vía in Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with which HP has cooperated for thirty years.
The North American Group intends to set up 200 sales outlets in Europe by 2010, of which 20 are branches in Spain.
The first were inaugurated last week in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia). Barcelona is the third business.
Herrera did not want to reveal the upcoming openings, but did not rule out Madrid as the next destination.
The vice-president, who is also head of HP Personal Systems, assured that the philosophy of shop opening is always the same. She supports a local distributor with experience and industry knowledge.
The North American group of companies advises these and takes over the exclusive shop equipment (with interactive products to touch). In Europe, all stores will look the same.
In addition, HP is responsible for training the shop staff.
Helena Herrero said it was not about a franchising system and pointed out that the exclusive sales outlet network is intended to "optimize the customer service and advice of small and micro enterprises when purchasing and then even the packaging."
The shop in Barcelona has a pioneer pilot program that solves the technical problems of HP devices with warranty.
An online service connects to the technical headquarters in Maastricht, Holland.
"In this way, we can solve problems in ten minutes that sometimes take up to two days."
"This system has been developed especially for small and medium-sized enterprises and private customers, as the large companies already have their service contracts for technical customer service," said Helena Herroro yesterday.
Sabadell wants to 'clause' his rivals in three years a million customers.
The executive board member of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, is more optimistic than other managers. He believes that 2001 will be a tough year for the banks, but first rejects a new liquidity crisis and foretells the end of the debt war.
However, it foresees a collapse in interest rates which banks are trying to compensate for increases in fees and the prices for loans.
Sabadell expects to catch a million private customers in three years - an outstanding subject.
Sabadell has found the way to exploit the next three years, thus surviving in a very complicated economic environment.
The Bank will introduce a new three-year guideline in 2011.
The aim is not only to survive without using the FROB’s public assistance, but also to increase the market share of a million private customers - 700 000 if you withdraw the customers who will lose the bank - because this is the big challenge facing this bank, because it has been paying more attention to its business customers than its private customers until now.
This year it has added 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
The market share of private customers is 3.5 percent, while business customers account for more than 10 percent.
Another principle of the 2011-2013 business plan is the increase in productivity, saying austerity, cost reduction. The challenges facing the bank will be presented together with the annual financial report.
Only a few banks dare to set and publish goals in these difficult times, as the financial crisis has confused all the banks' plans worldwide.
In this year, Sabadell will complete its four-year guide plan Optima, initially designed for three years, but as a result of the market situation it was extended by one financial year.
The bank's main goal is to leave the savings banks.
During a breakfast organized by the APIE, Guardiola stressed that 2011 would be a "slow" year "with great reach".
The manager assumes that Spain is only "slow" out of the crisis.
In addition, it would be "very difficult" to "create work" in two or three years - fundamental for the survival of the banks.
Even if it assumes that the war for liabilities, which punishes interest margins, will have to pay off the risks that banks and savings banks will have to pay for their emissions to obtain liquidity, as a compensation for declining profit margins, to the price of loans.
"The issues of liquidity and financing are structural and they will exert pressure on loans."
"We didn't turn the cock off, but the interest differentials are very high," added Guardiola.
On Thursday, Banesto issued an order to its branch network to limit the granting of long-term loans and to increase interest differentials (cf. Cinco Días of 22 and 27 November).
The manager also agreed that the banks were currently pursuing the state of "increasing fees", but "within a competitive framework".
Sabadell's guiding plan is based on organic growth, even if the group, as always, does not exclude corporate transactions.
Not for nothing he assures that in Spain "greater companies are necessary."
"In the coming year everything will change," he assures.
He emphasises that the need for capital is currently "increasing" and does not exclude some Spanish financial institutions from slipping into red figures.
He considered that the FROB could replace the money market in captivating stockpiles.
After ensuring that Sabadell can survive a temporary closure of the markets, he resists the argument of some bankers who are already prophesying a new liquidity crisis.
He stressed that nothing could be done, but unlike the events in June, we could achieve short-term financing through repo transactions, thus depressing the crisis.
CECA excludes a second fusion wave of savings banks
The Director-General of CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, rejected yesterday's possibility of a fusion wave of savings banks and stressed the speed with which the industry is being restructured.
When the concentration process of the Spanish savings banks began, several savings banks did not participate in the first phase. They held the second round.
On the other hand, the Director-General of the Spanish Savings Association (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured that this second round would not take place.
"I believe that most of the mergers are completed, and the involvement of Cajasol in the Banca Cívica group cannot be considered as a second round, but rather adaptations."
"The largest part has been completed. It may be that we have thirteen or fourteen instead of seventeen, but all important processes are already completed. They have been controlled by Banco de España, who has strongly supported all processes."
In a breakfast organized by the Board of Directors and Managers of Aragonian (ADEA), Olavarrieta stated that the concentration process "was carried out as quickly as possible and that we must be satisfied with the timely process that was set in earlier times, not now, within the framework of the business plans with Banco de España", he stressed.
"The transition from 45 savings banks with an average of 28 000 million assets to 17 with each 75 500 million is a historicly incomparable process. The number of financial institutions was reduced by 62 percent and they are now much larger, so that we have fulfilled the Basel agreement," he said.
Olavarrieta said, "There would be a series of undisputed opinions about the slowness of the process, which revealed the unscrupulousness and insanity," because "Banco de España advises us to conclude in due time before the end of the year."
The Director-General of CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday assured that Spain had one of the most rigorous financing systems in Europe and, perhaps, in the whole world, and added that those who doubted this were "without deeper knowledge".
The manager noted that in the current economic economy, we need to "do not worry" about the situation of financial institutions and savings banks who have experienced a "very significant" concentration process that will be carried out "as soon as possible".
He also recalled that the Spanish banks had carried out the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July.
Zapatero and the red line Germany
Berlin has opted for the maintenance of the euro, but at the same time has established conditions for the entire European Union.
The tensions in the markets have triggered a double response from the government.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has submitted new adaptation measures, starting with tax reductions for small and medium-sized enterprises, the regulation of temporary employment companies or the withdrawal of 426 Euro support for unemployed persons who are not receiving unemployment benefit, to the privatisation of 49 percent of AENA, the administration of Barajas and El Prat airports, and 30 percent of the state lottery.
On the other hand, through the assistance of former president Felipe González, the Deputy Government Secretary, Elena Salgado, supports the critique of Chancellor Angela Merkel, who has challenged the current crisis.
How are these processes understood?
It should be assumed that Merkel's position is not a mistake in their public relations.
On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of redefinition of the euro.
Germany takes a fundamental new perspective on the design of our future, which collides with the maintenance of the ancient traditions of a large part of its partners.
In view of the resistance in Europe, one begins to speculate in Germany over three possible reasons from the crisis.
The first: a strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the south had to leave the euro area.
The second: The reintroduction of the German mark - although this is more like science fiction at present - supports a majority of the public opinion, about 50 percent of the population.
The third party: a reorganisation of the euro according to German proposals. This means: more macro-economic control; strict budgetary management; punishment of countries that violate the requirements; possibly the payment of some countries and the extension of the cost of potential adjustment measures to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been marked for some time. Therefore, there is no excuses now.
First of all in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission created incentives for deficits and the German government drew a constitutional reform out of the sleeve to prevent this from happening from 2016.
This was the first sign of the distinction between what Germany considered necessary (heavy tax plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France.
The second sign put the Central European country when Merkel painfully pushed out the decision to save Greece.
But the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public opinion and the public opinion were absolutely against a rescue of Greece.
Finally, in the last of October, Merkel has come to the fore with a clear position, calling for a reform of the agreements of the European Union to enable the rescue of a country and at the same time to oblige private lenders to bear part of the costs.
This position was interpreted as an anti-European one, as it pushed the Ireland crisis and all the following forward.
But their proposal, although a little bit sweet, has been adopted, and in the next few months we will be participating in the reform of the European Union, which will allow these measures to take place from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that does not intend to cross.
It says to everyone that, even if measures are now to be taken unpopularly, there will no longer be the old functioning of the euro from this date on.
In 2013, the birth year of a new currency area will be the year of severe punishment for the conflicting countries to be forced to declare themselves inability to pay and in this case the private sector will have to pay some of the costs.
Germany shows us that we need to take a strong growth rate, with high savings and investment rates, measures of consumption, improvement of productivity and competitiveness, and positive external balances.
The other alternative, which is based on debt and construction with huge holes in the balance of payments, as described by Spain in boom times, will simply not be accepted.
The offer is clear.
And we'd do bad about not understanding it.
It is not just a question of reducing the government deficit to three percent by 2013.
The demands are much harder.
And the worst thing we can do under these conditions is cheat ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulences will go into more rest.
And that we will use the opportunities offered to us by spring 2013.
It seems that Zapatero also understood this, and his double announcement (the promised reforms after the meeting with the major companies last Saturday and yesterday's announcement of new measures) points out that despite the criticism of Merkel's hypothesis of creating order in his own home, he has prepared his way.
But the red line drawn by Germany is there, and it doesn't look like something would change.
Among the options envisaged is that we should not exclude the euro area fully stuffed with few serious countries.
In this case, Germany could still tell us that it warned us.
Sports and regulation
Tricks like those of Alonso and Ramos in the game against the Ajax show inventive spirit, but not the will to bypass a sanction.
In the game of 23 November against the Ajax in the Champions League, the alleged exclusion of two players of the Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) led to a lot of ink being shed on whether it was an unsporting act or not and whether or not both players should be sanctioned by the UEFA.
As is widely known, the two players lost time a few minutes before playing (their team had already clearly won) and played several fouls so that the referee showed them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since the Real Madrid would lead its group, the two players will fulfill the prescribed penalty during the next league against the Auxerre and thus enter the next game phase without any cards.
Finally, the UEFA Disciplinary Committee punished the coach of the club, José Mourinho, with two games and the players with different amounts of money.
The provocation of a yellow card under such or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is more often found in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the Ethos - the unwritten but in this sport-based rules.
Part of the debate on the case presented is the fact that a team of the football club Real Madrid (which presents in his anthemne of nobleness and honor and on other occasions punished his players for similar incidents) played the main role, and the dramatisation by Mourinho, who added an episode to his long history as a theatrical and provocative technician.
In any case, the debate is about whether it expressly contradicts the principles of sports which are not expressly prohibited by the statutes, i.e. whether these acts constitute a regular bypass. In fact, this procedure adheres to the statutes of sports, but seems to be compromising its meaning.
In this matter, the damage caused by the sports spirit should be examined.
The sports spirit defends the physical integrity of the opponents, an aspect which was not threatened by these actions, because it was not an aggressive game.
Another aspect of a clean game is to avoid the unwarranted players from taking an unjust advantage from the counter-team. This also did not happen.
The paradox of the action of the players of Real Madrid is that it does not correspond to what we normally understand as false play or rule, because the circumvention of the rule has not been carried out secretly to avoid a sanction, but it should be as conspicuous as possible so that it is punished by the arbitrator.
The players waited and accepted the sanction joyfully.
Another question is what kind of advantage the offenders drew from the intentional fouls.
It should be stressed that the rival was neither put into a more unfavorable position nor raised benefits for the played game, because the obvious result of this action was that your team had to continue playing with fewer players.
It is also no useful strategy for the next game, because the club does not have these players.
The advantage is that players start the next game phase of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future game.
But this is a long-term, up to a certain degree uncertain advantage, as the team could eventually leave. In addition, the players will receive a sanction with this procedure and pass into the second card cycle in which they leave less than in the first cycle due to card accumulation.
This does not make it so clear whether it really is an advantage.
In the end, such practices are not directed against the sports spirit, which also includes strategic decisions to make the most of the rules.
In this case, the players did not want to avoid a sanction (that would actually be a clear case of rule-over), they wanted to choose when to make it.
They made a strategic decision without avoiding a penalty or fleeing from it.
Although the line between inventiveness and the regulatory environment is blurred, I believe that this matter is a clear case of inventiveness.
I have the impression that the polemics came about as a result of two factors: because it was about two self-exclusions and because of the type of provocated rule transfer.
The damage caused by these actions to the principles of sport is less ethical than aesthetic.
Offer offensive for customer catch for group Christmas dinners in Barcelona
This year the dictatorship of the calendar will drop avalanche of reservations on the days 16 and 17 December.
The celebrations paid by employees themselves are wide-ranging. They do not want to spend more than 20 to 30 euros.
Like the Turrón and Christmas lottery, there are group dinners in the pre-Christmas season that carry out Barcelona’s oxygen to the restaurant and leisure industry. However, as a result of the economic crisis, they trigger a price offensive to capture the large-scale customer segment: almost everyone would like to spend between 20 and 30 euros for lunch or dinner, confirm the surveyed entrepreneurs and associations.
To make accounting even more complicated, the calendar (silvester drops to a Friday) has dropped all orders in the week of December 13th, with the result of a avalanche of reservations of dinner on two top days (the 16. and 17.) and almost no orders in the week before.
Since 2008, when bad times began, many companies have ceased group dinner for household reasons.
To avoid this tradition, many workers pay it out of their own pocket.
Whatever the economic situation, low prices are demanded, confirmed by the president of the Barcelona Gastätte Board, Gaietà Farràs.
The representative of the umbrella association has so far not dared to predict what the holidays will look like this month.
"People are thinking about it sometime before they make reservations."
"You want to go out, but they pay great attention to the prices," he emphasizes.
The business will go well with those who "offer quality at good prices with a good service," he adds, and calls us to remember that customers save in times of crisis, which is why prices of 25 euros are most requested.
In a survey in various central restaurants, it turns out that the evening of December 17 will lead the providers to a collapse.
The Soteras group says that the demands for this Friday with the intention to spend less than 30 euros would boom. The group has adapted its menus with complete offers between 25 and 35 euros to the economic situation.
With another leading group, Andilana, which has 16 restaurants in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar has led to advanced reservations, even from the beginning of November.
"We have made the impossible to maintain the previous year's prices with menus for every taste from 19,95 to 30 euros," he explains.
At AN Grup, the leader of El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 locals, optimism is not lost after the second quarter of the year, the revenue is back to bloom and good, although it is overlooked for the Christmas business to be concentrated on a few days.
Sources of the corporate group stress that the 18th day will also be an overactive day with groups of friends who celebrate Christmas.
To the six group menus, a Christmas menu for 30 euros or more was added as a price hit. It seems that customers are ready to spend 10 percent more than in the previous year and want more details in return, such as Cava.
In some companies too, green sprouts can be seen, which is why employees are invited again. This gives the impression that the group dinners are back in the upswing.
On the side of the roof association Fecasarm (with mergers such as the bar, restaurant and leisure association of Barcelona), the deputy chairman, Enric Gomà, trusts to see the end of the tunnel and notes that the reservations in total are quite "living", although the customers "slept out a maximum".
However, the fun at the celebration has not gone back, no matter who pays.
Pakistani nuclear programme is causing great concern in the USA
Islamabad produces nuclear weapons "faster than any other country".
Wikileaks revelations confirm relations between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the North American Embassy in Pakistan and the US Department revealed by the Wikileaks Internet Portal confirms the enormous concerns posed by the Pakistani nuclear programme Washington.
On the margins of the clarification and juicy details that the documents on the content of the talks and the thinking of the accredited North American diplomats in Islamabad reveal that cooperation between the two countries is not strengthened in terms of atomic security, but rather "decreases" on the contrary, and that the unstable Asian country produces more nuclear weapons "to a faster rhythm than any other country".
In particular, the nature of the Pakistani nuclear program - that the weapons are not put together, but their parts are stored to make their destruction difficult in the event of a possible attack - prepare Washington sleepless nights.
The following risks are included by the Ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, in a report before the former head of the National Security Council, James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear installations to the area under attack by the Taliban, the probable distribution of nuclear material and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear material".
The large number of people involved in the nuclear and missile programs is no longer viewed by the US, but also by Russia as a supervising and reason to be careful.
"Pakistan must recruit strictly believing personnel to monitor nuclear installations; due to the low education and cultural level, extremist organizations have more possibilities to report people working on nuclear or missile programmes," said expert Yuri Korolev from the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs in a meeting with its North American counterparts.
New to the documentation revealed by Julian Assange's Internet portal is that the cooperation between the USA and Pakistan fails in terms of nuclear dissemination and the increased pace in which Pakistan produces nuclear weapons.
In May, an office of the Embassy, which describes communication with Pakistan as "frustrating", explains: "There is often no transparency; we do not receive any answers or they are rejected."
In another communication, Peter Lavoy, official of the state intelligence service for South Asia, confirms that "despite the economic disaster Pakistan produces nuclear weapons as quickly as no other country."
The Ambassador Patterson asks Washington during a visit by the Chief Commander General Ashfaq Kayani to "clarise" the responsible person that "Pakton's army has to suspend its tacit oversupply of terrorist groups."
On the hunt for Wikileak's boss
Obama appoints a high officer for the anti-terrorism struggle to prevent new revelations.
Interpol gives a red warning about the persecution and detection of Assange.
Everything related to Wikileaks and its founder, Jullian Assange, forms a complicated labyrinth in which the facts are difficult to clarify.
Yesterday, Interpol issued a "red warning" on the "finding and persecution" of Assange.
However, this is not a traditional order for arrest.
Besides, it's not new, it's from November 20.
It has nothing to do with the last revelation of over four million diplomatic documents from the US, but with the accusations of sexual abuse that the Australian must face in Sweden.
In addition, the lawyer of Wikileaks' founder, Mark Stephens, assures "the police knew where and how to contact Mr. Assange."
The International Police Authority, based in Lyon, France, issued the order on 20 June at the request of Sweden, but it was not announced until yesterday after receipt of the authority by the Swedish authorities.
The 188 Interpol countries are obliged to identify and find assange "to catch it for the time being and to deliver it."
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red warning, according to the organisation's statements, many Member States regard the red warning as a free letter for an arrestment - which must be carried out by the national police - in particular if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as it is the case of Sweden and England, where Assange is likely to hold up.
The approach emboldened Assange's lawyers, who published a letter yesterday informing them that Wikileaks' 39-year-old founder is ready to answer the Swedish authorities' questions via video conference.
They also recall that Assange requested the exit from Sweden and was given the permission of the prosecutor, who was given the permission of the so-called Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, Chief of Security of Stalin.
"This is like a hunt, not like a legal persecution," the letter accuses.
While the world is looking for him - and his mother of Australia is blaming her son's innocence - Assange is in an unknown place, but not silent.
On Monday, he gave an interview to the director of Time magazine via Skype from an undetermined place. During the conversation, he requested the resignation of the US Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be demonstrated that it was responsible for the arrangement of North American diplomats who had pioneered UN and thus violated international agreements signed by the US, it would have to withdraw," he said.
His opinion was condemned yesterday by the press secretary of the White House, Robert Gibbs, who called the application for withdrawal a "bottle and absurd".
"I'm not sure why we should pay attention to the opinion of a type with a website," he explained to CNN.
Obama himself has commissioned a high-level officer for the anti-terrorism struggle, Rusell Travers, to prevent new document revelations.
The attempt of President Barack Obama to pay less attention to Assange is contrary to the opinions expressed by conservative politicians and commentators in these days.
Congressman Peter King, who will chair the National Security Committee of the House of Deputies from January onwards, has asked the State Department to examine the possibility of setting Wikileaks on the list of terrorist organizations, "to confiscate their funds and to pursue anyone who supports them or makes a contribution."
Tom Flanagan, consultant to Canadian President Stephen Harper, had gone further, and he had to withdraw his statement that Assange had to "be murdered".
"Obama would have to turn him into a target disk and use an unmanned plane or something."
Those who did not apologize were Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate.
"Whoever it was who had information sent in the government, he was guilty of betrayal and everything that is not executed is too mild a punishment," he explained to the broadcaster Fox.
Puigcercós is looking for peace in the ERC with a wink for the Carod
The Republican leader allows the party to take a secret vote on its continuation in office.
Huguet proposes a more pluralistic government and the end of the general assembly principle.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found a recipe to get out of the way for the 60th time of an internal riot in the ranks after the loss of 11 Members and half of the voteless ERC.
The party chairman is aware that his threat of withdrawal is not enough for the former party leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira. But he also knows that the influence of this sector is today as weakened as its mentor itself and will not cause him the same headaches as other former currents.
Therefore, the leader of Esquerra tries to win the new critics with an eyewinker, which would secure his position up to the next municipal elections.
At the beginning yesterday, the more than 200 regional council members of ERC announced that they could secretly comment on their remaining in office.
With constituencies, not with raised hand.
If the Carodists wanted to miss the President, they could do so without having to fear repression.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid both the impression of division and the impression of submission among his person.
In several interviews he confirmed that he would feel unconfirmed with half the votes plus one and he added without a percentage, a result "in Bulgarian style" would also not be good.
The Carod nearby demands more from the president than from the party to make its office available. An inadequate gesture, since Puigcercós controls the supreme organ of the congresses.
But since they do not have a sufficient majority to force withdrawals, they will agree with the Management Board a plan of action from now until May.
To this end, they expect to be able to participate in the preparation of the document on strategic reorientation, which will be submitted to the Council on 18 May.
Its intention is to bow for Puigcercós. In return, it is to promise to present the conference in autumn 2011, which the party leader already considers to be a fact.
The ERC party chairman is of the opinion that "polyphony" is damaging stability and he strives once and for all to enable the organization to wash its dirty laundry behind closed doors.
In this sense, the article signed by the acting conseller Josep Huguet in his blog is symptomatic.
In view of the fact that Puigcercós is an ideologist, the holder of Innovació considered it a fact that the party chairman was "backed up in exchange against various goals".
He counted five of which two are in the foreground.
First, the "restructuring" of the board so that it represents at least 90 percent of the party members, that is the inclusion of new faces from Carod's environment.
The second could be the big news.
Huguet suggests that ERC should finally give up the general principle of assembly as a way of working.
He thus defends a reform of the Statutes, which should enable the Congresses to hold with elected delegates.
From the end of the assembly model - an exception to the Spanish party system - Puigcercós' team, which already fought for it at the last two congresses, as possessed.
In fact, at the 2008 trembling assembly, the leadership of the party was commissioned to review the general assembly principle at a congress to deal with the reformation of the statutes.
This date is still pending, as information on the internal rest of the last few years was not advisable about the matter.
Now, without the critical sectors lying on the eye, the time may have come to take up this matter again and conclude it forever.

Next to him, the police found a cardboard with a message.
China maintains its greenhouse gas reduction targets
At COP16, China’s representative stated that his country has made enormous efforts to reduce carbon traces and that it would maintain its offer to reduce 40 to 45 percent of its greenhouse gases by 2020.
China is keeping its offer to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, assures Su Wei, the representative of this country at COP16.
During his first public appearance at the United Nations World Climate Summit (COP16), Su Wei assured that his country would have made enormous efforts to reduce carbon traces and convert its industry.
He stated that in the last four years his country has invested 245 million dollars to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
On the other hand, he stated that China would not change its goals, but would work with the international community on this issue.
He explained that the Chinese strategy in terms of climate change is divided into four aspects: dialogue, building capacity, building up institutions and supporting pilot programmes.
In all aspects, progress has been made, including the adoption of a new energy law last year, which includes targets for the reduction of emissions of gases, he said.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China the authorities of the states had cooperated with those of the Central State and municipalities in order to achieve the objectives of energy saving, effective use of energy and reduction of emissions.
In addition, he stated, several multiannual plans have already been launched or concluded, both those financed by the Chinese government and those receiving funds from other countries.
For example, he referred to the programme for the effective use of energy, which has been introduced over the past five years and which had received investments from the United Nations (UNO), the government and private hands.
A provincial-level project on climate change is also under way, he said, in order to exchange traditional light bulbs with energy-saving bulbs and another to weaken and adapt.
Martin Krol, scientific government adviser on climate change in this country, confirmed that China's efforts would be far greater than widely accepted.
He pointed out that the per capita emissions of greenhouse gases in China amounted to six tonnes per person, while in the United States they were 100 tonnes. China is responsible for a nine per cent total contribution to pollution.
Similarly, there has been unprecedented progress in the field of energy use. Energy efficiency has been increased by 20 percent over the last five years and a further one is expected to happen by 2020, he said.
Legal exclusion Espinos: César Navajo
The national leader of the PAN stated that the former panist party president had the right to turn to the National Commission of Order and to demand that what the right to him could be done to him.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that Manuel Espino Barriento's exclusion was right and that the former party chairman of the PAN had the right to turn to the National Ordinance Commission and to demand what the right to do to him.
In an interview held in front of the complaint by Gabino Cué Monteagudos as governor of the state, he stated that the Espinos exclusion was a decision taken at local level.
"This is an independent decision of the Ordinance Commission in Sonora."
"Mr Espino has the right, in his case, to refer to the Comisión de Orden del Consejo Nacional in order to make a decision by a competent body," he added.
On the other hand, he stated that it was not time to think about 2012 and that an alliance on presidential candidates had never sat at the negotiating table.
Navajo Vázquez was convinced that Acción Nacional was strengthened from the internal vote on 4 and 5 December, when his successor was elected.
"That (an alliance in 2012) is an issue that was never on the negotiating table, at least not until now. It was a suggestion for the municipal election, it was successful and fulfilled its purpose," he said.
The panist leader explained that the PAN looks back at 71 years of dialogue, so "we are not afraid of internal competition; on the contrary, "we enjoy it and it strengthens us," he commented.
He said that the Council would undoubtedly select the best president, the Acción Nacional, for the next three years. That is why he passed on the staves "to those whom the Council would determine."
"I am completely unattended and open. I would be proud to hand over the office of the party chairman to each of the five."
He predicted that the party's upturn in the last elections of July 4 would be reflected in the next elections, although "it is not time to think about 2012."
"Now it is about supporting Governor Gabino Cué in his role."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments that emerged from alliances between Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa would carry the flag and observe throughout the country. Therefore, "many hopes and longings are placed in it and I am sure that Gabino is up to the level of the requirements."
When he was asked about the criticism of the PRI of President Felipe Calderón for his discusory course within his four-year-old government, César Navajo called on the PRI's followers to reflect on the six-year period of former President Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI believes that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calderón, they should start defending them, they should finally come out of the closet," he said.
He believes that the owner of the Federal Government can make expressions like those he could make in his discourse in the Auditorio Nacional, because in this country there was no ban on mouth and even less a censorship.
Obama uses Twitter for the law for undocumented students
"If you are for the adoption of the Dream Act, call your senators and press for the adoption of this law," the President of the United States thundered in the popular social network.
Today President Barack Obama supported national mobilization to support the Dream Act - Law on the Legislation of Undocumented Students with a message on his personal blog in the social network Twitter.
"If you are for the adoption of the Dream Act, then call your senators and press for the adoption of this law," said Obama.
Its short notice contains a cyber link to a more extensive document that calls on the public to enter into contact with their senators, as the law's coordination is imminent.
"With your voice, which we are waiting for, the time has come to listen to you," he emphasizes.
The news was spread after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block all votes for each law, except the extension of tax reductions from Bush times and the financing of the government.
Such a blockade, announced on a letter signed by the 42 Republican Senators, could affect the coordination of the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START Agreement with Russia against the spread of nuclear weapons.
He asked about the blockade of Republicans of the Dream Act Act and other projects, said President Robert Gibbs, trusting that once the tax issue has been resolved, a timetable could be set for the other projects.
"I think we still have a lot of time..."
"We all agree that tax matters must be dealt with before the end of the year..."
"I think we can make an agreement on this at any time and then we can plan the expiry of the rest," he said.
The President of the Democratic majority in the Senate, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday that "he would request the vote at the end of the debate" so that the Dream Act - Law, which would allow the initiative to legalise undocumented students from next Thursday in the Senate, would be more likely to be next week.
The version of the Dream Act, or the law of the American dream, would legalize about 800,000 young people who immigrated to the United States when they were not yet sixteen years old, during the last five years in this country, who have been enrolled in a higher education institution or in the army.
But the lawyers of the law need to adopt the initiative sixty votes, which is why they depend on the votes of a handful of Republicans. At present, the organizations of the advocates of this project are organising an intensive influence on the adoption of the law.
The Democrats, of whom the majority support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, one of them said the Senator Ben Nelson from Nebraska, he would vote against it and only one Republican, Richard Lugar from Indiana, has announced his support of the law.
Therefore, the defenders of the Dream Act must get several Republicans on their side if other Democrats decide to turn their backs on the initiative.
Among the most rejected Republicans are Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as Senator George Lemieux from Florida who took over the mandate of Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch from Utah and Kay Corky Hutchinson from Texas, but they declared that they no longer support it on another occasion.
Another Republican, who had expressed his support for the law, John McCain, has not yet determined his position.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, the analysts agree that the Dream Act in the Senate is facing the biggest obstacles.
Putting your finger in the wound with literature
The second round of 'The lust for the language' was a walk in which the participants made themselves strong for the narrative
"I understand that with sex in the language, but... The finger in the wound? What is expected of me?", the writer Luisa Valenzuela, who was to open the second round of 'Los placeres de la lengua', asked a cycle that celebrated Spanish literature and used the subtitle of her question on this occasion (at another event the table was dedicated to sex in the language, she explained).
The finger in the wound... "brings us in trouble," the Argentine writer spat sweetly to the audience, which was composed mainly of young people who met at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara (FIL) to attend this fashionable round table by Marisol Shultz, attended by Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text that she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio, and then described Shultz as a great story. Luisa tells in the first person and is the protagonist who is looking for what is a "wound", and goes from doctor to doctor, from whom she does not receive any answer, but leads to the guide of her story.
The infector leaves them convinced: "Patience is not my strength, perhaps that is my wound."
Finally, after a frustrating approach to the dreamatologist who took her breath in the middle of the corridor, but who explains that wound is not a scientific term, the psychoanalyst clears the secret: "the wound is really open, the symbolic is the scar."
The main character of the narrative sighs and concludes that "it only learned from the wound that it is really open and does not exist" but it is convinced that the desire for the language and its traps mix.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also presented a delightful narrative, which he called 'Lob of the Invention', and in which the finger in the wound is not mentioned, but is discovered.
With allusions to magical realism, he tells of a famous sorcerer who touched the clouds, brought back far traveled men, or restored the virtue lost by a girl. The narrative made a turnaround and reported on America, the great novel, which from the beginning did not lack its own chronists, and he quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who criticised the abundance of the stories told by the conquerors.
"Cervantes, who invited all of us (the writers), ridiculed the pretensed witnesses who appeared in the stories as true, but in other ways the story of America would never have been told - with the imagination that even the shame came away."
However, he emphasizes, "It is the crazy and the liars who best imagine the things," and there reality and lies approach each other, where one no longer knows which side belongs to the narrative where the fictional literature reaches the summit.
He actually calls it the 'Tradition Cervantes'.
"From him we have inherited what is told."
When Mayra Montero was in line, the writer commented and praised the variety of interpretations to which the FIL's invitation to the round table 'The Finger in the wound' had contributed.
The Cuban and Puerto Rican woman devoted her contribution to the great wound of social violence affecting her country - like all Latin America - as a result of the struggles for drug trafficking.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a silent, unwildly planned commitment," she explained after stressing that literature is communication and liability that builds up between the author and the reader as with a "chemical reaction".
The evening was decided by the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose contribution was also "this finger of the dedicated writer in the wound of the writer" hevorhob.
He noticed that in a fast-lived world, intellectual habits and control of consciousness on dogmatisms also go forth, and forget that "after every confirmation there is a little no and behind every denial a little yes."
"In order to be in possession of our thoughts and reality, we must nuance: And nuances often mean putting their fingers in the wound and harassing those who feel much more comfortable when they think in the form of caricatures, black and white, in prefabricated ideas without nuances, and also to harass those powerful who prefer to divide the world into black and white, he noticed and invited a sense of writing to discover.
Romano fights for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in endgames, he experienced Ops and Abs in his career, but he played decisive games three times.
In the duel between Santos Laguna and Monterrey at the end of the game there are also two different styles set by their respective trainers, and their encounter marked by opposites is reflected in the results.
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in endgames, he has experienced Ops and Abs in his career, but he has had decisive games three times, and so far he has kept himself well, which is why this opportunity is of particular importance to him.
The Argentinian has played up with the medal to the second champion, he has remained behind the winners a step behind and, surprisingly, he has played consecutive final games with the same team.
The Santist strategist reached the first final game as coach at 'Torneo Apertura 2002' when del Morelia had the reins in his hand, with which he experienced a great defeat against Toluca with 4-2; later, at 'Clausura 2003' he reached the decisive duel, which he also lost 3-1 against Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna on the 'Torneo Bicentenario 2010', in which they played against Los Diablos, Rubén had to make another setback, as the game with 2-2 against Los Choriceros was undecided after 210 minutes of play, but at the Elfmeter he came forward with 3-1 and got two ways to record his title, but finally three of his players missed the eleven steps and the game turned to a 4-3.
Rubén had already lost two final games with Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his great rival. Therefore, he does not want to be persecuted once again by the unhappiness and freed from evil spell to celebrate a title for the first time, although he confirms that for him the most important thing is the game itself.
"I want to be champion, I don't want to break statistics, that's for a club, for my affection that I give myself, and that's why the title will come to me, but what's happening before is the most important thing," said the tax collector when he was asked about the lost final games.
The final game has remained strong in his memory, he assures him to have learned a lot from it: "The only lesson we can draw from it is that until the referee does not rush the end, we cannot celebrate, we are prepared to be on the line, the players also, because the last time we were already prepared with two elfmeters, and I believe that this is a teaching until the game is finished, there is no occasion for celebration."
To know that this series could be decided by elfmeter shoots, don't worry him, because he trusts his players: "You never want to arrive at the Elfmeter shoot, you want to end in the regular game time, but sometimes there is no alternative and you must be prepared for it in the previous tour we were prepared, but unfortunately fate prepared us a bad game, sometimes due to nervousness or the fierce desire to hold the title already in the hands, that left us something for this final game, and we hope that it won't happen this time."
It is in Romanso power to be no longer only second champion and to taste for the first time the fame that the titles bring with them.
The US amends the rules for obtaining a visa
The persons must present themselves before their consultation with the consulate at the visa application services; costs will be reduced in this way.
As from 10 January 2011, the procedures for requesting a visa in the United States Embassy and in the consulates will be changed.
The new procedure requires most applicants to present themselves to the visa application services (ASC, the initial letters in English) prior to their consultation in the Consulate.
The staff of the ASC shall record the biometric data of the applicant that will be checked by the consulate before the interview.
The new procedure has certain advantages for the aspirants, including:
Reduce the total cost of processing the visa, because it is no longer necessary to pay the appointment, the processing of the visa application and the transport service with which the document is handed out separately.
The applicant makes only one payment covering the three services.
The current price remains unchanged: the equivalent to 140 dollars for a tourist visa, 150 dollars for visas with application (including visas for temporary workers) and 390 dollars for hands and investors.
Those who wish to extend their visa only do not need to have a conversation in the consulate, they just have to introduce themselves to the next ASC, where they present their documents and take their fingerprints.
As the biometric data are collected in the ASC, applicants who need a second date for the conversation in the consulate remain less time than before.
Those who apply for the visa in the consulates of Ciudad Chihuahua, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo no longer have to pay the service charge of 26 dollars.
Additional information on the new visa application procedure can be found on the following website: http://mexico.usembassy.gov/boletines/sp101201_Visas-FAQs.html
NASA announces the discovery of extraterrestrial life
The North American Space Agency called a press conference to present tomorrow a find that will have an impact on the search for creatures in space.
The United States National Aeronautics Authority (NASA) announces a discovery of astrobiology that could confirm the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The find will be presented tomorrow at 13.00 a.m. at a press conference at NASA headquarters in Washington by experts in astrobiology. It is a science that examines the origin, development, distribution and the future of life in the universe.
When the press conference was convened, NASA assured that it would present "a surveillance fund for the search for extraterrestrial life", which triggered speculation among experts from other countries.
The discovery could prove the theory that it could exist in hostile environments, so far considered uninhabitable, human-like creatures. The hypothesis was thrown up that they could transform into intelligent living beings, as humans did, if their living conditions improved.
It seems to be a microbe found on the basis of the Mono Lake in the Yosemite National Park, California. It lives there in an environment that has been considered too toxic for all imaginable life forms, as the lake is highly arsenic.
In some way, the microbie uses the arsen as a source of survival. Taking this ability into account, the chances that there could be similar life on other planets that do not have our protective atmosphere.
According to astrobiologists, when these organisms metabolize the arsen, "there is actually another life form, a second life form that differs from the one known to us."
The Space Agency will announce the actual reach of its fund tomorrow, Thursday, at the press conference.
At the conference, Geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who examines the possibility of life on Mars, and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who studies Titan (the largest moon Saturns) under the question of whether his chemical composition of the Earth is similar.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergencia and Patrón form an opposition block
With the reform of the Congress organ law, the two party system will be introduced, they complain.
The 60th legislative period had just begun, and already installed an opposition block, led by the members of the PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who presented himself as an independent one. The four questioned the entry of the 'two party system' into the chamber.
Before the introduction to the 60th legislative period, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez von Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza von der PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo von der PRD and Patrón Montalvo were weathering against the reform of the organ law, as they would thus be excluded.
With this reform, they repeated, a two-party system would be introduced, because now there would be two people, the same number as parties controlling the Congress.
These four MEPs, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones who voted against the Bureau, led by the Panist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca in his capacity as vice-president.
Corvera Quevedo stated that the parties PRI and PAN had institutionally introduced their political margin with these reforms.
He said that in the next few days, they would talk to the representatives of PAN and PRI to change the scheme, but they assumed their political will and if they did not, they would be wronged by both parties, which would put an end to the opposition coalition.
"Here I come (the opposition coalition), that is what I see, because we are excluded from all the decisions, which do not even consider taking into account the opinion of the others."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia stated that it would be consistent with PRD, PT and Patrón and that therefore a pluralist group would be formed.
It cannot be allowed, he continued that after being monopolistic, the Congress should now be "duopolistic".
"It is not the spirit of law reform that will rule an eternal two-party system in Congress."
"At the beginning, this group will start with five Members and they will talk to other colleagues to make them more," said the Convergencia member.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of PT led in allusion to PAN and PRI that the congress was currently transformed into a 'valve' for two.
"Before it was only one party, now they divide it up to two."
Patrón Montalvo asked to respect the Members and to assign their place to the negotiating tables.
"The five who are currently seen as being divided into different groups have decided to unite to take our place at the negotiating table, because of the reform that was carried out and arranged by the others, we have remained outside and we do not agree to this reform."
200,000 peso more for "supplier"
The city administration of Mazatlán pays another check to the controversial owner of the company for electrical equipment.
Another check over about 200,000 peso for the benefit of Lorenzo Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the city administration.
Thus, the sum paid to the owner of the electrical equipment company in the second half of the year amounts to 1 200 000 pesos.
According to the city administration's transparency page, this check was issued at an amount of 200.144.56 peso with number 9258447 on 16 November with the purpose of using the bill of open invoices.
The treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had already predicted that more money would go from the community to this supplier. She is watched by the Auditoría Superior del Estado because she sells at higher prices.
What has not been mentioned is the total amount that one still owes to her and, as a result, the number of checks issued in favor of Camacho Palazuleos.
"It wasn't bought from her, it's just the debt paid, just like the rest of the suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last cheques "showed" again in the last quarter of the year: September 24th, two of October 15th, October 19th, October 29th and that last of November 16th.
Although the supplier has not yet been published in the Official Journal, as required by law, if a company is called into question by the ASE in order to prevent other administrations from requesting their services, the treasurer assured that their services would not be used again.
After the newspaper Noroest published on 25 July the audit of cheques issued by the city administration to its suppliers, it was announced that already, from March 2008 to 9 July 2010, during the three-year term of the mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the municipality had paid over 10 million Pesos with 42 cheques to Camacho Palazuleos.
There were also shops withjumapam, where she collected cheques worth over 3 million peso.
Tourist places need to be improved
Tourist companies regret the accident of foreign tourists due to the bad condition of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist into the collapse of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada, Mazatlán tourist industry asked the authorities to pay particular attention to the areas that are in bad condition and which have a bad picture of the port city.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, Chairman of the Trade Union of the Zona Dorada, recalled that on different occasions it was required to maintain the destination and transform the bad conditions that the tourists find into new employment opportunities or routes.
He said that the bad state of the roads and trails would have had a negative effect, as tourists came to wreak and saw the disorder, and they would turn their backs on the nearby shops.
"The politicians don't know what it means to close a company one day and they don't think about how much money you lose, because otherwise they wouldn't do the construction in this way slowly and without a plan."
Hotel owner José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said the fall of the tourist would have made attention to the lack of prevention and the outstanding maintenance work from the side of the city.
"The community has to take on its responsibility and avoid doing something like this once again. How to do this? Now, by a preventive maintenance instead of improving everything in the afterlife," he said.
"We are waiting longing to have a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist area, it must be maintained, even we residents have a right to a clean habitat. The city administration must change its strategy to maintain the city in good condition."
"There are other places that also look unpaved and unfinished," he said, "for example, el Escudo y el Venadito of Mazatlán."
"Today we need more than just advertising to attract tourists. It has to be offered a good product, a city that cleans its beaches and streets, and keeps the tourist attractions constantly in fire," he added.
"These arrangements have not been given enough attention, and this type of incident is just what is obvious to all: maintenance is urgently needed."
Raúl Llera Martínez, Deputy Secretary of Promoción Turística, expressed the importance of saving the tourist places of Mazatlán, because they would not be used properly and caused a bad image to emerge.
He mentioned a number of places that would have to be brought together with the city on frontman. To make the city clean, neat and attractive for tourism should be priority.
"Happyly, Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural sites, which at first need to be cleaned up and cleaned to make them attractive to tourism and to bring them to the inventory with which we advertise for this destination.
IP calls for results from Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, chairman of the CCE, suggested that Members should assume the great responsibility of giving an example of a better Sinaloa, which faces many challenges.
The Mazatlán business sector calls for a worthy parliament, free from agreements between the parties and the government, because Sinaloa is troubled and faces great problems.
The 60th Parliament was inaugurated yesterday. It consists of seven political forces, 19 representatives of the PRI, 13 of PAN, three of Partido Nueva Alianza, two of PRD, one of PT, one of Convergencia and one of PVEM.
The new members of the State Congress are expected to do a clean job, to feel committed to society and to the different social groups that depend on responsible parliamentary work, and not to repeat the same patterns of partiality and paternalism.
Eduardo Dávalos, Chairman of CCE, proposed that the new Members should take on the great responsibility to give a model for a better Sinaloa, which faces many challenges.
"We hope that Members will exercise their right to act free of agreement between the parties, because it is common for them to enter into agreements with which they represent their own interests, thereby transforming themselves into Carnivalskomparses of the rulers and the leaders of the parliamentary groups."
He said they should prove their commitment to building the necessary bridges to support the current government.
"We are concerned that they carry out a trustworthy work and work for society and its groups above all, for it was the inhabitants of Sinaloa who expressed their confidence in the last elections."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, Chairman of the Tres Islas Hotel Association, believes that one of the major challenges facing the 40 representatives is the drive and joint work for the economic growth of the state, because today's economic situation is extremely complicated.
"The most important thing is to encourage economic growth, to create investment incentives and infrastructure, which will in any way promote job creation."
With regard to the tourism industry, he asked the new Members to provide the necessary priority for the Ministry of Tourism in the state budget.
"I understood that it was the Ministry's second most inadequate means, which is incompatible with an important economic activity that brings foreign exchange and investment into the country and is in direct competition with the agricultural industry."
The tourist projects must be allocated funds, state security must be supported, and the alcohol law, which has not been renewed in previous legislative periods, must be updated.
Seeking Holy King
Dolls, cars, bicycles and other toys wish the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family yearning.
On the next day, it will be difficult for parents to fulfill these wishes, as the household is no more and no less than 12 people and a goat's goat.
Nevertheless, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan and Miguel do not give up hope that Melchior, Caspar and Balthasar will give them the toys and garments they so long for.
The family lives a modest house in the settlement of Salvador Allende. They live by hand in the mouth, because the father has no solid work.
"Sometimes hard times are told because my husband doesn't have a job, but we sell mandarins and potatoes...I'm already going with the gores for sale on the street in the afternoon," said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
Four-year-old Adelaida would like a doll or a bicycle, while her three-year-old sister Isabel wants a Barbie doll.
Ten-year-old José Alfredo wants to have a 'mooner car' for some time and for his eight-month-old little brother Jesús suggests Cayetana clothing in the size for one-year-olds.
" (José Alfredo) said to me, 'I would so much like this monster', but I answered him, 'Let's wait, boy', because it was very expensive," Cayetana said sadly.
For the older children who were in school, clothing and shoes would be ideal.
11-year-old María Guadalupe has the size 12; ten-year-old Isaías has the size of 10, while eight-year-old Miguel has size 8.
The 14-year-old José Juan lacks tennis shoes. A pair in size 5 1/2 or 6 would be very helpful.
If you want to help you realize the dreams of the children of the family Coronado Valenzuela, you can participate in the campaign 'Holy King will be sought' by donating a toy or cash in the reception hall of the newspaper Noroeste.
14 suspected drug dealers arrested
On Wednesday, the ten house searches in the Estrie administrative region were carried out as part of the demolition of a production and sales network of cannabis.
Fourteen people were arrested and various charges were brought against them.
The house searches were carried out in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, where the places that were mainly used to produce drugs.
"Approximately 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, cash and equipment that served production, have been confiscated," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesman for Quebec Security Police.
A total of eleven men and three women were arrested, two of whom were from Sherbrooke, the main wire-driving force of the drug ring.
The arrested persons should have appeared before the justice building in Sherbrooke for hours after their arrest.
They could be accused, among other things, of accusing the production of cannabis, its possessions for sale, the plot, and the service of crime.
These house searches had taken place as a result of a lengthy investigation that took place over a year.
"The information received from public authorities has enabled us to carry out these arrests," explained M. Ruel.
Around the 70 police officers from the Estria Regional Investigation Unit of Quebec Security Police, Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphis Police Department had participated in this police operation.
Secret immigration could easily be persecuted
The draft law of the Conservatives, which, according to the government, aims to regulate the problem of ships loaded with secret immigrants, will be taken for granted after the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they cannot support the proposal.
"I strongly oppose this Charter."
"I hold with a party that has laid fetters on your feet," explained Michael Ignativf, head of the Liberals, after the end of the weekly Caucus session in front of the assembled MEPs.
The Liberals claimed that the draft law, which allows any person to be detained for up to one year as a person identified for the transport of illegal immigrants, infringes the Canadian Constitution of Law and Freedom, as proposed.
Gilles Duceppe, head of the Bloc Québécois, also indicated that he could not support the draft law, as he turned against the wrong target group.
"We are against it and it seems that all opposition parties are against it, so we will wait for what the government is doing," said M. Duceppe.
Criticism of Olivia Chow's immigration question, NDP, has rejected the critics who demand that their party behaved not firmly enough towards the secret immigrants.
"The Neo-democrates agree to take action against the blind passengers, and we are trying to enforce this by means of another draft law, the C-35," Chow suggested.
We therefore do not support the draft law of the Conservatives because it seeks the debt of refugees and holds children captive for at least one year," said Chow.
The immigration minister Jason Kennyy accused the opposition parties to play with politics and ignore the will of the Canadians.
"The Canadians strongly inform Members that they do not tolerate this kind of secret immigration, these criminal processes that concern Canada and that treat the country as a foot-and-mouther."
"You expect Canada to take tough action," says Minister Kenneys.
"The government has not announced any vote of confidence regarding its draft law that could have led the country to vote that the government had rejected.
However, a conservative has said to the agency QMI that the government would convene a vote so that every opposing Member can immediately explain himself to his voters.
The new unit finds no unanimity
Despite the announcement of the possible creation of a new, ongoing unity to fight against corruption and collusion by Jean Charest, many observers continue to call for the formation of a public investigation committee on this issue.
Robert Dutil, Minister of Public Security, claims that this idea did not come from yesterday: Quebec had already consulted the New York Department of Investigation on this issue last January.
Since 1870, the metropolis has had a standing unit against corruption.
Nevertheless, the announcement of Wednesday has more than one surprised.
It must be said that this measure was not discussed at least at the meeting of the Standing Committee of the Quebec Police Service on 29 October last year, despite the presence of Robert Dutils.
Nor was it lacking that Stéphane Bergeron, critic and member of the Parti Québécois, qualified this announcement in terms of public security as "a magic rabbit from the hat" as well as "a right-hand solution".
On the other hand, Minister Dutil had turned to those who fear that political power has too much influence on the challenging future unity.
"They'll see the result when we declare it," he said, "and he'd be pleased to confirm.
"One is aware of this problem."
According to Réjean Parent, the president of the CSQ, nothing can replace the implementation of a public survey.
"The more M. Charest insists on trying to prevent the formation of this investigation committee, the more people like you and I think he has something to hide," he said.
"The only means to be able to form an investigative committee is the withdrawal of Jean Charest," said Yves Boisvert, lecturer for ethics and policy systems at ENA (State University for the Training of High Administratives).
In order to get out of this deadlock, he suggests to Quebec that auditing should be given a special mandate so that it can carry out research on corruption and secret agreements.
"One should be able to extend the mandate of auditing," he decided.
He also believes that the Quebec review could grant the same power as Commissioners, which would also allow them to commit people to the statement.
The formation of a stand-alone unit is not the only project in the Charest government drawers.
The Quebec will also demand Ottawa to amend the Criminal Law in order to be better placed on this kind of crime.
This demand comes from Operation Marteau's senior prosecutor, who informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the case law is not clear in this way of prosecution.
Vic Toews, Minister of State for Public Security, confirmed that his colleague, Rob Nicholson, was currently dealing with certain innovations relating to this dossier.
During the 2001 Operation Printemps, which concerned the groups of motorcycle police, 131 persons had been arrested, although the criminal law had not been renewed.
Ottawa has therefore enforced the law against gangsterdom.
Rivers under strict surveillance
A number of rivers remain under strict surveillance due to the high rainfall that has taken place since Tuesday in some regions of the province.
In Shawinigan, in the Maurice administrative region, a land slide occurred on Wednesday afternoon.
Two houses were preventively evacuated.
In the evening another land slide took place in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in the Lanaudiere administrative region.
A road has collapsed.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, strong rainfall of 40 to 70 millilitres fell on several regions.
Between 20 and 40 other millimeters of precipitation were expected here in accordance with the regions until Thursday evening.
The areas north of the river as well as the valley of the Outaouais region were most affected.
A total of up to 100 millimeters of rainshowers had fallen here.
Since these rainfalls are still to be added to the snow melts that have already accumulated in certain sub-areas, the crossing of multiple watercourses is feared.
On Wednesday evening, warnings on the flood alarm concerning the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in the Lanaudiere region were issued by the Quebec Security Service.
The rivercourses in the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentine mountains and the Chêne in Lotbinière become the object of flood monitoring and remain under observation.
In the region of Lanaudière, the heavy rainfall has crossed some lakes in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and also in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, a distant bridge was torn away due to the strong rainfall.
Ten residences had to be evacuated as a preventive measure.
In Outaouais, the crossing of certain lakes has caused the closing of several roads, especially in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pottefract.
The security service remains alert and monitors the situation accurately, says Security Councillor Annik Bouchard.
On Wednesday, the Quebec State High Water Centre has issued warnings about the strong rise of several rivers, in particular Maskinongé, Assemption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont partially corrected
The Quebec Radio Moderator Stéphane Dupont suffered a partial setback before the Canadian Radio Standards Supervisory Board (CCNR) because of his controversial statements on social welfare and Haitian people as well as because of his exceptional speech on radio.
While the CCNR represents the opinion, M. Dupont and his CHOI 98,1 FM team would have the right to express their own views, certain statements "had not provided adequate information on the social welfare and unauthorized negative representations of the Haitian people and also had such unhopeful speech that is not appropriate to the broadcasts broadcast during the day."
The Supervisory Board also concluded that a discussion on suicide involving the spread of the names of two persons who committed suicide violates the radio broadcast code.
The CCNR had received several complaints concerning the comments made during the 2008 and 2010 broadcasts.
The first decision was made following a complaint from the "Front commun des peronnes associées sociales du Québec".
The activist organisation had argued that the amounts mentioned in the consignment were inaccurate.
Rather, the presenters should provide solid and misleading information.
Regarding suicide, moderator Stéphane Dupont expressed the opinion that suicide was an expression of cowardice.
The majority of the Supervisory Board members had concluded that the message given was that suicide should not be considered a solution to life crises.
"The majority of the Supervisory Board takes into account that the consequences of the "Dupont le midi" programme have been addressed in a sensitive family-friendly and appropriate manner."
Therefore, he was not charged with any Tadel over his person.
The final issue concerned the statements relating to the Haiti earthquake.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had delivered a media-effective discussion that caused a lot of reactions.
The CHOI moderator had declared that he did not donate to the aid of Haiti, as one did not know with certainty whether the needy would really receive the donations.
The Supervisory Board believes that these comments were not abusive, but that their cumulative effect represents an unauthorized negative representation of the Haitians.
"I have already canceled my three-day suspension sentence on this matter."
"My file has been virgin for one and a half years," the moderator explained.
In all decisions, the Supervisory Board advocates the spread of unhappiness.
In all cases, the CHOI-FM has acted "out of its obligations".
The consequences for the radio station, which should have reported, among other things, its decisions once during the main broadcasting period within a period of three days, are minor.
A King of the Kung-Fu in Montreal
Nacereddine Zemmal, Montreal's Algerian origin, has taken a very special course.
The athlete, who shines in "Sanda" (full contact Kung-Fu), in the kickbox and in the Thai box, is now rising in the search for new challenges to the Tatami and the boxing rings of the world.
"I started fighting sports such as Kung-Fu and Kickboxes 12 years ago in Algeria," Zemmal, who has been in the metropolis since 2008 to develop under the professionals.
I personally seek the battle of all places, as for those who do not like to present the ground struggle, as the mixed combat arts do, competitions in North America are rare."
Recently, his character as a security officer and UPS assigned his rivals bad news, in which he won two gold medals from the World Carate and the Kickboxing Association (WKA) during the World Carate World Carate World Championships held in Edinburgh, Scotland, between October 23 and 30.
"I won the victory in the categories of full contact kickboxing and Thai boxing," he said.
"At present, I'm preparing for the World Cup in San Shou in China."
"There were those fighters from each category who had been placed among the first four during the last World Cup."
"I picked up bronze in Toronto in 2009."
"In 2005 I came back to Vietnam."
"In 2007, I finished the tournament in China in fifth place while I became third in Toronto in 2009," he added.
"It's worth mentioning that I've made progress in every competition."
"With this rhythm I will be first this time or next year!"
"San Shou" or "Sanda" are disciplines originating in China, in which beatings and footsteps are permitted as well as floor designs.
The two battles usually play on a platform, more rarely in a box ring.
The most renowned boxing fighter, which emerged from this type of martial arts, is the American Vietnamese origin Cung Le, which is probably known in the world of martial arts.
If Nacer Zemmal were to hold back only one event in his career, he would surely call his presence here at the Super Tournament "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl of the Kung Fu.
"This competition is the highest and highest in China," explained the congenital pounding church.
"It's a bit like the equivalent to the Lumpinee Stadium (the largest stadium in Thailand).
"That was a great experience."
In the semifinals of his category (80kg), Zemal won his first battle before losing his finals.
"The one who defeated me was a real professional," he said.
"There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 95 kg). "
"The winners of the semifinals meet each other in the finals of their category."
"Then the winners of each category offer the forehead to crown a single champion, the King of the Kung Fu."
450 million in contracts without tendering
Hydro-Québec has agreed with each other to grant $450 million of contracts for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydropower project.
In the middle of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts is a consortium consisting of BPR, Dessau, Groups SM and Axor, which has received the most important share, namely that of the project management, to a sum of 295 million dollars without tendering.
This consortium, called "Energie gérance", was formed in 2004 as a follow-up to the decision of Hydro-Québec, the private sector's responsibility to overreact this important hydroelectric project to a sum of 5 billion dollars.
At the beginning of 2005 the consortium "Energie gérance" gave the lucrative contract without a public tender.
For the Parti Québécois, recourse to business consortia is a serious ethical problem that raises the risk of antitrust and price increases.
"This is a new way of playing a carded game and averts the competition."
"This means that instead of performing played cards in a secret way, one is now doing them in an open form," said Sylvain Simard, Member of the PQ, at the press conference yesterday.
In the early morning, Simard had raised the question before the National Assembly because it seems difficult to understand how public interest can be served in this way.
In the afternoon, Ms Nathalie Normaneau had responded by saying vehemently that it had been a carded game in this contract.
"I remain faithful to my line," she weathered by strengthening that the PQ was "unreasonably" and "mistake her of hardness".
She said it's "the least" that the PQ apologizes.
The model of the consortium is common practice worldwide.
It is usually such a temporary alliance that allows two or more companies to pool their expertise in terms of a bid for a complex project.
The "Eastmain" project has a high level of complexity with regard to its working dimensions.
The construction process is underway and is scheduled to be set up by 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without competition being possible; there had already been negotiations.
In addition, the model of the consortium in Quebec is no longer an exception even in the case of relatively simple projects.
As the newspaper "Le Devoir" noted last week, the model of the consortium used in the field of civil engineering and consulting is the subject of government investigations.
A brief crossing of the Quebec business register allows more than 200 consortia to be identified, some of which seem to be permanent.
In this way, for example, Dessau cooperates with the majority of its core competitors, including CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin or Roche and Tecsult.
Any linkage, and of which there are several dozens, leads back to one and the same legal person, namely, to Dessau.
As far as the consortium "Énergie gérance" is concerned, Minister Normaneau stressed that "the territory of the Baie James is subject to a special labour force dynamics and that Hydro-Québec has invoiced this fact in a special way since the 1970s".
Réal Laporte, the great employer of the Société d'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has issued a statement that has left the nose on the fact that the contract on project management has been approved after agreement.
"If you make a call and there are only a few applicants, your prices will be high."
"So you have two options: either you take the people who are on this march and tell yourself: you will negotiate a satisfactory agreement at a good price."
"But the idea is that not the price is decisive, but the person's expertise," Laporte said.
This contract granted to the consortium "Énergie gérance" is part of a long list of contracts of more than 50,000 dollars received by the party Québécois.
The contracts were approved either by the Hydro-Québec or the SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
According to review, the newspaper "Le Devoir" counted more than 100 engineering and consulting contracts that companies or their branches, including, in particular, resource laboratories, were approved between 2002 and March 2010.
SNC-Lavalin had acquired 22 contracts, Génivar had received 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without their participation in "énergie gérance".
All these contracts have been negotiated.
They totaled $449 783 344, including the contract with "énergie gérance" over $295 131 564.
Sylvain Simard had stated that the four companies forming the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groups SM and Axor) were probably known to the "Parti libéral du Québec".
Minister Normaneau had made it sound that the PQ was equally connected to the companies she "financed" before she specified that it was more about their managers.
Barometer Conscious Consumption - The "green" label is not trusting
Green but uncircuited skeptical.
Quebec's consumer has little confidence in the main actors of sustainable growth, but also has little to do with the branded labels or eco-labels to control his choice.
Harm, although it bathed in a media-effective universe, where information in favour of more responsible consumption only becomes so: the barometer of responsible consumption has to complain of a lack of credible information, an inadequacy that is evident as a brake of its commitment, as the first reading that was held yesterday showed.
Although they have driven the consumption of so-called socially tolerant products in 2010, Quebecers still seem to have little credit to those who try to sell them.
Two-thirds of Quebec's population admits that they do not believe in the environmental engagement of companies as much as green corporate advertising, so the measuring instrument developed by Sherbrooke University's responsible consumer centre reveals.
Another finding: half of consumers doubt the trustworthiness of the official certificates, which are supposedly fair products, but also the credibility of the products and brands, which are declared to be environmentally conscious, says the barometer.
According to the same pattern, politicians' discourse on this issue is taken seriously by only 14.6% of Quebec's population.
However, information on responsible consumption seems to be important to stimulate this consumption segment, which is currently about a third of Quebec's consumers.
In fact, empty and dubious nature of information dampened the zeal of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the barometer after the higher price of the products.
Furthermore, one third of Quebec's declared performance of green products and services, which they are trying to manage, is suspicious of.
According to another communication, more than half of the consumers had changed their habits in 2010, mainly changing the brand of one or more products in order to express their convictions.
According to Barometer, they also preferred 61% purchases from dealers of their district and favoured the purchase of food grown in their region.
Greener and more responsible - the index of environmentally conscious consumption had reached a 64 of the maximum of 100 this year - the Quebec homoconsumus loves to present itself as king of recycling, trying to reduce its traces left in the environment by taking care of animal welfare.
However, the social and environmental consciousness seems to stop in front of his car, according to the barometer: just 28% of Quebecers have indicated that they have used public transport in 2010 or preferred the passenger centre to demonstrate their environmental interest.
The growth and cycling were also supported by 39.1% of the participants in this comprehensive behavioural survey who fed the clichés.
Government bond for the acquisition of eXcentris
The Quebec Government, which was invited by Société Angus and Parallèle to participate financially in the acquisition of the eXcentris cinema complex, agrees to cooperate, but only in the form of a competitive bond.
The developer company Angus as well as the company Parallèle, who had hoped for a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to take over the Daniel Langlois cinema complex eXcentris on the Boulevard Saint-Laurent in order to return his actual cinematic function, apparently do not receive what they have demanded.
Although the government has accepted its involvement in this matter, it has, on its own terms.
Instead of the expected donation, the Quebec Government offers a bond in less than the initial expected amount that could create an existent solution on beneficial conditions, at least in the opinion of the sources which can be recovered from the state's rumour kitchen.
A first action plan and a request for 12.8 million had already been rejected from Quebec last spring, the request for a petition has been corrected once again in a summer.
A proposal along with an action plan has already been sent by the president of the "Société de développement des Entreprises culturelles" (SODEC), François Macerola, to Minister St-Pierre, who heads the eXcentris Act.
A few days ago, he had given her a final factual report.
However, the counter-proposal of the Cabinet was submitted to the SODEC on Wednesday.
Parallèle and Angus now have until 31 December to respond.
In any case, the premise of the state donation really seems to have been pushed aside.
Let us recall that the Quebec ownership community of cinemas and cinema complexes had opposed a direct state investment in support of the acquisition of eXcentris by presenting the argument that the Minister of Culture had no financial support for real estate projects there , which he had not also given to other cinemas.
In contrast, several other market participants in the segment claimed substantial economic assistance.
Film director Daniel Langlois, after the self-financed construction of the cinema, had presented the author's cinema for over ten years in the spaces of his cinema complex, which could justify the exemption from the state funds.
The lack of cinemas showing independent films is more than obvious in Montreal, and eXcentris knew how to keep his clientele at the bar.
The Société Angus as well as the Parallèle company with Christian Yaccarini at the head of the camp, in turn, control a privately funded campaign, from which they expect a total of $700 to stimulate the acquisition.
Since spring 2009, only one screen continues to show films in eXcentris, namely Le Parallèle.
The goal of the future acquirers is to reopen the three cinema halls on February 27 next year with the screening of the very successful film by Xavier Beauvois "Des hommes et des dieux".
Christian Yaccarini, however, has not called up the newspaper "Le Devoir" and one is ignored what he and his group think of the down-corrected proposals that they have been made.
Secret of Unshaked Canada Afflicted
The new American diplomat lines spread by WikiLeaks aired the secret of what the United Nations considers to be the least-valued Canadian against the Americans, but with the same blow, they reveal the supremacy of the latter to Canada.
Consequently, the American diplomats are amazed that the Canadian electorate does not have Canadian-American relations in the sense of election, and they believe that the visit of President Obama would have helped the conservative government to implement its 2009 budget!
The four new communications between the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, which were publicly distributed yesterday, provide even more impressive details than the mere substantial content you have to bang.
A connection dated 22 September 2008, i.e. in the period during which the federal election campaign was in full swing, reports on the point from which the United Nations no longer participates in the operations discussed by its political leaders.
To the great amazement of David Wilkins, the American ambassador used in Ottawa.
Mr Wilkins offers various ways of explaining this situation.
"A Canadian minority complex, which is almost indignant, may cause Canadian political leaders to talk about internal issues of everyday life rather than to push the United States to black Peter (as in 1988 in the campaign on free trade), he describes.
The United Nations, he concluded, is therefore "the proverbial Goliath of this choice: omnipresent, but potentially too threatening to speak of it".
The ambassador understands this "ear-sucking silence" all the less, as the two countries have intense political and economic relations.
"Logically," he says, "it should be the ability of a candidate, a party and much more of a party leader to lead such an essential relationship that the voters have as a key factor in their urn's passage."
The other expression of this sense of importance is read in the announcement sent by Terry Breese, Managing Director in Ottawa, on 22 January 2009, to prepare President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your journey will help to ensure the continued existence of the government's vote of confidence over the federal budget at the beginning of February, where Canada will announce its first deficit after more than a decade of recovery of between 30 and 40 billion dollars," Breese describes.
Nowhere did he mention that the government had to postpone Parliament's session before Christmas in order to prevent Parliament from being overthrown by the coalition and the so-called survival of the opposition parties would have an impact on the quality of the proposed calling programme.
Another communication written and dated January 2008 by the Ambassador Wilkins provides Washington with an increasingly negative picture that the dramatic series broadcast via CBC are spreading from the United States.
The ambassador is disturbed by such broadcasts as Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which you can observe little subtle allusions to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or even discharges for the purpose of hearings carried out by CIA muscle prots.
Another communication goes on to tell how Hillary Clinten asked Bernard Kouchner at her first bilateral meeting to see if Europe was willing to take certain prisoners from Guantanamo.
Mr Kouchner should have answered the question with yes, but on the basis of an individual case-by-case decision.
At the end of the meeting, described, "he sent the State Secretary a paper in a 15-year-old Muslim Canadian origin in puncto Omar Khadr."
"The Secretary of State has agreed to review the file."
Finally, let us remember that the mindsets heat up in respect of WikiLeaks website.
Tom Flanagan, an old and Stephen Harper very closely standing consultant, had explained about CBC that those responsible for this massive leak should be "transmitted".
He was here at Mike Huckabee from the United States.
Global plan for the renewal of lighting
The UN in Cancun yesterday proposed a plan to renew the lighting of households, trade and industry in 100 countries with a view to achieving a reduction in greenhouse gas (CFC), which corresponds to nearly one third of the additional reduction that needs to be realized in order to stabilise the global climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan takes its position in the steps of the concrete major projects that the UN is hoping to implement in Cancun to compensate for the absence of compulsory reduction commitments from the industrialized countries.
According to the plan put forward yesterday, the main problem would be avoided in the form of the 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of the FCVs delivered on earth due to lighting, if the white glowing pears, which so far still represent a monopoly of 50 to 70% on the market, were to be replaced by fluorescent or better, by light diodes (LED).
The lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This corresponds to an equivalent of 70% of the exhaust gases of the global fleet.
In Copenhagen last year, large exhaust gas stations, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, had committed themselves to voluntary reduction plans, which were to reduce the global CFC emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, this balance sheet would have to be reduced to 5 Gts to stabilise the increase in climate by 2 degrees Celsius from today to 2020 in order to prevent this from getting out of control.
In the white glowing pears 95% of the energy escapes in the form of heat, and the remaining 5% produce the light.
With the compact light bulbs the energy consumption is reduced by 75%, with the new LED light bulbs this energy requirement is again reduced by twice.
The compact light bulbs hold on average between 6000 and 10,000 hours.
The new LED light bulbs, such as those that the manufacturer Philips has launched this week - this company has, by the way, participated in the UN study - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a white glowing pear, indicating the savings of the exchange plan to be applied in 100 countries.
In addition to the fact that a completely new light bulbs give very little heat, they can also work with a rule resistance.
And they don't contain any mercury.
Several specialists have pointed out that compact light bulbs have reserves, as they contain mercury and that it is therefore necessary to dispose of it as special waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, except for producers to make an adoption site available.
However, according to the report, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not the compact light bulb, but rather the coal power plants, which emit much more mercury to produce the electricity waste by the white glowing pears.
In the United States alone, these coal power plants emit 25,000 tonnes of mercury per year.
The report sets out in detail the profits that each country would generate through this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would save a billion dollars annually on purchasing electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2, which means an equivalent of 3.5 coal power plants whose Indonesia would cost 2.5 billion.
Côte d'Ivoire expects the announcement of the results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called for the "unsolicited" publication of the results of the presidential election of the Ivory Coast right after their deadline.
"The Secretary-General underlines the need for the independent election commission to obtain its work and to publish the preliminary results without further delay," said a UN chief press speaker.
"He asks all the Côte d'Ivoire parties and institutions to demonstrate their responsibility and to include any initiative until the provisional results are announced."
Despite the pressure exerted by certain foreign governments, the election commission had allowed the deadline set on Wednesday at midnight to pass three days after the Sunday election, without publishing the results.
Circa forty minutes before the deadline, the President of the CEI on TV had confirmed that the Commission would "go ahead with work" in order to announce the results.
On Wednesday many calls from all over the world have become loud, the CEI may at last call the winner of the second round of elections under Laurent Gbagbo and his opponents Alassane Ouattara.
However, the Gbagbo camp expects to cancel the "substantial" voting charges in the north by the Constitutional Council, which was achieved by the ex-rebellen camp of the Forces nouvelles (FN) during the coup failed in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, head of the Côte d'Ivoire presidential campaign, had confirmed that the maneuvers practiced by the FN to intimidation of voters in the north of the country had deterred the President's followers from voting.
The entire election could be cancelled if the actions brought by Gbagbo were taken into account by the Constitutional Council.
However, Gbagbo's opponents now believe that the highest court in the country is not neutral, as it is directed by Paul Yao N'Dré, a politically closely linked Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, man of the North who disputes any connection to the ex-rebels, has considered the delay in proclaiming the election results to be "unacceptable" and asked Gbagbo to respect them, even if he has not gone so far as to demand the victory.
His alliances reaffirm that Gbagbo blocked the publication of the results, knowing that he had lost; and file a complaint before the Constitutional Court after preventing the election commission from publishing the results was illegal.
The second round of the Sunday presidential elections was held for the coronation of the unification and reconciliation process of a country that had been split into two parts over the years.
On Wednesday, the United Nations had warned the Ivory Coast politicians that they could be held accountable for it in the event of any outpourings.
Laurent Gbagbo had made the first round of elections on 31 October with 38% of the votes against the 32% for Alassane Ouattara, who accepted the public support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round) as the leading candidate.
Unemployment rate remained stable in France in the third quarter
For the purposes of the International Labour Office (IAA), the unemployment rate in France is stable at 9.3% (including the overseas departments at 9.7%), the provisional seasonally adjusted data published by the Federal Statistical Office of Insee on Thursday show.
The unemployment rate in the metropolis is 2.631 million.
The figures for the second quarter amounted to 9.3% of the working population in the metropolis and 9.7% in the overseas departments.
Over the year, the unemployment rate recorded an increase of 0.1 percentage points.
In the third quarter, 3.4 million persons employed in the French metropolis were not employed, but wished to find a job, whether they were employed every two weeks or not, or whether they were unemployed or not.
The situation of young people on the labour market has continued to deteriorate with an increase in the unemployment rate of 24.2% in the metropolis (+ 0.9 percentage points within three months, +0.5 percentage points over the year) and 25% with the involvement of the overseas regions.
In the third quarter, 637,000 young people aged 15 to 24 were unemployed according to the IAA.
In turn, seniors have seen a slight increase in the unemployment rate of 6.4% in the metropolis (+0.2 percentage points over three months and over the year), i.e. 482,000 of over 50-year-olds, 6.6% with the involvement of the overseas departments.
Only the 25-49 year-olds could benefit from the stability of unemployment in the third quarter; 8.3% in the metropolis (-0.1 percentage point over three months, +0.1 percentage points over one year) and 8.8% in France as a whole.
According to a discussion on its calculation procedures, the Federal Statistical Office Insee has not published monthly unemployment figures since 2006.
On the other hand, Eurostat, the Statistical Office of the European Union, continues in this method and announced on Tuesday a rate of 9.8% in France for October (including the overseas departments) compared to 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini accused and arrested
An investigation procedure was initiated against Alexandre Guérini, 53, head of a disposal company and brother of the President of the General Council of the Bouches-du-Rhône region (PS), and he was sent to Luynes Prison, near Aix-en-Provence, in the course of an investigation procedure on public and fraud-suspected markets.
Alexandre Guérini was accused of suspense of corporate assets, misrepresentation of public goods, heeling, co-tendership in corruption, illicit bribery and possession of weapons, according to his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini is ready to fight and is prepared to express himself on all the questions that the prosecutor will ask him, instead of spreading his brainspins."
"It's easy to sue him with a number of criminal charges, another thing is to prove them," explained his lawyer Florence Rault of the AFP (Agence France Press) before hearing his client.
Mr. Guérini, brother of Jean-Noël Guérini, the first man of the PS (Parti Socialiste) in the Department, was interested in giving the judge a memorandum to his justification before his hearing by means of his lawyers.
A member of Guérini, Philippe Rapezzi, was also charged and detained on Wednesday evening.
According to lawyer Lucien Simon, her client had never done anything but his deposit he had to lead to keep up.
With regard to the business competence or the destination of the associated funds, he would never have been aware, Simon said.
In this affair, Daniel Pinna, former Director-General of the Aubagne public service, was also accused of being sued for suspense and complicity on Wednesday, but then, under the obligation to stay away from these acts under judicial supervision.
"My client was able to provide explanations on the facts that were accused of him."
"The leading prosecutor took into account not robbing him of his freedom, said his lawyer Yann Arnoux.
Four other persons were sued and released from prison in the night of Tuesday to Wednesday, including two of them under judicial supervision, says Deputy Supreme Prosecutor Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy managing director of the Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM) disposal plant, is under trial because of "unauthorised influence and passive bribery".
Two public officials from Aubagne, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, were also arrested, one of them, on the basis of the title of "intervention and miscarriage of public goods by a public service representative", the other because of "commitment in the miscarriage of public funds".
The life partner of Alexandre Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, was also charged with the "healing and subjugation of social assets".
Among those who have been confronted with Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently detained for a similar affair of fraudulent public crafts that had affected Corsica.
The supporters suspected his company to have contributed to washing money from "high" criminal circles.
The investigation against X for alleged fraud in the award of public contracts, particularly in the disposal sector, is carried out in April 2009 as a result of anonymous letters in the files of several open investigation procedures.
It is clear from the near sources of investigation that the investigation focuses in particular on the conditions of the award and the operation of a deposit in La Ciotat, which also relates to waste from the Aubagne area, as well as to certain cities in the Marseilles (MPM) urban catchment area.
Affaire Clotilde Reiss: the Elysée Palace exceeds its intermediate function for Syria
Within more than six months, from July 2009 to May 2010, Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher who was detained in Iran for "spionage", held the French public in a breath, brought diplomacy in alertness and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All of this under the attention of the diplomats of the United States.
The American documents received by WikiLeaks and searched by the newspaper "Le Monde" reveal some backgrounds of this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée had explained to the Americans its strategy that had gone to give these advices on dealing with their own crisis of "issels" in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how the French leaders have tried to convince Washington that the liberation of the young French does not have the release of Majid Kakavand, a captured in France and sought by the American justice for the benefit of Iran's nuclear programme on the basis of trade in material.
Finally, they put the way in which the French Presidency has tried to manipulate the media for the purpose of making them credible the idea that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad has played a central role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss, in a glaring light.
In truth, he had done nothing in this regard.
A diplomat telegram, edited in Paris on 12 August 2009, entitled "Iran: French Commentaries on how to deal with hostages".
François Richier, Elysée-Consulter on strategy issues, was accompanied by Patrice Paoli, Director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle Orient with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explained the French method to her.
They advised Americans to make every effort to bring back their own nationals who would be violently detained in Iran.
"Let noise," they said, "articulates loud and clear and without omission" the words "basic human rights", "innocent", "sofortable release" in the media.
This is necessary in order to embarrass the Iranian regime, which is very sensitive to its image.
"Do this all the more, especially as the Iranians ask you not to do so."
Because "silence doesn't solve anything", past the discussion attempts about inconspicuous ways, the Iranians are "Masters in escape maneuvers".
Mr Richier added that the arrest of foreigners was a "common, Iranian tactic" : "isolating for the purpose of political extortion".
He announces that the release of Clotilde Reiss from prison (which was due on August 16th, on the day she fled to the French Embassy) "in order to pay a large sum of money to the Iranians" (230,000 euros deposit).
And he makes clear that Elysée anticipates further hostages, a phenomenon that will "strengthen itself".
The Iranians could "in the near future arrest another of the approximately 1,800 French citizens living in Iran," he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss was released from prison twelve days ago but is still being detained in Iran.
An information was put into circulation: Iran’s Majid Kakavand, whose extradition requires the United States for illegal trade in sensitive electronic material to Iran, has been released from prison after a judgment was delivered to Paris.
Like many other observers, the American Embassy raises questions about this disturbing co-incidence.
For Washington, which pursues the illegal Iranian networks of acquisition of the material intended for the nuclear programme, the release of Majid Khakavand is a bad news.
Did France buy a cow trade?
The liberation of Iran against that of the French?
On 4 September, on the occasion of another discussion with Kathleen Allegrone, François Richier assures that this is not the case.
The Elysée, he says, was not only "fully surprised by the judge's decision", but also tried to object.
"There has been a strong exchange between the French Bureau and the French Minister of Justice" (currently Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot change the judicial decision," he explains.
Mr Richier would also like to point out that Majid Kakavand is still under "severe" supervision of the French intelligence service.
The Elysée consultant selects a telephone number, re-opens, then informs the American diplomat, the Iranian "currently caught up in the buildings in Paris led by the Iranian Embassy".
During the custody of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysée does not protect his efforts to believe by means of announcements and "flight attempts" organized by the media, the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad plays a "important" and "influenceful middle role".
The Americans do not observe this activity without irony and observe that manipulation bears fruit, as several press articles reflect the official French version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 conjure up "the French authorities' media flash".
What is based on so much "Thanks testimony" to Mr Assad, the Paris Embassy is asking itself.
"Despite their declarations of praise, the French authorities secretly admit that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians actually did."
The document then deals with the reasons for the elysée's failure to implement this fiction.
The intensive communication effort "is aimed at confirming Sarkozy's policy of opening up to Syria," he analyses.
A policy launched in 2008 that "was perceived as premature and undeserved by numerous critics in France and abroad".
"The Syrian role of building up" Paris tries to "remember Syria in the eye of what kind of promise one can achieve by playing a constructive role in the region".
The aim is also to "sow discord between Syria and Iran".
The American Embassy knows this from a good source.
On August 11 François Richier had entrusted her with this: "We do not know, of course, whether the Syrians have done anything."
"But we thanked them despite everything."
"This should at least create confusion among the Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives her at the Elysée.
He thanked the president of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in favor of the release of our countryman".
No online games for young Koreans after midnight
The South Korean government will pass a law called "the Aschenbrödel", which prohibits young people from playing online games after midnight, by blocking their access, so indicated government leaders.
A draft law to encourage online games operators to deny young people under 16 years of age after midnight access to these games is presented to Parliament in December, painted representatives of cultus and family ministries.
"Many kids play these games all night long and then have difficulties in learning in school and also in living a normal life during the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary in order to ensure their health and right to sleep," said Jo Rin, Minister-General responsible for this draft law of the French press agency Agence France Presse.
The online games will then be available again from 6 a.m.
Manufacturer companies would have had a year to prepare for the application of the law, so it specified.
The government also considers asking manufacturers to cut down the time limit for access to these games on a daily basis to young people whose parents ask for it, added the person responsible.
It will also provide free programmes to those who wish to make it possible to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "networked" countries, and newspapers regularly report various events associated with intensive Internet use.
The country is also undisputed champion in online game competitions worldwide.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals against 58 other nations in the World Cyber Games.
2018-2022 World Cup: FIFA appoints the referee
On Thursday, the FIFA Executive Committee, in a bright excitement due to the suspicion of corruption, appoints the World Championships 2018 and 2022, a highly political election that threatens to push the technical criteria into the background.
However, one thing is certain: the 2018 edition of FIFA's royal discipline will take place in Europe, its traditional Hochburg (the 4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, the Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 issue will then be somewhat more exotic; the International Football Association hopes to be able to win new territories (Katar, Australia) for itself after the premiere on the African continent in 2010 or to pursue its branch in the United States or in Fernost (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities belonging to the delegation (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, Emir von Qatar, Belgian and Dutch head of government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) shows the degree of economic and political commitment of a World Championship.
So the work behind the scenes threatens to stop until the last minute.
Hardly any other way to draw up a hierarchy of candidates.
According to the FIFA evaluation report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) present more serious arguments than their competitors.
But these considerations will not be so important to the 22 members of the Exeutif Committee at the hour of the election.
The Sunday Times, which stood at the beginning of the revelations with the suspension of two members of the Executifcommitee (Reynal Temarii and Amos Adamu), could also well have ruined the opportunities for their own country, the cradle of football, which was only one time allowed to win the World Championship, namely 1966.
The BBC had given this again to the feeding ground on Monday by broadcasting a documentary report that takes under attack three influential members of the committee, namely Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Reason enough to annoy FIFA and embarrass the English leaders who, in the first place, had engaged in intensive lobbying with David Cameron in these last weeks.
The head of government is hoping for a new edition of the chess train, which was won by Tony Blair in 2005 for London to organise the 2012 Olympic Games.
Would this intensive effort be sufficient to restore the image of England before the committee?
Nothing is less safe, because the duo Spain-Portugal is not lacking in trumps with its already finished stages, its expertise (WM 82 in Spain, Olympic Games 92 in Barcelona, EM 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
But the economic and financial aspects of the two countries could dampen their ambitions.
The possible repressions against the English, as well as doubts about the solitude of Spain and Portugal, raise Russia's chances of becoming a weighty outsider despite its gaps in the dossier (Stadia, Hotels, Transport).
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has decided to urge the members of the committee to make an undisputed statement on the visits of the English press "an unfair competition in the preparation of the vote".
"One throws her with dirt, one tries to compromise her," weathered Putin.
For 2022, the United States, strengthened by the experience of 1994, seems to be the logical favourites.
First economic world power, headquarters of FIFA main sponsors, the country seems to have a long list of advantages to Japan and South Korea, which have set up a very nice project separately.
However, these new candidates seem premature for two countries that participated in the competitions in 2002.
Another threat: the FIFA's hotly expected approval of the 2026 World Cup for China, which will make the Asian chances fall to 2022.
With Australia and Qatar, who had all registered with the expectation of futuristic stages, FIFA pursues its expansion towards new areas, but these two countries pose a greater risk, because certainty.
Australia, as well as Japan and South Korea, may suffer from the weakness of television rights, which has been acknowledged by the European countries (because of the time shift), the sensitive nerve of FIFA.
Second mandate: the clarity
De Gaulle had really protected.
Mitterand had made him believe that he was dirting.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not show the slightest hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than this.
A mandate in the Elysée calls for the next one.
The current head of state will be ergo candidate in 2012.
But the obviousness is not well on the side of the mystery attached to the presidential function.
So you have to do as if the doubt would arise from now on.
In one, as in the other.
In 2006, members of Jacques Chiracs stated that a third mandate was not excluded without their own belief.
On 15 November Nicolas Sarkozy assured in serious tone to make his decision "at some point in the fall of 2011".
The fact that on Tuesday evening in the Elysée before the UMP-Parliamentarians, he would give the perspective of "two mandates" was thus a little feverish.
Was that the official announcement of his candidate?
Far failed.
The President merely recalled that the 2008 constitutional change limits the number of five years of office to only two.
He made a statement, no announcement.
It is not the first time that he mentions the presidential election in a humorous tone at such meetings.
"You have seven and a half years with me or at best," he told them in July 2009.
To a new one in May 2010: "Don't think that I don't think about the subsequent phase."
His words from the day before yesterday make him no more candidates than they did the day before, but also no less.
If they make comments, then for a double reason.
The acceleration of the race for the candidate with the PS on one side.
But it is not the start of the competition with Ségolène Royal, which Nicolas Sarkozy is driving to reveal himself.
On the contrary, it is his obvious candidacy in 2012 that many members of the PS warn at an early stage than accepted to fight.
The bad surveys on the other hand.
For the first time, the voters of the right would prefer a candidacy of François Fillon of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against 44%, according to the BVA-L'Express survey).
"We have a candidate, and there are no discussions with the UMP about this," responded immediately and cautiously to the Prime Minister's environment.
"If he had a defeat as possible, he wouldn't be a candidate," told Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will always believe in winning," says Alain Juppé, who has been aware of the facts.
Euro: the ECB is forced to retain its purchases of state papers
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB last year should provide an opportunity to show how to get out of the crisis, or at least to announce the arrangement of a large number of unconventional measures of monetary policy to come to its conclusion at the end of the year.
The crisis of European public debt is committed that the central bank in Frankfurt can certainly not afford to affect today's more than tense situation on the European bond markets in order not to cause their deterioration.
Political costs would be far too high.
The French Minister for Finance Christine Lagarde welcomed the active role taken by the ECB at a press conference yesterday in order to resolve Europe's sovereign debt.
It has not dared to say whether it is of the opinion that the central bank can do more, for example by encouraging its programme of purchases of government bonds.
"I reserve my considerations for my European trading partners (...)".
Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB in Brussels the day before, on the occasion of his hearing by the Economic and Monetary Committee of the European Parliament, did not have much to do with his projects, but rather had the pleasure of pointing out that the programme of purchases of state papers would "continue" on the secondary market and that we would "see" at the assembly on Thursday as the decisions fail".
Unique certainty: The ECB will leave its key interest rate unchanged at 1%, the most historically low level since May 2009.
In practice, the Treasury's bond purchases were doubled from the ECB last week to around EUR 1.35 billion.
And according to indiscretions of some traders, yesterday it is said to have made new purchases to Irish and Portuguese government papers.
All in all, Eurosystem central banks have been making purchases of 67 billion euros since May 2010.
Among dealers, the anticipation of a follow-up of the purchase price is not at all doubted (see page 29).
The public authorities are not expecting any more remarkable change in course.
If the bond transactions of more than three months will have already disappeared from the ECB's arsenal, the latter will still be able to make itself in a voluntary manner at the unrestricted reserve of funds over a period of one week up to three months.
The public authorities are already drawing attention to the fact that this measure will be extended for a few months.
"I cannot imagine that the ECB will substantially amend its programme."
"In any event, she would risk provoking new tensions in the short term," says Michael Schubert, the trader of the Commerzbank.
"A progressive exit planned for the course of the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely to be," says Norbert Bräms, Volkswirt at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In the field of its interventions on the public debt market, "the ECB should maintain such a volume of purchases of bonds that will revive the emerging market," adds Norbert Brams.
In view of the relevance of the exposed position of European banks on the markets of debt in the euro area, the central bank has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
"At any price, it must come to the place of the lack of investors on the market and act in such a way as to prevent the advance enthusiasm about the returns paid to the weakest countries," said one important bond holder yesterday.
For if the interest rates begin to rise, countries would be even more prevented from reducing their debt or even from stabilizing.
This is the price to protect the euro.
The Berlusconi government is covering Italy
After an alarming beginning of the week for Italy, the situation yesterday, with the decline of corner interest rates to 10 years, has relaxed a little.
A return to the deceitful silence.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister of Economic Affairs, the regional presidents, Giulio Tremonti, had qualified the situation as "indisputable" and had expected it with an "insurmountable" weekend, which the person immediately denied.
In any case, on Tuesday, German interest rates would have reached a record of 210 basis points, and the price of contracts to cover the risk of bankruptcy had increased to 263 points, which had caused a certain headlessness in Rome.
Silvio Berlusconi had pointed out to his Council of Ministers that Spain's discrepancy with German interest rates is 400 basis points.
His right hand, Gianni Letta, had, however, expressed himself as a "heaviest concern" of the "market turbulences" and a possible risk of infection from the direction of Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy of the eurozone, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that Italy is like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, a national expert at the Hudson Institute.
In the clear text, this means that its problem is the absence of economic growth and the accompanying, dwindling tax receipts that threaten the state to no longer cover its financing needs.
The last Brussels forecasts were a cold shower for the government.
In the future, an Italian growth of 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012 is expected... although the budget budget budget at the Senate is estimated at 1.3% and 2% respectively.
Under these conditions, according to the European Commission, the budget deficit will be still 4.3% of GDP next year (in contrast to the 3.9.% predicted by governments) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Therefore, the uproar for a new household collective, which could be used to a total of 7 billion euros after the holidays.
"If necessary, new savings measures will have to be taken", says CEO Olli Rehn.
At the hour, Italy receives support from international institutions.
"The foundations of Italy's economy are in order and its accounts are regulated, which we have been repeating for a long time," assures Arrigo Sadun, Italian trustee of the International Monetary Fund, which is entrusted with Italy at the IMF.
"There are no problems at present, neither in the short term nor in the long term, as despite its high debt (19.2% of GDP in 2011, A. d. R.), Italy is demanding lower stabilisation progress than in other countries," observes Pier Carlo Padoan, OECD's head executive.
The question of political instability remains.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a distrust request from the Chamber of Deputies by which the elected elections could already be organised at the end of March.
There is therefore a little favourable period for decision-making in relation to a serious crisis.
Europeans are thinking about the development of anti-crisis measures
Christine Lagarde stressed it explicitly yesterday at a press conference in Paris: "I believe it was proved on Sunday afternoon and also in the evening: the Europeans clearly hold together, are ready and committed to defend their currency as well as their currency area."
Although quite relative, the deduction recorded yesterday from the interest rates of European government bonds was water on the mills of governments and the ECB.
However, a start to normalisation cannot yet be mentioned.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's had announced that it could lower Portugal's debt note, which is probably the most effective target of the speculators today.
"As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political perceptibility, which is particularly important for the banking systems," said the exane BNP Paribas' public authorities.
Above all, especially since "the political time is much slower than that of the markets".
The European countries, which are well aware of both this gap and the danger it poses, are intensifying discussions to strengthen the anti-crisis measures already in place.
Informal deliberations between the most directly affected finance ministers and, in the wider sense, with their counterparts of the G20 are progressing well.
And this also with regard to the meetings of Eurogroup and Ecofin at the beginning of next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
On the plan is the loss of unconventional measures to strengthen the back of eurozone countries in the crossroads of the markets (see below).
As far as the EU Stability Fund is concerned, its Executive Director Klaus Regling started his Asia tour in Singapour on Tuesday to inform Fernost investors about developments in the crisis in Europe.
If the purpose of his visit is not explicit fundraising, he certainly prepares the terrain for this.
The first advertising expenditure from the EU Stability Fund is planned for next month.
Yesterday, an official U.S. representative of the Reuters agency had entrusted the United States with a possible increase of the fund mobilised by the additional direct commitment of the IMF.
Portugal and Spain, the countries in the first series, are, in turn, sending themselves to take on structural reforms, especially in the field of labour market organization.
Reforms, which will be added to the austerity measures, will, however, show effects in the near future.
Lisbon and Madrid take a different path than did Greece and Ireland.
Both, and the others, are at any price to avoid asking for international assistance before they have set up their own budget corrective and decided on essential structural reforms that will bring them back to their confidence in the long term.
In turn, European investors are talking about the options available to speed up the normalisation process of government bond markets.
Axel Weber, who was on his way through Paris on 24 November, first had the idea that if the 750 billions of euros were not mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund, the Union would not hesitate to get back into its own pocket.
Barclays Capital's public economy, with regard to the market in European public debt, judges that an extension of around EUR 100 billion would be sufficient, "preferably" in the form of a direct liquidity injection.
This appropriation is intended to cover the European mechanism of financial stabilisation, which is currently EUR 60 billion.
A advisory board that has every opportunity to be carefully examined in the capitals of Europe.
Above all, when market conditions are rising.
Snow and Glatteis: 24 Departments in Orange Alert Level
The snow episodes are still experiencing traffic difficulties, especially in the secondary transport networks of Brittany and threaten to affect various economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now in alert stage orange due to the threat of snow and glass risk.
The regions of Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienne have joined the 20 departments already in alarm level, 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, then later at night.
According to Météo France, the intense snowshoes will strike the north of the Gironde as well as the Charentes, it snows easily on the et Ile-de-France.
Snow covers from 2 to 5 cm are expected in the departments concerned, from 7 to 10 cm, as well as from 1 to 3 cm, even up to 5 cm in the Paris region.
The regions concerned are Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and the regions Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin.
Snowfalls are considerable enough to cause traffic obstacles and to interfere with certain economic activities, says Mété France.
In the region of Côtes d'Armor, several regional roads for heavy transport of over 7,5 tonnes are closed, including Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac.
The transport situation of the secondary transport networks in Brittany is very difficult, according to the transport police, who refuse to use their own vehicle only in case of emergency, and the use of some TER buses has been removed throughout the day.
In Picardy, school traffic was lifted for Thursday.
No specific restrictive measures were foreseen for heavy traffic on Wednesday evening.
The prefecture "demands the drivers to the highest degree of caution on the roads and to adapt their driving behaviour accordingly."
On Thursday, the Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) called on airlines to delete 25% of their flights from Roissy Airport in Paris and 10% from Orly due to the expected strong snowfalls.
The DGAB recommends that passengers contact their airline.
Gatwick Airports in southern London, as well as Edinburgh Airport, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Métro Grand Paris: first financial sketches
Since the debate on the modernisation of the transport sector at the Ile-de-France is in full swing, it rains billions.
At least in the discussions.
In particular, the 23 billion are called to mind for the Metro Grand Paris to be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
In order to lead to the construction of the SGP, the state has declared a capital injection of 4 billion euros.
In the theoretical scheme, this is the sum which the SGP would then allow to grant in the markets a part of the financial sum to its twofold.
Today, the first high-level calculations have finally come about.
The 2010 supplementary budget, which was approved by the Commission of the National Assembly in the morning, includes the measures envisaged to raise the first part of these funds.
These are two types of measures: the creation of a special tax on closure and higher taxation of offices at Ile-de-France.
The former, so deprived of Article 15 of the draft law, goes "in the interests of the public-law institution Société du Grand Paris".
"The product of this tax amounts to 117 million euros a year".
The second is a reorganisation of the existing corporate taxation: "to modernise it in order to increase the product resulting from it and to overreact this increase of the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would that bring?
A mystery.
This sum is not specified in the text.
Of the 4 billion, you're far away.
"It is said that tax resources are added to the EUR 4 billion of the capital injection imposed by the State and that the Société du Grand Paris is gradually made available for the project," the explanatory statement states.
The SGP does not find this system at all offensive.
"Since the moment you book revenue (the two taxes, that is, R.), you can cover the projecting for over three years and then draw it out of the 4 billion," it says.
"This is recorded in the budget and is gradually deducted."
The SGP suggests that 2013 will start to record the 4 billion for the 2014 budget.
This measure, whose 4 promised billions can still be sought for a long time, is in danger of creating a quite moving, parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will take place on 7 December.
Raughty Hackers and Emsy Spines
The Affaire WikiLeaks has a dual meaning.
On one side it has become an obvious scandal, a scandal that is merely a scandal in the sense of sanctity that governs relations between the states, the citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at international level and gives a foretaste to the future dominated by regression.
But let's go straight ahead.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation that any file created by a secret service (an x-national) is composed exclusively of newspaper sections.
The "extraordinary", American revelations about the sexual habits of Berlusconis discard nothing more than what one has been reading for months in any X-like journal (except those whose owner is Berlusconi), and the terrifyingly caricatured profile Gaddafis has been offering cabaret artists fabric for a long time for their sketch.
The rule, according to which the secret files may consist only of already known news, is essential for the dynamics of the intelligence services, and that is not only this century.
If you go to a library dedicated to esotherical publications, you will realize that every work (via the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, the Templer or the Rosenkreuzler) repeats exactly what has already been written in previous works.
This is not only because the author does not want to publish occult texts (but because he did not know where to find news about the non-existent), but because those who devote themselves to occultism believe in nothing but what they already know and confirm what they have already learned.
This is also the success mechanism of Dan Brown.
So are the secret acts.
The informant is lazy, and lazy (or limited mind) is also the chief of the intelligence service (otherwise he could be anything, for example editor at Libération), who only considers what he recognizes.
The top-secret information about Berlusconi, who sent the American Embassy to the State Department in Rome, was the same as the ones that had published newsweek the week before.
So why is such a lifting about the revelations of these dossiers made?
On one side, the messages, at least since the end of the Second World War and since then also the heads of government can call each other or take an airplane to meet for dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of some small representation tasks, have become espionage centers.
Every viewer of investigation films knows this very precisely, and it does not come out of hypocrisy that one does so to ignore it.
Nevertheless, the fact that it is publicly repeated violates the task of hypocrisy and serves to put American diplomacy in a bad light.
Second, the idea that an x-popular hacker can capture the most secret secrets of the most powerful country in the world is the significant blow against the prestige of the state council.
In addition, the scandal brings less victims than the "sharpents" into distress.
But we devote ourselves to the profound nature of what happened.
At the time, at Orwell's time, you could bundle all power like a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Since then, Orwell's prophecy could have proved to be perfectly correct, where one can control any movement thanks to the phone, any transaction made, the visited hotel, the chosen motorway and so on; the citizen would become a total victim of the eye of power.
But if one comes to the fore, what is happening today, that even the secret crypts of the power can no longer escape the control of a hacker, the control process ceases to be one-sided and becomes circular.
The power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - elected as the revenger of the citizen - can experience the secrets of power.
But how can you keep a power that is no longer able to preserve your own secrets?
It is true that any knowledge of the character Berlusconis or Merkel is basically a secret from mystery, as it reveals the public sphere; but in the style of WikiLeaks, it is also true that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets, means to rob them of any power.
WikiLeaks did neither Sarkozy nor Merkel wrong, but Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this blasphemy that has been brought to such a mighty power?
It is obvious that in the future the states will no longer provide any information reserved online - this would be like a hanging stuck on the street corner.
But it is equally obvious that it is desirable with the current technologies to be able to keep confidential reports secret via telephone.
Nothing is easier than to find out if and when a head of state moved on in an airplane and contacted one of his colleagues.
How could relationships be maintained privately and only for certain ears in the future?
I know very well that my prediction at the moment sounds like science fiction and romantic, but I see myself required to introduce the government officials to me, moving in a secret way imperviously on uncontrollable march routes, hiding their communications nowhere else than in mere memory, and beyond the few written information they have received in the shoe sales.
The information would be stored in a single copy in closed drawers: basically, the spying attempt of Watergate had less success than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that the technology is moving like a cancer nowadays, i.e. backward.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communication, the Internet reconstructs a telegraph with (phone) wire.
The (analogous) videocassettes had enabled the film researchers to explore a film band for band by spewing from the back to the front and venturing all the secrets of assembly, while the (numeric) CDs now enable nothing else than jumping from chapters to chapters, i.e. in macroportions.
The high-speed trains take you from Rome to Milan within three hours, while this requires three and a half hours by plane including the changeover.
It is therefore not exceptional that politics and communication technology come back on a car and horse.
A last observation.
In earlier times the press tried to understand what secrets were forged between the messages.
At present, it is the messages that call for confidential information from the press.
Climate: how France's financial promises are beautiful
One year after the Copenhagen Treaty, it is time to examine compliance with the fast-solved financing promises (also called "Fast Start" or early financing) implemented by developing countries.
And already the rough French fine speeches have been revealed.
With the Copenhagen Treaty, developing countries have committed themselves to providing 30 billion dollars between 2010 and 2012.
The EU has promised EUR 7.2 billion over three years, France EUR 1.26 billion (i.e. 420 million per year).
On the occasion of the opening of COP16, the EU has drawn all the registers to convince its partners of the fact of its commitment to fast start financing: detailed action report from its Member States, press conference, major side events, brochure distribution.
The operation is remarkable and valid for its real value: developing countries and civil society would like to see all developed countries make the same level of precision.
The EU announces that in 2010 it has released EUR 2.2 billion, which will pave the way for its commitment of 7.2 billion in 2012.
But if you look into detail, things are a little more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen Treaty, this money should be "new and additional" in order to ensure that additional use has been made without harming public development aid.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what "new and additional" means.
While the EU Commission had proposed harmonisation, certain member states, including France, have blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone selects the benchmark he considers best.
For example, the EU Commission has chosen itself as a benchmark for those of 2009: international financing will be maintained, and 150 million will be added for over three years as part of the funding "Fast Start".
Other countries have chosen similar guidelines, either in terms of year or terms at the level of public development aid.
In return, France considered that the financing of "all new projects" in 2010 was "new and additional".
In other words, there are no indicative values for expenditure in the previous year or at the global level of public development aid.
In concrete terms, the total sum of French aid to developing countries can remain stable (or decreases) - France provides for its commitment to comply with its "new and additional" financing commitments.
Another crucial element is the breakdown in donations and loans.
There is no rule over this, and everyone chooses his calculation mode.
Some of them, such as France, are 1 loaned € as equivalent with 1 donation.
Obviously this is difficult: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans for certain profitable investments (often projects linked to emission control, which are based on the most effective technology) can be justified, it is deceptive to present the euro that is taken as an equivalent to a euro donated... In addition, only the cost of the loan to the investor country should be counted as commitment (i.e. the equivalent of an interest rate).
But France has nothing other than the following considerations: it "respects" its commitment of 420 million euros by taking up 91.5% loans (389.8 million euros) and 8.5% donating) 36.1 million euros - see also the EU document to convince itself of this.
France is the only country in the EU where loans are used to a large extent.
Germany calls for 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (among other things) fulfil their obligations 100% with donations.
In other words, if the vast majority of the European Union spends € 1 in order to fulfil its obligations, France is giving just 10 cents and understanding a similar commitment.
Lovely hococcus!
All in all, France operates in its fast-start financing with a double dizziness: partly with a further development of the action over time and, on the other hand, with the reality of financial commitment.
France manages to make it believe that it has spent 420 million "new and additional" millions in accordance with its promises and saves 36.1 million euros.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems that it was Bercy who carried out the arbitration) could have a double negative effect; once EU-internal (why are the other member states continuing with the donation if it is sufficient to borrow?) and then in the negotiations, as the developing countries cannot be completely deceived...
The chapter of early financing is only a small question in a relatively short time compared to the overall debate on the climate.
But the drop could be too much in the immense machinery of UNFCCC.
Let us hope that this will not be the case.
Whatever the case, it is essential to learn his lesson from this first year of early financing.
First of all, France could announce a change in its method of accounting for the years 2011 and 2012, in the spirit of respect for its obligations and balancing justice with the other countries of the European Union.
In particular, France could bring forward discussions on the subject of long-term financing (a different, crucial and currently discussed issue): it is not possible to escape the question of "preparability" or the type of booking of its loans.
France could change its position to be just as advanced as it is in other matters.
The hope is therefore based on the new Environment Minister Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprising announcement about the fast start of France and its vision of "preparability" as well as the use of loans would naturally raise from the international trust base, which is necessary for further discussions.
Alarm - pesticides taken by children
A child of 10 years takes over the day 81 different chemical substances, according to a study published this Wednesday by the association Générations Futures (former movement for the protection of rights and respect for coming generations).
The association, which explains that its results "does not represent a statistically significant value in view of the small number of samples analysed, but rather represent an illustration character of the treated problem," had between July and September bought the food normally used in the supermarkets in Oise and Paris, from about a ten-year-old child to meals.
These typical meals, including the official recommendations of five fresh fruit and fruit parts, three dairy products and 1.5 litres of water a day, have been examined as well as the soaking of laboratories in search of chemical substances, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The plate balance is debilitating: 81 chemical substances, including 42 as possibly or probably carcinogens, classified five as safe carcinogens, as well as 37 substances with endocrine interference factor, according to studies of several institutions such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
"Even if, in the nearing totality of cases, the legal limits for each chemical, individually taken substance are not exceeded, this survey is very good taken away from the fact that the reality in which the consumer may be exposed to carcinogens or substances with endocrine interference factor is causing concern," the association notes.
Already at breakfast alone the butter and tea with milk contain more than ten of the potentially carcinogen-resistances and three safely proven as carcinogens, as well as more than twenty residues that can affect the hormone system.
The apple imported from Brazil, as the intermediate meal for the study, shows traces of six chemical substances, including a fungicide prohibited in France.
The same applies to the green beans from Kenya, including lunch where the study found traces of a strictly prohibited insecticide in the EU.
In addition, the hack steak, the tuna from the boxes, even the baguette and gum of pesticides and other chemical substances were nailed.
In tap water, the analyses revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
During dinner, the salmon steak with 34 determined chemical residues was the "richest", and even the plastic plate used to warm the meal in the microwave was not untaxed.
The study says that the final risk of this "damage cocktail" for consumers is "most likely undervalued".
In turn, the Alliance Europe Ecology-Les Verts (EE-LV) has proposed to introduce a moratorium on the use of pesticides in order to stop the "advancing of civilization diseases".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) identified 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables that are consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
