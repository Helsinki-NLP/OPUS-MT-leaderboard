The goods cost less than 20 euros.
The fee corresponds to 40% of the value of the goods....
I am #PRS_ORG# magnificence and so it is no problem for me.
Just need a number or instruction that I attach to the package so that it can be destroyed by you as return.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG# a few days ago... for 249€.
Today it costs 179€.
I honestly think that is very annoying.
Do I have to cancel the order and re-order it for the better price or is there another possibility of credit?
I also think, in principle, that children should not be considered to play a role for their little siblings.
However, I think it is also good for big siblings to take care of the little ones in proportion.
Take a quick look, help me get the bottle, etc.
So they learn responsibility, help in the family and are involved.
As long as they can still be enough child, I can see no problem.
If your K1 is working alone for a short time and it's OK for him, that's good.
You can best determine if this fits your children.
It is not the case that he should wrap K2 and accompany sleeping for hours.
It's probably questionable, purely legal.
That is why the psychologist's statement may come.
Because if something actually happened like a fire, burglary, earthquakes, alien invasion, etc., it would actually be too much responsibility for K1, taking care of K2.
Whether this is a risk you want to take, is of course your discretion ;)
Please help me find the title of a book again!
I remember reading a crim / thriller a few years ago, and although I can remember almost the whole story, the title doesn't want to come to mind anymore.
The story was about fear and therapy.
At the beginning of the story, an animal caregiver commits suicide by overwhelming himself with food and going to his robbery cats.
The case is taken over by a Commissioner who, after a brief investigation, is going to get to his therapist who operates a clinic where he is treating patients with anxiety.
The Commissioner has a small niece who also has a fear (of fire) and ends up with this therapist.
There is more suicide and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is assigned anonymously before each suicide to go and document the place of the Selbsmord and put the photos on the internet.
In any event, it turns out that this therapist operates some kind of underground therapy group where the patient is planted a chip that suppresses an anxiety centre in the brain and ultimately puts the patients in the most extreme way.
(One woman jumps out of the window another one to die)
This fear is referred to in the book as "the fight".
At the end there is a big showdown in the clinic that had to deal with a fire.
This is the gross act I am quite sure that the book was written in the original by a French author/author.
If this action is known to someone or even someone can tell me the title of the book, I would be very happy.
Oh, ever, I don't have the Wlan password available.
Must contact my husband first.
It can take a while.
What steps do I have to take after that?
Is it also possible to return the price difference ?
Child, 4 years old, Splitter under the thumbnail
Child, four years, has over the entire length wooden dividers under the thumb nail (outside).
I tried to pull him with a pinset.
It's very hard to grab.
It didn't work out and hurt.
Now the child reacts hysterically when we try.
No more chance.
I'm going to see a doctor tomorrow.

Due to Omikron: Johnson wants to promote fresh vaccination
Always new Omikron cases are causing politics and science in Great Britain.
Therefore, by the end of the year, all qualified adults in England are to receive a vaccination offer.
London - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to move forward even faster than previously in the case of corona vaccinations in view of the rapid increase in Omikron numbers.
Each adult in England should be given the opportunity to obtain a booster dose by the end of the year, provided that at least three months have passed since the second vaccination, Johnson said in a pre-recorded video message to his compatriots on Sunday evening.
So far, the target date was at the end of January.
The UK Government will provide additional support to speed up vaccination campaigns in the areas of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
In view of the omikron variant, there is an emergency, and therefore there is a need to increase the protection of the vaccine, Johnson said.
The good news is that the level of protection can be increased by a third dose.
"Let's get boosters!" said Johnson.
On Sunday, 1239 other Omikron cases were registered in the UK, increasing the total to 3137.
Compared to the previous day, this was an increase of 65 percent. dpa
will the full amount be refunded from the purchase price at the time of collection?
I'm in favour of everyone imagining themselves with pronouns
I sent out an application.
Today the invitation came to a conversation by e-mail.
I want to respond to the email.
But unfortunately, the name is not a "Peter", but a more complicated name.
I have Googleed him and depending on where he/she has a cultural background it is either a man or a woman.
**I have no idea how to write the email now.
Can anyone help me?
** I am a foreigner and do not want to hold any officials over my feet.
Conclusion: everyone should introduce himself with pronouns.
Have a total of five books on it.
4 of them.
Only the one I bought today is not going
Obviously, the chair had an apparent lack of sales.
How can such a upholstery damage occur after 9 months?
Only tried on the #PRS_ORG#.
It's been working since c.
No more 14 days.
Therefore, I have always bought the last books via the website and then read them on the #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# and wanted to buy 8.
However, there was no more.
Now they are available again and I want you to add 2 chairs to your order and charge me this.
[CW] The feeling if I can't help.
Content warning: I'm going to write something detailed about domestic violence here.
I just need to write something about the soul.
I (21) get in touch with the victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence more frequently for professional reasons.
A topic that really comes to my mind, and unfortunately too often, is that many victims don't get any help or think we can't help them.
I know that we can't do everything and it's not perfect.
But there are fewer things in my profession that move me more than if I can do nothing in such situations.
I see the blue spots, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in conversation under four eyes, with the perpetrator far beyond sight and listening, I cannot reach all.
I don't know what the reason is, maybe it's fear of revenge, fear of leaving the usual social environment, fear of disfellowshipping the children from this.
What I always want to make clear to everyone is partly very close to the tears, all worth living without violence.
I want all women to know that they don't just have to take violence.
I often wish I could help in any case... I know I can't.
But this will never make it easier.
Please, always remember that you are worthy of living without violence, that is so unfathomably important.
"Arcane" on Netflix: What does the series do for "League of Legends"?
Many fantasy, many complicated names, a stunning presentation: "Arcane", the series from the "League of Legends" computer game universe, has recently been launched on Netflix.
Why do we look forward to the already announced two season?
Basketball-Bundesliga: Derby-Debakel der MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg bei den Merlins Crailsheim
At least at Youngster Johannes Patrick was left.
Nothing more: For the second time within not even three months, the giants lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the game Ludwigsburg's coach John Patrick had said with a look back at the Pokal defeat at Hakro Merlin's Crailsheim in early October: "We still have some anger in the belly".
But after the game it did not lie down - but increased again in view of the 61:72 (28:38) defeat in the basketball-bondsliga.
In fact, more than the naked result disappointed the way in which the appearance occurred.
Substantial is a statistics that expresses the whole dilemma: the three-queet was just 13 percent, 4 hits (all by the young Johannes Patrick) said and write 31 attempts - still questions?
The answer was John Patrick: "After the victory at Tenerife, we were simply not focused enough, and didn't realize what we were training".
It's hard to move the ball.
Quite the other way, his opponent Sebastian Gleim responded: "A horny game to win against Ludwigsburg for the second time," said the lucky coach.
"It felt like 10 000 people ago."
On Saturday in the Hohenlohe-Arena only 750 visitors were allowed, but they came at their expense.
Not least because of BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who marked 22 points and guided the game of his team.
"The best gamemaker I've ever trained," Gleim praised.
While Patrick's team itself failed the performance carriers such as Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) all along the line.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) the giants prevented a total debacle and arrived up to eight points after they had already returned 39:59.
In addition to Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon came on twelve points.
Fortunately, a lot of time to fight doesn't stay.
Already on Wednesday (19h) the giants receive the Skyliners Frankfurt, before then also in Ludwigsburg a maximum of 750 spectators.
We used to have a different address, but I changed it.
Yeah, I reported a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all warranty claims were rejected.
We have been legally informed again and have therefore ascribed it again.
We originally reported half a year ago.
Steps out of the egg: Max Rabe becomes 59
He is able to inspire his audience with reinterpretations of strokes from the 20s and 30s.
Currently he is on the go with the program "Good day, dear luck" - if he may perform.
Max Raabe would have wanted to celebrate his birthday on stage this Sunday in Leipzig.
But there's nothing out of it.
The planned concert was held in May 2022 - "on the official instruction" in order to reduce the corona virus.
Other of his performances planned in the Advent era must also take place first, as it is called on the website of the singer, who is now 59, and his musician (www.palast-orchester.de).
From January onwards, the artists want to make up for their schedules already in 2020 due to the pandemic.
Born on 12 December 1962 in the north Rhine-Westphalian Lünen, Max Rabe has already sung a lot and enjoyed singing as a teenager.
In Berlin he studied opera singing, and in 1986 he founded the palace orchestra together with fellow students.
Since then, the baritone has established itself with its repertoire of beats and Chansons in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
He was often awarded prizes.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached - just like his success album "For women this is no problem" (2013) - the second place of the charts.
He made it out of the niche into the mainstream.
Always elegantly dressed, the blond hair is strictly combed back and on labels, Max Rabe is no longer able to think away from the current German-speaking music landscape.
With the program "Good day, dear luck" he has been on tour since 2020.
Hello #NAME#, is it also possible to get a small pattern piece of furniture in advance?

It still doesn't work I just can't look for the cover leaf but not leaves.
Federal Minister for Construction Klara Geywitz: Unfitting does not create a new apartment
The new Federal Minister for Construction Klara Geywitz (SPD) has spoken out against the expropriation of large housing companies, as required in Berlin in a referendum decision.
"With disfitting, no new apartment is created, it only changes the ownership structure," said Geywitz in an interview with the "Dayspiegel" (Sunday).
My goal is to give tenants security that their rent will remain affordable in the next few years.
By the way, a colourful mix of private owners, cooperatives or residential companies is the best protection against monopoly formation.
In Berlin, the coalition of SPD, Greens and Left Party wants to set up an expert commission to deal with the outcome of the referendum.
But if the situation is not relaxed, Geywitz did not rule out discussions with the FDP in the traffic lights coalition about further tightenings in the rental right.
The coalition agreement provides for a rental price brake by 2029, a limitation of rental increases in tense housing markets and the extension of the rental mirror.
I will talk to the Minister of Justice to implement this as soon as possible.
However, if the rental market does not relax, "we will talk to the coalition partners about further steps," said the SPD politician.
Hello, I wanted to order something and after a few days, I noticed that I forgot the last step in the payment.
Unfortunately, the product is no longer available.
Do you know when it will be in stock again?
Or is it going to come again?
#PRS_ORG# with storage space (180 x #NUMBER# cm),

Then I will redeem the self-contained upon the new order
Thank you for the quick clarification!
If the lamp is shipped in March, how long will the shipment take?
I've already cut my finger
That's an absolute fragility.
At least 100 deaths by Tornados in Kentucky
In a devastating storm system, numerous Tornados have been pulled through the US.
Only in Kentucky could be more than 100 dead.
The pictures from there remind of a war area.
During the night on Saturday in the USA, several Tornados caused serious devastations, possibly calling for up to one hundred deaths.
The storms leave an approximately 320-kilometre snow of devastation, especially in the state of Kentucky.
His governor Andy Beshar said that everything was gone after a visit to the disaster area, wherever the Tornado was rushed.
Houses, shops, government buildings - just gone.
Parts of industrial plants, roofs are in the trees.
It is difficult to imagine that this is possible at all.
He calculates only in the state of Kentucky with up to a hundred deaths, the official numbers rise hourly.
Hello, I've just seen that she's display display display #NAME# sold out.
That's a very bad thing.
Is it still being produced?
Or is it entirely taken from the range?
Is there the possibility to order this display in another country?
until when you report?
If the delivery cannot take place in my apartment, I must cancel the order !
I understand, just can I order the ceiling now and have it delivered to Germany, which is in the shopping cart?
I had returned an artike via the contact form or had given up a return and wanted to ask if it was being received or processed, as I have not yet received confirmation.
Companies pay immunities and change advertisements
While the Federal Government further rejects the proposals for vaccination, companies in Austria have taken the initiative themselves and offer their employees money premiums for vaccination.
They are therefore in line with the social partners ÖGB and the Chamber of Commerce, which today called for financial incentives for vaccination.
The conversion of advertising slogans to immunizations - according to the German model - is also intended to increase the willingness to use corona vaccinations.
He's changed to a company he's been teasing about.
That doesn't make his situation any better than yours.
Waiting and drinking tea.
It's been a year.
Obviously, he didn't stick to his old place and looked for something else.
You can do that, too.
And that he didn't like you at the time: well, it doesn't matter.
He didn't like his job either.
There's too many variables.
Please accept the cancellation.
This will then be legally relevant.
I'm making a screen shot.

Aid to first of all own campaigns
Boron to the gruse!
I am currently leading adventures for a group of 4 friends across the gripper and want to seamlessly lead my heroes into a campaign written specifically for the players.
We play DSA 5.
The big bow is made, the evil-weights and their motivations written, the individual files are thought out, and now I am writing the entrance adventure and already stumble at the first encounter about my own feet.
The premise is that the heroes are to bring a peat with grain from Gratenfels to a small village near the Thuran lake.
That's where the further action is supposed to develop.
Some miles away from the village, a group of Goblins will open up to the hero and lure her into ambush.
I would like to give the player's characters the opportunity to solve the confrontation in various ways: perceiving, acting, threatening to recognize the danger at an early stage, whatever happens to the players.
Group strength: 8 ordinary goblins, 2 armed with spears, 6 with bows and sabres
In case of no notice, the Goblins lurk up the hero in a hollow path and flank to each three left and to the right arches armed the movement, while two with spears stop the movement.
Should it come to battle and be subject to heroes, I have two solutions
1. The heroes are all found and healed unconsciously and then by the son of the village school, a half-fifth.
The car is, of course, gone.
2. Should a defeat be inevitable just this half-elf with two of his servants and come to the aid of the hero in the battle.
The car is still there, all great.
How appropriate do you keep Deus ex Machina of Solution 2?
Is the Encounter going into adventure too much?
The Goblins group will play a crucial role later, so it is not just cannon feed.
EDIT: Wow, I didn't expect so many answers, especially not with so many great suggestions and tips.
I'm sure I'll look after many of your ideas and now I have more confidence in my narrative.
I've built the lamp apart again.
And put together again.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
That's why I'd like to send her back anyway
If you can get the returnlights then I can pack the lamp and bring it to #PRS_ORG#.

Is everything then picked up again or only the storage room part?
I'm inspired by Sky Sport F1
Hello dear F1 fans, over the season, the quality on the German Sky has decreased more and more, so I want to get a little air with this post.
First of all, in the middle of the F2 race today, the transmission was interrupted to start the F1 pre-report on time.
Although due to the delayed start and the start of the schedule was far behind planning, one could still have shown the last (planned) ten minutes as well as the championship decision (!).
However, it seems that for legal reasons, F1 takes precedence and therefore has to limit itself to everything else, so Sky DE did not have a choice here.
It's stupid though, especially as Sky UK has transferred the race.
Nevertheless, a small praise: the commentator Olivier Schwarztyes has accompanied the difficult situation around the serious accident well.
Then in the F1 there was once again a regular ignorance of the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, so both did not know that under a red flag you can change the tires.
Although this situation already existed in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both came to the conclusion that steps may change the tires when there were corresponding radio calls to Hamilton on this issue.
At Sky UK as well as RTL, both commentators knew immediately that there is this possibility for departures.
I think that such elementary rules should be known simply when you comment on the F1 on a pay-TV channel.
Nor is it the first rates of mystery, which is now possible or prescribed according to rules, both simply have constant uncertainties in the matter of rules.
In general, the cuddly comment style of Roos does not like, but admits that the taste is.
But I really like Heiko water from RTL better there.
In addition, constant nightmares come, both of them simply unprofessional, such as the ordering of coffee from (unsuspectingly) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD" by Ralf Schumacher.
The latter makes a lot of unrest in the comment that he does not seem to take seriously.
Not least, the advertising just takes over at Sky, in the runout Sky is the only channel that goes into advertising as you can listen to F1TV because only the German sound track without comment must come out right after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do that.
These two channels in the trainings also make less advertising than Sky, and that as a free TV channel.
You have to praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, but this alone does not make me overlook the disadvantages.
The remaining program of Sky Sport F1 is also very poor and full of repetitions.
Overall, Sky is really the worst German-speaking channel that transmits the F1.
In Unironic terms, RTL makes a better job on the four races that they can still transfer.
In any case, the magnificent F1 season is much less fun than it would be possible with a reasonable transmitter.
I'd be interested in your opinion.
On the here: #PRS_ORG# pendulum lamp, brass and multicolor glass x 1
Hello, I have an item to be delivered last week that is still not delivered.
I've been in contact with the chat twice and nothing yet.
The First Lady told me that it will be sent on Monday, the second lady told me yesterday that she will check and send an email and she never answered.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12.12.19.
One of them had a defect after a relatively short period of time (the material has a hole in the front part of the chair).
I'm asking for support.
Fan pumps are excellent to supply an aquarium in addition to oxygen.
It is also possible to operate a filter system via air lifts.
This series is offered in 3 versions.
Look at the table at the end of the offer.
There you can see the benefits in comparison.
If the pumps are strong enough, you can operate whole systems with them.
If you own a large aquarium, pumps with 2 or more outlets are suitable for connecting multiple outlets.
The MK series has one, two or four outputs, but depending on the model fan pump also offer to set an accent in the aquarium, e.g. with an air curtain (find with us in the shop) or with a decor that transforms the air bubbles into a function.
Here would be a treasure chest, muschel or something like that.
The MK series has a special, soundproofed construction and thus ensures low operating noise.
The installation is very simple.
The fan pump is connected 4/6 mm by means of an air hose to an airflower etc....and it can start already.
The fan pump should be equal or higher than the water level and placed outside.
If the fan pump is lower than the water level, you should put a return valve in between.
Simply cut the air hose and put the valve in between.
This would prevent the water running backwards, which runs the water out of the basin through the pump...
Should the fan pump be installed outdoors, you should be covered and protected from moisture, as do other air pumps.
The pumps of the MK series are pure power packs that consume little energy
Even if we specify the processing time of 3 days here in ebay, the packages are packed daily and the packages are picked up here daily.
Running well on the way, it's very fast.
We only want to prevent a little so that no one is confounded just because it took a little longer.
It would be so, not everyone has understanding for all the employees who also work in the shipping industry...of course there is no corona here.
Please do not rate equally bad, just because the delivery is delayed, this is exclusively due to the parcel services.
Of course, one likes to gossip about these services, even if we say right now, they have it damn hard
This is also very different regionally.
Be no one evil, stay healthy and we all hope that there will be better times again.
how long does it take to order the yellow with and without armrest?
Can you order the legs in light here?
Amazon founder Bezo sends astronaut daughter and moderator to space
The daughter of the first American in space, a TV moderator and four more passengers made a short trip to space.
They were transported on Saturday by the rocket system "New Shepard" by Blue Origin from Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
The flight took place in the west of Texas, the U.S. state of Texas.
Under radiant blue sky, Bezos most personally took the freshly carved astronauts into reception after their return.
"Welcome back," said Bezos, dressed in a blue room suit when he opened Luke to the capsule.
Under the applause of friends, family members and employees of Blue Origin, the six passengers climbed out and hugged the Amazon founders.
According to Blue Origin, they traveled for ten minutes and 13 seconds, reaching a height of 107 kilometers.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of Nasa-Astronaut to All-floated Alan Shepard (1923-1998), after which the rocket system is named by Blue Origin, and the 50-year-old TV moderator Michael Strahan were guests of honour, the other four passengers had paid for their tickets: space engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess and his son Cameron.
How much they paid for their ticket in each case did Blue Origin not share.
Laura Shepard Churchley reminded her father's mission after a short flight.
He had to work hard on his stakes and do everything himself.
She just flew along like that, the 74-year-old said she was laughing.
Michael Strahan was also enthusiastic.
He would love to return to space the same way, said the moderator.
"New Shepard" flies up to 100 kilometres
The New Shepard rocket system flies largely automatically.
The capsule separated from the rocket during the flight reached a height of about 100 kilometers above the earth, temporarily with weightlessness before the reusable object returned from large parachutes.
The International Aviation Association and many other experts view the Earth as a border to space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was already the third manned all-out of Blue Origin: At the first in July Amazon founder Bezos himself was on board, along with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former US driver and an 18-year-old Dutchman.
In October, the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner, who became world famous with his role as Captain Kirk in Star Trek, was also the former Nasa engineer Chris Boshuizen, the entrepreneur Glen de Vries and vice-president of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin to push forward business with space tourism largely without scientific research interests for the good of humanity and without regard to the climate.

Someone working in biochemistry or studying biochemistry
I am currently studying biochemistry in the first semester and actually find the subject quite exciting and even in the laboratory I am not disturbed (have already the inorganic chemistry internship behind me).
Of course, I had also been informed before I was studying about career prospects, but I still thought at the time I was going to study and become a PhD student.
But at the moment I have doubts, especially depressing my career prospects.
On the one hand (Studycheck etc) you always hear super professional opportunities and the profession is totally sought, on the other hand you can hear from unemployed biologists and incredibly badly paid jobs.
That is why I would be really interested:
1) As what are you working at the moment?
2) Are you satisfied with your work?
3) What have you studied / what training have you done?
4) Would you do the whole thing again?
Thank you for your answers!
At the moment, I am really unsure and consider that in 2022 I might be breaking off my studies and making an education as a specialist computerist.
If you have experience there, they also like to write :)
Extra stress before holidays & holiday weekends
This topic came up with me last week.
But I had to use my long weekend to relax.
That's why a post is about that.
Not only before big holidays, such as the Christmas holidays, there is great stress in our operation.
As it seems, there are also those before holidays plus bridge days.
It was like this: Last week, Mariä Himmelfahrt was, which is called "Auffahrt" in Switzerland.
On Friday, most people and businesses make a bridge day, which is therefore semi-official.
So it was a long 4-day weekend in the house last week.
So, what was going on last week?
All the stress.
Lauter E-Mails, who must be out there before the driveway, order here, everything *unconditionally* before the long weekend.
Because... well, because?
Because "next week" sounds like that after so much time and that must not be?
Or because people all seriously want to afford as much as they do in a shortened week as in a normal one?
Not only was I stressed then on Wednesday, but I was also powerfully nervous.
What is this self-isification about holidays?
What are our holidays for then if we are not allowed to give them properly?!
The stress did not come from above, the colleagues were all so self-evident.
My question is: are we just like this, the Swiss?
Is this our reformed-evangelic way?
Or do you know that in the north?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in their Thuringian homeland - but has no gifts yet.
"The beautiful thing, even if there should be no snow in Erfurt, you just drive to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest," said the actress and singer Hit Radio FFH.
She will agree to the feast by baking and basting with her son's places.
"I love that," said Catterfeld.
But until the momentous days, she still has a lot to do: "For the first time I don't have any gifts, I have to start now."
NEKTON-Bio supports a smooth process of mice and feathering.
NEKTON-Bio contains all vital vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 μg biotin/kg.
NEKTON-Bio gives the bird a smooth and shiny feather.
The majority of the damage caused by birds are due solely to diet defects.
Since the feather consists of proteiny substance, a particularly rich and balanced protein nutrition of the bird is a prerequisite for the formation of a flawless feather dress.
For a functioning metabolism, daily food must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
Most of the animal losses occurring during the mouse are based on insufficient or unbalanced protein intake and/or insufficient supply of vitamins and minerals.
In the composition of NEKTON-Bio, the unfavourable ratio of amino acids in most plant feed is explicitly taken into account and balanced.
No further vitamin preparation should be administered during the use of NEKTON-Bio.
NEKTON-Bio is cold water soluble and can be easily administered via the drinking water or via the soft food.
Thank you. I found it.
Unfortunately, still doesn't work
DDR-Handwerksmodel Altbau E-Lok E 95 03 DRG/ DR, the Lok was in use in Schlesia and Central Germany, the very rare locomotive probably stems from the conversion proposal of the model railwayer ME Heft 11/1968, used with playing tracks and fault parts see photos, function well, The E 95 series is a heavy freight train electric locomotive of the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (DRG), which has been designed for the tracking of heavy coal tracks in the Scottish network, the kit may also come from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
A locomotive is located in the DB Museum Halle (Saale) and we are operationally designed
In 1924 the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft had commissioned the AEG to present proposals for an electric locomotive, which should be able to transport 2,200 tonne coal trains and 530-tonne passenger trains at 45 km/h travel speed on this route.
The maximum speed required was 65 km/h.
Thus, in March 1926, the DRG determined the delivery as a 1'Co+Co1' locomotive with a tactile bearing drive AEG with the supply of the mechanical part, the Siemens-sucking plants with the electric part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, six locomotives were delivered, which received operating numbers E 95 01–06.
All of them survived World War II and then found themselves in the territory of the later GDR.
In 1946, the locomotives entered the Soviet Union as repair goods.
They returned to Germany until November 1952.
The reworkability of all six locomotives was established in the Dessau Reichsbahnremigungswerk.
[4] As the need for heavy freight transport locomotives increased with the progressive re-electrification of the central German network, the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were developed in 1959, with the other machines serving as spare parts donors.
The E 04, E 44 and E 94 were first built in larger numbers.
It was only when the E 94 had to be seen that the number of reprocessing could not be further increased that the E 95 was at the point of the reprocessing.
[4]The locomotives were first stationed in the Leipzig-Wahren railway station.
They came to the railway station Hall P in 1960.
They were mostly used in their own orbital plan in front of coal trains from the Geiseltal towards Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
With increasing age, the complex control of locomotives proved difficult.
Thus, it often occurred that shooters remained stuck in switching cases.
Then the beeman with hammer and wooden throat who was constantly riding on this locomotive had to solve the shooter again during the ride.
Damages to the motors often occurred and resulted in month-long failures in the locomotive.
[5] Since at the end of the 1960s there were enough new building locomotives and a significant expansion of the electrical plant was not planned at the time, the Reichsbahn could give up on old locomotives and most of the divider holes so that the E 95 were put out of service.
They added that the Deutsche Reichsbahn wanted to occupy electric locomotives only once more, which would have caused a problem in the train operation due to the above-mentioned difficulties with the machines and the visibility of the driver's stand.
[5] After the end of the E 95 02 and E 95 03 in mid-69, the latter followed the E 95 01, which quit the service on 5 October 1970.
The proposed new designation 255 001 was therefore never used.
Until the E 95 02 all locomotives were disintegrated.
The E 95 02 was installed as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10 as a soft heating facility at Halle Central Station.
It took some time for those responsible at the Reichsbahn to be convinced that the E 95 as a museum locomotive would be preserved.
In 1979, the first external work of the locomotive began with the aim of presenting it to a car show at the RAW Dessau.
[5] Since then, it has belonged to the Dresden Transport Museum as a non-profit museum locomotive.
In 1986, the locomotive was completed internally.
In the DB Museum Halle (Saale), the locomotive museum is cared for.
Since 1995, employees of the traditional Bw Halle P have been working on the operational work of the locomotive.
In April 2015, the locomotive was presented for the first time for an exhibition in Museums-Bw Arnstadt with new internal and external paints, with the transformers being checked and five motors operational.
-The locomotives were in use until 1945 on the Schleswig Mountain Railway and the branching tributaries, where they proved themselves on the basis of their reliable drive and low maintenance effort.
In February 1945, the machines were relocated to Leipzig as a central German network.
The main area of use was , initially , , , .
Handwork model H0 in OVP, function well, there are optical reworks necessary at the lok in own work, dusted, with playing tracks, cellar smell !!!, very rare manual work model, very small edition- the kit may also come from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN
The packaging can show labels and bearing traces.
Yes the F-parts are it
I got a bed from you guys.
However, there were problems with one part.
The central beam is held by two feet..sufferers are too narrow and the beam cannot be mounted on the feet.
What are we gonna do now?
I can't build the bed.
The central bar is kept by two feet, which are unfortunately misproduced.
The centre bar does not fit into the intended holder.
So I get new ones.
When will they be sent away?
No flats.
These are, according to the assembly instructions the right of the shape, they were just too narrow
But that doesn't matter.
Mainly they fulfil their purpose
They're not flat with me.
Could I get these?
Hello #NAME#, should I explain the problem to you again?
Residential fire with two lightly injured and high damage
Two people were easily injured in a fire in a residential home in Oberbayern.
In addition, an estimated damage occurred in the six-digit euro area, as reported by the police on Sunday.
The fire probably spread from a carport to the adjacent residential house in Kinsau (Landkreis Landsberg am Lech).
According to the report, two residents were hospitalized on Sunday with slight smoke poisoning.
The exact cause of the fire was not known at first, but the police did not go out of intentional fires.
The Kripo Fürstenfeldbruck has taken over further investigations.
But that's what happens a lot later.
And I have to pay again shipping costs.
To abdicate Fake News - Biontech CEO Releases Vacc photo
On the social network "LinkedIn" Uğur Łahin published a photo of his first vaccination at the beginning of 2021
Biontech CEO Uğur őahin had not yet publicly expressed himself to his vaccination status.
Now the entrepreneur published a photo showing his corona vaccination.
A friend's illness has moved him to tell him.
The CEO and co-founder of the Mainz company Biontech, Uğur Łahin, has published a photo showing how he receives vaccination against the coronavirus.
In the social media, there was false information that I was said to have not been vaccinated.
In fact, my wife and I received 3 doses of the Biontech-Pfizer vaccine," wrote on Friday in a post in the "LinkedIn" network.
"For a few months, friends have forced me to post a photo of me who has been vaccinated to counter these false rumors."
So far, he has rejected this because communication should not revolve around him.
But a call over the past week changed his opinion: "I was deeply sad when I learned that an old schoolfriend of mine is currently fighting for his life.
He fights a severe covid-19 disease and has been hanging on a respirator for three weeks.
The schoolgirl and his family were not vaccinated, wrote again.
He didn't ask for the reasons.
"The most common cause, however, seems to be anxiety, which is often fueled by misinformation and mistrust."
Fear can only be difficult to fight with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences.
On the Internet, an interview with the Deutsche Welle circulates, in which Uğur Łahin says he is not vaccinated.
However, the video was created in December 2020, as the Deutsche Welle himself explained.
"I'm not allowed to get the vaccine myself by law at the time," said the man at the time.
There was a prioritization in Germany in the vaccination of the vaccine.
In the meantime, prioritisation has long been lifted - and the Biontech boss has been able to impregnate himself three times.
Fire in revolving plant: tens of thousands of people without electricity
In several municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia, the light went out on Friday evening: no more electricity and in many cases no heating.
A fire had paralysed a revolving station.
After a fire with severe damage in a revolving station, tens of thousands of people in the Rhine-Sieg-Kreis in North Rhine-Westphalia had to come out for about 24 hours without electricity.
The fire took off the lights at 41,000 affected residents in several municipalities on Friday evenings.
The caregiver Westnet reported that on Saturday numerous emergency power aggregates had been in operation until the large-scale disturbance could finally be completely fixed in the late evening.
Firemen and helpers of THW provided support in the municipalities.
The authorities offered care places in schools and called for neighbourhood assistance.
The caregiver thanked those affected for their patience and assistance for their work.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought considerable restrictions.
We also thank the affected municipalities, the circle, the fire brigades and THW for their tireless use," said Florian Witt, head of the primary technology sector, in a statement on Saturday evening.
The repair of the damage would take a few days, since the Westnet operators could only put some lines back into service provisionally, he explained.
A technical defect led to the fire according to company specifications.
Flow stream
The fire broke out on Friday at around 7.15 p.m., according to the data from the Westnet in the Neunkirchen-Seelsscheid substation, has severely damaged parts of the 10,000 volt system.
There, extensive cleaning and repair work was needed.
At the same time, a connection to a 30,000 Volt voltage level had been established.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply is back.
Since Saturday 18:00, more than 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth had had electricity again.
A further 20,000 inhabitants of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid had been gradually connected from 21.30 a.m.
Since 23.15 a.m., the most recent ones would still have electricity from the outage.
More than 80 Monteurs from Westnet and partner companies were in use.
The authorities also called for neighbourhood assistance after the construction of an emergency power supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon.
"It is important now that citizens take care of elderly or single people in their neighbourhood and share them with local fire brigade houses when they are needed help," said Mr Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
When setting up and operating emergency power aggregates, the main focus was on the inhabitants of Altenheimen.
In addition, according to authorities, temporary care places were set up in schools for those people who were not able to provide themselves or who needed the power-related medical equipment or were dependent on medical care.
Hello!
Unfortunately, the blanket is sold out in Germany.
Can I buy them from you and pay them in euros?
It is the daily deck #PRS_ORG# in blue green.
I hope you also have a nice day and please stay healthy
But I can't assemble that undercase on the table top.
It is Custom #NAME#.
There are 3 versions of that.
We wanted those with table top diameter of #NUMBER#
we have 155cm diameter.
Today my #PRS_ORG# arrived, but I can't push it together and therefore shorten it.
Can you help me out there?
Otherwise I would have to send her back because otherwise it is not suitable for the purpose.
I would appreciate a feedback
Yes, that's really easier!
Then let's do it like that!
You'll send me the return card by mail?
The repair is now complete.
I had already tried this before the chat.
However, before the purchase I had not restarted the E-#PRS_ORG#.
Do you want me to do that now?
I find such a low credit almost unscathed.
We do not agree with that
Nordic combination: combiner Riiber wins
The German Nordic combinationers Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid have been printed at the World Cup in the Estonian Otepää.
The duo had to be hit once again by the outstanding Norwegian Jarl Magnus Riiber, who had already started the race with a great advantage after the ski jumping.
Return of order number #NUMBER#
When will the money be transferred back to my account?
Yes, we've both made new and use version 4.5...
could be they've heard of problems before
Got directly with my #PRS_ORG#, a book purchased it also seems to be on it.
As soon as I want to open it, the message comes, ups!
This document could not be opened.
File may be incorrect they report to the customer service.
As far as I can recognize it is a #PRS_ORG# epub file.
Can she help me?
Chat connection is gone and now?
I have to work in between, too!
To ensure that the colour order becomes even and clean, you should clean the components with some soap water of dust, fat and fingerprints, rinse with clear water and dry off.
Before you bring the brush to the model for the first time with a new color, it is recommended to practice 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do this on the later no longer visible inside of the components or on a yogurt cup.
The first line on the component
Draw the brush evenly next to stroke.
A slight overlap of the layers of colours will later provide a uniform surface.
Avoid going fast and wipe with the brush.
This creates unrealistic areas.
A model is not a garden fence.
Start with the bright colors.
The dark might appear later.
Metal tones and metallic colors come to the end with a separate brush.
Otherwise, it can come to unsavory metal slurries if they mix with normal colours.
Let the painted parts dry for one day before you install them.
The models achieve the original true appearance through the decals or deceleration images.
From hoist signs on airplanes through ship names to germinations and labels for car models: The decals give the model the last cut.
Apply the decals in the correct order, as long as the components are still easy to achieve.
An aircraft cockpit can be bonded or more easily before it is installed in the hull.
Even more important than the right tool, such as scissors, pinsettes and toothpicks, are during bonding time, patience and a quiet hand.
Cut out each decal individually and set it to your right.
Decals are also called water slide images, because you breathed their back with water for a short time, until the carrier's paper gets dark through the wets.
Then you just put the picture in a small piece from the paper and put it on the appropriate position on the model (which you have also exposed before).
While holding the decal on to the model with a tool, you pull the carrier paper away on the side.
Attention: Always check if the picture is sitting right before you put it completely off the paper so that it doesn’t stick to the finger, kneeling or even tear.
Soak excess water with a household cloth.
Attention not suitable for children under 3 years
I can only open a book briefly as soon as I look for something else then I no longer read the book and need to log out and log out and reload the book and search for the place until where I have read it.
On Saturday I've already communicated with you.
Do I get it by e-mail?
Also for all 3 packages?
For the lamp came to me in three packages.
Thank you so much!
Then I'll buy somewhere else as soon as the money's back.
But do I get it back?
Child wishing treatment at PKV / What is a "insurance case"?
Hello together,
We have been in child care treatment for some time now when it comes to accounting with the PKV, it suddenly goes across.
The following row after:
We had requested the children's education in advance at the PKV and received the promise of 3 attempts.
The tests were in no way restricted (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to successful pregnancy and birth and was charged with PKV.
Some time later, we tried to have a second child, and carried out 2 (unsuccessful) attempts, but they did not yet calculate with the PKV.
We again requested the acquisition of costs at PKV and again received 3 further attempts.
After some further attempts (we have carried out more attempts than promised, we are logically expecting the most expensive with the PKV) we submitted the invoices to the PKV and got the bad surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2+3), the PKV wants to make only 3 attempts.
The reason: With the pregnancy/birth the remaining 2 attempts of the first promise expire.
The second wish for children is a new insurance case.
However, according to the General Terms and Conditions, "The insurance case begins with the treatment, it ends when treatment need ceases."
The questions to the experts in the round here:
* Who is right here to pay the PKV (only 3 attempts) or we (there are 5 attempts to pay)?
* Would the PKV have to point out to us in the pledges that with a birth the further attempts will occur?
* Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case?
The infertility (as a result of closed tubulars) is not healed by the first child.
It would be great if the experts here gave your opinion.
Thank you so much for your help!
Can you please send me the three variants by email and tell me how I can best reach them again
All right.
We won't order anything with them anymore.
When they add the sales of me and my friend #NAME# (equivalent address), they have obviously lost good customers.
They like to pass this on to their managers.
This is not competitive.
Yesterday, the colleague told me that the repayment was made and now you tell me that I have to send this thing back.
I can't do anything about the commode coming to my door completely disturbed.
Please see in the screenshot what the colleague wrote
It is clear and clear that the refund has been made and I still have not received a refund via #PRS_ORG#
They can tell their manager that they have now lost two regular customers.
My friend has also ordered various furniture for our apartment through his account.
We won't do that anymore.
No, the defect only occurred after a few months.
An office chair must be normal.
Otherwise they can't sell him as an office chair.
Regardless of that, the warranty of 24 months shall apply.
No, it's not possible for me to obtain another type of packaging.
I will be able to remove the cabinet and make it available to the transport company.
Good day, I have a question about your series of #PRS_ORG#
These products will be advertised with additional pickers, but we can't find them with you.
Can she help?
The theme of the week: The best low budget movies
What a low budget film is exactly, there is no general definition with exact budget limits.
The Wikipedia has the following to say:
>A **low-budget film** or **low-budget movie** is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
On the web you can find plenty of lists of low-budget movies, such as on Letterboxd.com.
Do you know interesting representatives of this category?
What's it to you?
And what don't you like at all?
I am a very good customer of you, have already 2 apartments fully furnished with your furniture.
Wanted to ask the best price for the grey leather sofa Odelle.
The delivery time has now been extended once again, is it now also reliable?
Thank you very much.
With friendly greetings
There is no phone number, a chat where you have to wait 30min, is not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes at the waiting position...I'll give up soon because it just doesn't work here.
Hello.
"Halber Victory" against Belarus associated with high costs for the EU
According to political expert Raphael Bossong, the EU can announce a "half victory" in conflict with the Belarusian regime.
However, the costs were very high and meant massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees at Belarus' border with Poland and Lithuania, said Bossong to the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
The EU did not resolve confrontation in the long term, explained by the researcher of the Berliner Stiftung Wissenschaft und Politik (SWP).
This state of gravity - Belarus does not add very little, but the EU feels like a winner - is probably going on for a while.
The treatment of people on the border was not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights, Bosong judged.
Apparently, there was a "increasing normalization of pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole is not determined to oppose it, this is at the expense of fundamental rights.
This development also weakens cohesion in the Union.
"It does not seem to be able to stand up if a Member State is trying to make its own thing," as is currently the case with Poland, which does not even allow the EU Border Protection Agency Frontex access to the border.
The EU also paid another prize for its policy at the border with Belarus, said Bossong: a basic agreement on asylum policy would be difficult because the line "border protection, border protection and border protection" had been strengthened.
New attempt to cross the border
According to Poland's border guards, migrants have now tried to get across Belarus to the Polish territory.
55 migrants had been arrested at night on Sunday and brought back to the border, said a spokesperson of the Authority on Sunday.
In the event of the incident, the Polish officials had been recruited by the migrants not far from the village of Czeremsza.
According to the information, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be supplied medically by a military doctor.
Overall, border guards registered 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
On Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had crossed the border barriers.
Over the past few months, thousands of people from countries like Iraq and Afghanistan have crossed or tried to cross the border between Belarus and the EU.
The EU calls on Alexander Lukashenko, as a member of Minsk, to have attracted her with the prospect of entry into the EU.
Poland and Lithuania, according to press reports, closed down border sections.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines that bring migrants and refugees to the country.
In addition, EU Commissioners traveled to people's countries of origin to prevent departures.
The most effective element of the EU response was the pressure on the airlines, said Bossong.
"There the EU has thrown its market power into the scale and demonstrated its determination to operate with hard bandages and extraterritorial sanctions."
Minsk also had to take into account internal costs.
Belarus's society is probably not determined that the security device regularly locks thousands of people across the country.
Mercedes protests after controversial Formula 1 final
In the opinion of Mercedes, Max Verstäppen is said to have committed two regulatory breaks during the race.
Abu Dhabi - After the controversial Formula 1 final of Abu Dhabi, Mercedes filed an opposition.
The silver arrows assume two regulatory breaks in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest refers to a alleged violation of Max Verstappen in the Red Bull in the last safety car phase when he is supposed to have been caught up in a regular manner.
A second opposition was filed against the rating at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes-View, the protocol was not followed in accordance with the rules.
On the last lap of Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes, Verstappen had yet to become his first Formula One title.
The maneuver took place shortly after the end of a safety car phase, in which the Dutch had overtaken his driving car.
I'll check it out.
I'll talk to the bank and get back in touch with you.
Thank you for the support
Free admission for members: Europa-Park organises SC-Freiburg-Fantag

Judith Hermann read from her novel "Daheim"
In the course of the reading series "LiteraTour Nord", author Judith Hermann read on Friday in the sold out Blue Note from her current novel "Daheim" and also acted as a moderator.
She is divorced, lives in a house on the coast and listens sensitively to the night noise at her door.
I gave up the contact form yesterday to return an article, but I did not receive any confirmation or similar.
My question would be whether my request has been received.
It doesn't have everyone the time for your claped chat and falsely delivered cheap goods from China.
Your fault, which you fix, and not all from our household.
Contact Mrs #NAME#.
I can't chat with them every day.
We had chatted yesterday and agreed that I or Mrs #NAME# will receive an email with a 60 Euro voucher, a new order of the #PRS_ORG# bedside table and a return label.
This e-mail has not yet arrived.
The package wants to bring to #PRS_ORG# today.

But just because he says he's not an anti-Semit means nothing.
That's like when a kid says he has nothing against foreigners.
They will not admit it to them both.
But Collelah constantly reproduces any anti-Semitic messages.
If you want to distance yourself, you should simply leave it complete.
Yeah, well, then you're just as little serious as Colleague.
Those who seriously question evolution in principle are simply completely loosened.
Because of me, a God has set the whole thing in motion.
But as soon as you are a creationist, you have to believe that the Earth is 10,000 years old and that science is just blurred.
And with that you are an enemy of science and no more serious to take as colleague
In order to maintain an optimal vision, the magnifier should be sewn to the eye as close as possible.
The specially aplanatic-achromatic lens system allows you to use the magnification and colour-free use of the magnifier up to the edge zone.
Lupens are often marked with magnification information.
However, these data only apply to precisely defined conditions which rarely meet the conditions of use.
To be able to make optimal use of your magnificence, please note the instructions in the table "Technical data" (see instructions for use in the packaging).
Light reflexes arise on the lens surfaces of all optical devices - that is, even in the case of loops.
These reflections are significantly reduced by an anti-reflex coating.
In compliance with the optimal conditions of use - a close-to-eye gap - reflections on the lens surfaces are less perceptible.
Further information can be found in the accompanying instructions for use (in German and English).

Tree sales in Schönwolde: In the municipality of Krembz, women are looking for Christmas trees from
Farmer Frank Diers has experienced many curious situations during the sale of the fir.
Once a man should have gone home without his partner, because both could not agree.
Every year he plants well 2000 pieces for this.
The 56-year-old has already experienced many curious situations.
That always makes the pre-Christmas time a bit funny, he says.
What about the voucher?
Otherwise I am away as a customer?!
After all, I received a broken delivery and now paid the full price for it.
Then I will evaluate it accordingly!
We do not need to discuss the better court, but there is some similarity between the two.
Both consist of meat that is grilled on a spinning spear.
So both have their names.
In German, an equivalent might be something like the "dreher", which doesn't sound so delicious by far.
Problems with fiber optics + Devolo DLan/Magic
We've had a new fiber optic connection in the house for a few weeks.
Unfortunately, I now have problems to build a stable Wi-Fi network.
Before I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and I used Devolo DLan, which until a few failures received 50 Mbit and sent out.
The new fiber optic connection sends 500 Mbits to FritzBox 7590 and DLan, which is connected to FritzBox, are also available.
However, on the other DLan module, which sends out the wifi, no longer the full 500, but the further I remove in the house with the module, the less comes (so use a socket that is located 1, 2, 3, etc. spaces from the other module).
This means that the internet with the new fiber optic connection is now even slower on the first floor than before (\~45 Mbit).
I also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which seems to be using a new technology.
Although this was slightly better than DLan, there were similar large losses.
Could anyone explain to me why, with fiber of glass, so much internet speed is "lost" over the power line?
And is LAN really that some solution?
It would be extremely complex to relocate LAN cable in the house.
I'm really despairing, which is why I created an account here.
That is why I would be all the more happy about an answer.
When it's time to change the current account
Whoever would have thought that the girokonts would be calm for the first time, sees himself deceived.
While many banks have used autumn to get all kinds of tricks from their customers to confirm the increases in fees in the past, the fees for negative interest rates also fall further.
For example, Deutsche Bank was considered relatively generous with a limit of 100,000 euros.
Now she has halved the allowance once and even quartered for the day's money.
In a first step, the limit was reduced only for customers of the Group-Sparte Postbank - to 50,000 euros for Giro and Investment accounts and 25 0.000 euros for daily cash accounts.
In the meantime, however, these lower allowances apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as confirmed by a speaker on request.
And not only for new contracts, but also for "new individual agreements with existing customers".
The Commerzbank had already gone down to a limit of 50,000 euros, which is still valid, as was the case with ING Germany.
The direct bank DKB, which is popular with cost-conscious customers, has lowered the fees in two stages, initially at 50,000 euros, and now at 25.000 euros.
After all, more than 100 banks now have an exemption of 25,000 euros or less according to the figures of the Verivox Internet Portal.
The Sparda-Bank Berlin also arrived at EUR 25,000: However, there is still a legal discussion with the consumer centres, which have even been entitled in the first instance before the Landgericht Berlin against this regulation.
It is already being discussed in the banks whether the institutions should possibly make provisions - in the event that the upper authorities also declare the negative interest rates inadmissible in principle and that many millions of bank customers have to be refunded.

Jennifer Aniston employs a whole beauty army
She's now officially at Hollywood's top.
But her life is like a mountain and valley ride.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was elected the most influential woman of the year by the U.S. magazine "The Hollywood Reporter".
For them, who made 2021 with the "Friends" reunition and the continuation of their series "The Morning Show" Furore, this success is primarily the result of much discipline and work.
An entire army of assistants, stylists and trainers takes care of their appearance.
After all, according to Aniston, they give themselves a chip a day (yes, read correctly: a ONE chip from the bag).
The fact that she flies the hearts of both female and male fans is a miracle.
Maybe because she's just wrong with luck - and still seeks great love.
And removed the baby wish from the list.
Previously, she was constantly asked when she became a mother.
That hurt her.
The people who asked that have no idea what's going on with me personally, medically, why I can't.
It was really harmful.
Keep hoping that success and fame will also make you happy.
Unworthy end of a career: Räikkönen must give up
Kimi Räikkönen's departure from Formula 1 was even quieter than thought.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn pulled off the gloves and wiped the sweat off the forehead.
That's it.
After a driving mistake and a slight touch on the belt, Räikkönen had to drop his Alfa Romeo at the Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi after not even half of the race distance.
It was his 349th and last Grand Prix, the "Iceman" finished his career in the motorsport-king class.
His wife Minttu and the two children had also traveled to the United Arab Emirates.
Räikkönen's greatest success was the 2007 World Championship win in Ferrari.
He made 21 Grand Prix victory, started 18 times from the pole and came to the podium 103 times. dpa
Friedrich gets 60th World Cup victory - Nolte wins in the two-stop sport
The brand of the Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björnale with 94 successes is the goal of the Bobpilot.
"I've figured this out once, I'd have to win nine and a half wins per season, then I could make it to Cortina 2026," said BSC Oberbärenburg's double-lympiasier, who recorded two successes in two days during the Winterberg race.
Only on Saturday did he refuse the attack of Johannes Lochner by five hundredths, in which he drove from rank three to one.
Then he changed something to the material setting and drove out a larger lead on Sunday at 0,30 seconds.
With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle), he worked in front of the British Brad Hall.
The Austrian Benjamin Maier became third.
"We went more risk today and were rewarded," said Friedrich, who also brought his 22nd victory in series.
The Berchtesgadener Johannes Lochner, who is driving for Stuttgart, came to the fifth place this time after the second place.
Christoph Hafer of the BC Bad Feilnbach landed in the eighth place in the first race according to rank four.
"If I knew what he was doing differently, I'd do it like that," said Lochner.
Nolte with Home Winning - Podium for Jamanka
Laura Nolte won the second season with the women on their way home.
After it was only enough for fourth place the day before in Monobob, she raced for the world cup win at the German trifle success with Anschieberin Deborah Levi on Sunday.
Twoerbob Olympic winner Mariama Jamanka from BRC Thuringia came in second place with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
In addition to her Olympic qualification, she booked the first pedestal square this winter.
The Wiesbaden Kim Kalicki landed in third place with Leonie Fiebig.
For me, it was supercool, first pedestal in the world cup, I'm superhappy that Mariama takes me.
I'm super happy with the development.
There's still a lot of potential at the start, but the start times were okay today," said Burghardt, stressing: "It's not only moaning, but there's also a lot to do."
Yamanka got upset about the not quite fault-free rides, but said, "It's going in the right direction".
I already had the blanket in my shopping cart and could buy it now!!!
What do you want me to do?
I just didn't get it and therefore I can't redeem it, which is why I finally asked for it.
Through Corona, I had quite different problems last year and never had time for them.
And now he said it was going out that really upsets me.
Look into the chat it was about the Asare seat.
I would like to return it and then order it again, as it is just reduced :)
Why is the shipping started on 16.3.
There was nothing of such a long delivery time on your website
No until I type on it comes an extra field with the message
It was taken off yesterday by your colleague.
Why is this a problem today?
I've also sent you pictures of the wrong delivered would be.
But we want the shelf module anyway, just a new undamaged
And don't cancel the whole order.
Only this day, just this week, only until XY...
Hello, lovely girls and girls and women,
I have some things I just want to write and maybe it's the one thing - or others too...
I'm 24, I have kPTBS, full-time student and dog mama - sometimes apart from that my dog doesn't scream or go to kindergarten he's actually 1 to 1 my child.
My friend (since 6J together) is sick, has caught a burn 2nd grade on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him because I also kept having emotional needs and because I want to see him and feel him, we have much cussed and it was beautiful.
I helped him shower (because hand is in the band wg burning).
He is cooled above and we currently see himself less (1-2x week) which makes me very much able to create with my needs for affection and love.
My dog child just hurt belly, I cooked for him and now he's in his cuddly corner and has relaxed a bit after I was there with the heat lamp and caressing for him.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she's just gone for a month.
Now the housework is still going to stop on us, which we naturally divide.
But even cooking is just a lot of work for me...
My PTBS disease is just quite well adjusted, I am half well treated and able to cope.
Not good, but I'm good and almost symptomatic.
My university just demands a lot (for me), tomorrow at 15h I have a written test for which I have done nothing yet and about the day after tomorrow anatomy hours for which I should prepare at least a little bit.
And next week I have an oral exam on Tuesday, and then what's going on is in my calendar and not in my head because there's no space.
So my week goes like this: Only until the day after tomorrow, then it's weekend.
But after that the whole thing goes on?
It's only until the birthday.
Only until the start of the holiday.
It's only through the weekend.
Just up to...
And so it continues forever.
I think I'm just so stressed that I need these spiritual clues because otherwise I'll pack that.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic", but otherwise I don't...
Is that what you're doing?
Honestly, I am infinitely grateful that I don't have to work.
I can't put that in words.
Don't know if I would have survived my kptbs.
I think that has a lot to do with women's mental load, and that's why I thought I'd probably find suffering enthusiasts here...
I certainly wish you a relaxing evening, the week is almost done!
I got my order today Unfortunately the whole other color plus surface is scratched and table leg has printed.
At the first delivery the color was exactly as on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!!
What can you offer me?
If we change the table now I get another color or how?
The cancellation email was sent on 26.12.#NUMBER#.
The other two times.
But she was not confirmed.
I found at school that many religious teachers do not believe in God and for them it is just another subject like math or geography.
For me, this was always something strange, perhaps because I was raised Christianly and I always believed in something like this.
How about that?
Perhaps you can also tell about work and study colleagues with different attitudes.
In principle, I understand the difference between private and professional and it is useful to separate.
There is also a curriculum, etc.
But just find it strange to have a physics teacher who doesn't believe in the theory of relativity.
What brings you to want to teach religion if you don't believe it?
True culture or something?
Hope your question is not too private.
Can't change it or not?Write English that I also understand well
It's been a very long time, I'd give it up.
It's okay, thank you.
I expect a feedback by the beginning of next week at the latest.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Video Search Help Please
Hello, dear people,
I'm looking for a movie from my childhood (from 24).
I think it's been a movie for young people.
In the film there are two time axes (or parallel worlds).
On the one hand, modernism (real world).
On the other hand, the past (or the kingdom of the dead) (not quite certain).
Since I can't describe it in any way in the real world there is a young woman.
And in the kingdom of the dead a young soldier (uniform similar to those of the soldiers from the curse of the Caribbean).
For some reason the paths cross and an action arises.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the kingdom of the dead who wants to bring the woman into this realm to live myself I mean.
The transition I think is also the tomb of the soldier.
In the end, I think both soldiers are fighting each other.
If that's what I say to you, I'm grateful for every answer.
Our kid slept only on the belly from week one.
Fast forward: still lives :D
Relax.
Such a child holds out much more than you think.
Make sure everything is right, no cuddly animals, more often go in and watch, but no minutes of surveillance.
That makes you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattress.
No pillows.
Ahso and ours had no sleeping bag, but always a blanket.
Watch your child when it sleeps.
Does it turn the head to the side?
Can it get up from the belly?
Or is it right in the mattress with the face?
That's where you can divert yourself into whether everything's okay.
We've all grown up, too, and when my husband came to the world, it was going to be a zb and would be to put the kids on the belly to sleep.
In addition, we are already "stemkunde" with you and have already bought many products
But why do you just offer me 20EUR?
Hello, I wrote with a colleague yesterday about you and so far I have not received a feedback.
It's about my wardrobe that arrived yesterday (order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer does not fit in the closet.
Please contact me as soon as possible.
The cabinet is so currently not to be used.
To say it quite clearly.
RBTV has promised a lot.
And yes, I know for myself, not everything can be kept.
And I also had a lot of fun with RBTV.
It is just so that the policy of this station is now under all the control.
Almost every format is sponsored (ok), but then at the same time go on a big bedding tour.
It was said that you are an "independent" Internet station.
quote Arno: You want to be "no running litphaic column".
What are you doing now?
A 0815 advertising station trying to bring his BilloMerch to the elite fan.
And then we have Marah's Do's & Don'ts.
These, of course, apply to everyone except Simon and Etienne.
Of course, they can continue to offend people.
A krogmann who lacks empathy completely and at the expense of the action with the exploded rented rooms tries to make ashes.
How do you feel about all this?
Great if you like it, I think it's terrible.
I'm asking for a noise call as my wooden table has been broken.

Whether as a comforter at abdominal pain or just for cuddle – My little heat friend can be used a great deal.
Cherishkern cushions are a traditional home agent for soothing heat applications, since cherry cores can absorb heat very well and re-inject it again.
The removable inner cushion can be heated easily in the microwave or in the oven.
The soft cover makes the application particularly pleasant, so that the little ones feel hidden, even if they are not doing so well.
The cherry core cushion with reference to heat is only suitable for the following areas of application:
Before heating the pillow, test for unusual smell, floor or fire stains and, if present, dispose immediately.
Please remove the inside cushion before heating from the cover!
Heat up in the microwave at a maximum of 300 watts for max. 2 minutes (notes of the microwave manufacturer!)
Directly after heating, distribute the heat by shaking evenly in the pillow!
Then reset the inner cushion to the cover.
In the first warmings, a slight moisture formation may occur on the surface, but it disappears on repeated applications.
Always stick to the specified heating instructions, as longer times or higher energy performance may cause damage (inflammation and combustion risk!).
Before heating the cushion in the microwave, check that heating of grain products is allowed in the manufacturer's instructions for use.
After the heated inner cushion has been placed back in the reference, please check the temperature of the pillow for suitability for babies (max. 43 °C) at your arm bend!
Do not use pillows in acute and chronic, inflammatory or feverish diseases, circulatory problems, fresh hematomas, bleeding and open wounds, as well as in people with reduced pain.
In the case of existing skin, heart, veins, diabetes or tumour disease and pregnancy, please contact a doctor before taking this medicine.
Should sewing have opened and loose cores emerge, discard the product and the loose cores immediately and inaccessible to children.
If the product is used in babies under 1 year of age, the temperature of the child should be checked regularly during use to exclude overheating!
All serious incidents arising in connection with the product shall be reported to the manufacturer and the competent authority of the country in which the user is established.
The cover is removable and can be washed in the machine at 30 °C.
Please note the care symbols on the product!

Is the battery broken?
Last night my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) was no longer loaded by my power supply.
I bought this about 5 months ago, so I should still work.
I thought power supply alone was enough to operate.
Misdisplayed, the battery is empty and the laptop no longer starts despite inserted power supply.
Then I've expanded the battery, but nothing is going on here either.
You guys have ideas?
A new battery is ordered, but why can't I use the laptop in the network operation?
Is there something else broken?
Thank you for your help!
I want the delivery of the #PRS_ORG# to the room.
How can I book it?
I am interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
But don't know how high the seat is...
Often on tour and yet a lot of equipment there?
With Everyday V2 backpack by Peak Design no problem!
20 litres capacity also swallow larger photo equipment without problems, which can be safely stored using the padded FlexFold parts.
And what else you need on everyday items, thanks to practical accesses in the individually configurable interior, remains well organized and separate from the photo equipment.
With the "Update" of the Everyday Line on version 2 (V2), the series presents itself in a new look.
The chic, minimalist design has it in itself literally - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some very innovative solutions that protect the interior of the backpack reliably and yet provide seconds of access to the photo equipment.
This works with two options: Once conventionally via the lid valve, which can be closed with the MagLitch locking system, an excellently thought-out solution for effective protection, which has already proved itself with the Messenger Bags.
There is a metal clasp with matching anchor beams on the front of the backpack in the clasp.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has invented a variety of "fillstands": there are 4 anchor beams, stable destroyed in which the lock hook can be cut.
If the backpack is fully loaded, just take the top bar, it is rather empty, a deeper one.
Clasp closure and hooks are also magnetic.
Thus, the backpack can also be reliably closed without touching the hook.
The second possibility also differs the Everyday Backpack fundamentally from other photo backpacks: In addition to the lid flap there is still a zip opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the greatest disadvantage of conventional backpacks with access from above - you no longer have to feel through the content!
At the same time, this clever detail greatly increases the everyday fitness of the backpack: If you take along not only your photo equipment, but also everyday items or luggage.
In Everyday Backpack you can individually configure the interior (more below) and thus easily store it apart from each other - and access it independently through the two lateral openings.
You can also pull the backpack from the right side in front of the body, for example, to access camera equipment in the right main compartment, while everyday things remain safely in the left backpack half and do not come in between.
Comfortable, uncomplicated wear straps help.
And since the outer shell of the backpack is also made entirely of 100% recycled, weatherproof nylon, the content remains dry even if it is to go to Scotland in autumn.

hello, my order number is #NUMBER#. When is the item delivered?
Order and payment was made on 12.1.21.
I was given a completely different lamp than I ordered
Please call me
If you extend the voucher to me, I will immediately give up a larger order, but after all I kept the damaged piece of furniture and did not return it.
And that the past year was different from what I thought I couldn't imagine and I just couldn't redeem it in time and clarify it.
But I have the damage as a customer and I do not accept that.
Rotinger brake discs are designed for the requirements of the dynamic driver, who appreciate reliability and safety during braking even under difficult conditions.
Rotinger brake discs are made of cast iron and then mechanically worked (bored and cut).
All tinted discs are produced in short series according to individual technical characteristics, which are specific for certain discs and patterns.
On the basis of the individual technical drawing, a special production program is created, which is aimed at making out the disc according to the characteristics of the original assembly.
The tuned discs made in this way ensure high comfort and brake efficiency.
In addition, opened openings increase the effectiveness of cooling the disc, with the cuts improving cleaning of the brake discs and the brake clots.
Aesthetic properties of our tuned discs underline the character of each car by its attractive and striking appearance.
Coloma is the city where an unexpected event shaped the history of the west coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man discovered brightly brittle in the water at the southern fork of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery secret, the news quickly spread and triggered the so-called "California Gold Rush" from '49.
Thousands came from near and far and made Coloma one of the fastest growing and thriving cities in the country.
Areas were put down, tents were pitched, and saloons and hotels were almost overnight.
Everyone wanted their share in the wealth of the country.
For many it was said: "Coloma or Bust" (Coloma or bankruptcy)!
In this game you are a pioneer who is looking for wealth in the West and wants to make a name.
You will search for gold, recruit workers, drive horses together, and build businesses.
You will also be given the opportunity to explore the surrounding rivers and adjacent areas.
You're not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You're gonna have to exceed your pioneer colleagues so you don't have to go out with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast strategy game with many ways to win.
You choose your actions at once, you need to budget with your resources and build a Tableau that works more and more for you (so-called "Engine Building").
The buildings on your Tableau allow you to become more efficient, maintain additional actions or apply rules for your benefit.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge tiles, you can develop your individual style of play using fine adjustments.
Coloma plays over a period of three years from 1848 (the year the gold was discovered in Coloma), over 1849 (the year of California Gold Rush) to 1850 (the year California acquired official statehood).
One year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, players will secretly and at the same time select a location on the game plan where they can perform actions.
Afterwards their selection is revealed and they place their pioneers in the appropriate locations.
If a location has the most pioneers, it gets a lock!
This disables half of the location - which reduces the possible actions there.
The players then perform alternate actions, such as the extraction of resources, the movement of cars, the setting up of tents, the search of rivers, the building of bridges, the opening of shops and the positioning of revolutions.
When all actions are completed, the pioneers return.
The prizer turns to a new location at the beginning of each round and thus changes the available actions.
This goes on until the pricer has moved five times, so every site has once covered and the year ends.
There is a shooting in which players must defend Coloma from an attack of angry bandits.
If the players have contributed enough turrets and the bandits are numerically superior, they receive rewards.
But if they fail, they receive lower rewards or end in the cemetery.
The game ends after the third shooting, then the final score takes place.
The player with the most winning points wins!

"Why children are not tyrants" Doku, ARD Media Center
CW mental violence, sexual abuse, abuse of power
The ARD documentation appears in my Twitter timeline today, and I looked at it right away.
>The child psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a popular guest in talk shows and holds lectures throughout Europe.
With his book "Why Our Children Become Tyrants" (2008), he triggered a heated debate on education.
Former patient:The right to education now raises serious accusations against him.
Please be careful, the movie is hard to bear.
And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently.
We parents and other responsible people must never, never, go to power over the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child room for its development and to make the framework for the child as big as it makes sense and possible in the situation.
Brrr, I'm still shaking.
Holetschek: Countries advise on the removal of the testing obligation for triple vaccines
At their next meeting, the Ministers of Health of the Countries will decide on a national removal of the testing obligation for three-fold vaccination.
"We countries need to be very clear about whether and when there are three immunities of vaccination," said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), Chairman of the Health Ministers Conference, the "Image on Sunday".
The removal of 2G plus for triple vaccination is "not only medically meaningful, but also provides an additional vaccination," said Holetschek.
Federal Minister for Health Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has agreed that "he will make a proposal to the Health Ministers Conference on this issue as early as next Tuesday".
So I want to send the lamp back

What you describe as *Awareness* is called sensory perceptions under general anesthesia.
These occur at a frequency of about 1 to 1000.
It is most common to listen to sounds/voices, more rarely to see pictures and most rarely to perceive pain.
For this topic relevant: Kaiser sections are operations that are accompanied by an increased rate of awareness, as one avoids a very deep anesthesia in order to protect the child until the aberration.
Previous episodes of awareness should be mentioned in the anesthesia interview.
Certain anaesthesia procedures such as total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) are associated with a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT: Love all, this comment from me does describe awareness correctly, however* u/Nitemarex **per definition none.
I have read her comment incorrectly.
But the chair is broken.
That's not where the 20€ will help us either.
These are legal warranty claims.
The absolute minimum would be to take the broken chair back.
This is in addition to the legal obligation also standard in the field of eCommerce.
Please check again if they at least take the broken chair back.
We'll sell the second chair privately.
We're losing some money, too.
I already sent you an email that you did not answer.
Again the question.
The order and invoice state that the goods will be delivered to a room of my choice.
The freight forwarder is company #NAME#.
I just called there.
They told me that they only deliver in front of the door - because of #PRS_ORG#.
Is that so?
If so, I need to cancel the order as I don't know a person who can carry the heavy furniture on the first floor.
Will I not call?
I had formulated a question
Theater historian Günther Rühle 97-year-old died
He has profiled himself as a theatre critic and as an intensant.
Later, he wrote a monumental theatre story.
On Friday Günther Rühle died at the age of 97 years.
The new book is still on the table, freshly printed: "An old man is getting older."
The harrowing diary of a slow departure from the world led by the theatre historian and journalist Günther Rühle until April 2021.
And in the middle of the reading, the news comes that the author died.
The last sentence in the book reads: "I've witnessed my thanks for life here."
There are different types of pallets.
One of the most common is Europe's pallets, standardized wooden pallets, which are used mainly in the European area as cargo carriers.
You are certified by the European Palette Association EPAL
In 2020, more than ten million pallets were produced in Austria, according to statistics from Austria.
The production value was about 79 million euros.
How many pallets are imported annually to Austria is not raised
New York Brings MLS Championships for the first time

Rouding Tips & Tricks
I had here a week ago to get many great tips for the perfect goulash.
That was for Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and buttery!
So thank you again :)
Now I've come to taste and want to cook to New Year's Eve Roulade for the first time.
I'll set up a beef fund for this tomorrow.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I have no oven, but only a large pot.
How's it going now?
What about the books or how do I get them back to my #PRS_ORG#?
My English isn't that good anymore, but I'm getting it.
IES is a refund of €#NUMBER#
I was already informed by mail on 18.01. that the refund was made.
But to this day, the money has not been received from me.
You'd like to check there.
Where there are still Christmas bread in the Lübeck room
For many people, Gans or Ente belongs to the Christmas days like the fir tree and the gifts.
You haven't gotten any poultry yet?
Now it's about time.
We'll tell you where you'll get a Christmas bread in the Lübeck room.
The "Drive" of a tube end-level contributes significantly to the warmth and fat content of the guitar amplifier sound.
These features are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor circuit.
With the VOLUME, GAIN and MASTER VOLUME controller, you can set the desired level on the one hand and on the other you can set the content of your sounds.
In addition, the amplifiers of the VT+ series offer a unique POWER LIFE controller, which allows you to reduce the sound level without changing anything to the "Gain" and the distortion.
Further on, the sound was that even a power reserve can be fleeted with the POWER Livel controller if it goes loud.
The entire potential of the VT+ series can be used in any situation thanks to POWER LIFE controller.
The headphones can also be used as line output.
The signal here is processed with a box simulation, so that you can get an impressive "acoustic" sound impression even when you use a headphone or direct recordings.
A CD or MP3 player can be connected to the AUX socket so you can jam your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - so you don't need a separate voice device.
If you donate an additional VFS5 fan, you can also easily call the sounds by foot, turn on/off the effect blocks, and "tap" the speed of the then compatible effects.
For live use, this is essential.
With its new power packages, VOX will take another step into the future!
But they saw that with others.
Is there any way to send the lamp back?
Because she's too low for a table?
So I'd love to send her back then.
Can you help me with that?
And the fashion?
In the next few weeks, will we get another update to the exact delivery date?
Hello, have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs
If it is not possible, I would also be satisfied with a discount or voucher.
I may find a customer for the furniture.
Just over 1,000 euros for goods that I don't need will be a little bit.
I have just received my delivery and would have liked to know if screws were intended as part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) to the intended hook.
This is not a satisfactory answer and the waiting time has not been worthwhile
Is there a premium customer status with you?
Iran sees progress in negotiations on nuclear agreements
The negotiations for the revitalization of the international nuclear agreement are marked by Iranian evidence.
"Both sides are about to agree on the topics on the agenda," said Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri on Sunday of the news agency Irna.
This was a "positive and important development", because at first there was no consensus on the issues to be discussed.
The agreement is intended to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna talks on the revitalization of the agreement continued after just one week's interruption.
Negotiators of Iran, Germany, Great Britain, China, France and Russia participate in the negotiations.
A US delegation is also in Vienna, but only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia overtakes Saxony - Free State now state with the highest corona incidence
Thuringia has replaced Saxony and currently has the highest incidence in Germany.
As the only federal country, the value is above the mark of 1000.
As the only federal state, Thuringia has been located at the Corona incidence on Sunday above the 1000 mark.
The Robert Koch Institute reported the seven-day value of 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which had always shown the highest incidence in Germany, this value was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thuringia had dropped slightly, but had also been above the value of 1000.
Within one day, 2242 new infections with the Sars CoV-2 virus and 16 other deaths related to infection were reported in Thuringia.
200 patients with Covid-19 were treated intensively in hospitals on Sundays.
Report delays can occur on weekends.
In addition, health offices have been overburdened for weeks and hardly ever after with the detection of new cases.
I understand.
Since the delivery is not made until the beginning of March, it may be possible until then.
I have to print it out and stick to the package and drop it at the post office, that's it?
here I don't have to click or fill out?
That's exactly why I'm writing to you.
I would like to accept the return at my own expense.
8 euro Return fee is a freaky thing in my eyes.
It is time for changes
###MBundestag I am greeted, I am u/StratorDE in the plenary room in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
#What's the post here?
If you look at the activity in the past few months of the MBundestag, you can find one thing: it is not extreme.
We came into a winter drive and extended the summer hole to a few months.
#Where is the problem?
Yeah, what was it?
For the most part, this should simply be linked to dissatisfaction, as some things have happened here and as we generally do.
In the last few days, the impression has increased that many here really still have Bock on the MBundestag.
#What we need to change
At this point, the community around the MBundestag is in demand, which wants to keep it alive.
The attack came from u/edizVEVO, who has become aware of this project in the last few days and has found one, quite simply, shards.
After some writing, several people from the community have found themselves wanting to rebuild the project.
However, I would also like to expressly call on all to participate, only in this way can this project be a reality in the future.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a discord server, on which we can exchange and work out concrete things.
You can join the server via this link.
Objectives:
* How will the MBund day work in the future?
* Which existing orders need to be modified / adjusted / removed?
* How are we supposed to be outside in the future?
* How will new members be recruited?
* How do we create a fair electoral system?
I'm pretty sure I've forgotten a lot, but that's not bad, and we end up with the discord.
If you have fun and time, come to Discord, work with us and let us democratically decide on the future.
I ordered a lamp shield from you to be delivered.
Now I see that the article is too big/klobig for it and is not suitable for my taste.
I have already ordered a different suspension for this.
I put it together and noticed this when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about that.
I hope that this will be returned and I have a full refund.
This is also quite sad, as the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have one more question: the daily blanket #PRS_ORG#, are there those also in excess size, so in 240/240 for example?
#PRS_ORG# must be able to guarantee me that the faulty cabinet will be picked up immediately.
And I'm asking you to make that happen now.
I don't have a suitable packaging, but will remove the cabinet as far as possible for collection - they have to clarify with #PRS_ORG# how this can work then.
#PRS_ORG# can contact me at any time to arrange a pick-up date.
Is there any instructions for assembly?
How long would I have time to get this or choose to return?
How do you answer the question why you are vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague I like.
She herself has lived vegetarian for a while, but at present she probably eats meat very rarely.
I myself was a vegetarian a few years earlier.
On the question of whether I have always wanted to be vegan, and vegetarianism has been a planned intermediate step, I have answered honestly without much thought.
And that for a long time I thought that as a vegetarian I would support the animal welfare, but at some point I reflected and understood that in the end I also supported animal torture.
Therefore, my decision to become vegan.
At that moment, I had the impression that on her side there was displeasure, then she defended vegetarianism and thought she knew where her flesh came from and was reduced as vegetarian animal suffering.
Now I wonder if my answer was 'plump'?
How do you answer the question?
Have the feeling that one is quickly put into a corner as a vegan and that conflicts arise without putting it on.
It greets a harmonious vegan (;
This is not an exception according to § 312d BGB.
Do not decompose your #PRS_ORG# from the legal requirements for remote sales.
I am at the assigned date when #PRS_ORG# picks up my return not on site.
Since I can't be on the spot because of a funeral, it can't be changed either.
Please can be assigned an alternative pick-up date.
From 01.02.#NUMBER# I can be found all the time.
Lahnsteiner Wehr prepared for water rescue: 45.000 euros grant from the country
Recently, the Rhineland-Palatinate Interior Minister Roger Lebentz issued a grant of 45.000 euros for the new aircraft car Water rescue of the volunteer fire brigade Lahnstein to Mayor Peter Labonte.
The total cost of the vehicle in operation since November 2020 amounted to 135,000 euros.
A good and important investment in security.
I am pleased that the country of Rheinland-Pfalz supports us in this regard," says Lahnstein's mayor Peter Labonte.
The car is used by Lahnstein, one of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Over and under water they perform tasks in the rescue of water, ice and technical assistance.
In Lahnstein one calculates permanently with increasing efforts: The boom of the hotel shipping on Rhein and Mosel as well as the further increasing use of the Lahn as a leisure flow contribute to this.
I bought a book that I could read only 10% and then started the problems.
I can't open the book.
However, its recommendations have been followed, synchronized, removed and the app has not been updated.
I'm a little frustrated because the whole action has cost me a lot of time and I'm hoping for help now.
Okay, it's like that.
I would like to order 3 items from the collection of #PRS_ORG# to June.
Can I enter an appointment in the ordering process?

Thank you for putting the whole thing here, I have also spent almost a decade in the state service in a similar activity, we were also arms bearers in the executive, I don't want to go on it!
I find the question of right and left always very simplified.
In principle, however, one should say that, of course, the minister of state comes from the liberal to conservative spectrum rather than from the revolutionary left, that should actually be clear to everyone.
Of course, in the special uniform and weaponry people should be magically attracted to the right of conservatives should also be clear to everyone that these people can then, of course, be difficult to deal with the living reality, because you have of course, besides the average white, now many Germans with migration backgrounds, women and also homosexuals (and therefore I do not mean the exuberant feminine clichés, because these are in the executive rather less to not at all but quite normal men and women you can't notice if they don't tell you) and I also have to rely on these people, because in doubt they save your life or put it on for you.
But even if it sounds strange for me to have a conservative attitude for the first time, I am proud of Germany and I feel that it is rather less likely that this policy will be used for it, or that it seems to them to be right, but they simply want to be treated in a normal manner.
Back to the right, because, of course, police and armed forces are also a cross-section of society, one will also find extreme rights there, but they can openly say their opinion there or even openly forging any State-hazardous plans is medially exaggerated and also annoyed me.
Of course, it happens that police and soldiers who have often been in foreign use often started to standardize because of negative experiences and even say things that are controversial to politically incorrect.
It also happens that there are certainly also right-wing conglomerates who are having a strong exchange of views.
Nevertheless, what I think is well combated and also countered by political education and education.
Germany is so internationally wrapped and that is also so good in my opinion that we could not afford to have right racists and Nazis in our ranks at all!
Yes, what I don't understand, I also ordered the other basket on the German side.
Why should this come from England?
When I ordered, it wasn't sold out.
I already ordered it in November.
but it was so confirmed to me in your confirmation of the order
It's still about my order, which is no longer available.
I chatted with #NAME# before.
Alternatively, you could still deliver the other #PRS_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# Euro in Black to Germany or this basket is also available somewhere in Germany.
I always find you as a partner company.
But at the top of the wood part are two deep candles filled with some yellow
and on the mirror itself is a small scratch
Ordinary through child?
Hello, me (w32) has been busy for a long time.
I am very disciplined and organized at work, (in my own, very little leisure time), but I have been getting it more bad than quite right to conduct my household permanently clean and neat.
There are always phases in which everything remains, and then and when does it pack me and I clean up and clean.
But it's never like "that someone could come to visit spontaneously".
My husband is not (unfortunately) better, although it bothers me somewhere but most of the time household simply loses against work and riot.
The kitchen is still cleaned regularly as we like to cook.
Now to my question, did you manage to get better with a child?
We don't have any work yet, and I've been dealing with this question for a long time.
Because for me I have no incentive, it just doesn't bother me so long as no visit comes and, for example, always fresh clothes are there and the kitchen is usable.
Do you have a bigger incentive with your child or do you stay sloppy?
Look forward to your answers.
Exclusive, new, high quality and anatomically pre-formed cut, offers maximum comfort, a perfect fit and thus allows for almost unlimited freedom of movement.
Preform with special, further embossing on the joints for improved freedom of movement (on arm and knee joints)

Career in social work - as someone with a self-insecure personality disorder?
I've been studying software development and I've been learning for about a year now.
Unfortunately, I am more and more aware that this profession is not the right thing for me, which is why I have been thinking for a long time, starting again and studying social work.
The problem: I have a self-insecure (or fearfully avoided) personality disorder (EVPS).
This means that I have no sense of self-esteem and I am therefore shy.
I don't have a problem talking to people on an objective level, but I find it very difficult to have looser conversations and I have been told more often that I am acting inaccurately (which I think I've already gotten better).
Can I become such a social worker?
I do not want to work as a street worker or in an open youth meeting, but rather in search advice or family assistance.
I do not know, however, whether the actual working day is really the way I imagine it to be, and it is difficult to find something on the Internet.
The EPPPS is already leading to problems in my job (for me, emotionally) because it pulls me down every time there's something to do with my code ("if I'm going to pick up the simplest things again") and it's hard for me to ask more experienced colleagues to help me ("I should really know myself how this is going"/"I think he's really having to think me less mediated with my stupid questions about the work"/"he really has to think of me" etc.).
The problems I will probably have in every profession but I wanted to mention it in the place.
But you've got the sofa back?
Because there was no confirmation for that either.
I'm waiting for an appointment for collection
What do they mean by giving back, please!
If I have downloaded a book to the #PRS_ORG#, the message your #PRS_ORG# does not approve this book
are there any problems?
I was in chat with #PRS_ORG#, who asked me if I had got a delivery confirmation for my cabinet.
The protein (protein) absorbed with the feed disintegrates the bird in its stomach-darm tract into the individual protein building materials (amino acids) and builds out of them its own protein substances, which it also needs for the formation of the feather.
The feather formation in the nesting and the feathering formation in the mushering bird are extremely complex processes and are associated with a particularly high stress for the overall organism of the animal.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio must not be administered during breeding, as there may otherwise be disturbances in the breeding cycle.
Following this curative use of NEKTON-Bio, it is appropriate to return to daily vitamin supply with NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral preparation).

1 g NEKTON-Bio on 250 ml of water or 100 g of soft food.
It is only recommended to prepare as much drinking water/week food as the bird consumes daily and to change water/food daily.
A removed measuring spoon (introduced) corresponds to 1 g NEKTON-Bio.
In the case of severe feather damage, the double or triple dose of NEKTON-Bio can be given at the beginning until the approach of feathering is visible.
After that, the normal dose is reached until the feather reform is fully completed.
Storage: NEKTON-Bio should be stored dry without sunlight, between 15° and 25°C.
Please excuse them, but the chair is sold as an office chair.
How can an office chair be broken after 9 months?
The warranty claims in Germany are 24 months.
That's really very bad service.
Hello, I sent an e-mail on Monday to inform you that my order has arrived damaged and pictures have been attached.
Did you receive this e-mail?
Statement of a municipal employee in opposition to the statutes
Hello r/LegaladviceGerman,
I've got the following problem.
A walnut tree is to be fallen on our property.
So filed to the community.
An employee writes to me that the fall of fruit trees and thus the walnut is not part of the statutes.
In the statutes, however, the walnut is explicitly indicated as a tree to be protected.
Can I now rely on the employee's statement or not?
On the one hand, I must be able to rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the statutes are clear.
Thank you for your answers.
That's what we understand.
Then we'll use them new packaging for that.
I have not received a message
Well, then I still have a sofo without use.
Could you offer me a deposit or a voucher?
What was more expensive than that?
Yes, I believe that only the question is whether I can pay in euro and have the blanket delivered to Germany
Can you check that out?
Signalling: serious traffic accident in Selb
Recently, a serious traffic accident occurred on St 2179 between Selb-Nord and Plößberg.
As the police press alarm currently reports (14:03 a.m.), a car has come to the counter-traffic traffic while overcoming.
There's some injured.
Ah, okay.
All right, then thank you so much that it was so easy!
Council and ideas for further careers
For the first time Christmas to you!
My Christmas is unfortunately mildly good, because my dear head is thinking everything you can think of.
Before I pick up here now .. in short: I need advice and best of people who somehow know my situation - so of you.
I'm just doing the ref as a cross-inferno.
Originally, I studied something else and worked there in an area (in order to remain at least a little anonymous, I don't call anything more accurate).
But the whole thing was too boring and I looked at alternatives that could make me more fun.
At some point I landed at the department and was sure it was - even though the framework conditions are much more unflexible than in my previous profession, but I didn't care.
I have now arrived at the third "I google other job invitations".
And it's only about half a year.
At the paints before that, I have always decided to continue and at least end the ref, after which I can still swing.
But just now I'm absolutely done.
I had so little free time the last month that I'm completely exhausted.
Now there are vacations, but there's still a lot of work waiting for me.
Before the ref, I always thought I was stress resistant, but there was my weekend and my holiday evening.
That's where I was free.
And the stress at work didn't matter at all.
Now the family party is too much stress to me.
And then there are these rigid structures that also trouble me.
In principle, it is fun and looked at from the outside, the ref also runs well in terms of feedback and so on.
But I'm completely out of touch and I wonder how much stress my body holds before it closes completely - if he doesn't do that right now.
I wonder if I would like to have the rest of the working life - especially if I read some contributions from you here - or if I should not go back to the old area again, because where I was appreciated I could take free time if I needed it, and if the work was somehow boring, but was paid appropriately and worked together in a team that had worked out and not as an individual fighter like that now is most of the time.
But then I wonder if in a year I didn't get back to the same place as now and I'm dissatisfied.
You notice it's all kind of weird, but maybe you've come out as an outside council or ideas, like I'm out of this situation, which I'm completely finished, and I'm about to cry at the slightest thought about it.
I'm not going to make decisions so emotionally right now, which probably does not lead to anything good.
But perhaps your views help me to see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel - or to enjoy Christmas, that's enough for me for the first time.
Thank you for reading and apologise for the whining undertone of me.
I hope my situation has become at least a little clear.
Since its introduction in 2001, the VOX Valvetronix series has been constantly developing, which has led to the combination of advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" circuit, which perfectly imitates the behaviour of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X Amps we present a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely up-to-date in terms of sound.
Thanks to VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of the components and amp circuits, the VTX amplifiers are waiting with an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
These amps also of course contain the multistage Valvetronix preamplifier.
This is partly based on real analog circuits, because they simply get the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier better than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated circuit, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed housing and a bass reflex system from which the natural resonances can only sprinkle.
With the "Tone Room" software from VOX, you can even correct and bend historical facts on the virtual level until the amp and the effects sound as you have always imagined.
The perfect combination of tube sound with Modeling technology is primarily due to the VOX Valve Reactor technology presented in 2001.
Of course, it has since been refined several times in order to meet new sound requirements, which has led to a further performance boost of the VOX Valvetronix series in 2010 - with more dynamic and more numerous and significantly improved amplifier models.
From the handy VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has also been designed in such a way that all guitarists are looking for a maximum sound variety here.
All guitarists are dreaming of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a bold sound, a nuanced play of game dynamics and string attack as well as a prompt speech.
During an in-depth analysis, the VOX engineers have discovered that the final stage determines the tube character of a amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology on the basis of this finding.
The Valve Reactor circuit of each VT+ amplifier fitted with a 12AX7 tube perfectly reflects the behaviour, subtle nuances and the sound character of a tube amplifier.
NBA: Despite 20 points by Wagner: Magic loses at Clippers
The defeat series of the Orlando Magic in the NBA stops.
The Wagner brothers can shine - but to win against the Los Angeles Clippers it is not enough.
Despite 20 points by Franz Wagner and seven counts of his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost at the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday 104:106.
The main compartment is also adaptable: with three individually playable and foldable velcro parts, it is designed to meet the needs of your photo equipment and is therefore suitable for any kind of cameras - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full-format mirror reflective cameras.
What ultimately fits in the backpack depends, of course, on the size of the camera and the lens.
A DSLR camera with an attached lens, two to three alternating lenses, and a flashing flash would be possible.
Greater DSLM cameras such as the different models of the Sony-a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 leave room for more lenses.
In addition, you can store a lot of accessories.
And those who have a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-Series) can use the backpack for their equipment and photo-like things.
Drone pilots also make an optimal choice with Everyday Backpack 20L, as the backpack offers enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Volcano eruption on La Palma: probably longest in history
In the nearly three months since the outbreak, lava flows on the Canary Island have caused great damage.
Is an end in sight?
With a duration of 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma has been the longest in the famous history of the Spanish Canary Islands since Sunday.
So far, the outbreak of the volcano Tehuya in 1585 was considered to be the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa.
There are no reliable data about earlier outbreaks.
Although the activity of the still nameless volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has declined slightly in recent days, volcanologists have not yet expected any forecast when it could end.
Indicators point to a slowing down.
The best news is that they are stable," said the president of the Island Council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, the state TV station RTVE.
million-height damage
In the nearly three months since the outbreak of the outbreak, the hot lava destroyed almost 2900 homes and other buildings, as RTVE reported.
Nearly 1200 hectares were covered by a meter thick lava layer.
This corresponds to almost 1700 football fields.
More than 7000 inhabitants had to be evacuated, the damage is estimated at more than 900 million euros.
In front of the coast there were two new landings with a size of about 50 acres.
In particular, the hugely important banana cultivation for the island, of which about half of the approximately 85,000 inhabitants live directly or indirectly and who were already in the crisis before the volcanic eruption.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, other areas were severely affected, wrote the newspaper "El País".
Christmas and gifts
Christmas stands in front of the door, and especially the children will hardly be able to expect the heavenly feast.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree have connected with the spiritual atmosphere and the kneeling tension a little seductive in themselves.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that keep our increasingly divided society together.
It is all the more important to become aware of the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the gesture of giving, which, according to French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Muss, has been a peace-building "Society Treaty of Natural Peoples", can escape the rigid routine and be filled with life in the context of this tradition.
How Nikolaus became the Christian child
It was strictly the Protestants who closely linked the Christmas days with the Beschenken.
Previously, gifts were presented on Nikolaustag in one way or another.
The background of this still popular custom is that Saint Nicholas, bishop of Myra, secretly threw three women into her window in one night to spare them another life in sin.
From this unconventional way of giving, the custom popular in Germany emerged to fill the boots with gifts, especially the children.
Protestants found themselves in this custom because they reject mediators between God and man as "Holy worship".
For these reasons, they are opposed to the institution.
Martin Luther made the Christkind out of Nikolaus and thus established a new line of tradition.
The focus of gifting shifted to the Christmas Eve.
Since most Protestants no longer see such detail issues so closely, it only upsets the least that the custom of Saint Nicholas is similar to that of Martin's use with Martinsingen and Martin's move is still an integral part of the pre-Christmas period.
Today you will find in boots in front of the door and under the Christmas tree from socks to coveted luxury watches all that the heart desires.
Variety of traditions in Christian countries
Sources prove a tradition of giving since the 13th century on the day of Saint Nicholas.
With the Reformation, the day of giving shifted to Christmas Eve.
In all the Christianly characterized countries, however, there is a joyful kuddle about the question of who is now bringing the gifts to the children.
In Germany, it depends on the region in question whether the Christian child appears on the Holy Evening or the Santa Claus, who is in principle a kind of Nikolaus, who has in time been assigned some peculiar species.
This includes, for example, his white noise, which has little in common with the rather strict Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sled, which is drawn by reindeer and the preference of the fireplace to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands Saint Nicholas remains the central figure at the Christmas Festival.
In Spain, the Three Kings give the gifts, while in Italy there is the witch Befana, who should have pointed them out the way to the Child Jesus.
In Scandinavia, fable beings sometimes bring gifts, while in Russia fathers brought frost to some glory.
Here it is not reindeer, but three horses that pull their sleds as Troika.
In the Czech Republic, the mother country of the Reformation during the Hussite Wars, the Christian child is responsible for handing over the gifts.

Police shoots suspected bank robbers near the Royal Palace
Close to the Kensington Palace in London, an armed man was shot by the police on Saturday.
The police told me that callers had reported a man who was supposed to have gone to a bank with a gun and a bookmaker's business.
The man fled, according to the authorities, in a vehicle that could be stopped by officials a little later.
There were shots and the man was hit.
He was still declared dead at the crime scene.
The police did not turn out to be from a terrorist background.
Several embassies are located in the Kensington Palace area.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine and the three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.

Pills Problem
Hello, dear woman's people.
I hope I do everything right here, after a year reddit actually is my first post.
To my problem: about five years ago, I was in need again to take the pill, mainly because I had so bad pain during the period and shit PMS before the period.
Now I would like to leave it again because I already have to take enough medications through chronic diseases that I cannot choose from.
My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
At my last about two years' break I had got from 0 to 100 explosive pimples and these everywhere.
As far as that surface is concerned, but I've been very burdened, and I'm not feeling comfortable.
In the two years' break, the whole thing never really normalized itself.
Maybe anyone has any tips to avoid this time.
Perfume-free and without gedons is my cosmetics already, but maybe there's what someone can recommend to me.
Unfortunately, female doctor didn't take me so seriously and skin doctor appointment is coming.
Thank you very much to everyone who read the novel!
Yes, the dear skin is such a thing.
Had pre-bupertary bad neurodermitis, then a time rest, then large-scale pedestal braid and the acne theme.
I also tried everything I could in the course of chr. disease, and I depended on sugar, milk and meat-poor mixed food, because nothing else worked really well.
It may also be good that Hormonell is simply the worm in there, but if you like me all over the building site you would also prefer not to go looking for anything else that goes wrong.
I already had everything from her colleague semina o. ä.
Written and now I have lost the conversation and do not know what was answered to my concern.
I always have to work in between and on the phone, and suddenly everything was gone...
What is there to check if the money was there, I'd have seen it
Check my bank details, maybe there was something wrong.
but there is it in general in large
since it is available in large black

110 kV earth cable is being rebuilt in 2022
Approval for the installation of the new high voltage cable at Tann is legal.
The planned decision by the government of Niederbayern opens the way for the construction to begin in 2022.
This was now reported by the network operator Bayernwerk.
The 7 km-long earth cable will connect Tann to the north of the municipality and the existing 110-kilovolt line between Simbach and parish churches.
The cable is connected near the village of Edermanning near Reut to a mast of the transmission line.
Good morning,
my order from 03.01.21 with the order number #NUMBER# has only arrived in parts with us so far.
The blue bet cell number:#PRS_ORG# with the mail number #NUMBER# was sent back by #PRS_ORG# with the note "Service not possible".
All three other packages have arrived so that delivery is definitely possible.
Can you tell me how the other process is now?
A nice start to the week!
You can forget, I explained this once again yesterday!!
This is a chest of glass and the whole sides are placed, so there is glass everywhere and the cardboard is broken
The commode stands in my apartment and #PRS_ORG# refuses to come to the apartment because of the #PRS_ORG# provisions
This means that the dress-up can't be picked up because nobody's allowed in my apartment
Thank you for the message
but why only EUR 20?
The originating value of this chair was #NUMBER# EUR
No, it's all books, so the request at #PRS_ORG# is probably a general problem.
Ref: Planning lessons (EC)
Hello, ladies and gentlemen,
I've been in the ref since summer, teaching is fun, but I've still had big problems in time planning my lessons in the field of geography.
Unfortunately, my school is technically not well equipped, so in principle I can only use the board, the school book and an OHP as a medium.
In addition, I can only copy b/w for free (which is annoying for geography).
I just need a very long time to plan my hours.
For example, we are currently making the subject of geofactors, and I actually have every hour in my mind.
In principle, the methods are always repeated, but on the other hand, I do not want to invest too much time for easy lessons (I also need UBs, etc.).
When planning, I always go out of my learning goal (what I want to achieve) and then think about how I can build it (usually I create a work sheet with texts from books that my school does not have).
We have the book Terra and with most tasks in the book I am rather dissatisfied.
Therefore also the worksheets.
Maybe I can get a geography teacher how to work with the book time-efficiently.
I'd be really happy.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from the order #NUMBER#.
In fact, I have already decided for a new one at #PRS_ORG#, but I would like to take the returns as soon as possible.
Trade fears about Christmas business because of the 2G rule.
In most shops, only those who have been vaccinated or healed can still be.
Trade considers this unnecessary and laments sales collapse.
He also has a possible solution.
The 2G regulations spoil the important Christmas business from the perspective of the German Trade Association (HDE).
In transactions with non-daily needs, sales losses are to be lamented, criticised by HDE Chief Managing Director Stefan Genth.
According to a recent survey of the HDE among 1100 dealers, more than 70 percent of companies looked negatively at the rest of the year.
Many would have written off the Christmas business.
"What should actually be the positive peak of the year is often a hole without ground," said Genth.
Therefore, dealers with 2G access restrictions lost almost one third of their pre-crisis revenues in the last week.
It only works well in the food retail as well as in the online field.
The Association called for consequences from the dramatic development.
Purchasing with mask, distance and hygiene concept was a safe matter, said the chief executive.
"2G shopping doesn't bring us on in the fight against the pandemic," he stressed.
The current regulations deterred customers and required high personnel deployment.
The band scheme had to be admitted across Germany, he demanded.
After that, each customer had to be controlled only once on 2G (vaccinated or healed) and would have access to all transactions with the given volume on that day.
In addition, sampling checks should be carried out in the retail sector, as in public transport at the 3G (vaccinated, healed or tested) rule.
The real estate company Deutsche Euroshop, specializing in shopping centers, also spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
The frequencies were last without 2G at about 75 percent of the pre-corona level, the sales were around 90 percent.
These figures will now fall safely in the middle of the so important Christmas business," said Chief Executive Board Wilhelm Wellner of the "Economic Week".
Due to the high human and administrative effort, the Center will try to find and obtain solutions.
This includes the so-called volume solution, in which "the visitors, for example, at a central location in the center once give their 2G proof and afterwards - equipped with a bracelet similar to in a club hotel - can enter all shops unspoiled".
I recently ordered and delivered the #PRS_ORG#.
The mirror has a scratch and on the frame is also an error which has been tried with a yellow filler to be cashed.
That looks unsavory.
I would like to give the mirror back and have already packed it back into the package and stuck it to it.
How do I proceed for the return now?
The lamp is designed for dual balance based on new flat SMD LEDs with high performance and high color rendering.
A modern microprocessor provides for the setting of the colour temperature and brightness of the lamp with exceptional possibilities.
In addition to the adjustment of brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to adjust and store the colour temperature manually in the range of 3100 - 5650K.
Use the current settings in the flash memory.
A special feature of the controller, it is simple and intuitive.
The lamp produces a very luminous flux with soft light of high quality, completely flicker-free.
The beam angle of 120 degrees, with which you can light large areas at relatively small distance is excellent.
By the way, also in reporter situations in small spaces or short intervals.
You can adjust the brightness practically without changing the color temperature.
It is a great tool to work both on the film set or in the studio.
The optional DMX512 controller allows remote control of the lamp in TV studios or when the lamp is mounted in hard-to-access locations.
At the back of the lamp is the control panel, consisting of buttons and a shining display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current colour temperature in Kelvin.
Furthermore, there is the slot for the NP-F batteries (not included)
User memory The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
To run the settings of the individual settings on the storage slots, simply press one of the memory keys and complete.
The memory controller stores the current state of the lamp on the switch off, so that the well-known situation is back on when the new switch on - Very practical for studio work if, for example, the camera is set to certain color temperatures.
Working with battery one of the greatest strengths of DL3120 functionality results from the possibility of operation with cheap NP-F batteries.
These are often already owned by photographers and cameramen (and women) - so you can rely on already existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check whether the batteries have sufficient power - it is a battery tester with the same capacity - for each of the two battery compartments a value in the two display displays (the upper left battery display, the right on the bottom display).
In addition, it is of course possible to continuously supply the headlight via the supplied power supply.
The structure of the headlight is very simple.
You have a 16mm sleeve as a connection to fasten, so you can get directly to your photo tripod.
The inclination is to be adjusted reliably on both sides by means of the fasteners.
It was observed that the mechanical components are extremely high quality and are therefore also designed for durability and hard use.
In addition, a swivel joint is included in delivery.
Great is also a bag included in the delivery.
So you can transport or store the lamp with all the accessories you might want to buy without any problems.
Shame, I've been given these and they're too small :(
"Party we wanted to throw": Frankfurt celebrates after rich comeback against Leverkusen
What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the last two Hessens in series were supposedly on their way to the next Bundesliga race.
But then the SGE turned on, and within a good hour, shot the frustration over a continuous start of the season from the soul and won furios with 5:2. "It's madness what the boys have done today," said coach Oliver Glasner at DAZN and spoke a "paussal lob, to everyone who was with them".
At the beginning, it looked like a new damper for the Frankfurters who were still standing behind their expectations at the age of nine.
Patrik Schick had led the Leverkusen with 2:0.
What happened then also impressed the SGE trainer.
"How players came back then and showed a fantastic performance," continued Glasner.
I am crazy happy with the performance we have shown and of course also with the result.
The morals of his teammates were also emphasized by the defender Christopher Lenz, who for the first time had been able to stand back in the place since the fourth day of the game and his overcome muscle injury.
"I think our mentality is incredibly great," said the 27-year-old, looking forward to the result, especially for the viewers.
That was the party we were trying to shoot today.
For the upcoming tasks, however, Glasner now wants to keep the focus on himself, but is also well positioned in terms of the personnel situation.
It is extraordinary that we all have players fit in December that all players are physically in a top constitution.
It's top work in our medical department, but also the players live highly professionally.
Now one wants to "go ahead step by step and remain modest" and "go ahead at this level" the tasks until the change of year.
Next on Wednesday, in the course of the English week, there will be an outside game at Borussia Mönchengladbach (18.30 o'clock, Sky) on the program.
Grade I get the mail that my package comes back to you due to a mistake in my part.
I tried to call #PRS_ORG# and let it redirect, not a chance.
Can it be shipped to me directly or do I have to wait for the money to be returned and the order will be re-issued?
Unfortunately, I am not going to order again because it has already lasted for a very long time.
Have you ever been sitting on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
Dampers for handball women before quarter finals against Spain
Germany's handball women slender after the humiliation against Denmark with hanging heads and empty eyes from the parquet.
At 16:32 (8:13) the DHB selection in front of 800 spectators in Granollers collected a red defeat and now had to run against host Spain in the quarter final.
"We were far too anxious and too much respect for the opponent," said Bundestrainer Henk Groener.
We must be different against Spain.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany closed the main round group III with 8:2 points as second behind the Danishs (10:0).
It's a shame we couldn't take the flow.
That was a bad game from everyone that we have to delete," said Captain Emily Bölk.
In the fight for entry into the semifinals, a significant increase will be required against the 2019 World Cup seconds on Tuesday to keep the delicate dream of the first medal alive since 2007.
The best German recruiter in duel with the three-time Olympic winner Denmark, Alina Grijseels, was a backroom player with six goals.
"We were just not there - neither in the attack, nor in the defense", Xenia Smits admitted and demanded: "We have to look forward now."
From front to back not on the height
In contrast to the previous five tournament games, the German team with the apparition was not up to date.
Deficiencies and technical errors in the attack and gaps in the defense were responsible for a fast 0:4 return after seven minutes.
Only Torfrau Dinah Eckerle was immediately at operating temperature and prevented worse with some parades.
The first goal succeeded the DHB team after 9:30 minutes, when Greyseels successfully completed a quick counterpoint.
However, this was not the expected initial inflammation.
Against the aggressive coverage of the Danes, the German women could hardly get into the scene - and if so, they mostly failed at the strong Althea Reinhardt in the gate of the Scandinavian women.
For example, the game had run early at 3:10 after 20 minutes, especially as re-roomer Mia Zschock saw red a little later because of a hard fouls on her opponent.
In the quarter finals, however, it is allowed to participate again.
Only in the final phase of the first half-time did the DHB selection come into play a little better and at least on five goals until the break.
In any case, the only slight hope for a pick-up after the change was after seven minutes at 9:19.
Once again, the Green-Schützers sinned in all areas and made it easy for the well imposed opponent, who is among the medal candidates during the final round.
As a result, the German team could no longer increase its performance and went off the parquet as a clear loser.
DACH Event Calendar Day 6: Family Traditions in Christmas
As part of the Reddit event calendar, we have given the Nikolaustag and take this opportunity to dedicate to us family traditions during the pre-Christmas season, the Advent, Nikolaus, Christmas Eve and Christmas holidays.
How was that at home at the time?
How about your partner?
Do you want to pass on your traditions to your children?
What's the best thing for the kids?

I'd like to bring in a bill code
as with #PRS_ORG# gift vouchers
Is that what they're doing?
The title is available, I work as a vaccine in mobile vaccination teams, where the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is vaccinated (up until now only) in nursing homes.
As these are soon to a large extent ready, some of them continue in vaccination centres for me.
I am happy to answer questions without a time limit on the organizational and human aspects and also medical questions, if they are not related to a person (e.g. "I take medication X, this is done with vaccination.").
In my area of responsibility, the Enlightenment for vaccination, the indication (person has the right to vaccination according to the corona vaccine system and no reasons which speak against it), the medical documentation and, if necessary, the emergency care for allergic reactions (myth never happened).
The vaccination itself is delegable to qualified staff, e.g. medical professionals.
However, we often do not have one in the vaccination teams, but "only" (for God's sake there is no lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical-technical assistants for the vaccine preparation, but they can't perform vaccinations (must?), so that I also carry out most vaccinations myself.
Heavy "Huidlerer" question: Amberger knows the solution
What's a "hudler"?
With this dialect word, sent by an amberger, the BR television broadcast "We in Bavaria" has been given a lot of thought.
However, unlike many previous days, the term in the series "Host me?" remained unearthed by the callers this time.
No, it wasn't a "human who's nervous."
And no one "all has to go fast."
That, people heard from the TV presenter, was totally wrong.
What the man from Amberg told us about the solution, and thus also caused amazement for many upper poles.
"The Huidler," the spectators learned, "is a rag with which someone wipes out the oven."
Dialector Antony Rowley, who has been an expert from Bavarian television for years, confirmed this.
With the note that this is a typical above-palzian term, somehow derived from the rather known mouth art word "houdern".
With which an educational gap was closed - probably also with a number of people who have lived in the Amberg area for a long time.
I haven't been able to buy books for two weeks.
The following error message will always be received after confirmation: opens - something wins wrong - try again later.
I have rebooted the #PRS_ORG# gel#PRS_ORG#n, connected to the PC, synchronized and repaired.
Nothing helped.
The choice of tyres at the racing wheel- is really so pan-proof?
This morning I woke up full of action because I still wanted to train at least a little to prepare my bike tour in the next week.
Said, done and I was driving my racing bike, which I bought on eBay yesterday.
The first 40km were also really nice - but then what happened in such a city centre (this time: Thank you Krefeld!).
Glass splitters on the track.
Zack, loud cish and my back tire didn't want to participate in the rest of the route in any case.
Because I had no real opportunity to get me a replacement jacket and a replacement hose because of the weekday, I had to turn around with half the bad mood and take the first train home.
Then it wasn't quite that bad, but maybe it's also better if I practice it again before cycling with the change of tire.
But now I'm in front of a question and hope you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long distance over several days in front of me, I would get this problem very unpleasant often.
Now it was really not bad, because the old tires from the pre-owner (very nice old man, the day I came to pick up the bike up until 1pm 120km!) and who had already called it suboptimal, because he has been rolling with them for several years.
But if I think I have to make a change of tire while driving after 80-90kms, then I think I'm really bad noise :D
Now I came into the conversation with an older man at the platform, who wondered why I wouldn't have the Marathon Plus tyres; they should be unflatable.
Now, of course, the whole thing sounds very seductive.
But are these really so incapable?
I have little desire to spend 40€ / mites now, only to be disappointed then.
I also ask myself: I am currently on the racing wheel I believe 25x622.
Although there is also (seemly?) at the Marathon Plus tyres, the majority is already wider.
Is this a problem?
Or would you advise me on a racing bike in general with other tyres?
The Schwalbe page seems to recommend the Durano DD to me!
Thank you in advance for your help and my greetings!
Car slides against tree: Driver fatally injured
The 53-year-old had been hit on the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten with his car of unexplained cause against a middle island and then hit the counterway, as the police informed.
There came a frontal collision with the vehicle of a 27-year-old.
The 53-year-old car was then thrown against a tree and the man stuck in the car.
The 27-year-old and his 23-year-old co-operator were severely injured in the accident and brought to surrounding hospitals.

After the release of our new high-end broadband B 100-6 OHM, it was only a matter of time until our SOLO series would get young again.
SOLO 15 is the name of the new Sprössling and is visually reminiscent of the large models with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, in this design proposal, an appropriate designed foot is included directly with to lift the speaker to the correct listening position.
This one has no influence on acoustics and can therefore be adjusted in length according to the circumstances at home.
As a principle, SOLO 15 is very well suited for people in which the maximum volume plays a more subordinate role, but is to be achieved at an exceptionally high level.
A 10 cm speaker is simply not able to produce almost unfiltered such a large sound pressure level.
This does not mean, however, that SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, it appears considerablely grown and extremely impressive and accurate for its size.
Tonal was matched with a slight high ton increase in SOLO 15.
This is generally common in wide bands to optimize the increasing bonding of too high frequencies.
The SOLO 15 convinces exactly on the listening area with very clear and fine sound.
Slightly turned outward, the high tone range can be reduced and thus the sound can be made warmer.
Thanks to the point sound source, the location of the individual components of a piece of music is sharp and amazingly precise in the optimal stereo triangle.
The reference suspects of extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM provide an enemy dynamics that seeks its same.
The SOLO 15 thus not only complements our SOLO series, but expands it in terms of resolution and accuracy.
As with all our kits, at the beginning it is recommended to think about the final look of the speaker in order to plan appropriate changes in the construction.
If, for example, you want to veneer the case, you need to adjust the speaker's reduction accordingly, as the veneer is again carrying material.
After all the plates have been cut (e.g. in the construction market), you should first drill an 8 mm hole into the floor plate at the appropriate point, in order to be able to carry out the cable easily there later.
With the help of an upper milling machine, the speaker opens in the front so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can be used later.
On the reverse side, this opening should be provided with a 45° phase to make the opening surface of the speaker’s chassis as large as possible.
The four coupling points of the B 100 - 6 OHM are interrupted in the phase, as shown in the picture 'Detail Phase'.
After that you start with the actual structure of the box and place one of the two side walls on a flat surface in front of you.
These are now exposed to the back wall, lid, front and floor.
The three stiffenings should also be applied and bonded.
The stiffenings themselves can vary if necessary in the material thickness, if one wants, for example, to use finished ledges from the construction market instead of producing them from 16 mm MDF itself.
In the next step, the second side is attached.
Then follow all plates of the foot, i.e. the two sides, as well as the front.
By means of a suitable hole circular saw or forester drill, the opening of the bass reflex tube, as well as the connecting clamp on the back wall will be facilitated.
Then a round milling machine is used to round off all edges of the actual box.
The top of the base plate can also be rounded off.
The base plate is then firmly bonded with the foot of the housing and in addition screwed with long wooden screws.
It follows the drawing and drilling (2.5 mm drill) of the coupling points of the speaker’s chassis and the connector terminal.
After cleaning the housing of wood dust (absour / blow out), you start laying the cable.
The 35 mm bass reflex opening in the back wall makes this the easiest possible.
In doing so, you push the entire and uncut cable piece by piece through the 8 mm hole into the foot until the terminal opening and let it stand out about 30 cm.
In the upper part of the housing you can bring the cable to the speaker opening and let it hang out loosely there as well.
The frequency softness is prepared and used below.
The construction plan of the frequency softness as well as the corresponding connection plan can be taken from the following document: Installation instructions Soft Solo 15.
If the frequency softness is installed and the connection terminal is closed, the 8 mm cable opening is closed inside the box, which is not yet completely closed.
Through the 35 mm BASSREFLEX opening and with some skill, you can drop hot adhesives on the opening and thus close.
By opening the B 100 - 6 OHM and with a small lamp you can check the sealing accordingly.
Now the dampening follows as described.
Then the B 100 - 6 OHM is connected and fixed with the corresponding screws.
Polarity plays an important role in this, so that the plus line (marked cable) must be at the plus pole of the speaker (larger contact).
Finally, the bass reflex tube is shortened and inserted to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the pipe).
For dampening, a mat of the damping material is cut into two parts and loosely distributed in the housing.
The opening around the bass reflex channel should be kept free.
Can I place an order now and have it delivered at the beginning of June?
> Hello to all,
> At last we can announce that we will host the OSCAST again this year!
> Unfortunately, for known reasons it is not possible to get more than four people into the studio, which has meant a higher planning effort and explains the short-term nature of the announcement.
ABER: There will be at least three people on the circuit so that we will track the Oscars 2021 with at least 7 beans in the stream and hopefully thousands of you!
> We do our best to avoid delay or other problems.
But hey, it's still pandemic – yet we will give everything to accompany the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
> It will start at 0:30.
Let's get drinks cold, plan good food and prepare for a long, but very interesting night.
