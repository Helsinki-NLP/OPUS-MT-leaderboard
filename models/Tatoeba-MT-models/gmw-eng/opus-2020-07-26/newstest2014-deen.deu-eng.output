Gutach: Even more safety for pedestrians
They are not 100 metres from each other: On Tuesday the new B 33-foot ramp in Gutach was put into operation at the village parking lot - in sight of the older town hall amp.
Two systems so close together: intention or syllable?
Gutach's mayor answered this question clearly yesterday.
"The Rathausampel was installed at the time because it secures the school path," Eckert explained yesterday.
The Kluser traffic lights ensure both cyclists as well as bus passengers and the Bergle residents.
The system, which was officially put into operation yesterday, is important for the Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße crossing area.
We have the museum, two churches, spa park, bus stop, a doctor and a bank as well as the traffic flow from the residential area ›Grub‹.
"At the high traffic and pedestrian traffic, another traffic traffic lights had to come to their safety," says Eckert.
This also confirms Peter Arnold of the Landratsamt Offenburg.
"Current measurements run through the B 33 on a daily basis about 12 000 vehicles the municipality of Gutach, of which about 10 percent are heavy-duty traffic," says Arnold.
Therefore, the construction of another traffic lights is more than necessary: "Security is simply going on here," says Arnold.
A total of four traffic shows had been carried out, a circular traffic was also considered, but because of the narrow in the crossing area Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße were discarded again.
According to Arnold, when choosing the traffic lights, everything was previously tested: "By means of an extra for us with particularly long wooden trunks loaded transporter, we have decided whether these vehicles can be driven out of the Sulzbach road to the B 33 without turning the traffic lights around".
The approximately 15 000 euros traffic lights system itself is the "modernest thing on the market" Arnold explained.
The system is equipped with coloured LEDs, which shine so brightly that the lights of the drivers can be easily recognized even in the deep sun.
And it is economical too: the older lighting systems consume about 100 watts, the new ones just eight watts.
There are three lighting systems per direction.
Arnold explained the technology of the new plant: it is equipped with two radar sensors.
Press the traffic button, the upper radar sensor tests the traffic position.
If the road is free, it immediately comes green for the pedestrian, if not, it takes about 15 seconds.
Another radar sensor checks whether the green phase for the pedestrian can be finished.
"If a group or disabled people are to cross the road, the green phase will be extended, so everyone will come safely across the road," Arnold explained.
Of course, the driver here had to think as a partner and observe the road.
This was not the case yesterday: Hardly the traffic lights showed green for pedestrians, a top-class vehicle floated through - with shining red.
Josef Winkler has been writing about the needs of his childhood and youth from the soul for more than 30 years.
The Carinthian poet has often described the disasters of his Catholic village childhood - the speechlessness, the hanging to raw violence and the harrowing sexuality, the narrowness and joylessness.
The Büchner award winner is well known as a prose author, theatre texts are rare in his work.
Collage from Prosatexten Gerhard Freschter presents for his performance "Whitelights on the tongue tip", which can now be seen in the Garage X at Petersplatz, therefore a collage of prosetexts.
The theatre maker combines elements of the autobiographical novel "Der Leibigen" (1987) with prosaminiaturen from "Leichnam, his family besieging" (2003).
On the largely blank stage - important requisit: a broken sofa on which an indication is copied and masturbated - the eight-piece ensemble hangs through the text material.
The text seems to have little trust in the director of the freighter.
The 70-minute performance submerges the template with a wealth of direct influences, known from the repertoire of postdramatic forms.
Above all, the actress comes to the sometimes questionable Scenic performances.
They are touched hard, dipped with their head under water, with their evening robes stacked to the wall.
Forced into cellophane or bodice, they stagger on dangerously high sticks through the staging, either monologizing them loudly or lying completely silently on the stage floor.
However, the text does not mediate in this strenuous way.
The best moments are the evening when singing - the range ranges from deep purple to folk songs.
Only towards the end does the overturned performance come a bit to rest, and Winkler's protracted absurd humor flashes.
A black box in the car?
U.S. road planners are looking for a money source to repair the decaying Highway system, and believe they have found the solution in a small black box that finds a place in the dashboard of each car.
The devices that record each kilometre and report the information to the authorities are at the heart of a controversial attempt by Washington and the planning offices of the states to revise the obsolete system of financing US roads.
The normally rather boring area of road planning has suddenly created an intensive debate with colorful alliances.
Liberties have allied themselves with environmental groups, and they argue that the government can use the small boxes to record the traveled kilometers – and possibly where they were driven – and then use the information for calculating tax decisions.
The Tea Party is horrified.
The American Civil Rights Association (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of data protection concerns.
But while there is no agreement in Congress, several states no longer wait.
They are currently checking how they can switch over the next ten years to a system where drivers pay per mile.
Thousands of drivers have already tested the drivers, some of whom are equipped with GPS surveillance.
This is really a must for our country.
"It's nothing we'll only be able to use," said Hasan Ikhrata, Managing Director of Southern California Assn. of Governments, who plans to record the driven miles for all Californian drivers in the state from 2025 onwards.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
The technology for this is here.
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund, which is financed from taxes, is paid by the US Americans to the fence column.
But in America no longer is danced as much as before.
Cars consume less petrol.
The state oil tax of 18.4 cents per gallon (less than 4 Eurocents per litre) has not increased for 20 years.
Policymakers do not dare to raise the tax by just one cent at high spray prices.
"The petrol tax is simply not sustainable," says Lee Munnich, an expert on traffic legislation at the University of Minnesota.
Its state has recently equipped 500 cars with tachographs to test a milestone-based payment system.
"This is the most meaningful alternative in the long term," he said.
Officecrats call it a mile-based user fee.
It is no surprise that the idea is in the hands of urban liberals, because the tax could be used, for example, to influence driving behaviour in such a way as to reduce congestion and climate-damaging exhaust gases.
The California planners rely on the system in the preparation of strategies to achieve the ambitious, legally anchored goals of the state on climate change.
But Republican Bill Shuster from Pennsylvania, chairman of the House Transportation Committee, has also explained that he sees the most common long-term alternative.
The free marketers of the Reason Foundation are also inspired by the idea of having drivers pay for their journey.
"This is not a tax that disappears in a black hole," explains Adrian Moore, Vice-President of Reason guidelines.
People pay directly for what they get.
The movement is also supported by two former American transport ministers who in a report in 2011 had invited the Congress to move towards mile-based billing.
Last year, the US Senate approved a 90 million dollars pilot project that would have included 10,000 cars.
However, the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the advance, responding to the concerns of Members from rural areas who represent people who often have to travel many miles on the way to work or to the city in everyday life.
Nevertheless, several states and major cities are moving in this direction on their own.
The most committed is Oregon, who is currently recruiting 5,000 drivers for the largest experiment in the country.
These drivers will soon pay the miles instead of the mineral oil tax to the state.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City is also considering such a thing.
Illinois tests it to a limited extent with trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes the transport ministries of 17 states on the east coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is currently examining how to introduce the change.
The concept is not a universal hit.
In Nevada, where 50 volunteers were recently equipped with the equipment, motorists were skeptical about the idea that the government could pursue any of its movements.
"Thinks against Big Brother and such things were a big problem," explains Alauddin Khan, Head of Strategy and Results Management at the Ministry of Transport of Nevada.
People didn't want it.
When the test came, Nevada’s ACLU warned on its website: "It would be relatively easy to turn the drive writers into adult surveillance devices."
There is no need to build a huge, bulky technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to capture data on the daily movements of individuals.
Nevada belongs to a number of states that are now looking for affordable technology, with which the state can capture the traveled kilometers, but not exactly when and where.
That would make the public feel calmer.
The hunt for this technology has led some authorities to a small startup company called True Mileage in California.
The company has originally not started to help states to control drivers.
Rather, it was their goal to take a foothold in an emerging market for vehicle insurances, where riders should pay on the basis of the driven miles.
But the devices they have tested are also interesting for the road planners, because they do not work with GPS and provide only limited information that is regularly uploaded via modem.
"People are more willing to participate if their speed and locations are not recorded," said Ryan Morrison, Managing Director of True Mileage.
Some of these public pilot programmes have made major mistakes.
There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to implement this.
In Oregon, the planners experiment with providing drivers with a number of options.
You can opt for a device with or without GPS.
Or they do not choose any equipment at all and instead pay a flat rate fee based on the average miles driven by all the inhabitants of the state.
Other institutions hope to sell the concept of a suspicious public by equipping the equipment with more functions than with fewer.
In New York City, traffic officials want to develop a taxing device that can also pay parking fees, pay an insurance for only a mile, and collect speed data from other vehicles in real time, thanks to which drivers can avoid traffic jams.
"The added value of the benefits offered by the system would be motivated by drivers to participate", says a city planning document.
However, some traffic planners wonder if the whole talk about paying per mile is not just a huge distraction maneuver.
In the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the San Francisco Bay area, officials stated that the Congress could solve the problem of the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund simply by increasing the fuel tax.
An additional one-off fee or an annual charge could be imposed on drivers with hybrid vehicles or other low-fuel vehicles, so that they also pay a fair share.
"There is no reason for an operation, if an aspirin is sufficient," explains Randy Rentschler, Commission head of legislation and public affairs.
When we do, hundreds of millions of drivers worry about their privacy and many other things.
Königsfeld: Small team beats watch
The volunteer fire brigade her main fall test in spite of staff shortages with Bravour.
Only eleven men took part in the exercise.
Department commander Hans Kammerer had chosen in his practice the property Feder on Burgberger Straße.
A short closure is said to have occurred there while sawing.
The resulting fire and smoking development injured two people, but one of them was able to send an emergency call.
After the first review of the situation by Hans Kammerer, two of the Wehr's respirators made themselves ready to enter the building.
After a short time, it was possible to find the first person and lead him into the open.
The second person had to be carried.
This was not so easy, as there was also a narrow stairway to overcome.
The building, a workshop with integrated stableing for two horses, was not easy to secure.
There was a lot of wood and strawballs in it.
In addition, there were still electrical machines for woodworking.
The first attack was made via the tank in the vehicle.
A further line was carried out via a flood hydrant at a distance of about 100 meters.
Now three deletion attacks could be designed.
A hollow beam tube was also used in the building.
Hans Kammerer also went into the exercise to show what can be achieved with little available staff.
In the event of a serious event, support will be provided through the day-to-day application group Königsfeld.
The commander was satisfied with the course of the exercise.
Networking universities and companies important
On his visit to the district of Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald, Landtags President Guido Wolf also informed himself in Titisee-Neustadt about where the labour force of tomorrow came from.
In the funding centre Hochschwarzwald, he and the executive director of the vocational schools as well as the Kreisgymnasium and the parent advisory board examined this important question.
"Education is an important location factor," underlined Claudia Stehle, director of the Hans-Thoma School, who presented the networked school project Bildungszentrum Hochschwarzwald.
Wolf was impressed by the pilot projects for training.
Since 2011 there has been a successful cooperation between the funding centre, the Kreisgymnasium and the vocational school centre.
He also praised family friendliness in the district.
"It is important not only to have an eye on the family phase, but also the phase to care for family members due to demographic change," said Wolf.
He also argued that more and more employees were caring for the care and care of their families.
"Without the support of employers, the resulting burden on employees can lead to an end to the employment relationship," said Wolf.
But no one could afford to lose qualified labour, he continued.
Another particularly important factor is the networking of universities and companies.
"For those who have already come to know the benefits of the region during their studies often receive the regional economy with their acquired knowledge and skills, which contributes to the strengthening of the region," the Landtags president was convinced.
It is only if sufficient training places were offered that skilled workers could also be covered.
In his opinion, the site advantage of the district is its beneficial location in the southwest of Germany, in close proximity to France and Switzerland.
In addition, on his journey from Titisee-Neustadt to Freiburg, he experienced the efforts already made to expand public transport.
"Stay persistent and make public transport better," he explained to the local politicians present.
Experienced with music for an entertaining afternoon
For 15 years, the Kaul family has invited the Dietinger Seniors to a coffee, cake and then a Vesper.
In the past, the older citizens were buried in the rest.
This afternoon, St. Josef is taking place in the nursing home.
The locals were looking forward to the delicious cakes and cakes.
Later there was sausage salad.
Silvia Kimmich-Bantle and her father Karl Kimmich talked with common melodies.
The 100-year-old natural stone wall as the front line of the old school yard to the Kirchstraße is to be put again on the renovation cost plan of the city of Bräunlingen.
In the days before the Kilbig a small corner wall was built during the first work of the renovation of the front school yard, to stabilize and static relief of the over a hundred years old stone wall with balustrade.
According to Alexander Misok of the Bräunlinger Stadtbauamt, the Landesdenkmalamt intends to involve in the planning and to create a renovation plan for the old wall.
A cost calculation will then be carried out by experts, who will then be put on the table by the municipal council to decide and define the further action.
A decision on this is expected to take place as early as the next year.
After the renovation, paving and tree planting of the old school courtyard within the two sides of the school built in 1912, a follow-up action must be taken in the foreseeable future, the restoration-needed limit wall must be renovated from the ground to the new substructure.
The historic, one hundred-year-old demarcation wall of the old school yard to Kirchstraße, is mainly due to water and frost damage, since no drainage is available, need to be renovated and has a archery forward.
Deep cracks in individual stones testify of weather damage, but the wall is not currently vulnerable.
A stable wall is a prerequisite for a schoolyard used by students, which is due to the current fastening work.
The school court renovation was originally planned even in the years 2008/2009, but high unplanned expenditures made a shift.
An important word in the historical school wall renovation, which has even been used for filming, will be the Landesdenkmalamt.
If regulations come from this side, the city of Bräunlingen hopes for grants from the monument protectors.
The students of the Bräunlinger primary school, who are now being taught again in a well renovated old school building with a new aula, can soon use the old school yard.
Özdemir wants to receive jazz training in Stuttgart
Cem Özdemir, Chairman of the Greens, has now been involved in the ongoing discussions about the future of the Musikhochschulen in Baden-Württemberg.
"I think it is wrong to give up the holistic education at the Stuttgart University of Music," said Özdemir the "Stuttgarter Nachrichten".
Jazz and classical music belong to the jazz site Stuttgart.
In this way, Özdemir, who in Stuttgart is a favorite for a direct mandate at the Bundestag election on 22 September, is the Green-Red State government.
On the basis of an expert study, this requires a reorganisation of the five music universities in Baden-Württemberg.
The Jazz and Pop programme will then be transferred from the Stuttgart Musikhochschule to the Mannheim Musikhochschule, among others.
US border: "Super tunnel" discovered for drug smuggling
At the border between Mexico and the USA, investigators have discovered and stopped a "super tunnel" to drug smuggling.
As the U.S. customs authorities reported, the more than 500-metre-long tube between Tijuana and San Diego was equipped with electricity, railways and a ventilation system.
Thus, three suspects were arrested, eight tons of marijuana and nearly 150 kilograms of cocaine were confiscated.
According to the information, the tunnel had not yet been used.
"These cartels are stupid when they think they could dig under the radar," said the U.S. District Attorney General, Southern California, Laura Duffy, at a press conference in front of a San Diego warehouse, where it had been discovered one end of the tunnel.
To the drug gangs, Duffy said: "If you continue to build such tunnels and try to use them, we are determined to make this a huge waste of your dirty money."
Both U.S. authorities and Mexican security forces are in a permanent fight against drug cartels.
Since 2006, more than 77,000 people have been killed in Mexico in connection with drug crime.
Designed by experts
Because of the extensive equipment of the tunnel, researchers assume that it was constructed by architects and engineers and that the construction took about a year.
The track system was equipped in such a way that electrically operated cars could be used there.
On the Mexican side is the access to a building that is 80 meters from the border.
According to authorities, a ladder leads 20 meters to the depth of the tunnel.
The tunnel has a cross-section of 1.20 meters and a width of 90 centimeters.
He would also have been able to promote illegal immigration to the USA.
Two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine foot.
The third, a Mexican, was captured because of the confiscated marijuana.
All three threaten to be the highest penalty for life-long withdrawal, as officials said.
Since 2006, eight such tunnels have been discovered, continued at the press conference in San Diego.
However, it is the first time that cocaine was found in such tunnel construction.
Cocaine is usually smuggled in smaller quantities and not by tunnel.
This shows the desperation of drug gangs, whose traditional routes have since been cut off, said Bill Sherman of the drug defense DEA in San Diego.
You would do anything to get to the United States.
No details were reported to the arrested, at least one was Mexican, it was said.
You have to expect prison sentences up to ten years.
2014 is Geisinger's celebration
The anniversary of the city of Geisingen on the occasion of the 1250th anniversary.
Returning to the first documentary mention is getting closer and closer.
When the year ends in almost eight weeks, the anniversary year is coming to an end.
Geisingen and Church Houses were mentioned together for the first time in 794.
In churches a certificate was produced, in which both places are mentioned.
On March 15th, there will be an official opening to the anniversary year, and since Geisingen has no hall at present, this opening event will take place in the place where both were first mentioned in church-houses 1250 years ago.
During the anniversary, a number of events are planned in Geisingen, as well as in Church-Hausen.
Church Houses will be held in July at a weekend from 18th to 20th July the 1250th.
Celebrate again.
On Friday with a celebration, on Saturday and Sunday with a festival around the Kirchtalhalle.
At the end of the holiday there is also the Church-Hauser church festival.
City Music Director Rudolf Barth wrote an order composition for the city on the occasion of the anniversary, which is listed on three dates.
On 21 June together with the Sunday celebration of the Schwarzwaldverein, on 12 July in the Arena with fireworks and on 13 December the first concert of the city music in the new hall.
This is completed and inaugurated in the anniversary year, the official date is the last September weekend, 27 and 28 September.
On the occasion of the Geisinger city anniversary a new chronicle will be released.
"But it is not only to become a chronicle by Geisingen himself, but a printed work on the Geisingen of today, which consists of Geisingen, Church-Houses, Leipperdingen, Aulfingen and Gutmadingen," said Mayor Walter Hengstler.
And also the Geisingen of today celebrates 2014 birthday, in 1974 the present territory was completed with the conglomerations.
The new chronicle will then be presented at the new festival hall in Geisingen on November 21 or 22.
But 2014 is also a year with many jubilees.
Strohglonki's scarf begins on February 8 with a custom evening on the occasion of her 60-year-old existence, the harmony Gutmadingen becomes 90 years and has on March 29th the Festbankett and then celebrates the district music festival from May 1 to 4.
The Altenwerk Leipferdingen becomes 40 years old, the Geisinger school has been at the new location for 50 years and celebrates this on May 10th, the Musikverein Polyhymnia Leipferdingen becomes 150 years old and celebrates this at the Brunnenfest from July 4th to 7th.
The city of Geisingen was first mentioned in a certificate of gift, which is owned by the monastery of St. Gallen, in 764.
The certificate was produced in churches (houses) which was then court.
Both municipalities are thus mentioned in the same document.
The reason for celebrating this 1250-year-old was the municipal reform 40 years ago.
Council takes track systems into view
Should the railway crossing "Am Hirschen" be extended in order to increase road safety?
Yes, the councils have decided.
Schiltach must take control of this amount of EUR 220 000.
The Deutsche Bahn will improve the Kinzigtal railway in the coming year.
In particular, safety of railway crossings is to be increased - there are collisions of trains with other vehicles across Germany on a regular basis.
If the municipalities agree to the conversion measures, they must participate in the costs by a third, the rest sharing the railways and the federal government.
Schiltach's city builder Roland Grießhaber explained the specificities of the Bah crossing "Am Hirsch".
There the city plans to build an outlay at the height of the tunnel mouth west of the railway track.
There, even larger vehicles, such as long wood transport, could be on the verge without having to block the tracks.
Grießhabers therefore proposed to construct a necessary supporting wall in such a way that the city could widen the road that followed in due course in order to ensure a smooth flow of traffic.
This was discussed controversially in the municipal council, as some councils doubted the need for a road spread: Thomas Kipp put the critics' mood to the point: "Do we have to take so much money into the hands of so few vehicles?"
Mayor Thomas Haas contradicted: The "Hirschen" railway crossing is regularly used for long wood transports.
Even wood from the "Kuhbach" area is partly transported through this route because the up to 20 meters long vehicles could not use the route at the Häberlesbrücke because they could not turn there into the main road.
In addition, Haas argued that the route should be rerouted to those vehicles that are not allowed to use the tunnel when the main road is locked.
Since it should be noted that the Kirchberg and Schlossberg tunnel would have to be rebuilt and renovated, as is currently the case in Wolfach, the railway crossing "Am "Hirschen" could also provide an important transport indication for a longer period of time.
The councils agreed to examine the cost of the planned spread of the road.
In spite of this, it was largely agreed to the conversion of the railway crossing with the condition that the necessary supporting wall was built in such a way that the city could build the road towards "Bahnhofstraße" where appropriate for meeting traffic to about 5,5 meters.
On the other hand, the conversion of the railway crossing at the Gerberei Trautwein could lead to a very different problem, which concerns the access to the heavily rising "Groltzhäuser Weg" (Groltzhäuser Weg).
The administration had the reconstruction plans of the railway examined by the engineering firm Breinlinger, since it had doubts as to whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhaus Weg would then be possible without further delay.
The investigation concluded that it should not be ruled out that road inclinations could lead to longer vehicles being installed.
The responsibility for this again bore the city as a roadlift carrier.
As a result, conversion could result in liability disputes.
Since both the logging of wood and the bending in the current state of expansion worked, Haas was not to be agreed with the conversion of the railway crossing.
At this point, too, the risk of a collision of the train with a vehicle on the transition is much lower than that of the other railway crossings, because it is directly adjacent to the centre stop to which a good visibility is located.
Even trains from the main station would have to be stopped at this point to the extent that no collision is threatening.
Most of the time, approval was refused for the conversion of this railway crossing because the city of Schiltach had to "bade off" the problem with sitting vehicles, according to the councils, as the railway could withdraw from responsibility after completion of the construction work.
As unproblematically, the panel considers the conversions to the railway crossings "Vor Heubach" and "Vor Kuhbach" for which crossing agreements have already been made with the railway.
Esa decides on large space missions: billions of missions
Remote planets, gravity waves or black holes - experts from the European Space Agency must now agree on two major projects they want to launch in the coming years.
30 proposals were selected, five are still in the race.
Far worlds.
More than 1000 planets at other stars have already found astronomers.
Whether there are lives on at least some of them, nobody knows.
The selection is difficult: Do you want to search for gravity waves?
Or would you rather explore the origin of the cosmos?
Or after earthlike planets, perhaps discover extraterrestrial life?
These questions are specifically addressed by those responsible for the Esa European Space Agency.
For their "Cosmic Vision" programme, they are looking for ideas for two major space projects that will make research decisive progress.
The budget for such "L-missions" is about EUR 1 billion each.
The start is expected to be 2028 and 2034.
In early September, the elite of European space research met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions.
30 ideas stood for the debate, five of them have now come into the closer choice.
Many bodies examine the proposals, look into the researchers.
In the next few days a final decision will be taken by the Scientific Programme Committee.
In total, four major questions were asked by the Esa to find answers to the missions of the "Cosmic Vision" program initiated in 2007.
What are the conditions for the formation of planets and life?
The exact processes during the formation of stars from large gas clouds - and thus also the formation of planets that surround these stars - are still in the proverbial darkness.
A large infrared telescope in space could penetrate this dark.
And if a star has planets, under what circumstances can life come about there?
In order to address this question, the space telescope "Cheops" will start in 2017, with which 500 already known planetary systems will be examined more closely in our vicinity.
But the possibilities are limited, Cheops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million euros.
With larger instruments, astronomers could picture earth-like planets and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres and thus search for "biomarkers": gases that are considered as an indication of biological activity.
How does the solar system work?
In the final analysis, this question should also include the conditions for the emergence of life.
An important role is played by the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field and the particle radiation from it with the planetary system.
In our solar system, these processes can be investigated in an exemplary way.
With the "Solar Orbiter", the Esa has already approved a M-Class mission (there the budget is about half a billion euros) for this question.
The sun is expected to start in 2017 and to observe the sun's surface and activity closely.
The researchers are also of great interest to Jupiter and his moons.
They want to find out what role the giant planet has played in the development of the solar system.
For this, the Esa represents the first of the three L missions of the "Cosmic Vision" programme.
The "Juice" probe (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) is expected to begin its journey in 2022.
Eight years later she reached Jupiter and was to examine the atmosphere of the planet as well as the icy moons of Europe, Kallisto and Ganymed.
What are the basic physical laws of the universe?
The space of the world offers many ways to study matter under extreme conditions and to examine whether the laws of nature we know are still valid there.
It may also be possible to find deviations that could lead physicists to a new theory under which all known laws of nature can be united.
How did the universe come about and what does it consist of?
13,7 billion years ago, our cosmos was created by the Big Bang.
In addition to the common matter of stars, planets and living beings as we exist, there is Dark Matter, whose gravity holds galaxies and galaxy clusters together, and Dark Energy, which accelerates the expansion of space.
So far, the researchers do not know which physical laws were valid in the first fractions of the Big Bang, or what is made of dark matter and dark energy.
With "Euclid", the Esa has already granted an M-mission, whose launch for 2020 is planned.
With a special telescope, the probe is intended to investigate the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time in the entire sky, thus enabling conclusions on the nature of dark matter and dark energy.
Who could make the race
Of the 30 proposals, only two will remain at the end of the competition process.
In the opinion of many experts, "E-Lisa", the best chances for an authorisation as an L-mission is a demanding concept for the detection of gravity waves.
This includes physical changes in the structure of space time, which Albert Einstein had predicted nearly 100 years ago.
They have not been proved to this day.
Elisha could do that, the scientists hope behind the project.
The mission foresees a two or three probe detector stationed in the All.
In contrast to earth’s installations, it could also prove gravity waves that have been created in the Big Bang, thus providing new insights into the emergence of the cosmos.
Four other proposals compete with the second L-mission: a large X-ray telescope called "Athena", which, among other things, is intended to explore black holes, "Icy Planets", another mission to the outer planets of the solar system, "Prism", a mission to measure cosmic background radiation, and the "Exoplanet Finder" to detect and investigate earth-like planets.
There have already been proposals for sample-return transport from Mars, for researching moon, Venus and asteroids as well as for solar physics.
Snowden ready to 'cooperate' with Germany in relation to US surveillance
Edward Snowden, the Whistleblower of the U.S. intelligence service, has explained that he is ready to travel to Berlin and to declare before the German Bundestag if the American National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander do not provide any answers about their activities.
German MP Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden on Thursday in Russia, where he received asylum to discuss with him the statement in Germany.
In a letter from Snowden, presented to the media on Friday by Ströbele in Berlin, he writes: "Even if the result of my efforts was proven to be positive, my government continues to treat a dissenting opinion as a break of loyalty and try to criminalise political opinion with criminal threat, in which no defense is possible."
But telling the truth is not a crime.
In the letter Snowden wrote that he was convinced that the support of the international community could convince the American government to drop the charge against him.
The charge brought by the U.S. Justice Department includes spying and theft of state property.
German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich said: "If Mr Snowden is ready to speak with German representatives, then we will find ways to do this."
The relations between the US and Germany are burdened by the claims that NSA has stopped the cell phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Thomas Oppermann, the Member of Parliament responsible for the intelligence committee, said that the opportunity should be taken to listen to Snowden as a witness if this was possible, "without endangering him and completely ruining relations with the United States".
Ströbele, a member of the Greens, published a picture of himself and Snowden in his Twitter feed.
He was accompanied by two German journalists during his visit to Russia.
Ströbele explained that according to the lawyer of the former NSA employee Snowden, he could not return to Russia if he left the country.
If Snowden says in Germany, then he needs a assurance that he is "safe" there, said the MP.
Snowden explains in his letter that he was exposed to a "serious and ongoing" persecution campaign that expelled him from his home country.
However, he was touched by the worldwide response to 'my act of political opinion'.
Citizens around the world, as well as high-level politicians – including in the United States – have described the revelations over an uncontrolled system of comprehensive surveillance as a merit to the general public.
In his letter, Snowden offers the German authorities an offer of cooperation, "if the difficulties surrounding the humanitarian situation have been solved".
Frontier Airlines raises charges for hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to demand up to 100 US dollars of passengers who want to store hand luggage on their flight.
Frontier Airlines intends to charge up to 100 US dollars for a piece of hand luggage and 2 dollars for coffee or limonade, even if the announcement on Wednesday read that passengers should keep the whole box.
The new fee applies to hand luggage in the luggage compartment above the seat, small bags under the seat are still free.
Frontier stated that it would be worth 25 US dollars if the fee was paid in advance, and 100 US dollars for travellers who only paid at the platform.
Frontier spokesman Kate O'Malley said that the fee of $100 is aimed at moving travelers to take care of the payment in advance.
"We do not want to calculate this sum," she said.
In 2008, airlines began to charge charges for the first and second checked baggage.
Passengers who tried to bypass them have therefore stopped as much as possible in the hand luggage as they could, resulting in the fact that the luggage compartments above the seat are often overcrowded.
Fees are a way to move passengers to take less on board.
O'Malley said at the new fee it's not really about making money.
It is about the most loyal customers of Frontier who have made it clear that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find space in the compartment above the seat.
Passengers who buy your tickets on the airline website do not have to pay.
This means that a passenger may be allowed to carry a luggage with him, but the next person will have to pay 100 dollars for a similar piece of luggage.
O'Malley stated that the Frontier website and check-in procedures would be changed so that passengers would be informed of the fee before coming to the flight platform.
Frontier's new hand luggage fee will only enter into force in summer, and a exact date will not yet be available.
Passengers often resort to luggage surcharges and other charges, but airlines are happy to resort to them.
They argue that the transport of luggage should pay money and passengers this service if they wished it.
Many at Wall Street consider the new baggage charges to be a sign that airlines are taking enough money to cover the costs of travel after years of losses.
Most, however, have left their fingers to pay for hand luggage.
Spirit Airlines Inc. demanded three years ago as first charges for hand luggage and later Allegiant Air, also a low-cost flyer.
The only other airline with such a fee was the Hungarian Wizz Air, explained the Airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who followed the additional fees closely.
He estimated in a December 2011 report that the hand luggage fee was Spirit’s $50 million annually.
Sorensen, who once held a leading position at Midwest Airlines, has recently flown with Spirit and was curious about what would expect him at the platform if passengers were confronted with the company's unusual hand luggage fee.
"The boarding process was one of the smoothest things I experienced in my career in aviation," he said.
I expected to see tooth-knocks and hand-held discussions on the platform.
"The plane was full," he said, "and the boarding ran like a lug."
Frontier also follows Spirit with the 2 dollars that are required for coffee, tea, limonade or juice.
The company explained that passengers who bought limonade or juice should keep the whole can and be refilled free of charge.
Water is still free.
In 2008, US Airways had tried to demand money for soft drinks, but seven months later it reversed after passengers had beged and no other large company had moved.
Frontier’s step in collecting fees for the hand luggage if passengers do not buy directly from the airline is the latest initiative to direct customers to their own website.
Airlines pay online travel agencies such as Orbitz 10 to 25 dollars per ticket sold.
This gives all companies an incentive to move passengers to buy them directly instead of via an online travel agency.
But Frontier has gone most widely in this area.
In September, the company began to award only half as many frequent flyer miles when booking via an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, the miles were reduced once again to 25 percent of the flight distance.
A third-party flight with Frontier over 1000 miles therefore brings customers only 250 miles.
Passengers can also reserve seats only when buying directly on the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base at its head office in Denver, but the business is shrinking and the company loses money.
The proceeds decreased by 9 percent, and the flight capacity decreased by almost 13 percent in the first quarter, as reported in the financial report published by the parent company Republic Airways Holdings Inc. on Wednesday.
Republic has tried to control the finances of Frontier in the course of the sale of the company.
Proverbs come from the Bible
40 women attended the last breakfast of this year in the Protestant church community of Bisingen.
The theme of the day in the town hall was "languages from the Bible" and "Developments from the Middle Ages".
Zita Köhler, the chairman of the Church Council, went to the Bible proverbs after breakfast in a talk.
"The words contain lifestyles, regulations or warnings," she explained.
They compared multiple proverbs to the corresponding Bible passages and explained the meaning.
She called proverbs like: Wooden eye be watchful, like sheds fall from the eyes, throwing an eye on someone, the Lord gives it to his in bed, his hands wash in innocence.
On several occasions, the speaker also advised her listeners what a proverb it was.
The Middle Ages sayings were accepted by the church councillor Christel Dehner: all good things are three, blue, something wasted.
She explained the meaning and origin of the phrases she called "bridges to the past".
Finally, a Tombola was delivered.
The prizes were covered on a table and were humorously defined before they were handed over to the winners.
Among the visitors to the breakfast round were mayors Roman Waizenegger.
Learning instead of unemployed: pilot project for unskilled people in tourism
A pilot project for the tourism industry is under way on the Mecklenburg Lakes Plate.
Under the leadership of the Federal Labour Agency, 49 women and men who are already working as unskilled in the industry will be qualified as specialists for hotels and restaurants over three winters.
"Newly that the six-month course ends with degrees," said Carmen Wiechert from the Neubrandenburg employment agency.
The benefits were varied: the participants would not be unemployed, the companies would be skilled professionals, who were increasingly lacking in hotels and restaurants, and the Agency did not need to finance unemployment.
The Chamber of Industry and Commerce in Neubrandenburg and the Deutsche Hotel- und Gaststättenverband (Dehoga) Mecklenburg-Vorpommern are also involved in the project.
NSA states that "internal error" and not hackers are guilty of crashing the website
The shadowy National Security Agency stated on late Friday that an error had paralyzed its public website for a few hours and not hackers, as was claimed online.
"NSA.gov was not reachable for a few hours tonight, as an internal error occurred during a planned update," explained the e-mail e-mail e-mail e-mail e-mail e-mail.
The problem will be fixed this evening.
The claim that the failure was caused by a distributed Denial of Service attack (DDoS) is not true.
In the early evening hours, online server trackers noticed that the NSA website was not accessible for at least six hours and that this is not available to some users.
Previously, a spokesperson from NSA told ABC News that the Authority's sensitive internal network was "in no way" compromised.
Secret information is not in danger, says the speaker.
At least a group of hackers claimed for themselves to have paralysed the NSA website with a DDoS attack.
In case of such attacks, the target website is flooded with site calls until the servers are overloaded and the website collapses.
Cybertactics are relatively simple and the attacks do not serve to enter the internal network of the target system.
The former super-secret NSA, whose nickname was once No Search Agency (No such authority), is now in the light of the public and looks forward to the revelations made in recent months about its extensive surveillance programme in Germany and abroad, a result of the secret NSA data stolen and published by the disillusioned former NSA staff member Edward Snowden.
The growing controversy around the intelligence service fired initial speculations about that the incident today is the result of a targeted cyberoperation.
The number of people without a job fell slightly in October by 22 to 1,307.
Although the ratio was 3.1 percent better than last year and also better than in September, "we would have hoped more," says Monika Felder-Bauer, Deputy Head of Business of the Agency for Labour in Sonthofen.
Many businesses have responded to attitudes so far.
According to Felder-Bauer, one reason for this is: "We have hardly any professionals in craftsmanship, health care and the care of the elderly".
As a result, job offers for staff in the hotel and restaurant industry have been in progress since September.
The winter season begins in mid-December.

Loss of profits in Bombardier after decrease in delivery quantities and orders
On Thursday, Canadian aircraft and railway manufacturer Bombardier Inc reported a 15 % decrease in net profit after being under pressure from decreasing orders and extraditions for aircraft in the third quarter as well as contract problems in the railway division.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, also did not publish any flight test data for the CSeries' brand new aircraft and did not provide any new information on whether the aircraft could go to commercial use in accordance with the ambitious timetable next September.
The test aircraft's young flight, one and a half months ago, has been followed by only three more launches, which makes it seem to be questionable whether the test phase is as planned.
The results remained behind the forecasts and led to a fall of over eight percent on the Toronto stock exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, Analyst at National Bank Financial, lowered his evaluation from "outperform" to "sector performance" on Thursday in view of the limited price potential of the stock in the next one to two quarters.
"While weaker delivery figures for aircraft were expected to be expected to date, we are very much disappointed by the margin development in the transport sector," said Doerksen in a customer letter.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries if the test program for the aircraft progresses.
However, if new orders are not announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more sceptical to the programme.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries aircraft series can catapult the company into the lower market segment currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was introduced to the public in March and flowed for the first time in September after months of delays.
However, binding orders for the CSeries with 177 moderates are so far, as potential buyers are waiting for the results of the flight tests and want to see whether the company's claims regarding fuel efficiency and cost-saving potential of the new jet traffic aircraft are applicable.
At present there are a total of 403 orders and commitments of 15 customers and companies.
Chairman Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier will achieve his goal of 300 binding orders at the beginning of the commercial use of the jet.
On Thursday, management also assured analysts and media that the program was in the schedule.
"The test aircraft was no longer on the ground than expected," said Beaudoin at a telephone conference, adding that during the aircraft's service life, ground testing and software updates had been started.
Each manufacturer is planning differently.
We have decided to take a first flight and then attach a revision period to what we have done.
This happens throughout the flight program.
The second of five test aircraft is expected to start in the next few weeks, the remaining shortly thereafter, it was called by the company side.
Nevertheless, analysts remain skeptical whether 12 months after the young flight of the first customer a plane of the CSeries can take into service.
Bombardier said it was checking the planning for commissioning (EIS) and will update it in the next few months.
"The slow advance of the flight test – even if they are clearly in line with bombing internal planning – strengthens our view that commissioning will shift to the first quarter of 2015," said Doerksen.
In the third quarter at the end of September 30, Bombardier's profit fell to 147 million dollars and 8 cents per share of 172 million dollars and 9 cents per share per year earlier.
The adjusted profit per share is unchanged of 9 cents.
Sales decreased slightly from 4.2 to 4.1 billion dollars.
Analysts had expected a profit of 10 cents per share and sales of 4.56 billion dollars, said Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world's fourth largest aircraft manufacturer indicates that he had delivered 45 aircraft in this quarter, a decrease of 57 last year.
Net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26.
Contracts in the aerospace division amounted to 32.9 billion dollars on September 30, and was therefore unchanged compared to December 31st.
"In the field of aerospace, the results were disappointing as part of our specifications, but the low order intake and market conditions as a whole were disappointing," said Beaudoin.
Sales in the aerospace sector fell 13 percent to two billion dollars.
Bombardier, the world's largest railway manufacturer, announced that sales in this sector rose by almost 11 percent to $2.1 billion.
Contracts in the transport division amounted to 32.6 billion dollars on September 30, and was thus slightly increased compared to December 31st.
The margin of profit in the transport sector has been affected by settlement problems in some major contracts.
According to management, there will be new requirements for the fourth quarter.
In the afternoon trade on Thursday, the Bombardier share dropped by 8.5 percent and was at 4.83 Canadian dollars, after having also been announced that the Google financial director Patrick Picette will change the board.
Brazilian Embrian SA, the third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer worldwide and Bombardier's closest rival, reported a ten percent decline in the quarter profit on Thursday.
USA: Shots at Los Angeles Airport
An unknown person fired shots on Friday morning (local time) at LAX airport.
While the airport management informed Twitter that the shooter was in custody, the "Los Angeles Times" reported that the man was dead.
A security man was also killed.
Media also reported several injuries.
US President Barack Obama is constantly being informed about the situation, said White House spokesman Jay Carney.
The incident occurred in Terminal 3. Eyewitnesses indicated that they had seen a shooter with a gun in one of the departure halls, as several media reported.
A traveler told CNN that many people had sought protection in panic.
Travellers would have cried and cried to children.
Among those waiting, panic broke out, and many would have hid themselves from fear behind chairs.
He heard two shots, says a traveler of the Los Angeles Times.
An employee of the TSA security authority suffered a gunshot injury on the foot.
The scene was "like in a movie".
After that, he himself had been brought to a security area, the man reported.
The shots should have fallen close to a security control area.
Airport building evacuated
On TV pictures it was possible to see how many sick and police cars were running in front of a terminal.
Hundreds of people were put in safety from the building.
Users on Twitter published photos of a special deployment command and a rifle lying on the ground.
The incident began at 9.30 a.m. as reported by the airport management via Twitter (local time).
The access roads were blocked, which, according to CNN, formed long backstowers.
As far as landings were concerned, air traffic had been temporarily discontinued.
However, on CNN several flyers were also observed during the start-up.
Terminal 3 is mainly operated by smaller US airlines.
Los Angeles LAX Airport is the largest airport in the United States.
Cocaine-independent lawyer, warning drug-boss about police investigation, must go to prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, gave information about Neil Scarborough
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction could come to light.
He was sentenced to three years in prison by Liverpool's Crown Court
A well - known defendant who warned a drug baron about a major police investigation because he was afraid that his secret drug addiction could be revealed was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, supplied underworld size Neil Scarborough with sensitive information about his drug trafficking activities after being compromised by his own cocaine search.
The lawyer who was praised by criminals as "class-class" with the nickname "Bash" was arrested in his house in 2011 after the police had supervised Scarborough, which he had represented in an earlier drug trial.
Officials observed how Scarborough (32) delivered three bags of cocaine at the house of the lawyer in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was with colleagues at a meal of the lawyer's chamber.
The investigations revealed that Ditta regularly consumed Class A drugs after finding traces of cocaine in his hair, wallet and credit card during tests.
Over a period of eight months between January and August 2011, he attempted to obtain unauthorised information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners.
At the time, all four suspects were supervised by the police as part of a major investigation of heroin and cocaine trade in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
Together with 32 other people, they were later arrested after the police secured heroin and cocaine worth 1.5 million pounds and 200,000 pounds of cash in a series of house searches.
Ditta, 42, passed on information to the criminals because he feared that his drug dependence could become public.
Today, Ditta, who works for the firm Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn, was found guilty and sentenced at Liverpool Crown Court in two charges for disability of justice after a three-week trial.
He admitted to cocaine possession at an earlier survey.
The lawyer was transferred after the police found out in their investigation against Scarborough that he had been in regular contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigating officers followed the suspect and saw him go to Ditta's house and put the drugs with a purity of 60 percent in a black golf glove under the lawyer's garbage tunnel.
Shortly after he had delivered the drugs, Scarborough regularly telephoned Ditta, who was at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium in Ewood Park.
The lawyer returned home, got the drugs, and then nine messages were exchanged between the two.
In court, it was announced that Ditta was a 'regular consumer' of cocaine after tests of Class A drugs had been discovered in its hair, wallet and credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested, but resigned from taking cocaine and said that he had spoken to the alleged dealer because he was his client, and claimed that her discussion was under the "Anoffelsgeheimnis".
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards, but they were secured and a hair sample was taken.
In the police investigation, he indicated that he was going to work at both his private address and his workplace as well as an office and clients would call him at home for legal matters.
It was announced before the Court that he had called for important actors in the drug trade, some of whom he had previously represented, after significant arrests and had informed them of what the investigators knew about them.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said: "A criminal lawyer should know better than everyone else that the law is not to be broken."
Ditta is accused of abuse of his position as a criminal defender, as he has become too involved with certain clients.
The relationship in question is not just that of a drug dealer, but a drug dealer who provides his lawyer with drugs.
Some of his communications were undoubtedly legitimate, for he was the lawyer of these people.
But this went far beyond the limits of a normal relationship between lawyer and client.
He dealt with police investigations as far as possible so that they could continue to carry out their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta thus sued his profession.
He was too close to certain clients, especially Scarborough, and he allowed his independence to be compromised.
Ditta was aware of any misconduct and said: "If I were a corrupt lawyer, what I am not, and wanted to pass on information to Scarborough, I would not wait 15 hours, but do it immediately."
But after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead of the Lancashire police said: "Mr. Ditta has taken the step from a criminal defender to a criminal at the moment he started to acquire drugs from organized criminals."
His cocaine dependence led to hopeless compromise and made him susceptible to the motives of leading members of organized crime, who instructed him to obtain valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and ensure confidence and confidence in the public.
Ditta lost this confidence and tried to get rid of the facade of his profession.
The Serial and Organized Crime Unit of Lancashire led investigations against Ditta, which also led to a conviction in three cases because of the possession of cocaine and the restriction of justice, which underscores our determination to bring criminals to justice.
This case should be a warning to criminals and shows that no one can escape the arm of the law.
We'll find you and bring you to court.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after he had declared guilty of conspiracy to heroin, cocaine and cannabis trade.
Thirty-five other drug-trading individuals were sentenced to a total sentence of 153 years for drug offences.
On his website Ditta published an area of questions and answers about himself in which he said that his dream job was to represent as lawyer clients in the death cell in America, his ultimate guest at dinner was Muhammad Ali and opportunity inequality was the motivation for his work.
Revolutionary work of church music
At the end of the celebrations on the occasion of his 160-year anniversary, the song crown Dunningen will frame two services with Franz Schubert's "German Fair".
After the great success of the musical "Rock my Life", which the spectators enjoyed in spring this year, the Liederkranz will enrich two services with the performance of the Deutsche Messe by Franz Schubert at the end of the anniversary year.
On Saturday, 26 October, this extraordinary fair will be heard at the church of St. Martinus Dunningen and at the church of St. John Baptist in Lackendorf starting at 10.15 a.m. on Sunday, 27 October.
The so-called German Fair with the original title "Songs for the Celebration of the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass", D 872, is a spiritual musical work by composer Franz Schubert from 1826 and was considered almost revolutionary at the time of its birth.
The Mass is listed within the framework of the divine services, as the client Johann Philipp Neumann had in mind.
Under the direction of Hermann Schneider, the choir is accompanied by the brass group of the music club Frähsinn Tennenbronn and Noemi Locodi at the organ.
Haslach: Skeptic softs confidence
For example, the elections to the 2015 parish council will change in the Haslach (SE) day care unit.
There is then only a joint parish council for all six parishes.
At a joint meeting on Saturday, the committees from Haslach, Hofstetten, Mühlenbach, Fischerbach, Steinach and Welschensteinach prepared for the changes.
For there is nothing to change in the fundamental decisions of the diocese and it is up to the parish councils to implement them as satisfactory as possible.
In the course of the day, it became particularly clear: the skepticism toward the new deviates, but by the same token of confidence.
From the ideas and expectations of the innovations in 2015 to concrete proposals about the future composition and the size of the parish council, the extremely constructive discussions of the six bodies with the main officials of the Seelsorgeteam ranged.
On the basis of a presentation, regional dean Georg Schmitt presented the newly adopted guidelines for soul care units in the Archdiocese of Freiburg.
In the future, the SE Haslach, as a church, will form a body of public law that enters into the rights and duties of the so far six individual churches.
There will only be a joint parish council and a foundation council in which the parish office is represented.
At least two elected members are to be represented from each parish, and so-called community teams will be formed in the six parishes.
In the future, your task will be to promote church life in the area.
The question of the finances of the individual parish then showed a considerable need for discussion.
The innovations provide for the preservation of accumulated assets in the parishes.
On the other hand, the liabilities are transferred to the community as a whole.
Especially in view of the large planned investments, the obligation of which then all the parishes meet, there were great concerns.
"Even in the past, only projects that could be mastered by the individual parishes have been invested," relativized Haslach's parish councillor Bruno Prinzbach.
Practical experience with a joint panel for five parishes described Barbar Ritter, the chairman of the panel in the Sage Care Unit Schutterwald-Neuried.
They had done their job in 2006 to "becoming one, five staying" and to find out that this is not so easy at all.
The bodies of the Haslacher Seel Care Unit then began to answer the questions about the future composition and size of the joint parish council and the practical work of the community teams.
Preparations will be made at further meetings and will be decided at a further joint meeting of all six bodies in the spring.
In the end, parish councillor Michael Schöner from Steinach presented the new logo of the Soul Care Unit, which was approved by a clear majority.
In Pfulllendorf the electricity becomes more expensive
The citizens of Pfulllendorf have to adapt to higher electricity costs.
As confirmed by the Managing Director of Stadtwerke, Jörg-Arne Bias, over the SÜDKURIER, a four-member family of Pfulllendorf will be charged 70 to 90 euros per year.
The main reason for the upcoming rise in prices is the increase in the so-called EEG envelope from 5,277 to 6.3 cents per kilowatt hour.
This levy is re-established by the four operators of the large electricity tracks each year in October.
These shall specify the additional costs which they incur from the energy transition, which they can raise through an envelope over the electricity price.
The townpieces of Pfulllendorf form the last link in this chain.
In its forecasts, the Supervisory Board of the energy company had even assumed a higher turnover, as Jörg-Arne Bias reports.
Now, the specific payments would have to be calculated before the city works could inform their customers about the exact price increase next week.
"We go out of an increase of 1 cents plus x", says Bias, where the number will be more close to the 2 cents.
Ampel on permanent red: be careful for waiting
Sometimes a traffic light just doesn't turn green.
The contact loop in the street does not react, or the light sign is broken.
Then what do you want to do - go to Red?
If a affected person has waited long enough on a red traffic light and the crossing is free, he can continue, explains Stuttgart lawyer Ralf Becker in the magazine "Motorrad".
However, the waiting period had to be "appropriate", which could be interpreted differently from case to case.
Becker advises to endure at least five minutes before the traffic lights have to be affected.
However, anyone who continues the journey despite red light must be aware that he is in full debt for a accident caused by it.
Those who wait less than five minutes may not wait long enough, warns Becker and points to a decision of the Supreme Court of Hamm.
In the negotiated case, a driver had ignored the traffic lights after about three minutes and had to be responsible for a negligent red light breach.
The traffic lights were not faulty, but they moved to green a little later.
A ban on driving remained in his hands because of the special situation - but the fine did not.
Municipal council is pleased about the sound budget
Whenever it comes to the household in municipal councils, mayor Ralph Gerster has a good laugh.
The municipality bag in Herdwangen-Schönach has been well filled and debt has not been known to the administration since 2005.
In this sense, the 2012 financial year can also be booked as a full success.
This became clear in the presentation of the annual accounts for 2012.
As Andrea Rothmund explained, the administrative budget of around 7.6 million euros was more than planned than expected.
The surplus of the administrative budget was also about 1.8 million euros above the approach.
The main reason for this is the surplus of trade tax revenue and the municipal share of income tax.
The wealth budget was again clearly above the planned values.
Instead of the expected EUR 1.5 million, it was EUR 2.5 million last year.
"This is essentially due to the higher supply from the administrative budget," says Rothmund.
As less investment has been made than planned in the 2012 financial year, the addition of deposits has also been higher.
Overall, the general reserve could be increased by around 2.1 million euros to a total of 4.9 million euros.
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for their good work.
"One doesn't simply shake such a work out of the sleeves," said Gerster, looking at the annual accounts.
He and the councils were obviously pleased with the good figures.
It may sound paradoxical, but precisely these good figures could soon be expensive to citizens.
Due to the good financial situation, the community has in the past been able to give up high rates.
However, according to Gerster, this has already been reduced many times by the country.
There are conditions for these subsidies from various compensation sticks.
Among other things, the cities and municipalities applying for grants must have certain lifting rates.
"We need to look at the issue of lifting sets, as investments for which we would like to have grants will arise in the coming years," said Gerster.
Nagold: Hugo Wermter for 60 years in the choir
At 60 years as a singer Hubert Wermter's story is almost twice as long as that of the herb festival, in which he was solemnly honored.
Hubert Wermter stood on stage as usual in the colours of his men's singing club.
Even after 60 years, singing with the now probably more than dearly won choir still makes him great fun.
Wermter was also active in the association, including 28 years as a member of the committee.
For his commitment and fidelity he received several awards: Jörg Kohr, Pastoral Representative on behalf of the Cäcilienverband Rottenburg-Stuttgart, presented to him - since the choir is also a church choir - a certificate of the association and a letter of honour signed by Bishop Gebhard Prince.
His singers handed him the certificate of the German choir association as well as a engraved tint plate.
In addition to honouring the 31st Autumn Festival, the MGV Betra, the song crown Salzstetten, the singer's department Baisingen and the local music club had invited the full-maringer to a colorful mix of different choirs and singing styles, which the around 400 visitors had.
The MGV Vollmaringen opened with atmospheric songs like "In the wine paradise" and "Lustig, her brothers".
Her honorary singer Hubert Wermter prepared a small stand to honor them - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's "bonds anthem".
The men's singing club, Bethra, also sang classical choir songs such as "Jägaufen" by Julius Wengert, "Weit, weg weg" by Hubert Goisern and the folk song "When you go through the valley".
With his mixed choir and his group of women - the "imbulschor" - the song wreath salt stetten provided for the women's quota of the festival.
The mixed choir was abducted with the Neapolitan folklore "Santa Lucia" and "Eviva Espana" by Antos Gus in foreign countries, while the "Impulschor" also resorted to foreign languages: "Liberatio" and "Hey Jude" belonged to their program.
The singer's department of the Baisinger Sportverein came back with "Whatish of the Swab?" by Hans Süssmuth and Robert Pappert's "Bierlied" back in his native background, where the Vollmaringer Musikverein offered the crowning musical degree.
For the children there was a small side program - "Oma Hanne" alias Hannelore Stollsteimer performed a Kasperltheater and read a few stories that the children did well at lunchtime.
Children's Dreams Become True
The kindergartens and kindergartens in the Zollernalbkreis will receive mail these days.
In cooperation with Bauhaus and the Sparkasse Zollernalb, the Schwarzwälder Bote wants to support the facilities in the realization of their building and decoration wishes.
Does the kindergarten need a new sandbox?
In the action, all kindergartens, day-care facilities and children's cribs from the entire Zollernalbkreis can participate.
If you have a building or beautification wish for your facility, you can apply with this at the Black Forest messenger.
Be creative with your children and surprise the jury of action kindergarten building.
A jury consisting of representatives of Schwarzwälder Bote, Bauhaus and Sparkasse Zollernalb selects three wishes from all entries.
What are the conditions for participation?
The wish should be realized with construction material worth a maximum of EUR 2000 and on a (action) day.
In addition, the winner has to provide for many diligent builders himself.
What about the action day and the helpers on their own?
Bauhaus provides the material with the support of the Sparkasse Zollernalb.
It will be delivered to the kindergarten on the agreed day and will then be processed directly by the helpers.
Helpers can be parents, grandparents, friends, clubs and, of course, the educators and children themselves.
Kenyan Press Empathetics About Controversy Media Law
"We are in an agonizing situation and we may ask ourselves: what does Parliament refuse to simply abolish judicial independence tomorrow?" was read in the paper which the draft law considers unconstitutional.
"The law is draconic and very punishing and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, Managing Director of the Capital Group, one of Kenya's most prestigious independent radio stations and news sites.
He said that the new Media Tribunal "will always be prejudiced, because it is an extended arm of the government," and restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya's position in the global economy.
"I hope the President listens to us and we call on him to reject this bill and send it back to Parliament," he said.
According to The Star newspaper, the government is taking 'the media effectively into a strangle' through the new law, whereas The Standard, Democracy and Freedom of Speech in Kenya have suffered 'a severe blow' and called the draft 'draconian'.
The adoption of the law is part of a series of measures aimed at strengthening national security in the wake of attacks by armed Islamists on the Westgate shopping centre in September.
The Kenyan media attracted the anger of the authorities because they published shots of security cameras on which the units sent to the crime scene were said to rob the luxurious shopping center.
Chief of Police David Kimaiyo responded by ordering two journalists and a leading media representative, even if the pre-charge was withdrawn after a media call.
Under the new law, media houses can be charged with a penalty of up to 20 million Kenyan schillings and individual journalists with up to one million and the further risk of losing their professional recognition or being excluded from official press accreditation.
The Tribunal also has the right to confiscate the property of the persons concerned if a penalty is not paid.
According to Daily Nation, 'a single penalty can push most radio stations into bankruptcy'.
In addition, the newspaper considers that these measures could have a devastating effect on the description of Kenya's 'living blogosphere'.
If they broke the media to silence, politicians could do whatever they want.
"No one will ever know," wrote Mutuma Mathiu, journalist of the nation, who calls Kenyan media a decisive control factor in public life.
"You leave politicians themselves, they lead the country into bankruptcy, and we return to the time of the hunters and collectors," he commented.
The Kenyan legislators had already caused public trouble in the past.
In May, they agreed to reverse the cuts ordered by the National Remuneration Commission and returned tax-free to the world's highest rates of approximately 532,000 schillings per month.
Bad-Dürrheim: A dream becomes true for the FC
The official opening ceremony for the artificial grass sports ground was not fined by the importance for the city and the football club despite the cold weather and the rain.
A more pleasant celebration must have been desired last Saturday, but Peter did not want to participate.
So all those who came without umbrella or couldn't keep such a one for some reason.
This was done by the musicians who framed the festival, as well as by some speakers.
That is why Nass was also chairman of the FC Albrecht Schlenker, who spoke of the fulfillment of a dream.
His thanks were to all, above all, Mayor Walter Klumpp, who made a strong commitment to the implementation of the project, to the municipal council, to the participating companies and association members who came in.
Here particularly Lothar Held, Paul Weizenegger, Heiner Gail and Peter Graf.
The skilled pensioners laid 400 square meters of paving stones for the new paths.
This remarkable honorary commitment was also appreciated by the Landtagsdeputer Karl Rombach.
Other greetings spoke for the urban sports committee Hubert Baier, the district chairman of the South-Bad Football Association, Kuno Kayan, and Friedrich Knorr from the planning office, who announced a donation for the club's youth department.
Mayor Klumpp recalled that in the spring and autumn, recurring weather-related influences were increasing to the original lawn in such a way that it could not be played.
15 years ago, there were the first considerations to solve the problem when the construction of a third place at the football club site or at the real school at the Salinensee was considered.
Both were rejected again.
Six years ago, thoughts came up to create an artificial grass sports ground, which was generally considered the ultimate solution.
Specific plans were taken up two years ago when the FC took over the Skullstube in Erblacht, a cost contribution of EUR 100 000 for the construction of the square, and the country approved funding of EUR 104 000.
The municipal council decided in October 2012 to take over the remaining 356 000 euros to the total cost of 560 000 euros, Klumpp summarized.
The construction of the 68 x 108 meters-large artificial grass court took place on 4 June.
During the three-month construction phase, 3,000 cubic meters of earth were removed, half of which was used for the laying of a Dirt bike track.
Union and SPD continued their coalition negotiations with the issues of home and justice.
To this end, the relevant working group met in Berlin in the morning.
Among other things, it is about direct democracy, parliamentarians and the federal police.
In the morning, the Working Group on Migration and Integration also wanted to continue its deliberations.
Among other things, this should be the subject of dual citizenship, in which both sides have conflicting ideas.
The SPD wants to end the compulsion for immigrants born in Germany to opt for one - the Union rejects a double passport.
On the subject of traffic, which is not on the meeting order this Friday, the SPD endorsed its no to a passenger car toll demanded by the CSU.
A vignette is a "flat rate for the variety and therefore ecologically counterproductive", explained the SPD negotiator for transport Florian Pronold, in a letter to his group.
There was a threat of out-of-road traffic which was already a major accident.
The introduction of a toll for all cars would also be only a first step from Pronold's point of view.
"There is a danger that the compensation for Germans will be deleted at a later stage," he said.
Dieter Thomas Kuhn in Stuttgart: Die singende Fehnwelle auf der Freilichtbühne

Carriers in case of accident severely injured
In the event of an accident on Thursday evening, a 37-year-old car driver from Aachen was seriously injured.
According to the police, a 41-year-old from Müsch was on her way to Grefrath with her car on the Kempener external ring.
When she wanted to turn left onto the St. Töniser Straße, she saw the coming car of the 37-year-old.
The saw collided.
The Aachener suffered serious injuries and had to be taken to the hospital for treatment.
Constance: blocking after accident at the Schänzlekreisel

There was a collision with the BMW of a 23-year-old constant.
Also damaged was the VW driving behind the BMW Passat of a 19-year-old.
A total of about 15000 damage to property was reported by the police.
The road had to be blocked during the accident, it continued.
Vienna Airport Clears Passenger Calls
Mr. Max Maier, please come to Gate 24.
In the future, there will no longer be any statements like this at Vienna-Schwechat Airport.
A large part of the speaker's transmittances are thus lost - the noise level is to be reduced so significantly.
Creating a more relaxed atmosphere is the goal of this innovation.
As Airport Speaker Peter Kleemann announced to Radio Wien, Vienna Airport follows an international trend with the recruitment of permeabilitys affecting individuals.
For example, airports in Copenhagen, Frankfurt and Dubai have already been waived of the noisy calls.
Due to the loss of these terms - on average, about 200 personal calls by the speakers in one day - it will be quieter at the airport in the future.
"It has also been shown in the experience that these individual transmittances have been seen relatively little, but at the same time all other information on changed flight climbing or departure times is a bit lower here," said Kleemann in conversation with the radio station.
Highlander-Games at the Kaltenhof
In addition to the brake car train with tractors, there is a second competition at the agricultural autumn festival at the Kaltenhof from 6 to 8 September.
On Saturday, September 7th, start the Highlander Games at 1.30 p.m.
Although they have a Scottish tradition, they are in the Kaltenhof swirling.
Teams and individual fighters measure in the disciplines of tree trunks, hoofshoes and water eggs.
Four and a half metres long, the tree trunk is between 25 and 30 kilograms heavy.
"It doesn't come about," explains organizer Peter Saile.
The trunk has to be thrown off vertically, let's skip it and then come to bed.
This is evaluated with most points.
When throwing hoofs, the goal is accurate.
From eight meters away, a plot is thrown.
Skills and strength must be demonstrated by participants in the carrying of water over 50 metres.
Time and water in a bottle are measured at the end.
From each "Clan" or team, two are allowed to participate in the individual competition.
The winners of the team and individual competition receive prizes.
Trainable as early as 10 a.m.
Desired is a suitable clothing, for example, the competitions in the Schottenrock can take place.
But also Swabian wearing is allowed.
For the "outfit" the jury gives a few more bonus points.
You can log in until an hour before the start of the competition.
With the Scottish-Swabian Highland Games and the Tractor Pulling, which starts half an hour earlier, a lot of action has already been announced on Saturday's holiday grounds.
In the evenings, the band's friends will pay for their music.
At 7 p.m., the biraböhmische Blasmusik from Schömberg designs the great entertainment evening.
The chapel plays fluffy polkas and marches.
Her repertoire also includes sensitive waltz and a rich big band sound.
With it will be the Heinz Koch, known as a singing host and black sausage for a while, among the reins.
In Dornhan, he has already performed at the Christmas market and at the fools.
On Sunday, the Musikverein Leinstetten will stay for the early stage, and from 2pm the farmer chapel Böffingen will be a guest, and the "Oldies" will let the festival go off.
The stop-lacker party with DJ Ralf is starting on Friday.
Other program points include the Oldtimer and Schlepper Meeting, exhibitions of companies on the subject of agriculture and forestry on Saturday and Sunday.
Other attractions on Sunday are the Maislabyrinth, the craftsman's market and sheep's shearing.
Especially for children there is a pedestal zoo, straw-hoop castle, tractor driving (under instructions) and tractor surfing.
Organisers are the Förderverein Mützhalle, the Ski Club and the tractor friends "Zündkäpsele".
Overview of milk and egg alternatives
Vegan diet requires plant alternatives to eggs, milk and dairy products.
For example, curated tofu with plant tooth is a quarkish set.
The Vegetarian Federation is also known as World Vegetarian Day on November 1.
On 1 November, the Vegetarian Federation of Germany proposes a series of vegan alternatives:
Pure plant margarine is a good alternative to butter, yoghurt lets be replaced by soya yoghurt.
Instead of milk, soya, oat, almond or rice milk could be used.
Addable plant cream replaces conventional punching cream.
There are also plant alternatives to eggs.
Half a crushed, mature banana, for example, can replace an egg as a binder in a cake.
Also 50 grams of apple or one tablespoon of ground linseed plus three tablespoons of water are suitable for this purpose.
Lockers become dough instead of egg, for example, with a mixture of a teaspoon of baking powder, a tablespoon of food starch and three tablespoons of mineral water.
But also 50 grams of soya yogurt or silk tofu can fulfill this purpose.
According to the Vebu, about 800 000 people are currently feeding vegan in Germany, i.e. only plantation.
Sleepless in New York
On the way to their host families in Weymouth, Massachusetts, the students of the Black Forest gymnasium met the American city of New York.
After eight hours of flight, it immediately went to Brooklyn Bridge, over which the heart of the city, Manhattan, was reached on foot.
There was already a fascinating view of the world-famous skyline, which is a special attraction in the evening light.
Due to the time shift, the students were almost 24 hours on the legs, but faithful to the motto "The city does not sleep" was decided the day at Times Square.
Despite Shutdown, on the second day the Statue of Freedom could be reached by ferry and climbed on foot.
After that, Wall Street was transferred to the Memorial of September 11.
On the third day, the students were able to gain an overview of the fascinating city from the 373 meters high view platform of the Empire State Building and enjoy the view.
Then it went through the hectic driving of the New York streets across the Rockefeller Center to Central Park, which provided an ideal opportunity for short stays in the autumn sun.
After a short flight from New York to Boston, the students have now arrived in their host families and experience school everyday life at the Weymouth High School.
This year, too, a Hubertus trade fair will be celebrated at the parish church of St. Mary on the Hülsbergstraße on the name of Saint Hubertus.
St. Hubertus was the Sage of a quite reckless hunter who converted through a vision and was later appointed Bishop of Liège.
The hunting hornwind group of the hunters Westfalen under the direction of Brigitte Kluth is playing on Parforcehörner (natural horn in the mood of E) after old, originally French melodies.
The blowers wear riding clothes because they mainly accompany riders, horses and dog mutts on tow hunts.
The solemn fair will take place on Sunday, 3 November, at 11.30 a.m.
The newly designed storage shines with a new cafe.
One that invites you to stay and return.
One that wants to make the name a program.
According to Lexicon, Déjà Vu is called a psychological phenomenon, which is expressed in the feeling of having experienced or seen a new situation once.
In the case of visiting the café of the same name at the branch in Kleve County in view of the Rhein-Waal University, it does not have to remain with the pure Déjà Vu feeling.
Finally, the café with its beautiful name has the right goal: to make an actual stay not only thoughtful, but to experience again and again and again.
Because it's just fun and it's just nice.
A look at the inner life on the impact 8 gives the viewer a good feeling at first.
The state-of-the-art but non-cool café office looks like a place to feel good.
Here, the team will spoil the guest with the founders Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner at the top with a wide range of coffee or cocktail variants.
There are delicious cakes or individually used fresh baguettes for this purpose.
The owners, both 33 years old, made a name for themselves before the opening of the charming café on the stop as a gastronomy: in Kranenburg they led the "Art Lounge".
From the move to Kleve on the stop, the friendly café lovers are hoping for more audiences.
Not least also through the university.
"Where we don't have a specific target group," says Daniel Büttner.
Rather, the two young students here want to address the same thing as seniors and all ages between them.
Apropos Café lovers.
The friendly owner is behind the coffee-genuss.
Enjoy the fragrant hot concoction in the various variations themselves.
Expressofan
Daniel Büttner is more the Expresso fan and Mirjam van der Stelt the cappuccino drinker.
"A baguette - that's my thing," she tells the NRZ.
Two events were already in the bright café.
Better said one.
Because the port festival took place more outside - the Café Déjà Vu did not profit from it.
But there was also the RingelNight.
"Beautiful, successful and funny," they found 33-year-olds.
But not everyone's business.
Maybe that's why Daniel Büttner isn't a big fan of events: "You can't do it all right now."
And with an event I always address only those who are also interested in the special event.
That's why events will be the exception for us.
"We want to disrupt the normal operation as little as possible".
To say: Déjà Vu also stands for reliability.
With regard to the quality of the products offered here, as well as the team and the beautiful environment at the stop in Kleve.
The road that develops more and more into a gastronomy mile.
For the joy of many smart people, the guests from close and far and the students who discover the gastromeilen and thus also the Café Déjà Vu for themselves.

A day of thanks at the MGV in Dinker
It was the 165th Foundation Festival to which the MGV "Friedrich Wilhelm Dinker" had invited this year and 52 guests, active singers and their wives were happy to come.
In the club venue of the restaurant "Witteborg" in Dinker, all enjoyed the harmonious interconnector very much in the sign of music.
Traditionally, the Foundation Festival is also always the appropriate solidity to perform honors.
The special award "Singers of the Year" was welcomed by the writer Rolf Wagener.
"You have not only written up a lot for us, but have also turned many rounds for us, for which we thank you very much," said Erich Schlotmann, the chairman of the choir.
This year the awards for participation in the performances and choral samples were presented to the choir director Dieter Schulze with 44 participations, followed by the chairperson Horst Pier-Ribert, the chairman himself, and the last year's "Singer of the Year" Friedrich Winkler with 42 participations each.
==References====External links==
A special thank you was given by the board of directors Ange Pier-Ribbert, who once again had enchanted a menu of the extra class and to Gerda Pier-Ribert for the table decoration.
The MGV "Friedrich-Wilhelm" meets its regular choral samples at 7.45 p.m. on Tuesdays.
"We are always welcome to new singing-loving voices," says Schlotmann.
UN announces new targets for combating poverty
The United Nations will start immediately with the preparation of a series of new objectives to replace the Millennium Development Goals announced 12 years ago.
In the run-up to the UN Summit on Sustainable Development, which began in Rio de Janeiro in the evening, Australian diplomats played a key role in the advance of "sustainable Development Goals", replacing the Millennium Goals that expire in 2015.
They were included in the final draft document, which will be adopted by world leaders, including Mrs Gillard, at the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon stated at the summit that the time had come to "think over national interests".
"I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to start a process with which universal, sustainable development goals should be agreed," he said.
“These goals will build on our progress from the Millennium Development Goals and will form an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will not hesitate to implement this mandate given to me by the Member States in order to achieve our vision of the sustainable development goals building on the success of the Millennium Goals."
Even if the SG Achim/Baden has been without a victory for four days, the handball obligors still have a good mood.
Trainer Tomasz Malmon has no doubt about this at all.
All are still fully motivated in the matter.
Nevertheless, I hope that we will finally win again.
"For I don't know how such a victory tastes," Malmon expects a success experience from his team at VfL Fredenbeck II.
Even though Fredenbeck's third-liga reserve has not yet torn out any trees, Malmon in advance warns the index finger.
Many players I have trained myself in the A-youth.
Therefore, they will certainly be particularly motivated against their ex- coach.
"In addition, it is important to wait for further reinforcement from the first", the SG-Coach explains.
In order to finally return to the success track, the Malmon team must definitely increase in comparison to the past performances.
Most of all in the cover work and during the switching game, it was a big hit.
Opportunity also needs to be improved.
So I hope my players finally got their head free during the short break.
Security concerns in Mozambique are growing in the face of conflicts between influential personalities
Thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputos under the watchful eyes of the statue of Samora Machel, the founder of the state and the first president of Mozambique to vote for peace calls at a rare public demonstration.
"We want peace again, we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, managing director of an investment company.
For fear of the future of the country, she has exchanged her business clothes against a T-shirt with the inscription "We demand security" in Portuguese and joined the crowd on Thursday at the independence square of the capital.
For two weeks now, there have been reports of conflicts between government forces and Renamo, one of the worst fighting since the peace agreement over 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement, initially supported by White Rhodes and later by the apartheid government of South Africa in trying to destabilize the independent government of the country.
After the 1992 peace treaty, she became an opposition party.
Analysts believe it is unlikely that the country will fall back into a mature conflict, but recent events have disturbed foreign investors and locals.
Much is at stake for the rapidly growing economy, as the discovery of huge gas reserves off the coast and coal camps in the northwest could bring investments of over 50 billion US dollars from companies like Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the USA into the country in the coming years.
The ruling Frelimo party, since 1975 the dominant force, and Renamo blame each other for the tensions.
Renamo claims that the government has provoked the recent clashes by attacking its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional castle of Renamos, on 17 October.
The assaults on the former rebels escalated when government forces attacked Renamo bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the leader of the group, explained Renamos spokesperson to the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for the clashes and accuses the organization of having attacked soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has tried to raise concerns about instability.
In relation to AFP, the French news agency, he said on Wednesday that Dhlakama considered himself to be a "lost" who "will use all his remaining forces to prove that he can impose his decisions on the government".
Both Frelimo and Renamo stress that they want to avoid war.
But the concerns have increased since Mazanga was quoted with the words, Renamo gave up the 1992 peace agreement.
Compared to the FT, he said that he meant that Frelimo no longer respected the agreement.
"Our vision is to start negotiations again and seriously," said Mazanga.
Previous talks between the parties have contributed little to the settlement of tensions fired by a number of clashes this year.
"We have two grown-up men here (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who meet their heads," says Joseph Hanlon, lecturer at Open University and Mozambique expert.
None of them is good at negotiating and no one is willing to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, who is pushing for election reforms, has already declared that she will boycott the municipal elections in November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of violence as the attempt of a debilitating movement to obtain concessions and financial benefits from the government.
Renamos election successes have been shrinking since 1992, while a newer party, founded by a former Renamo member, will probably improve Movimento Democrático de Mozambique (MDM), in the elections.
Mazanga claims that Guebuza – whose resignation when his second term of office ends next year – wants to destroy the country's democracy.
"He doesn't want a multi-party democracy, he doesn't want a transparent election, he doesn't want peace because he doesn't want to give up the presidential office," said Mazanga.
It is unclear about what renamo has, but it has done unresting attacks on police stations and vehicles on an important North-South connection.
Most of the fighting took place in the province of Sofala, which lies a few hundred kilometers north of Maputo, but in which Beira is located, using the port, mining companies such as Rio Tinto and Vale to export coal.
In June, Rio interrupted the use of the railway for one month after Renamo announced an attack on the route.
Mazanga answered with reluctance whether Renamo would repeat this threat.
Renamo wanted "to warn the international community that things in Mozambique are not good," said Mazanga.
Instability has increased the frustration over the government, says Fernando Lima, director of Mediacoop, an independent media company, because many people have already been concerned about corruption, the slow progress in development and a recent abduction wave.
"People think that the government and the president are responsible for the future of the country and should be the one to find solutions to the problems," he explains.
Omar Sultane, a demonstrator, said people just wanted stability.
"No one is interested in Renamo and Frelimo, they just want peace and accessable roads again," he said.
Children should be taught myths and legends as "models for life", says an author.
Thor's stories showed that "brutal power has no chance against clever tricks," and the Artus legend demonstrate how important it is to have a dream.
Many of the myths, however, were "too wild, too dirty and in some cases too dirty to be taught in schools", which is why Crossley-Holland pleaded for a "careful choice" of old-fashioned works.
"I think it's wonderful that in America myths and folklore are already part of education," he said.
I have been proposing this as a plan for twenty years.
He added that with authors and teachers who were "overly didactic" children would "turn off completely" because in entertaining stories the messages would be "unscrupulous".
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from English and was the author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and the British Folk Tales, said: "You can follow certain intentions, but you should keep them in the background as far as possible."
Perhaps the greatest difference between an adult author who writes for adults and an author who writes for children is the need to convey hope.
Not everything has to be simplified or lead to the happy end, but there is an immanent sense of good and evil.
It must be misrepresented, revealed by history and not explained.
This is the old story of showing instead of telling.
Hansjakob draws again in Freihof
100 years ago Heinrich Hansjakob took up his retirement home in Haslach, and on Sunday his last years were alive in the "Freihof".
The many spectators were thrilled by the very momentous scene play.
From the arrival to the award of honorary citizenship to his death, the script writer and Hansjakobddar Alois Kraftzcyk had designed an entertaining piece, which was very appealing under the direction of Cornelia Volk.
Marcus Zagermann took the audience as a speaker through the ten different scenes, explained contexts and bridged time from youth to close retirement.
On October 22, 1913, Hansjakob comes home to his children's sky, to his free yard.
And then began the scene game in which Alois Krafczyk once more shined in his parade role as a great son of the city.
He was still with Erich Becherer from Mühlenbach's "Schwarzwälder Füchsen" (Schwarzwälder Füchsen).
Not only was he welcomed by the audience with much applause, his sister Philippines also welcomed him.
Billy Sum-Hermann understood it incredibly good to get into the sister's role and gave her enormous life in milieu and gestures.
The Mühlenbach peasant chapel played appropriately selected pieces of music between the individual plays and thus rounded off the performance.
Haslach's mayor Heinz Winkler was honoured for the award of the honorary citizenship, who, in behalf of the then owner of Hättich, together with a part of the city council made his expectation.
Their anticipation then made the three-king singers, who led Hansjakob to the exclamation: "Ah, like beautiful, youth memories of my own three-king season come to life again."
With their song "O Jesslein", they enjoyed the audience in the open court as well as the children of Storchentag with their loud "Out, Out".
At that time Hansjakob had expressed his criticism of the church of office, as had his concerns about the growths in agriculture, the consequences of industrialization or the effects of war.
In his homeland, behind his tomb chapel on the fire at Hofstetten, he found his retirement.
"A restless spirit had finally found its rest and had gone home forever," it was said at the end of the scene.
There were many applauses and many praises from the audience for the performance.
Basketball: The Hope of the Neckar Giants Grows
The odds on the league remain of the sports-decreased Ludwigsburg Bundesliga basketball players have risen.
Because there should be a wildcard procedure, then for the Neckar Giants there is now a competitor less.
The Hamburg Towers Basketball project does not apply for a possible repatriation site.
"We won't participate in the Wildcard process," said former national player Pascal Roller, who has been setting up the concept for a professional club in Hansestadt since 2012.
A first exhalation was still not to be heard from Ludwigsburg.
"We didn't deal with the Wildcard process, so long we didn't realize Düsseldorf won't get a license," said Neckar-Riesen-Boss Alexander Reil of our newspaper.
Until the 23rd of May, Upper Düsseldorf Baskets will be able to submit documents to the Arbitration Court and prove its economic Bundesliga capability.
Up to now, however, the licence has twice been denied to the Rhine countries.
The arbitration court is the last instance.
Haigerloch: Supper-Mahlskirche enters the point of view
As a contribution to the 150th anniversary of the Evangelical Church in Haigerloch, the city's cultural and tourism office is dedicated to the last of its public themes this year on Sunday, 27 October, the Evening Meal Church.
After visiting the Atomkeller Museum, the Haigerlocher period was to be considered after 1850 when Haigerloch came under Prussian rule.
The end point is a visit to the Evening Meal Church.
There, the leaders get the story of the church's construction and gain insights into the development of the Protestant community in a Catholic area.
Last but not least, the view of the evening meal created by Friedrich Schüz with the support of Walter Kröll and Georg Halmitter also falls into the church.
It is an original faithful reproduction of the famous Milan model of Leonardo da Vinci.
Meeting point to the other half-hour guided tour is at 3 pm at the Atom Keller Museum.
There are tickets at the Atomkellermuseum cash register.
For questions and information, the tourism office of the city of Haigerloch is available.
Snowden could also say in Russia
Former U.S. intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in the U.S. appeal in his Russian asylum.
Representatives of the Federal General Procuratorate could either ask written questions or personally meet the 30-year-old in Russia.
This was reported by the Interfax agency, calling on previously named circles who are familiar with the situation.
Such a question could be resolved in the inter-state context.
An exit Snowdens from Russia is practically excluded.
"In this case, he loses his refugee status," the Agency quoted her source.
Because Germany is the ally of the USA, snowden there threatened the extradition, it continued
Long breath pays off
Six men's teams fought for the title at the tennis tournament of the clubs.
In the end, the endurance of the team Maier/Bronner decided the last match.
A dream weather had received the tennis department of the Sportfreunde Rohrdorf to the tournament of the local clubs and friends.
The fun at the tennis game was in the foreground of the tournament.
There were five games per team on the plan, each playing against each one.
It was played in double mode with a long set of up to nine points or a maximum of 45 minutes duration.
Anja Schlieiter heads the tournament
The tournament management was in the well-proved hands of Anja Schlietter, supported by Carmen Müller and Inga Kronemeyer.
After the first three games and a lunch break with pasta, the tournament went into the decisive phase.
The favourites Andre Maier/Matthias Bronner were in parallel with Michael Klippel and Sadmin Osmic (both teams of the SG Rohrweiler) so that the last two matches had to make the decision.
At the award ceremony, Carmen Müller was finally able to hand over the hiking cup to Andre Maier/Matthias Bronner, who had the longest breath on the finish.
The second place was double Michael Klippel/Sadmin Osmic.
The bronze staircase reached Rainer and Bernd Maier of the Asphaltriecher team.
At late afternoon sun and coffee and cake the successful sound of the tournament took place.
On the last week of August, the Schwarzwälder Freilichtmuseum Vogtsbauernhof in Gutach near Hornberg is once again firmly in the hands of children.
Traditionally, the museum welcomes visitors on Saturday and Sunday, August 24 and 25, as part of the summer holiday program to a colourful children's and family festival with numerous activities and events.
"Great and small can learn various old crafts on both days," says the press release.
Whether making soap, turning candles, felting or making ropes, for any age is the matching thing.
The children are assisted by regional craftsmen from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.
The museum workshop is also working.
When building cuckoo pipes, water wheels or circles, the young guests can prove their craftsmanship.
Have fun, too, promises the many old games, such as push car racing or sling running.
Speed and coordination are needed here.
For all the little detectives, the open-air museum on Saturday and Sunday, at 12 and 2 p.m., offers a mystery guided tour of the museum.
On a tour of the terrain, the children must guess what stories of truth are true or yet lie.
In addition, visitors have a special opportunity to get to know the open-air museum during a carriage with Black Forest foxes.
Not only horses, but also many other animals, such as sheep, goats, cows and chickens, are to be found and amazement on the site.
In addition, all children on Sunday may look forward to the Clown Otsch, who will drive his snack with the museum guests from 11 o'clock on.
Cozy and fairy-tale, it goes to Hermann Büttner.
The storyteller takes the little guests at 11. 13 and 15 o'clock into the wonderful world of fairy tales.
In addition, the children's costume dance group from Gutach presents traditional dances at 11.30 a.m.
Furthermore, on both days of the event from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m., many craftsmen such as the Besenbinder, the neighbor, the spider, the weaver and the baker can look over the shoulder during their traditional work.
Until the end of the summer holidays in Baden-Württemberg, visitors to the open-air museum expect a varied holiday program.
In a small New Zealand town Burt Muro is considered to be a lovable Kauz because he has made his motorbike, built in 1920, to take part in a race in America.
Burt, despite a heart failure, is not to be removed from his dream.
With his savings, a couple of donations and a mortgage on his old workshop sheds, he transfers by ship to Los Angeles.
After the film there is coffee, tea and cake.
Shrewd pinging bothers locals
Rhenus Midgard also invested heavily on land.
They distribute the coal coming from the ships to the neck.
The company has several irons in the fire at its location.
In addition to the coal import, Rhenus Midgard uses wind turbine logistics, among other things.
Black shimmers the coal in the storage area in front of the dike.
Two huge blue neck shakers and rechargers distribute or load the coal here as needed.
Every time the envelopes move, a shrill warning sound sounds over the ground.
"The signals are for safety and are required by law," says Matthias Schrell, Managing Director of Rhenus Midgard in Wilhelmshaven.
Unfortunately, this is a lot to be heard in the face of unfavorable winds - and so there have already been some complaints of people from the city order.
He takes the actions very seriously and has therefore contacted those concerned, says the 40-year-old.
In close consultation with the authorities, the warning signals with technical measures were now kept quieter.
In the future, he continued to rely on the open dialogue with the neighbours.
Because Matthias Schrell has a lot left in front of the site.
With the expansion of the Lower Saxony Bridge Rhenus Midgard continues to rely on coal imports for power plants and is one of the largest in Europe in this sector.
Thanks to the in-depth bed tub form terminal at 18.5 meters, Capesize-Bulkcarriers can be manufactured here for a long time.
"This year we want to crack the 3-million-ton mark on the cover," Schrell says.
In addition to the Eon power plant on site, the import coal goes to power plants in the interior.
If the GDF-Suez power plant goes to the grid, then about 5 million tonnes of coal imports per year would be realistic.
The three ship-handlers on the bridge as well as the second conveyor could create up to 10 million.
Bayern Basketballer despite first defeat optimistic
Even the first defeat in the Euroleague could not narrow the huge optimism of FC Bayern München's basketball balls.
"No one can forbid us to believe in winning even the best team in Europe over the past two years," said Bayern-Coach Svetislav Pesic after the unfortunate 83:88 (39:47) on Thursday night with the champion Olympic Piraeus.
We sent the message: Also in Munich there is basketball!
At their first third appearance in the European royal class, the Munichers sold themselves very well for a long time, but were simply not clear enough during the crucial phases.
At first, the guests managed to turn a 15-point back into a tour 13 minutes before the end, before Piraeus gave the game a turn again.
"We struggled back incredibly against the twice Euroleague champion, but then made minor mistakes again," said Bavaria-Profi Yassin Idbihi.
We're proud of our performance, but we want to win every game.
Malcolm Delaney and Nihad Djedovic were the most successful runners of the Munichs, who in the first two matches against the Italian series champion Montepaschi Siena and the Polish title winner Zielona Góra had celebrated significant victory.
Ben Greenman: Ten Years of New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
It could be said that New York City is the birthplace of Stand-up Comedy in America: nearly a hundred years ago, Varite artist Frank Fay, who worked as a Conferencier at Palace Theatre on Broadway, started to tell the crowd of jokes in the form of a conversation.
Over the years, Fays has been expanding innovation, as was the last time at the New York Comedy Festival.
This year, the festival will celebrate its ten-year anniversary with over sixty shows in small clubs and large theatres by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the Caroline Stand-up Institute.
"Most of these headlines started at Caroline's and then became more and more successful until they were too familiar to appear in a club," said Hirsch.
We designed this festival so we can continue to work with them.
At this year's event there are performances of Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as of Stand Up for Heroes, an annual music and comedy event for army veterans at Madison Square Garden, which includes Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
With the festival the world of comedy has also grown.
A number ofcomedians who will participate in the festival this year have become known through rather unconventional paths, such as broadcasts on smaller television channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll became known with a Sitcom on cable television (the ironic-slip fantasy football series "The League" on FXX) and now has its own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was one of the most famous for her viral video series, "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On", both for Saturday Night Live and for Parks and Recreation.
Both Kroll and Slate and other young Comedians with characteristic voices (the surreal pessimist Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic theme concentrated on Racial topics W. Kaumau Bell) are products of the decentralised world of American comedy.
Among the festival's largest visitor magnets is an interview: David Steinberg speaks to Larry David.
Steinberg started as a stand-up comedian, but has developed into a respected television and film director as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007 he moderated a television broadcast entitled "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg" at TV Land.
The meeting takes place at the Town Hall in the middle of Manhattan.
"The city is definitely in the comedy DNA of Larry's entire work," said Steinberg.
He told me when he's here, sometimes he goes through the lane between two buildings and thinks: Hey, if I lose all my money, I might live here.
Iran satisfied with the process of nuclear negotiations
Iran shows itself satisfied with the negotiation process one week before the next nuclear meeting with the five U.N. venues and Germany.
"After years, we now have an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Authority to clear the differences of the last years," said Foreign Minister Mohammed Djawad Sarif on his Facebook page.
It would still be a long way, but the nuclear chief negotiator is satisfied with the negotiation process and is also optimistic that at the end both sides will find a solution.
Drama in Uruguay: Boys kill game combs with Machete
Two children have committed the murder of an 11-year-old in Uruguay.
The two 14 and 12 - year - old boys had invited their victims to go for a bird hunt with them.
They armed with machetes and knives on Tuesday to starve the 11-year-old and threw the body into a fountain, the newspaper "El País" reported on Thursday.
Then they would have played football in a workers' quarter in front of their homes.
The body was found the following night in the village of Cerro Pelado, 15 kilometers north of the exclusive beach town Punta del Este.
As Alibi, a five-year-old half-sister of the disciple who had taken them should say that she had been sexually attacked by the boy.
But when the girl described the Tathergang before the police without mentioning an attack against her, the two boys admitted the deliberate killing of the 11-year-old.
The elder called it a rival in the football game, among other things.
He was sent to a psychiatric youth institute for the time being.
Consignee must go to prison
Because of exploitative trafficking in human beings, detention, threat, insult and dangerous physical injury, the Landgericht Konstanz sentenced a 33-year-old man from St. Georgen to three and a half years in prison.
The former Bundeswehr soldier, who, after two operations in Afghanistan, worked as a doorstep, made a confession in the course of a process agreement.
He then met women in five cases via Internet or telephone contacts, which he sent to the bar after a few weeks against their will.
He used resistance to break violence and threats.
He kept the revenue of some women who had been buying for him for years.
By confiscating mobile phones and SIM cards, he suspended women's contacts to the outside world.
Together with a colleague who taught the women, he brought them to various brothels in the southwest.
There he had them partially monitored to control their revenue.
In court, the defendant claimed first that he was suffering from a severe trauma after colleagues in Afghanistan were killed in an explosion next to him.
After a psychiatric expert expressed great doubts about the psychological restriction and thus of limited guilt, the 33-year-old made a comprehensive confession.
The court had no longer to hear of the injured women.
As one Kripo official reported, at least four other cases of exploitation of human trafficking could be identified after a first display by telephone surveillance measures.
Discussions stopped were marked by high aggression.
In later hearings, the victims had confirmed their martyrdom.
Another witness, in whom one of the women had discovered blue spots all over the body, had not made any statement to this day.
It is about "a completely broken personality", which sees violence and exploitation in this meteor as normal.
The defendant regretted his behaviour yesterday.
"He has settled out of these circles and wants to live a normal life after the arrest," he said.
Oil price continues to reach 96 USD per barrel
Oil prices continued to fall on Friday, after concerns about a high supply overestimated a report according to which the energy-intensive manufacturing sector of China is growing.
In the late morning in Europe, the reference crude oil varieties for deliveries in December fell by 14 cents in electronic commerce at the New York Mercantile Exchange to $96.24 per barrel.
The contract fell at 39 cents on Thursday, which meant a fall of 5.8 percent in October.
The large range of crude oil has burdened prices over the past few weeks.
On Wednesday, the US Department of Energy declared that the US offer had increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over the course of five weeks, the offer had risen by 25 million barrels.
On Friday, however, there were indications of stronger demand through two reports of an increase in activity in Chinese manufacturing.
This signifies the continued recovery of the economy of China, with growth increasing to 7.8 percent in the third quarter after it had reached its lowest level in the previous quarter for two decades.
Crude oil from Brent, a reference value for international crude oil, which is also used by American refineries, fell to 108,58 USD per barrel at the ICE Exchange in London by 26 cents.
Court of First Instance blocks decision on NYPD’s stop-and-friesk Directive
On Thursday, a Federal Appeal Court in the USA blocked the order of a judge who had requested changes to the stop-and-fresk program ('Behind and Browse') of the New York Police Department and dismissed the judge from the case.
The second U.S. Appeal Court stated that the decisions of Judge Shira Scheindlin would be suspended until an appeal was made by the city.
The judge had judged in August that the city violated the Constitution with the way in which the program for stopping and questioning people was implemented.
The city appealed against its assessment and the appropriate remedies, including the decision to set up a monitoring body to assist the police in amending their directive and the relevant training programme.
The appeal court heard the arguments for suspension on Tuesday.
The appeal report stated that the judge had to be dismissed from the case because she had violated the Code of Conduct for US judges by stating that a judge should avoid the appearance of partyity; this was partly justified by a number of media interviews and public statements in which she had publicly responded to the Court's criticism.
The judge had judged that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people, because they were unreasonably targeting black and Latin American men with the stop-and-friesk program.
It appointed an external body to monitor the implementation of essential changes, including reforms to directives, training and supervision, and arranged a pilot program with body-borne cameras in quarters where most controls were carried out.
In August, New York City agreed to end the practice of storing names and addresses from people released after police control.
An oral hearing to appeal to the city is scheduled after March 14, 2014.
The stop-and-frysk tactics have been criticized by a number of civil liberties.
Controls of this kind have been in different forms for decades, but the number of checks recorded during the term of office of partyless mayor Michael Bloomberg rose to an all-time high of 684,330 in 2011, most of them black and Latin American men.
In 2004, four men, all of whom belonged to minorities, filed a complaint that developed into a collective charge.
Supporters of changes to the NYPD's stop-and-frysk programme say that the changes will end unfair practices and create a more trusted and effective police and influence the way other police presences use the regulation.
Opponents believe that the changes would dampen the morale of the police, but not the crime; nor would money be wasted and the broader problem of a police force that was under pressure after thousands of places were lost in the last decade.
The judge pointed out that she did not end the stop-and-frysk practice, which is constitutional, but only reform the method of implementation of the checks by the NYPD.
The happiness of the dreaming camels
Happiness is an oasis that achieves only dreaming camels
With this sense of meaning, the first chairman Wolfgang Henne described the history and fascination of the association "Helfende Handen".
On Saturday afternoon the tenth birthday of the association was celebrated, which can have considerable successes.
The first chairman of Henne reported in detail the work of the association.
He himself was the first time in Mauritania in the Cheijk-Zajed hospital in Nouakchott in 2004.
As a result, a further cooperation developed, and the gynecologist Henne performed numerous operations on several trips.
During the speeches pictures were shown by the interventions on a large canvas, so that the guests of the anniversary event could take a picture of the actions mentioned.
The club's desert vehicle was also shown.
It is a former federal border protection vehicle.
Rainer Prewo, the former OB of Nagold, had proposed to equip this vehicle with a photovoltaic system and now, according to Henne, plans to work with the association in a consultative role.
In 2008, the Zimmerei Schleeh from Baiersbronn created the health care station in Socogim, an estrange on the outskirts of the capital, honorably in the record time of just under a week.
Henne also mentioned a new mother-child hospital in Nouakchott
Especially interesting in times when Nagold is to eliminate the birth clinic.
One learns a lot in Africa as a physician, henne, for example, deceleration against burn-out.
Due to the political unrest in the country, you could not make as many trips as planned, but many physicians came to Germany to host here in various areas.
Furthermore, containers with materials are regularly sent to Africa, so in March this year medical equipment, medications, association material, hospital beds and glasses.
Co-initiator Hans-Joachim Fuchtel himself provided plenty of local colour by telling about Mercedes vehicles converted from Mauritania to the mobile goat stall and the experiences of the tribal musicians who traditionally support the association, during their Mauritanian journey.
As his personal motives, he called his work in the field of auditing as a young Member.
When he realized how much money was lost on the way, he decided to help Africans control a budget by the people.
Fuchtel also stressed that global economy also required global human love.
Nor should it be forgotten that Africa is closer than some think.
From Gran Canaria it was not far to Africa.
Coulson used phone hacking to check a tip
The former news of the Word editor Andy Coulson reportedly used "telephone hacking, surveillance and confrontation" to attempt to confirm a false tip over an affair of the then Interior Minister Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the court in Old Bailey, News of the World had heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with his "attractive special advisor" Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper instructed private detective Glenn Mulcaire to hack Pawlby's voice emails, and persecuted them, but Coulson also called them and left news as the court learned.
"In the view of the prosecutor's office, Coulson, who is now the publisher of the NotW, is nobody who is standing in front of the home of people and hopes to catch them up for a fresh deed, but one who likes to confront people with a story to see their reaction," Edis said.
He said NotW uses three methods to invest in researching stories: phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third method.
Obviously he knows about the second, the monitoring, otherwise it can't be.
What about the first one?
Did he know about the phone hacking?
He argues, but we say, "And whether he knew about it."
Rumours about an affair Clarkes were first picked up by the feature editorship of NotW, when a source that was sexually interested in Pawlby was said: "Don't waste your time, she's with Charles."
A band with voice emails from their phone of at least three events was secured in August 2006 in Mulcaire's apartment.
The investigators also found entries on the detective's computer, on which Pawlby and her sister were stored as "projects".
During the time of the investigations, Pawlby’s grandparents received anonymous calls asking them for information about them, Edis explained.
Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup supervised the movement of Pawlby.
On June 18th, 2005, Coulson left her a voice mail with the following content: "I have a story that we want to bring out tomorrow, which I would like to talk to Charles about."
Edis explained that Coulson's activities in this story followed the same pattern as with other important personalities, such as the former Interior Minister David Blunkett.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson Blunkett had been confronted with a married woman because of an affair when he was left with the fellow defendant Rebekah Brooks who had been married at that time.
Coulson and Brooks argue that they have conspired with others to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted the phone hacking.
In protest against the planned rich tax, the French football will actually pass the first strike since 1972.
A cliché meeting will end without results.
In the conflict over the taxes on the rich, the government and the professional football in France have manoeuvrated themselves after a failed suffrage meeting in a deadlock.
President François Hollande received and heard their complaints at the Élysée Palace in Paris on Thursday.
However, he refused to waive the football from the planned 75 percent tax on income of more than one million euros a year, which all companies of the country should pay for two years from 2014 onwards.
The opposite side also remained hard.
The strike announced for the end of November will also be carried out, the Chief Association of Professional Clubs (UCPF), Jean-Pierre Louvel, announced.
The playing days in the Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 between November 29 and December 2 thus fall out.
Singings: No absolute protection possible
"We want to involve the inhabitants in planning early," Mayor Jens Häußler opened the citizens' information event on the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
Around 80 participants had come to the municipal hall to explain the planned measures, to ask questions, to express concerns and to bring ideas.
Häußler stated: "The final decisions are made by the members of the municipal council."
The flood, which met ginglings unprepared on May 15, 2009, was an incisive event that raised the question of protective measures for the future, according to Kaußler.
A river basin study had been commissioned with the neighbouring municipality of Aidlingen, which is now the basis for the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
"The aim is to protect as many land as possible," says Häußler.
The planning of protection against a flood expected statistically every 100 years, according to Deutsche Wetterdienst, is considered.
Climate change is taken into account by a 15 % supplement.
In specialist circles this is referred to as "HQ 100aKlima".
The water masses, which had caused considerable damage in Geching in 2009, corresponded to a 1000-year-old flood.
"There is no absolute protection, but we can achieve a relative improvement," says Häußler.
In order to achieve the protection of HQ 100aClima, around four million euros must be invested in Gechingen, with the municipality counting on national grants of around 70 percent.
However, he pointed out that there was only the promotion if an overall concept was implemented.
To this end, the community was dependent on the participation of citizens.
A complex planning and approval procedure had to be completed.
In the best case, implementation could begin in 2016.
Among other things, the protection concept presented in the municipal council last week (we reported) provides for local measures in the flow of the river Irm from the Stammheim valley.
Following the presentation of the flood protection concept, the participants took the opportunity to raise their concerns.
Among other things, it was questioned why no more dams and reservoirs were planned to protect the place.
Gregor Kühn, specialist planner of the commissioned engineering office Wald and Corbe from Hillsheim, who presented the concept, stressed that it needed the interaction of all proposed measures to achieve the desired goal in the sum.
Furthermore, one was kept to find the most economical solution, said Joachim Wald of Forest and Corbe.
Unmut has been in the hands of the old town, who suffer from overloads of the canal network even in the event of normal thunderstorms.
The problem is known to the administration and first measures have already been taken.
However, it was more important to point out that the directives on sewer systems are different from those for flood protection and should not be mixed.
The municipality was obliged to interpret the canal network in such a way that rain events could be carried out for two to three years.
Increasing the size of the waste water channels would result in millions of devouring.
Hardly injured after collision
On the early Friday afternoon, two drivers were severely injured on Landesstraße 44 near Revensdorf in a frontal collision.
The police immediately locked the road completely, but could not say anything at first to the accident.
However, there are several testimonies that should be evaluated first.
The 19-year-old director of a VW golf drove toward Revensdorf and the 38-year-old man from Gettorf met her with his Hyundai.
Both vehicles collided, with the woman being so heavily trapped that the fire brigade needed almost half an hour to free her from the wreck.
The actual cause of the accident was initially unexplained.
Both accidents came to nearby hospitals.
The route remained full for about two hours.
You could call him the U.S. Dostoyevsky.
Philip K. Dick was a god seeker, a metaphysicist, his novels and stories also have something serial.
Amazingly, the external relationship: the stinging eyes, the beard, the high forehead.
And just as Fjodor M. Dostoyevski, with his massive oeuvre, can be understood as the founder and apologist of the Russian soul, one reads Philip K. Dick as an American prophet, who is quite a bit true in his own country.
Some titles have been published in Heyne Verlag, the Haffmans-Kassette with the 118 narratives distributes two thousand.
Dick explains America - the empire of stunning technical progress, paired with paranoia, security craze and the belief to be chosen.
Dick had God’s experiences, his late books read like a mixture of the revelation of John and a computer manual.
Maybe he was crazy, drugged his brain.
He's gotten, early on, that the computers are divinities.
He wrote a theology of the computer and asked what distinguishes a man from a machine, the Creator of his creature.
That's the "Blade Runner" problem.
Killing.
A master of science fiction.
A fantastic writer.
His stories inspired film directors like Ridley Scott, Paul Verhoeven and Steven Spielberg.
This story is particularly significant now.
The "minority report" dates from 1956, it pours the smell of the Cold War and the McCarthy Tribunal.
The pre-crime principle is being developed here, "pre-crime", which is now more or less the official doctrine of the White House.
In Dick's world, which is terrifyingly like ours, mutants look to the future - and the police are approaching.
"We record individuals who have not violated any law," says the head of the authority.
"We'll get them before they can commit a violent crime."
And: "In our society there are no serious criminals, for which we have a penitentiary full of Pesudo criminals." They read streams of time.
They assume that evil is happening, and prevent the criminal idea from being put into practice.
Dick's story looks like the blueprint for the anti-terror laws and the noise of the NSA.
Anticipation of the attack: Obama's drone philosophy and practice also works.
But Dick's story is not over yet.
The chief of police complains that there is no more division of power, that the military controls everyday life - and what is left of the state.
Then the watchman himself will be monitored and transferred to a future crime.
The system is running through.
It's perfect, but it's lying.
It invents its own requirements.
Not only does he buy mistakes and sacrifices but he builds himself on them.
The system creates the danger it fights.
Philip K. Dick means to keep drawing closer to the truth.
Spoken at Merkel in Russia
Former U.S. intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in the U.S. coffin about Chancellor Angela Merkel in his Russian asylum.
Representatives of the German federal prosecutor could either ask written questions or meet the 30-year-old personally in Russia, the agency reported Interfax.
Previously, the Green-Bundestag member Hans-Christian Ströbele had met in Moscow yesterday as the first German politician Snowden to talk to him about the affair.
NSA recovery strengthens company paranoia due to state surveillance
On a mild day at the end of August, a German police helicopter flew deep across the U.S. Consulate in Frankfurt am Main, the capital of Germany.
At the direction of the Federal Office for the Protection of Constitutions and the Combating of Terrorism (BVT), the German Internal Secret Service, he should photograph the roof of the U.S. post located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
According to German media, the BVT wanted to demonstrate the presence of surveillance antennas and the action led to an exchange of words between the US and the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Berlin.
James Clapper, U.S. Director of National Intelligence, once again insisted in September that the US did not use any means of foreign spying to "stolen the business secrets of foreign companies on behalf of US companies so that they could increase their international competitiveness or profits."
However, since Edward Snowden, who became the Whistleblower, began publishing his full-length horn to US surveillance secrets, European governments and business leaders are no longer sure whether they can speak with the director.
Reports that the US National Security Agency has been spying out the Brazilian oil company Petrobas and that has acquired data from American cloud providers, including Google and Yahoo, have brought the company paranoia to a new peak because of state surveillance.
The barrel to overflow brought the revelation that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone was blurred, possibly for ten years.
If the most powerful person in Europe can come into sight, then companies will certainly also be potential targets.
Snowden has made intensive cooperation between US intelligence services and businesses transparent.
I think it is possible that these data will be used for mutual use.
"Germany must wake up," explains Oliver Grün, President of BITMi, representing small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
German companies believe that the US now poses an almost as high risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, according to a survey published in July by the consultant firm EY.
However, there has been no evidence in Snowden's documents that the US has passed on the business secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Policymakers have expressed concern that the EU has lacked certain IT and Internet capabilities and should reduce its dependence on the US.
The companies are sceptical about this.
In the Bundestag it was proposed that we should build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again ...
“This is not how it works,” says Hasso Plattner, chairman of the German software manufacturer SAP.
If you wanted a strong European IT industry, you shouldn't have let it die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidized, from coal to cars to agriculture.
Everything except for the IT industry.
Nevertheless, scope and technical refineries of the US spy authorities exposed by the Snowden revelations have shocked companies that had previously seen the greatest spy risk in China.
Cloud computing is a major change because European business leaders are now more aware that data stored in the US is subject to the case law there and are therefore potentially at risk.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a trade institute, the revelations about US data mining activities with Prism rejected about ten percent of U.S. members' plans to use an American provider.
Jim Snabe, Deputy Managing Director of SAP, says: "We see a new question from customers who did not exist a year ago – it is: Where are my data stored and can you guarantee that they remain physically in this area of law?"
Many German business leaders believe that the latest reports simply confirm what they already knew anyway, namely that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and therefore need to be guarded at all costs.
It is no surprise that economic espionage takes place.
That's always been the case.
"It has been a topic for many years and has not fundamentally changed due to the current discussion," says Kurt Bock, Chairman of the chemical company BASF.
The Americans spy on commercial and industrial level, as we do, because it is in the national interest to defend our companies.
The management of companies does not normally boast of the countermeasures that have been taken, because this gives an attacker advantages.
In large companies, employees have long been inflated that taking a free USB stick on a fair or leaving a laptop unattended in the hotel room is not advisable, linde said.
Ulrich Hackenberk, member of the board of car manufacturers Audi, says that it has been a standard practice for years to collect the phones before a board meeting, so that they cannot be used as hearing aids.
The German BVT advises executives to use simple prepaid phones when they travel abroad, because smartphones may be compromised.
The prepaid phones were thrown away.
However, there is a concern that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to hacking and monitoring.
In Germany, many of these companies are world leaders in their respective niches.
"Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack experience, personnel and financial resources to effectively protect business secrets against unauthorized access," the BVT warns in a report.
The USA warns its own companies of economic spying by other countries.
According to Washington Post, in February France, Russia and Israel behind China, the US National Intelligence Estimate ranked two of the countries that used to obtain economic data from hacking.
A member of the board of a German blue chip company agreed when it comes to economic espionage, then "the French are the worst".
Bernard Squarcini, former director of the French interior intelligence service DCRL, was quoted in an interview this month in the following words: "The intelligence services know very well that all countries, even when working together in the fight against terrorism, are spying out their allies."
Hechingen: Fair gives answer to wedding questions
"The marriage is the most important journey of discovery that man can make," said the philosopher Sören Kierkegaard.
Tips on how at least the wedding celebration can be achieved have now given a special exhibition in the domain in Hechingen.
Retirement was important providers around a wedding.
A trend: The retro look has kept moving again.
That's about to start with the wedding clothes.
White is must, best covered or in cream.
At the front, the often grumbled clothes with embroidery are closed, often with a veil, but at the back they go down the back and often end in a tug.
However, as Stefanie Koch emphasizes from the fashion house Kleidmüller, the spirits separate.
In men, the suit dominates with vest and plastron, but it can also be chosen cream-coloured or brown combinations.
Important is the selection of the local, it was explained.
Jewelless side rooms are not optimal, the ambience should be special.
Here the domain drew attention to its own offer in the Remise.
If you want to go ahead with the carriage, Uwe Link has an offer.
"Coaches are also popular for boys' leavers," he says.
Romanticism is also required for invitation cards, flower arrangements and also for wedding pictures.
More and more in fashion are the "After-Weding-Photo" - that is, recording series in special places, preferably waterfalls, a few days after the festival, but in wedding clothes, Elisabeth Keidel explained.
Many more details of a successful wedding were presented in the domain on Sunday.
Flower arrangement, rings, wedding table, cake and also a magician, such as Marko Ripperger, who can entertain guests stylishly.
Not to mention the right cosmetics and nail care.
Everything for an unforgettable feast.
Dogfriends Successful
For the repeated time, the athletes of the dog-friends Bitz were successful on a rally-Opedience tournament.
Achim Scherrenbacher started in Kandel with two dogs; with his dog Sandy he scored 94 points in the class of beginner and secured fifth place, and with 15 month old Marley he brought it with 87 points on place twelve.
With her Woody in class 1, Susi Höpp looked critically at the performance judge.
Parents of a teenager from Georgia who died in tragic accident believe in murder
The teen's parents, whose body was found in a rolled ringer mat in the gym of his high school, are convinced that her son was murdered, explained the family lawyer on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson from Valdosta in the U.S. state of Georgia was found on January 11 in a upright mat that stood behind the gallery in the school gym.
The investigating officers of the sheriff of Lowndes County concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident, but this doubted the 17-year-old's family.
"You are convinced that her son was murdered," said Benjamin Crimp, the lawyer of Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, to FoxNews.com.
You would never have believed he died the way the sheriff concluded.
"They believe that it is against any logic, contrary to the laws of physics as well as to the common sense," says Crimp.
Rather, they are convinced that the truth is covered up in order to protect the person or persons responsible for the death of their son.
"Your son went to school to learn and came back in the body bag," he comments.
U.S. prosecutor Michael Moore said on Thursday that there would be a formal investigation to Johnson's death, as a number of important questions were still unexplained.
What was the cause of death?
Is his death due to a crime?
This was explained by Moore at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I follow the facts in whatever direction they lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I believe that there is a sufficient basis for formal investigation," he said.
Moore explained to reporters that the initial autopsy indicates that Johnson died from a "position-related suffocation".
A second autopsy, however, caused another cause of death, according to Moore.
"There are a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed," he said.
Moore added that if there were sufficient evidence for a criminal or civil investigation to the death of Johnson, he would instruct the FBI to carry out the investigations.
A representative of the county sheriff's authority did not immediately comment on our request on Thursday.
On Wednesday, a court in the south of Georgia ordered that the authorities should release all surveillance videos that the investigators have reviewed.
The teen's parents said they hoped that the video recordings contained evidence of his death.
CDC publish Allergy Guidelines for Schools
On Wednesday the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a series of guidelines for dealing with food allergies from children to schools.
These are the first such directives issued by the US Government, as the number of school-based children with food allergies is increasing.
One of 20 children in the United States now has a food allergy.
According to CDC, the distribution of food allergies among children increased by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007.
The guidelines contain information for schools that are intended to raise awareness of food allergies and how to deal with children who show allergic reactions.
It is also recommended that schools have available epinephrine – the car injection of the EpiPen brand is used most frequently – to be able to encounter a potentially fatal hypersensitivity reaction.
The legislation in the states has recently changed the rules so that schools can keep epinephrin more in stock.
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms that are called by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children may say: 'It feels as if something is pressing on my tongue', 'My tongue feels like a hair is lying on it' or 'my tongue is crawling'.
Parents of intersexual children can choose 'badly undetermined'
Germany is the first European nation in which a third generation is recognized for children born with non-clear genocide.
Newborns are no longer assigned rigidly male or female.
Under the new law, parents no longer need to explain gender for such children, but can "undetermined" or "undetermined" reference to birth certificate.
The aim of the law is to put pressure on parents so that they do not have to make any over-decided decisions regarding operations for a sex assignment in newborns, and to combat discrimination against intersexual people.
According to BBC years later, an intersexual person said, "I am neither man nor woman."
I remain mutilated and full of scars, the stain created by doctors.
It is estimated that one of 2,000 children every year does not come into the world either as a boy or as a girl.
They belong to the intersexual, a group that is subject to the diagnosis of "sexual differentiation disorder" (DSD), a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, germ glands (eggs or testicles) or unusually developed genitals.
Wallis Simpson may have been intersexual.
The understanding of gender identification is still not very well developed, but most experts in the U.S. recommend using the best available information for gender allocation, if a provision is not possible, and not waiting for the psychological and physical development of the child before – if any – deciding for an operation.
The New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specialized in the problem of gender identification, said that the new German law "sounds after a good thing".
Intersexual children are an ethical dilemma.
"Some people have life-threatening diseases that require surgical surgery, but most children do not," he said.
You can make a sex assignment without surgery and then wait for identity to develop.
The scientific data about how a child develops his gender identity at all are not very accurate.
Nobody knows why it's happening.
It's like the secret why people are homosexual.
A 2011 report to the European Commission states that intersexual people are to be distinguished from transsexual or transgender persons, because their status is not gender-related, but due to their biological constitution, which is neither male nor female, but typically both at the same time, or not clearly defined as one of them.
These characteristics have been shown in subordinate sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hairing, breasts and stature, priority sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals or in chromosome structures and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of discrimination which is subject to intersexal and transgender persons in professional life, as well as of the extent of harassment, violence and prejudice crime.
Boys who do not correspond to the sex image now have a special camp.
In Australia and Nepal, it is now possible to indicate male, female or third sex on official documents.
In June, Australia's Norrie May-Welby (52) was recognized as the world's first "sex" person after a court had granted the life-long maintenance of a "undetermined" sexual status.
In addition to M and W, German ID cards will have a third assignment, X for intersexual, according to the Interior Ministry.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a news message on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French MPs of the strict Catholic country signed a petition to remove "Gender Theory" from school books.
The American site Catholic Online has also voted against German law, on the grounds that "if the world is torn into a new state, where gender is a decision, but sexual activity is not, then we are twisting two more pillars of civilization."
The mother of a newborn from Maryland told baby zone that it would be better if babies were assigned a sex at birth.
"The parental existence is already stressful enough without further restrictions, especially if one does not know the sex of one's own child," she said to the parent website.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children born with both male and female genders were referred to as hermaphrodites, according to the attractive Greek God who had both sexes.
Ten years ago, medicine considered the sex to be something that could be erased and then rebuilt.
But in the meantime, the ethical foundations of an operation are doubted, after now it is known how complex the gender identity is, and that doctors can also be wrong, because they do not know how the child feels when growing up with the gender assigned by them.
“In the middle of the 20th century, it was called a ‘psychiatric emergency’,” said Drescher.
When such a child was born, you did not call the psychiatrist, but the surgeon.
The ruling theory about the treatment of children with inconspicuous genitals goes back to Dr. John Money from Johns Hopkins University, who expressed the view that the sex is formal.
He coined the concept of "sex identity" and argued social and environmental offenses – as parents raise a child – interacted with the genes and hormones of a child, emphasizing whether a person is a male or a female.
But in a case known as "John/Joan" from 1966, his theories became controversial.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been separated from the child at a time of customization, to castrate the child completely and remove his testicles and then raise it as a girl.
"Money presented this case as a successful example of a transformation, which he was not," said Drescher.
When the boy was about 15, he returned to the male gender and married a woman.
At 38 he committed suicide.
According to Drescher, there are still doctors who would practice this model.
However, in the 1990s, with the introduction of the Internet, survivors of these sex operations have approached the public who are "not happy with the result".
For example, at Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old author from Montana, born with XY male chromosomes, but two-digital geniuses.
The doctors were not clear about whether he had a great clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never lead a "satisfying life" as a man.
So his external organ and testicles were surgically removed shortly after the birth of 1976 and he was raised as a girl.
At the age of 12, he received female hormones.
“I knew I wasn’t a girl,” he told ABCNews.com
I was unhappy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he should be given a vaginal plastic.
But since he was depressed and knew something was wrong, he demanded his medical records.
What he found out was shocking.
I was sterilized at my birth – and no one ever told me that.
Bruce was born with a DSD through which his body could not produce enough testosterone for the development of the genitals.
After learning the truth, he returned to male identity, received testosterone injections and had his breasts removed.
The operation has made him barren.
Today, he fights for others in an organization called Interface Project to see intersexual people as normal.
However, Anne Tamar-Mattis, managing director of the legal group Advocates for Informed Choice, is concerned that the German law can "encourage for stamping and stigmatizing".
“Many activists are concerned that the German decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and assign a ‘undetermined’ to the child,” she said.
We are afraid that intervention will be beneficial.
We think it would be better to assign the male or female sex and then wait.
But we still do not know how the law will affect us, so we can only speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said that her organization supports the Australian law, because "it allows adults to be recognized as third sex".
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal gender," she said.
The German law concerns the assignment at birth.
This is not a fight to force little children at that time.
When they are grown up, they can decide for themselves about their bodies.
But Dr. Arlene Barenz, a breast radiologist from Pittsburg who has a daughter with a sexual differentiation disorder and supports hundreds of others in a self-help group, says the German law "competent" both parents and children.
Katie, the daughter of Baraz, was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called complete androgen resistance.
Because of the recipe order of the target cells for testosterone, Katie developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus and no ovaries.
Today Katie is 29 and married; she works at the University of Pennsylvania as an employee in the psychiatry.
Although it is infertile, it hopes to be able to have a child through adoption or a caretaker.
"The law gives parents room, so they don't have to make overcrowded decisions," said Baraz.
It gives them time to make different tests and clarify things and gives them time before they write "male" or "female".
In this way everything is fine – you raise the child and love it.
You have a wonderful baby and enjoy the parent's happiness.
And you don't have to make an operation too fast, which can no longer be reversed.
"This includes the children in the decision and eliminates the fear that parents are relocating because they think they would not do the right thing," she explained.
Finally, the child decides about the gender that is better suited to him – and that is wonderful.
This enables children to make the decision themselves.
Unknown hurt girls by car shot
The unknown injured a twelve-year-old in Saxony-Anhalt in case of gunshots from a car.
The perpetrators were probably fired in Genthin on Thursday evening with an air pressure weapon on a group of children.
That's what the police in Burg told me.
The girl was easily injured on the left-hand carte.
Rescue forces took the girl to the hospital.
The shot came from a small car that had passed a group of six children and had suddenly stopped.
Witnesses saw two people sitting in the car.
The perpetrators also shot at a bus stop.
A disc broke.
Then they drove away.
The criminal police found it on Friday.
Until now, the police inspection of Kempten can look back on a quiet Halloween night.
The officials were called only twice to ecstatic children who threw them against house facades.
Since the homeowners recognized this in time and immediately removed the egg remains, no material damage may have occurred either.
Furthermore, some Sylvesterböller were also inflamed in the city area, but there was no material damage here either.
An resident in the Bishop-Freundorfer-Weg reported that his car was wrapped with clopapier and that his radizierblenden were removed.
Until the police arrived, however, the man found his bike blends in the immediate vicinity, so the police did not have to continue to work.
Living with a future perspective
Actually, Waltraud Ries lives dreamily.
Your house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with lots of greenery, an old tree stock, nice neighbors and not too much traffic.
In the city it is only a few minutes by public transport.
"Do you hope you don't fear spiders?" asked Waltraud Ries, pointing to a fat spider on the door frame.
I've been looking for a new apartment for my husband and me for some time.
But you know how difficult this is in Stuttgart.
The reason, however, is not a spider phobia, but the concern of not being able to cope with the many stairways to the house and the apartment at the age, explains it.
In addition, since a meniscus operation, the mid-fifties have had to experience their own body, which means moving from floor to floorwork with handicap.
Recently, a book was published by her on the topic 'Happy Living in Age - What residence form is the best for me?'.
'Our apartment is the best example of what's not going on in old age', she begins to tell.
When she moved with her husband more than 20 years ago into the Maisonette apartment, it was just a beautiful apartment in the middle of the greenery.
Today at mid-fifty, Waltraud Ries thinks differently about it.
She also knows, however, that she is one of the few people who deal with the topic of living in old age at all.
Most of them do it as long as it goes.
Old always only the others', she says flattering.
Only when the pressure of suffering is really great do you think.
"But it can be too late," says Ries.
In her book, the interior architect presents 17 residential models for self-determined living at age.
'What kind of home you choose, however, is always an individual decision', she explains.
There was no solution for old age.
Even those who could afford to live in Tuscany or Brittany should always think that they could also get sick.
And: 'Without good knowledge of the local language, one is also united in the Dolce Vita,' says the specialist book author.
Among their models are classic care models, alternative housing forms or the often cited Rentner WG.
In old age, everyone has such ticks and maces
'For me, however, such a living community would be nothing,' she says with an eyewinker.
Not at all like in a student WG with a shared bathroom and a kitchen.
'In old age, you just need your retreat rooms,' says Ries.
Nevertheless, the book author does not want to exclude that a senior community can work anyway.
But this had to be different from the classical Student WG.
And sometimes you just want his rest, she believes.
In this opinion, it is not alone in the capital of the state.
'Most old people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own home', is also the experience of Theresa Rütten, the head of civil service life at the age of the state capital.
Their department advises people about the topic of 'being older'.
For this reason, especially older people would often also buy inconvenientities and limitations, just to stay in their usual environment, which is also the experience of the Stiftung Warentestest.
Today, there are many ways to make the house or the apartment barrier free.
Ries recommends that all those who are concerned with the age-related conversion of their home or their home should first inform themselves thoroughly and not commission the first best craftsman.
Today, there are also specialists for the age-appropriate conversion.
Even in the rental apartment let one or another realize this, and if it is just the toilet seat increase, the interior architect clears up.
But not always can the existing apartment be changed age-friendly and therefore accessible, even if it is still so beautiful.
This experience had to make Waltraud Ries.
It is possible to install a stairway within the apartment, which would also be paved with stairs up to the door of the apartment, but this would be far greater obstacle.
She will continue to search until she finds the ideal object for herself and her husband.
Before moving, she is more gray than before the spider at her door of residence.
USA wants to continue to prosecute Snowden on criminal law
The US has not changed its attitude as former U.S. intelligence officer Edward Snowden.
He will continue to be accused of unauthorised disclosure of secret information.
So he had to file a criminal trial in the US, said the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs, Jennifer Psaki, in Washington.
The most recent statements by Snowden would not change this either.
Previously, after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow, German Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele had appealed to the US not to threaten him with punishment.
Psaki stressed that in the case of Ströbele's statements, it was about a parliamentarian and not that of a German government member.
Secret Service Cover Edward Snowden is basically ready for a conversation with German authorities.
First, however, he wants to know his situation clearly.
This has made clear to the former NSA employee, who was sought by the US, in a letter not addressed, which the Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele published on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and forwarded to the Federal Government, Bundestag and General Federal Prosecutor.
This letter, after a translation by Ströbele, has the following wording:
To the competent authorities
I was asked to write to you about your mass surveillance investigation.
My name is Edward Joseph Snowden, and I used to be engaged in a contract or a direct job as a technical expert at the National Security Agency (NSA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) of the United States.
In the course of my work in these institutions, I became a witness to systematic violations of my government, which led me to act out of moral duty.
As a result of the publication of these concerns, I saw myself exposed to a serious and persistent hetze that forced me to leave my family and my home.
I currently live in exile and enjoy temporary asylum, which the Russian Federation grants to me under international law.
I am encouraged by the response to my political action, both in the US and elsewhere.
Citizens all over the world and also high officials - including the United States - have considered the revelations to be a system of comprehensive surveillance, which no one is accountable for, as a service to the public.
These espionage revelations led many proposals to new laws and directives aimed at the previously concealed abuse of public trust.
The benefits for society from these findings are becoming increasingly clearer, while at the same time the risks acquired have been clearly reduced.
Although the outcome of my efforts has proved to be positive, my government continues to treat this as a break of loyalty and strives to criminalise and sue political opinion.
Nevertheless: Saying the truth is not a crime.
I am confident that, with the support of the international community, the United States Government will take this adverse attitude.
I hope that, if the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been addressed, I will be able to participate in the responsible information of the facts concerning the statements made in the media, in particular with regard to the truth and authenticity of the reports, appropriately and legally.
I look forward to a conversation with you in your country as soon as the situation has been clarified and thank you for your efforts to protect the international law that protects us all.
Edward Snowden testifies by Hans-Christian Ströbele
Kindergarten has found a private buyer
"The building is in good hands," says Winterlingen's mayor Michael Maier.
The former kindergarten in the garden street has sold the municipality to a private person.
The sale was agreed by the municipal council in its last meeting in the non-public part.
The building changed its owner to an "adequate" price.
"The municipality is satisfied", says Maier.
In the household 100 000 euros were employed.
It is not yet clear how the new owner wants to use the former kindergarten.
The mayor is right that Winterlings have handed over the responsibility for the building to someone else before the winter and therefore no longer has to stand up for the entertainment of the house, how to heat up, look at the garden and clear the walkway.
"This effort is now gone," Maier is pleased.
Space Concert at High Summer Temperatures
The Musikverein Hammereisbach gives a square concert on the terrace of the Gasthaus Hammer.
When conductor Bianca Willmann lifts the clock at 7.30 p.m., the thermometer still shows 25 degrees.
About 50 listeners enjoy the sounds of the Hammrich musicians.
The chairman Manuela Honeck explains the pieces of music.
Honeck thanked all those who had helped to successfully cope with the first music shock.
Report: Obama campaign considered replacing bids with Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama's closest advisers have secretly considered replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton in the 2012 election campaign, according to the New York Times.
The revelation is the most remarkable surprise of Mark Halperin and John Heilemann's long-awaited work on the 2012 election campaign, "Double Down: Game Change 2012".
The Times is a copy of the book that is about to appear and reported on Thursday evening that the president's top advisers had conducted "extensive group meetings and surveys at the end of 2011" to find out if Obama's dwindling hope for re-election would be better if he dropped bids.
According to Jonathan Martin, National Political Correspondent of the Times, the book thoroughly traces the history of the efforts of leading employees of the campaign and the White House, namely the former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, to measure the effect it has on the survey values to exchange the former Foreign Minister Clinton against the Vice-President.
The potential change was a strictly guarded secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and in the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen of the President's narrowest advisers – including Daley, former campaign leader Obama, Jim Messina, and the former executive adviser to the White House, David Axelrod and David Plouff – knew about the thoughtful change.
In 'Double Down' it is claimed that Daley had been at the forefront of efforts to exchange bids despite their 'sense, personal circumstances' before finally deciding against such a chess, after the data showed that the candidate Clinton's 'no significant improvement of Obama's chances'.
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the government had actually considered replacing bids with Clinton.
"I said a number of things to consider, and that was one of them," Daley told the magazine.
It must be remembered that the President had terrible survey values at that time, so we thought, "For God's sake, what do we do?"
While Daley referred to the investigations as 'proposed care', Martin told Anderson Cooper of CNN that during the campaign, considerable effort had been made to re-election to find out whether such a train was paying off in relation to the electoral tournaments.
"In campaigns, not so much money is spent on surveys and focus groups, if you don't think seriously about something," said Martin on AC360.
However, it is not clear whether Obama knew that his team was thinking about an exchange.
Martin told CNN that he had asked Daley if his former boss knew about the potential change.
Although Daley said that he did not believe that the president was "conscious", the former Chief of Staff admitted that Obama had known about it.
Martin added that "Double Down" did not give a definite answer to the question whether the political explorations had reached Obama's desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought Obama had no knowledge of whether to drop bids during the elections.
"Possible", replied Martin.
What happens to my email on the way?
E-mail is actually electronic mail.
Was e-mail implemented in the design of the Internet service in the same way as in conventional mail the secret of the letter was technically implemented?
In the design of early Internet services, the main focus was on making communication possible.
Therefore, the basic technical protocols have not been taken into account in creating a stable basis for an ear-proof exchange of letters.
Therefore, a traditional e-mail corresponds to an open postcard rather than a sealed letter.
When user "Anna" sends an email to "Benni", the computers of the two are connected directly?
In the first step, the email program or the browser of Anna sends the mail to the mail server of their service provider.
For example, if it had a Gmail account, it would be Google.
This mail server sends the content to the provider who uses Benni.
On the route, the mail can run over a number of other servers on the Internet.
Bennie can then call the content with his provider.
Will conventional emails be read through the web on their way?
Most emails are read several times on the way by software robots.
With the sender's provider, it is usually checked whether the mail carries a malicious program as an attachment.
A virus check is also carried out on the receiver systems.
In addition, providers will check whether it is a annoying and unwanted spam mail that is deleted immediately or at least sorted out in a spam folder.
Do the robots have another task?
In systems such as GMail, the robot also determines the information that Google needs to place contextal advertising.
If Anna and Benni communicate via GMail about their upcoming holiday trip, Google can show links to holiday offers.
Do unknown people also read the emails?
The likelihood that unauthorized persons will read a mail is extremely low.
But this is theoretically possible.
In companies, administrators often have the opportunity to read electronic mail.
The law enforcement authorities and intelligence services also have legal means to intercept or take notice of e-mails.
To this end, possible illegal decoupling actions are needed.
Is it possible to protect emails from co-reading?
With an encryption according to the OpenPGP standard, an e-mail can be effectively encrypted against co-reading.
With a high technical effort, it is also possible to mask the metadata of an e-mail communication, so that it is not even possible to recognize anyone who communicates with who.
How important are Yahoo and Google on the e-mail market in Germany?
According to a Convios Consulting study of August 2013, Yahoo and Google play only a minor role in the main privately used mailboxes.
While the shares of Yahoo mail had last fallen, GMail was able to increase significantly from Google.
Mother in the Forest Arrested and Pensioned
When his father died, a man from Wolfsburg forged a plan.
He buried the dead in a forest - and continued to cash her pension and care allowance.
In order to continue to cash pensions and care allowance, a 67-year-old Wolfsburger buried his dead mother after investigations by the police in the forest.
First, he covered up the death of the 89-year-olds, then he spent more than a year and a half.
Now the 67-year-old has to answer for fraud, as one speaker said on Friday.
After that, the man hid the woman in a forest near Helmstedt.
The man was suspected already in May: At that time it was noticed that medications were no longer needed for the mother in need of care.
The pensioner told the investigator that his mother had traveled to Spain.
Because this was strange to officials, they continued to determine.
It came out that the two had lived in a common home for more than 15 years and he had last cared for it.
The 67-year-old finally admitted the death of his mother.
According to police, an observation did not show any evidence of a capital crime.
You want ice cream that shines in the dark?
A British entrepreneur has developed the first ice in the dark – with the help of torments.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of the marine animals and created a shining licking plant.
The idea came to him after he had read a research on torments and was able to convince Chinese scientists to produce the shining protein artificially.
The ice cream reacts when consumed with the tongue, which increases the pH in the protein and triggers the lighting.
Chris explains that the ice cream reacts to the heat in the mouth and shines – the more you lick, the brighter it becomes.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company "Lick Me I'm Delicious", says: "The product is incredible, but still in a very early production phase, and thus you get two grams of it for 200 pounds."
The protein used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue at a neutral pH.
When the mouth warms up the protein, the pH and the ice shines.
We have tested it in the last few months and it seemed ideal to bring it to the market on Halloween because it has this wonderful lighting effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever made, because the torture fluorescent is four times more expensive than gold.
Every bullet costs me about 140 pounds.
But it tastes delicious.
Charlie's experimental company based in Bristol is famous for its unusual flavors, including beer, cheese, beef and leaf gold.
But his latest creation is to become even more ambitious.
He says, "I want to develop an invisible ice cream."
This is not possible in itself because of the light cracking caused by the ice crystals, which consists of ice cream; but I suspect we will find a way to create it.
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a torture produced by Chinese scientists
The TSV Morsum is still in the handball league after six days of playing.
Now, for the team of Ingo Ehlers, it will be the Derby against the TSV Daverden, who celebrated his first victory last weekend.
With this game the season starts new for us.
"I hope that we finally have our head free," Ehler's behavior is optimistic.
At last, with the exception of the permanently injured Henry Blohme, he has available his complete cadre.
Also, Daverden puts us at the pace of the game.
That is why we must keep our error rate low.
In the first place, however, it is important to increase in the coverage, which has left everything but a safe impression.
Daverden's Coach Thomas Panitz is more relaxed after the first win of the season against Nordhorn.
The game was of course a house number.
But that's why we're not the favorite for a long time, because in Derby, everything can always happen.
However, Panitz now wants to search in Morsum to start a series.
Missing will Jan-Malte Jodat.
For this, the A-Youth Joost Windß, who is active in the A-Youth-Bundesligist HC Bremen, celebrates his season debut.
Whoever isn't hot in a game is supposed to stay at home.
Halloween 2013: Figures
When I was little, Halloween had something magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat sweets, stop late and dress up for the neighborhood.
Today I've become a Halloween muffle.
In the last two years, I have not been willing to distribute from my home of sweets, and I am sure I will not do it this year.
But according to statistics, I'm a black sheep, as far as Halloween is concerned.
The majority of Americans – 158 million to be accurate – celebrate Halloween this year and spend a total of 6.9 billion US dollars on sweets, costumes and decorations, according to the US-American Association of Retailers (NRF).
One thing I look forward to every Halloween then again is the trend values.
The costumes will account for about 1.2 billion of the 6.9 billion U.S. dollars spent, according to the NRF.
This year, exciting unimpressed objects are the last scream.
Women no longer need to cover themselves in sexy clothes, they can now also embody seductive food such as pizza, hamburgers or carrots.
As for men, I expect a lot of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead, and I bet the Daff-Punk spacemen will create it in the Instagram feeds this year.
According to Google, the most sought-after costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I guess there's nothing wrong with tradition.
We dressed our dogs last year and were not alone to my astonishment.
In fact, Americans spend 330 million dollars this year for costumes of their pets, says the NRF.
That's a lot of hot dogs.
As far as sweets are concerned, we're not mild.
Americans will spend 1.9 billion dollars this year, says The Nielsen Company.
That's about 270 million kilograms of chocolates, lugs, candys and rubber braids.
So good news for the US Department of Commerce, 41 million people who move through the quarters with the saying "Sütes or Saures".
In fact, we will buy over 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and – do nothing – eat.
The only thing we don't want to consume is sugar sweet Candy Corn, but 15 million kilograms of it are sold around Halloween, according to the National Association of Confectionery Manufacturers.
That's about nine billion corn grains.
It's a mystery I couldn't solve yet.
Nothing more belongs to Halloween than houses where it spits.
They have great names such as "Terror Behind the Walls" (which, by the way, is in a real prison), "Howl-O-Scream" and "The House of Shock".
There are actually 1,200 officially recognized locust houses in the United States that achieve 500 million dollars of proceeds, says America Haunts, and this includes the wonderful photos on which you peck in your pants right now and then place the friends on Facebook, where you don't get rid of them again, and one of the type you're standing on is left with a comment like "new facial expression".
But let's finally get to the pumpkins.
Charlie Brown made us familiar with the big pumpkin when we were children, and the carving of a pumpkin later is like the adornment of the Christmas tree – something we have made up of small.
Fortunately, the “baby in the pumpkin” trend started only last year thanks to Pinterest, so that most of us grew up to cut the pumpkin and not to sit in it.
This year, Americans will spend about 106 million dollars on pumpkins, according to the US Census Bureau.
The pumpkin latrine, which slowly rotts in the front garden, probably comes from Illinois, where this year 245 million kilograms of pumpkins were harvested.
If you want to score correctly, then call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California and cut something nice from their 921 kilo heavy pumpkin.
Housing fire in Helmet: rescue forces mountain carbonated bodies
The fire brigade had to get out of Helmbrechts on the late Thursday evening.
A three-family house in the district of Hof catches fire in the night to Friday.
The rescue forces store a cooled body from the house.
Rescue forces have found a carbonized body in a three-family house during a fire in Helmbrechts.
Whether it's a resident's business is still unclear, as a police spokesman in Bayreuth said.
On the late Thursday evening it had burned on the ground floor of the house.
When the fire brigade came in, the flames already beat out of a window.
The forces went into the apartment and found the body in a room.
This and another room were completely burned out.
The entire ground floor was damaged.
All other residents were not at home during the fire, the police officer continued.
The building was not inhabitable for the first time.
The exact cause of the fire was not clear at first.
Germany's largest national church has launched an offensive to recruit for the profession of the pastor.
The background is a possible lack of pastors: the Evangelical Lutheran Church Hannover expects the number of their current 1,800 pastors to be halved by 2030.
For young people today, the profession is very attractive and offers good prospects for the future, said Pastor Mathis Burfien (43) in conversation with the Evangelical Press Service.
It is attractive to be able to determine the work and day process itself.
With Burfien the Landeskirche has for the first time commissioned a pastor in a full place to inspire young people to study theology.
At present, fewer and fewer young people choose to study theology after the Abitur.
Burfien leads this back to the ecclesification process: "God's voice is quiet, the world is loud".
The profession was characterized by great freedom and diversity.
I am a member of my calendar and can place my priorities where it is important to me.
Pastors could be very close to people as soul caretakers.
They deserved as much as teachers and could live well.
Of course, more will be paid in the free economy, but theologians would have a safe employer.
This comes to the young people of today who are not only concerned with careers but about a meaningful work.
According to the Landeskirche, which comprises three quarters of Lower Saxony, about 60 pastors are retiring each year.
At the same time, about 40 graduates of a theology study begin their vicariate.
In thinly populated peripheral areas such as the resin, the Emsland or the Wendland, it could become difficult to occupy places in the future.
Burfien wants to organise study days for young people and also invite celebrities who have studied theology.
Theology studies offer a wide range of training.
You can even become President of the Federal Republic of Germany.
Land Rover Rally Series announced
In the interior there are racing seats and six-point belts as well as a free speech system.
The options range from reinforced brakes, a service package with support from bowler-works mechanics and logistical support to vehicle storage between events.
Drew Bowler, Managing Director of Bowler Motorsport, explains: "The Rally customers who come to Bowler have changed."
They are not all experienced racing drivers, but people who are looking for tension and adventure, as well as for a accessible path to world-class events.
We are pleased to be able to open this way in partnership with Land Rover and MSA and believe that the format opens up new opportunities to experience the various rally disciplines in the UK and abroad and to prepare new ones for the rhinestones and the reality of Rally Raid.
We really enjoyed developing the Defender Challenge-Wagen – this will be an entertaining championship.
In addition, there is a training and testing day at the Defender Challenge in February as well as the option to take part in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
Fire brigade called for the rescue of a little dog that stuck 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous rock ledge in a quarries
Cockerpaniel-Hündin Ruby had escaped after a minor traffic accident
Three days later she was discovered by a walker in the quarries in her misplaced location
Fire fighters sailed off rock wall and rescued the dog from safe death
The fire brigade succeeded in bringing a little dog to safety, which stuck on a 15-metre - high ledge in a rock wall.
The nine-month-old Cockerpaniel-Hündin Ruby had run away after a traffic accident on Sunday afternoon and survived for three days alone before being saved from a quarries on Wednesday.
Scott Alderson, 25, and his friend Becky Hall, 20 of whom the dog belongs, came to the Flappit Stone Break in Denholme, West Yorkshire to take Ruby back in and thank the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service firemen.
They had desperately searched for their missing bitch and published help calls on social networks when she had escaped to the quarries after the small traffic accident.
About 14:15 a.m. on Wednesday saw a walker performing his dog, the stranded Ruby on the 15 meter high heel in the quarries.
The Cleckheaton Fire Station's technical rescue team rushed to the spot, sailing to rescue Rubys, which was then transported up in a dog box.
Andy Clayton, specialist of the technical rescue team, said: “She was in a dangerous situation.
It was located in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from the top and the ground.
She did not move muscle during her rescue – she was like stiff-frozen.
But now she's fine.
She ate a couple of dog cakes after that.
That was a rather unusual use.
The fact that the dog was discovered is incredible.
Peter Lau, specialist in the technical rescue team, said: "Ruby had a big luck."
There was the possibility that she was very seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was brought to the veterinarian for examination, but he did not detect anything except exhaustion and dehydration.
Becky Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: "It was frightening to watch the rescue."
I couldn't believe she was really up there.
It was wonderful to keep her back in the arms.
The veterinarian explained that if the exhaustion had become too large and it had collapsed, it would probably have crashed.
The firemen have done great things.
It was really brave what they did.
We are just so grateful and each of them was absolutely incredible.
Scott Alderson from Keighley added: "We were afraid she would fall down, but she remained up."
The firemen were great.
I can't believe where she was.
Mick Jagger says he never touched Katy Perry when she was 18.
In an interview with an Australian radio station this week, Pop star said she had worked as a background singer to Jagger's song "Old Habits Die Hard" from 2004.
Perry said that she ate with the old rocker and that "he attacked me when I was 18.
She added: "It's been a long time and he was very kind to me."
In a statement, a representative named Jagger, 70, said on Thursday that he "categorically denied that he had ever tried to approach Katy Perry".
The representative added: "Maybe she confused him with someone else."
Perry was one of the singers who had a guest appearance during the Rolling-Stones tour this year.
Her new album "Prism" landed on track 1 this week.
George Kerevan: European unbundling gives Scottish people the choice
A new day, a new horror story on independence.
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland is required to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership.
This provides the keyword for stories about pass controls in Berwick and a border secured with barbed wire along the Hadrian Wall.
In fact, the Strathclyde template pointed out the potential economic benefits that would bring more freedom of travel in the rest of Europe, but this – as expected – did not play a role in the headlines.
No one has mentioned that the EU Member States often apply their strict rules when it is more favourable to them.
Since Scotland currently does not belong to the Schengen area, the continued non-compliance for Brussels would be only a small concession in return for what you really want from the Scottish.
So, actually, no story.
And one that has come so far in the years that it already resembles a fossil: The first time I heard the "independence means pass-checking" duck at least 40 years ago.
An interesting point is lost in the constant repetition of this ancient story.
Why should one expect an independent Scotland to dance after the European pipe?
Why exchange the London yoke for Brussels, especially now?
These are the real European news: the great plan for the unification of Europe after the war has been set in motion.
With the euro crisis, the project Europe officially died.
All over the EU, parties gain ground that are hostile to the EU or want to throw the euro on board as a Community currency.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Party of Alternatives for Germany – founded only this year – was able to forget nearly five million votes in the Bundestag election in September and thus effectively banish the Free Democrats (the equivalent to the British Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.
There has always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federalist Europe.
The current economic crisis, however, turns out to be a turning point.
Because of the strict austerity policy imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank in connection with the forced jacket in which the national economy is required by holding on to the single currency, many people believe that the project Europe has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments causing excessive budget deficits – that was only the case in Greece.
Instead, the Eurosystem has committed its members to exchange rates which are beneficial to German exporters – and this is what German politicians would like to do.
Without the possibility of devaluation of the local currency, southern Europe can be found with a built-in productivity disadvantage compared to Germany.
The only possibility is to reduce wages and public spending – inspired by Berlin.
The current problems of budgeting and currency are facing a deeper European problem of productivity.
As a result of the 'green' energy directives, established by Brussels – a code for the subsidisation of French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers – the European industry is paying doubles for electricity and the quadruple for gas compared to the United States.
This is a paralyzing cost disadvantage, as we could already see in Grangemouth.
The European petrochemical industry does not protect all world wage-fixing certificates from being pushed into the corner by cheap American shale gas.
As a result, there is a revolt, especially in France, the former EU Cheerleader.
After the war, France's political elite saw the EU as a vehicle for holding Germany in chess and lifting Paris at eye level with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a gateway to political legitimacy and Europe has expressed its own economic policy, which is the reason for the French economy to fight.
The result: Marine Le Pen's right-wing, EU-enemy Front National has just won a decisive re-election and thus referred the ruling socialists to third place.
The Front National is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of voters – a timely warning for the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that a division in the right spectrum would automatically mean advantages for the left.
What does Le Pen do with its newly acquired popularity among the white French of the working class?
It would like to use EU elections next year to forge an anti-EU, anti-Community currency block in the European Parliament.
If the anti-EU parties in these elections are to be cut off – and this is very possible – then for the first time such a block could dominate the European Parliament.
This is the point I want to put forward: the growing resentment against the EU and the single currency will be combined to abolish the euro in the future.
The EU will not disappear, but it will become more like the 'Europe of (soverish) nations', the General de Gaulle favoured.
Germany and a few of its satellite economies may hold on to the euro, but France and southern Europe will return to their own currencies.
I expect Britain to distance itself from this project in the hope of flattering with the US.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific region suggests that Britain will stand alone in the Atlantic rain.
Where does Scotland stay with all of this?
We can decide to be a region of (in the last consequence) small England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – including telling Berlin and Brussels what they can do.
I think Scotland could go quite well in a looser European union, provided we keep our own currency.
Cooperation with other, similar thinking countries is easier in a non-federal Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should consider paralleling Norway and maintaining our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is – remarkablely – the most successful political movement against austerity policy in Europe and has won a spectacular majority in 2011 due to the rejection of the proposed (and implemented) cuts that Labour Finance Minister Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory-Lib Dem coalition had to answer.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to decide now for independence, only to get a austerity policy imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: Growing Growing Up
Afro-American and hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white-eyed women, as studies show.
Physical changes do not mean puberty directly
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe that epidemic obesity is a trigger of early puberty
The trend towards early puberty is less pronounced in boys
The former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specialises in child health and family topics.
Should a mother be concerned if her daughter is already growing breasts and hair of shame at the age of seven or eight?
At the annual conference of the Association of Paediatrics American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz stated that these early physical changes were relatively normal among American girls and represented a new norm.
"I spend a lot of time calming parents – it's usually not a sign that puberty is entering quickly," Kaplovitz explained.
Clear displays of development, such as growing breasts, cream and axe hair as well as body smell, show up with girls earlier.
Nevertheless, there has been only a slight shift in the age of the Menarche (the occurrence of the first regular bleeding) over the last 40 years.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, slightly less than 12.75 in 1970.
"When the breast development begins, it takes at least two to three years to reach the Menarche," said Kaplowitz, also author of the book " Early Puberty in Girls: The Essential Counsellor to Deal With This Common Problem".
Time is the most accurate test as puberty progresses.
It is controversial what is actually the beginning of puberty, but it is true that the breast enlargement is accompanied by a growth boost before the age of eight years.
In most cases, the process slows down or stagnates – something that a pediatrician can closely monitor.
Tests may be indicated by an endicronologist if progress is made faster, so that serious problems such as tumours or cysts can be ruled out.
There are treatment methods for delaying early menstruation and the defense of another consequence: the premature aging of the bones, which can ultimately cause growth inhibition and thus small body growth in adults.
Recommendations for medical or hormonal therapy orientate at the age of the child, development speed, growth rate and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is reluctant about drugs, but he admits: "The oppression of puberty can relieve behavioral problems and the feelings of girls, unlike their peers."
The other big problem is understandable: parents simply don't want their very young daughters to have the period.
"They worry about the risk of pregnancy or how they handle the hygienic side," said Kaplowitz.
"It was a shock," recalls a woman whose daughter had gotten her days with ten.
Even though there were first signs and we talked about menstruation, she was not emotionally prepared.
She came home scared and excited because she was the first one in her circle of friends.
There are many widely published theories about the causes of early puberty.
But there is no solid evidence that hormones in milk or other food, chemicals in the environment, or sexual messages in the media are originating.
Boys come to puberty like girls used to.
Kaplowitz considers that the most convincing premisse is the epidemic of obesity.
He supported the conduct of a study in 2001 on girls aged between six and nine years, creating a link between body fat and entry into puberty.
Other studies support this conclusion, but there are many other factors that played a role.
In this country, African and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white counterparts.
There are different explanations for this.
Globally, an early puberty seems to be influenced by all kinds of things, from economic conditions over climate to genes.
Another puzzle: Although boys are growing early in their facial and foam hairs, the trend towards a full-scale previous puberty is not as pronounced as with girls.
Other doctors at the AAP conference underlined the complexity of the issue.
The appearance of acne and shawl hair is common even in babies and toddlers.
"We need to be careful about how we identify the true beginning of puberty," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a paediatric endocrinologist at the Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to be advised by their pediatrician about how they should talk to their child.
"This can mean that you have to have a conversation earlier than expected," said Kaplowitz.
If you stay calm, the child usually reacts well.
Girls who bloom early need the insurance that the process is a normal part of life, even if he comes earlier than thought.
Jumbo manufacturers argue over the width of the seat in the face of large orders
Between leading aircraft manufacturers, there has been a conflict over the width of seats in the tourist class on long-haul flights, indicating the tone for a bitter collision on the Dubai Airshow this month.
The dispute revolves around the seating width, which passengers are offered for long flights in the tourist class – not always those to which airlines try the most, but this designated space is the key to the efficiency claims of the latest Airbus SAS and Boeing Co. aircraft.
Airbus demanded an industry standard this week, which prescribes a seat width of at least 46 cm (18 inches) in the tourist class, but the US archrival Boeing says that the airlines should decide.
The dispute comes at a time when the aircraft builders compete to sell even larger versions of their two-engine long-haul flyers, and expect record orders at the event from 17 to 21 November.
As the rear part of the aircraft is designed – in particular if there are rows of nine or ten seats – is crucial for the stated economic results to deliver the new "Mini-Jumbo" design.
Boeing claims that his modernized "777X" has 406 seats in the tourist class, which are over 17 inches wide and thus allow ten per row.
Airbus explains that the competing version of the A350 transported 350 people in 18 inches wide seats in the tourist class, with nine per row.
Aerial giants often distribute information about technical details by means of advertising in the specialist press.
Now Airbus appeals to the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X with over 100 orders is expected to make the race, directly to the public.
Recently, the company presented an advertisement that could be the beginning of a new ad war and showed sponsors a picture in which three people were chatted in a restaurant, and the title: "Would you accept this?"
"Boeing proposes long-haul flights in seats that are narrower than regional turbo-props," says Airbus Sales Director John Leahy.
In view of changed nutrition habits, people are getting thicker, but aircraft seats have not radically changed.
Between the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 defined the modern long distance journey, and the end of the century, the weight of the male average American between 40 and 49 years has increased by ten percent, according to the U.S. Health Ministry data.
According to American health statistics, the male average in the 21st century is 100.8 cm.
Airbus says that its rivals adhere to a seating concept from the 1950s when the average body size of the freshly baptized 'Jet set' was narrower.
According to Airbus, investigations have been carried out which showed that an additional duty (2,54 cm) per seat increased sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing contests Airbus's figures to the sizes of the seats and says that it is not the manufacturer's discretion to decide how airlines can balance flight tariffs and facilities.
According to investigations, the company also explains that the experience in the aircraft depends on more than the width of the seat.
"It is really important to give airlines flexibility so that they can do what they think they need to be successful," explains Kent Craver of Boeing's flight cabin expert.
They don't want us to dictate to them what makes them profitable.
You know her business better than anyone else.
For passengers the issue is more elbow-free, but for manufacturers it will increasingly be a topic that can affect sales.
The challenge lies in a race for aircraft orders with an estimated volume of at least 700 billion US dollars after list prices over the coming decades, which could have a lasting impact on the US or Europe's export balance.
As Reuters reported for the first time in July, the seat layout is the driving force behind the dispute over the new jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim 20 percent more efficiency per seat with their latest two-engine long-distance designs than the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 77-300ER.
The Boeing statements on the results partly depend on the comparison of the 777X with its ten seats per row to the original design of nine seats in the 777.
The increased costs per unit are still lower than for currently used machines with ten seats per row.
"Boeing is therefore having more seats in its aircraft to make it more competitive to our products," says Kevin Keniston, Head of Passenger Comfort at European Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts, full cabins with ten seats per row at existing 777s said that many passengers opted for the narrower arrangement, which could be accompanied by cheaper flight tariffs.
“eighteen inches seat width would be great for passengers, but reality is: from an economic point of view, the Airbus offer is controlled by the threat from the 777,” says Mary Kirby, expert in cabin facilities, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not offer seats, but rather a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines can choose.
The world-traveling jet sellers even carry band sizes to track the establishment in competition.
Even if they price the comfort, all manufacturers also offer jets with high-densification design for low-cost flights and regional flights.
Airbus offers an A350 with ten-seater rows, but according to its own statement it has not sold yet.
Until recently, Airbus stressed the importance of more adaptability of the cabins and offered wide seats on the corridors for some jets.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets, experts say that the reputation for a new industry standard would probably break down, but could divert from the shaft of 777X sales.
New anti-Nicotine vaccine could make the pleasure of smoking the garage
Scientists have developed an anti-Nikotine vaccine that could spoil the fun of smoking.
A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice from nicotine addiction for a lifetime.
More experiments are needed before human testing, which may take a few years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of the Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the first results were good.
"We are very hopeful that this kind of vaccination strategy can help millions of smokers who have tried to stop and experiment with all the methods available on the market, but have had to experience that their nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches," says Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified in such a way that it contains the genetic information for the production of nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then produce a constant stream of antibodies.
The antibodies hunt the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain, whereby a smoker does not experience nicotine high.
In trials, vaccinated mice to which nicotine was administered kept their normal level of activity.
However, mice without vaccination would have taken a "timeout", the researchers explained, a sign that nicotine had reached her brain.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
The vaccinations had to be given so often to maintain the levels of antibodies that they were expensive and impractical.
However, the cost of the new vaccine is probably significantly lower, as it transforms liver cells into antibodies factories.
As Professor Crystal said, a future vaccine for humans, if sure, could be given to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette and thus prevent nicotine addiction.
But it is more likely that smokers would use it to stop.
"You know, when they start smoking again, they feel no pleasure because of the nicotine vaccine, and this helps them to stop habit," he explains.
British scientists said that the results were interesting, but at the same time warned that further research was necessary.
Tripodi disputed having been influenced by obedi
To the former minister of the Labor Party Joe Tripodi from New South Wales, an investigation by the State’s corruption supervision is initiated.
The former NSW minister contests to have changed the rules for the moritim lease on the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who owned hidden holdings in three lands on state-controlled land.
The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC Independent Commission on Corruption) extended its investigations on the question of whether Obeid affected different State ministers to extend lease contracts to the Circular Quay, where the Obeids operate two restaurants and a café, without notice of their expiry in August 2005.
Now, because of the accusation that Tripodi had known of Obeid's hidden interest in the plots after Tripodi's former deputy chieftain Lynne Ashpole had declared accordingly on Thursday.
In years of discussions that began in 2005, the government had pressed for public tendering for lease contracts.
The guards were on the other hand and also wanted longer periods.
In 2009, the lease contracts for the companies at the Circular Quay, which brought the Obeids in every year $2.5 million, were extended without public tendering.
Tripodi, who was port minister from February 2006 to November 2009, originally expressed its support for public procurement.
However, he refused to make the changes on requests from Obeid, who, as Tripodi confirmed, had pressed for a reorganisation of the government's lease schemes.
One of the ICAC’s telephone statements from August to September 2007 showed talks between Obeid, Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had been transferred to the Ministry of the Port after working under the authority of the Fisheries Department.
"Was the subject discussed in these telephone talks the preparation of commercial lease schemes?" asked Deputy Commissioner Anthony Whealy Tripodi.
"No", Tripodi replied.
I don't remember what was discussed, but it definitely wasn't.
By no means between me and Mr Obeid.
Israeli fighters attack target in Syria, so official sources
Israeli fighters attacked a target in the Syrian port of Latakia on Thursday night, confirmed a leading government employee to Fox News.
The official did not explain what was the objective, but said it had been at least one.
According to Associated Press, the target was Russian SA-125 missiles.
At least twice this year, Israel has already carried out air strikes on missile deliveries in Syria.
Foreign workers with 457-visa could be subjected to 'realty test'
The Government is considering an "realty test" for foreign workers with 457 visas within the framework of extended measures.
If the test is introduced, it will be used by means of a criterion designed to prevent the 457 being used for occupying unqualified jobs or as a back door for the move of family and friends to Australia.
Today, a government discussion proposal was published after the former members of the Labor Party, Maxine McKew, had condemned the government's comments with regard to foreign workers, because these could be considered insult by the neighbours of Australia.
“Sudden statements, such as ‘foreigners should stand behind’ and ‘introduce Australians first’ are a far more unpleasant setback in times when trade unions called for a protected labour market,” she said to the Australia India Institute today.
Historically speaking, white workers were to be protected – and if some in the region nagging an echo of this historical artifact, I would not be surprised.
The proposal for a debate outlines twelve measures once envisaged by former immigration minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was talking about human smuggling in Sri Lanka yesterday, has implemented five of the recommended amendments, others are still being considered.
If the 'reality criterion' is taken over, someone requesting a visa could be checked to see if 'the application is real in cases where the applicant is related to the holder or a relevant person of the supporting undertaking'.
Companies could also be obliged to account for the number of 457 visa holders, after in the past, companies that initially wanted to support only a small number of workers have finally recruited hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylumist probably died of a heart attack after arriving this week with a refugee boat on the Christmas Island.
The disturbed nine-year-old son of the man who had come to Australia with him has been cared for by an adult cousin since his father died on Wednesday, who was also on the boat.
Australian authorities took the man to Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
The UK Government announced a study aimed at increasing the advantages of the HS2 railway project for Scotland.
In the work of HS2 Ltd, it is proposed that high-speed connections between Scotland and the north of England be realized as early as the beginning of Phase 1 in 2026.
Minister for Transport Baroness Kramer said that the project 'will bring Britain closer together'.
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was very pleased to work with the British government on this plan.
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed train link between London and the West Midlands.
After the end of Phase 2, there will be connections to Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government corrected the estimated cost of building the high-speed road between London and northern England from 32.7 billion pounds to 42.6 billion pounds.
The UK Government, which is talking with Transport Scotland, has commissioned HS2 Ltd to look for further route capacities and travel time improvements for northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of a journey time of three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
Baroness Kramer said: "Our goal for HS2 is a truly national route network that brings the UK and its cities closer together."
We are moving forward with HS2 because it brings tremendous benefits.
Without it, we are facing a capacity crisis in our railway network.
But it is also about the link between 18 British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which is improved thanks to HS2.
Scottish State Secretary Alistair Carmichael commented: "Today's announcement is a good news for Scotland."
On behalf of the Scottish Government, Keith Brown Carmichael called on 'unmissibly' to work for Scottish integration into the HS2 network.
Brown said: "The high-speed rail link has the potential of enormous economic benefits for Scotland, but at the same time, the economic power of Scotland also provides an argument for fast rail links across the UK."
That is why we are pleased to work as a partner of the British government and examine the options for a high-speed rail link in Scotland, create the benefits for all, and complement the Glasgow-Edinburgh link that the Scottish government is already planning.
I am looking forward to examining the investigation report with the British ministers next year and to taking the next steps together.
Rules on electronic devices in aircraft shall remain in force provisionally in Australia
Australian flight passengers must continue to switch off tablets and smartphones at launch and landing, despite efforts in the USA to loosen the regulations for such devices.
The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) allows US airlines to change their specifications so that passengers can read, watch or play e-books on their devices during critical flight phases, provided they are in "air traffic mode".
During most of the flight, passengers are already allowed to do so, but many people find that they are not allowed to read their e-books when they start and land.
However, Australian companies do not follow any immediate plans to amend their regulations in order to implement the US airlines.
CASA also stated that the announcement would be considered, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical flight phases still apply in Australia.
"Casa does not currently have specific rules on the use of electronic equipment in the aircraft", it has been announced.
The issue is subject to provisions that air carriers must maintain safety at any time, and passengers must follow the safety instructions provided by cabin staff.
Virgin has already had discussions with CASA about the extension of his Wi-Fi entertainment system to flights and stated that one should be open to change, but these should be initiated by the legislator.
"We would welcome a review of the approval of electronic devices by CASA, because we are convinced that this would improve the customer experience after we now (wireless entertainment) offer during the flight," said one speaker.
Qantas stated that the current rules would be kept up to now.
"Our current directives provide that electronic devices should not be used at the start-up and landing stage, and we do not currently have any plans to change that," the company explained.
The FAA regulations apply to US airlines.
However, we are always interested in developments in regulations that can benefit passengers, and will certainly look at the FAA decision and the reasons behind it.
The decision has different effects on US companies depending on the age of the fleet.
They must demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate radio disturbances by mobile devices, and change manuals, training materials, hand luggage programs and customer instruction.
"After an airline has confirmed the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use portable, lighter electronic devices such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at any height," said the FAA.
In rare cases, in poor sight, the crew will show the passengers while landing the equipment off.
The group also recommended that heavier equipment be safely stored under the seat or in the compartments over the seats when it was launched and landed.
In front of the Revierderby against Schalke, co-educated BVB trailers with light rockets for ugly scenes in the Veltins-Arena had provided.
Borussia Dortmund then announced serious consequences.
Before the Friday match of the Football League against the VfB Stuttgart, the ultras responded with a silence - first.
It was an uninhabited, almost already spooky acoustic that offered the viewer until shortly before the start of the Bundesliga game between German vicemaster Borussia Dortmund and VfB Stuttgart in signal Iduna Park.
To be heard were mostly the guests with their singing.
The southern gallery, on the other hand, where the faithfulst of the faithful - and loudest - BVB fans are standing, initially presented themselves extraordinarily silently: no singing, no battle calls.
The pod of the Capo, which otherwise coordinates the joint incite, remained unoccupied.
And at the front on the stand, a big flag with "Section Stadium Prohibition" was sorely waving.
Only as a goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller, as always as the first BVB player to enter the place, burned up short-term jubilation.
When his teammates followed, there was loud singing and wailing scarves - but long ago not everywhere.
There was nothing in the central blocks 12 and 13 of the southern gallery.
Also that stadium speaker Norbert Dickel once again listed the positive experiences of the last days - the victory of Derby, victory over Arsenal, the extension of contract by Trainer Jürgen Klopp - did not provide for celebration laune.
Only five minutes before the appetizer the Capo climbed his podest - and until then with hands tangible tension unfolds in a loud scream, as Dickel as usual asked the mood on the edges in the stadium.
Last but not least, as always, was the southern gallery in the row - and finally again as usual was the loudest place in the stadium.
And at the latest, when the loud call "Derbywinner stands up" came up with the appetizer of the southern gallery, everything was again as always.
The silence before was probably a reaction to the events of the past days.
Immediately before Revierderby at FC Schalke 04, some of the co-operated BVB trailers had light rockets fired into the audience bars and into the square - almost goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller.
The game was delayed due to the chaotic scenes.
BVB-Boss Hans-Joachim Watzke then received the top of Dortmund's ultras in his office - and believe Watzke's words, this was a rather untiring date for the fan representatives.
"There will be massive cuts for the entire ultra-motive movement," the BVB-Boss announced on Thursday evening at a panel discussion in Frankfurt.
As an immediate measure, Watzke prohibited the ultras a choreography for the home game against the VfB Stuttgart.
"I prohibited that," he said.
We cannot give up the zero tolerance policy on pyrotechnics.
In addition, the ultras have been shown various possibilities of punishment - until Tuesday they now have time to choose one.
Otherwise, Watzke says, the BVB will impose a penalty by the end of the next week.
"This is going to be incisive", Watzke assured.
One may be anxious to see how the reactions to the South Tribe then fail.
Pony houses are booming in Singapore, as the crisis has arrived in the middle class
In a pledged house in the shopping center of Bendemeer in Singapore, Janani Amirtzleinga trades a golden bracelet, a ring and a pair of earrings in order to pay the school fees of their daughters.
"My husband and I just bought a house, there's all my money in it," says Amirttzuela.
Although she earned 3,000 Singapore dollars each month (about 1.730 euros) as an administrative employee and also worked for her husband, she explains the monthly family income.
In fact, demand in parts of Southeast Asia – where household debt increases – is so high that ValueMax, where she has made her exchange, became the third pledge house listed on the Singapore Exchange this week.
The pledge of jewelry is not only a quick way to get money – 1,300 Singapore dollars in the case of Janani Amirtzinga – but also almost as cheap as an unsecured bank loan.
Typically, mortgage houses in Singapore require an effective annual interest rate of 17 percent, which is just over 15.4 percent that the United overseas Bank demands, a local lender with a branch in the same shopping center.
However, mortgage houses offer the advantage that there is no need to verify creditworthiness or income evidence, which is why loans are possible faster than banks.
For this reason, millions of people in the region are turning to farms after families feel the pressure from increasing living costs as well as increasing household and consumer debt.
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap loans due to a looser financial policy in the developed economic areas, families with lower and medium-sized incomes are looking for peat houses to compensate for the difference in the dwindling economy.
This week, the rating agency Standard & Poor's growing household debt, mainly due to rising mortgages, was a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore, according to the Agency, have the highest budgetary debt in Asia in relation to the gross domestic product.
Malaysia is at the top of the list with 80 percent of GDP, an increase of 60 percent still in 2008.
Economics are also concerned because of the high consumer debt in Thailand, which has come out of a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, the data showed an ongoing export weakness and a decrease in consumer demand.
“In the final effect, this means that in view of increasing costs, people in the middle to lower segments (the income scale) will try to supplement their income wherever possible,” says Song Seng Wun, economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historically high gold prices in the last two years have increased the trend towards the confiscation of personal objects, as people take the opportunity to turn family jewelry into cash.
In Singapore, about 70 percent of pledged items are in the 200 panthouses of the state of gold.
People say: "The gold price looks good, let's pacify us grandma's gold chain and get back next month."
The largest Thai pan-house operator, EasyMoney, has experienced a 20 percent increase in customers in its branches in recent months.
The growth in the pledge business is so strong that ValueMax, operator of the Bendemeer branch and 15 more in Singapore, not only wants to expand to neighboring Malaysia – where the company operates four houses – but also outside Asia, says Yeah Lee Ching, Managing Director of ValueMax.
The company finances the 60 percent of Singapore Dollar, which it took this week with the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some creditors have gone into the crossfire due to high interest rates, Yeah explains that mortgage houses not only offered cheaper interest than other lenders, but also did not directly increase debt.
"Customers borrow items they already own, and the liquidation of personal assets does not increase household education," she explains.
The mortgage business is increasingly accepted as short-term financing in society.
Also, not all people who use mortgages are in financial difficulties.
Rich people from Singapore also come to the ValueMax branches to pledge gold bars and Rolex watches, for which they receive up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash.
To us customers come from every social strata.
"This includes affluents who lend something for a business or investment in the short term, or small companies that have to bridge bottlenecks in cash flow," says Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
NSA collects data from Google and Yahoo - Snowden wants to help
Edward Snowden's intelligence revealer has a fundamental interest in helping Germany in clarifying the ever-increasing NSA spheres.
Following the presentation by Hans-Christian Ströbele, a member of the Greens-Bundestag, he was concerned by his surprising meeting with Snowden in Russia, under which conditions ex-Secretary staff would testify to a German prosecutor or before an investigation committee.
Snowden referred to his complicated legal situation, Ströbele said to the ARD magazine "Panorama".
rescue package over 325 million Australian dollars for Tasmanian health care
The Australian government insists on the harsh conditions associated with the rescue package of over 325 million Australian dollars for Tasmanian health care to ensure that the government of the state cannot waste the money.
Federal Minister for Health Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth will take 'unfavourable measures' to avoid a crisis caused by an ageing population of the island state, a higher rate of chronic diseases and system restrictions.
The funding for a four-year period was decided after government consultations with independent Tasmanian Member Andrew Wilkie.
"The government has launched an emergency rescue package that, in our opinion, addresses the unique challenges facing the state," said Plibersek today.
The 3.5 million dollar package includes 31 million dollars of emergency aid for electoral services.
Other 2,600 operations, including orthopaedic procedures and treatments due to grey star, are intended to eliminate residues.
In addition, there is money for day clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better aftercare after stationary stays, the specialist training, mental health services and the introduction of a system for electronic record of health data in local hospitals.
"These investments are in line with the ideas I have been told by the clinical staff concerned that they are the best way to improve the Tasmanian health system," said Tanya Plibersek.
The Minister insisted on a strict reporting and accountability obligation of the Tasmanian government.
The state had to maintain the current level of financing in order to obtain money from the Commonwealth and report monthly on where the additional funds were spent.
A three-member Commission will be set up to ensure that the state provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible.
As Wilkie said today, the 325 million dollars would be of little use if "they were not accompanied by real reforms that bring the public Tasmanian health system to a more sustainable course."
However, he praised the government for responding to his request for urgent assistance, which he expressed first to the Prime Minister at the beginning of May.
"I am confident that federal aid will make a big contribution to removing the state's public health system from the list of concerns," said Wilkie.
According to the Government of the State, these elections will largely make the most of the recent cuts.
However, Peter Dutton, the health spokesman for the opposition at the federal level, believes that today's announcement is just a 'flaster solution'.
"We are therefore in a position today because the Labor State Government has deducted 430 million dollars from the health system," he said to ABC TV.
It can't be that a state government pulls almost half a billion dollars out of the system and puts the Commonwealth 300 million in and then pretends to be good news.
Dutton asked Plibersek to ensure that not one dollar of the rescue package for additional bureaucracy was spent.
Guillaume Nicloux' adaptation of Denis Diderot's novel convinces with exceptional production equipment and contemporary details, however, is also heavier than necessary.
The story of Suzanne, a young noble who is sent to the monastery by her family in France in the 1760s, tells the moving story of her family.
As she rebels, she is confronted with the extreme cruelty of an extremely sadistic superior and becomes the object of erotic fascination of another.
The film never slips into laziness or sensational lust – and that's where its problem lies.
The solemn seriousness with which the film is told also makes it a tortured dungeon for the audience.
Syria has destroyed its ability to produce chemical weapons, such as a monitoring group
Syria has destroyed important chemical weapons and poison gas munitions facilities, the global chemical weapons surveillance group declared on Thursday, while severe collisions occurred in the north of the country near one of the sites where potentially toxic substances are stored.
Also on Thursday, a Syrian activist group announced that more than 120,000 people had been killed three years ago since the start of the civil war.
The announcement of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) arrived one day before the date on which the
1 November, which the The Hague-based organisation had set up Damascus to destroy or "inoperable" all facilities for the manufacture of chemical weapons, including all machines for mixing chemicals to poison gas and filling ammunition.
The completion of this process, which is basically the first stage of destruction, is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable aimed at the destruction of all Syria's chemical weapons by mid-2014.
The destruction of the facilities means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
Damascus, however, still has to start destroying the existing weapons and supplies.
According to estimates, there are about 1,000 tonnes of chemicals and weapons in the country, including mustard gas and the nerve gas Sarin.
The announcement came at a time when fighting took place in the city of Safira on Thursday, experts say there was a chemical weapon production facility and warehouses, as the UK-based Syrian Human Rights Observatory reported.
The group of activists who followed the number of dead through a network of activists in Syria stated on Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
Of these, 61,067 were civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the side of the government, 29.954 of them belonged to the army of President Bashar Assad that 18.678 were government-friendly fighters and 187 Lebanese Hisbollah militias.
Also among the dead were 2.202 deserted army soldiers and 5.375 fighters of the opposition, many of them foreigners.
On July 25, the UN estimated the number of dead in this conflict to 100,000 since March 2011.
This number has not been updated yet.
The conflict has forced about two million people to flee the country.
Assad's troops have been fighting in Safira for weeks against the rebels, many of whom have connections with al-Qaida groups.
The Observatory said there were losses on both sides on Thursday, but did not mention any details.
The battle underscores the danger posed by chemical weapons inspectors, for their mission to liberate Syria from its toxic arsenal is a race against the time in the midst of a violent civil war.
According to OPCW, which works closely with the United Nations, the team "is now convinced that it has seen and experienced all the major production and mixing/filling facilities mentioned by Syria."
Therefore, 'no further inspection activities are currently planned.'
At the beginning of the week, inspectors had declared that they had completed the first round of inspections and visited 21 out of 23 of the sites indicated by Damascus.
Because of security concerns, the inspectors said that the visit of two facilities was not possible.
On Thursday, the OPWC declared that the two sites had been "opened up ... and that the existing objects of the chemical weapons programme had been moved to other specified facilities that were inspected."
It was not immediately clear whether the site in Safira was one of the two facilities that the OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has submitted a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which will have to be approved by the OPWC Executive Committee next month.
"I draw the hat from the bravery and the courage that you have shown in fulfilling the most challenging mission ever carried out by this organization," said Ahmed Uzumcu, the Director-General of the Monitoring Organisation, in a comment published by OPCW.
For three years now, the mainly Sunni Muslim rebels have been fighting against Assad's government and its security forces, many of which belong to the Alawites, a separation of Shiite Islam.
With regard to further developments, the head of the observation group, Rami Abdurrahman, said there had been a strong explosion on Wednesday in an air defense facility in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion was not known, he explained.
Anger About Judgment of Bombenlagen von Bali
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people who were killed in Bali in 2002 responded annoyedly about the judgment of the last instigator, who was brought before court, because Umar Patek was to be shot by law.
Patek, who was fleeing Southeast Asia for almost ten years as one of the most-fed persons, was sentenced to 20 years in prison for his role in building explosives for the bombing.
He could be released after 15 years with impunity.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder because of the attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, where 202 people died, including 88 Australians, and many more were injured.
A culprit also took place in a number of terrorist-related charges, including a wave of explosive attacks on churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
The prosecutor had demanded a life sentence, even if she could have applied for the death penalty for the man who, because of his reputation as a master bomb maker, is also called "Demolition Man".
The decision has aroused painful memories of June Corteen, a mother from Perth who lost her 39-year-old twin daughter Jane and Jenny in the devastation executed by Patek and his co-conspirators almost ten years ago.
Fighting with tears, she said Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really think he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys.
"One should put him in front of a shooting command," said Corteen to AAP.
I have to live every day with the fact that I won't get another grandson and I'll never see my daughters again.
The Sari Club was made the same as the ground when on 12 October 2002, shortly after 23 o'clock, a huge bomb exploded in a small truck parked in front of the night club.
Peter Hughes was in Paddy's bar, where only 20 seconds earlier a suicide killer had a explosive-filled backpack exploded.
He fell into the coma for a month after the attack and died three times, while he was hanging on a life support system.
Hughes said that Patek deserved the same fate as the three other members of the terrorist cell Jemah Islamiah – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra – who were responsible for the bloodbath four years ago.
Really, this guy should get the death penalty before everyone else.
To leave him alive – no, there is no reason to leave him alive.
Getting 20 years after he's killed 202 people and hurt many hundreds isn't much.
Patek is the last of the Bali-Bomber who stood in court.
He escaped almost a decade of arrest, but was finally arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where U.S. armed forces killed the former al-Qaida chief Osama bin Laden almost four months later.
During the negotiation, an FBI agent said that secret service reports had indicated that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden with the aim of restoring the connection between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaida.
"He didn't say," said Corteen.
Until recently, he has shown no repentance for how much suffering he has brought to other people.
The verdict came before the ten-year anniversary of the attack this year, which is celebrated with commemorative celebrations in Bali and Australia.
"There will be many tears this year," said Corteen.
Patek can still appeal against his judgment.
FAA: Passengers can now use electronic devices in aircraft (but do not have mobile calls)
From the departure to the landing, passengers can now use their electronic devices to read, work, play, listen to music and watch films, but not telephone with the phone, according to the new guidelines issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the USA on Thursday.
But passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately.
At a press conference, FAA staff member Michael Huerta explained how quickly they would be implemented, down from the respective airline.
Airlines shall demonstrate to the FAA that aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they have updated the flight staff training manuals as well as the arrangements for storing the equipment in accordance with the new rules.
The FAA stated that it has already received plans from some airlines to extend the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.
Among these airlines were Delta and JetBlue.
"Depending on the condition of the plan, we could approve the extended use of electronic devices very soon," the FAA announced in a statement.
Passengers currently have to turn off smartphones, tablets and other devices when the aircraft doors are closed.
You can start it again only after the plane reaches a height of three kilometres and gives the captain green light.
When entering the landing flight, passengers must turn them off again and not start them again before the plane has landed.
According to the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are secured against electronic interference could allow their passengers to use the equipment even on launch, landing and rolling ground, the FAA explained.
Most of the new aircraft and other aircraft converted for the use of Wi-Fi at greater altitudes should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the professional association of professional flight attendants, welcomed the changes.
"If the new regulation is implemented safely – and we work closely with the airline – both sides will benefit," said Glading.
We are honestly sorry to have to feel like watchmen on this issue.
However, Internet connections for surfing, exchanging emails, text messages or downloading data under three kilometres remained prohibited, explained the Authority.
Passengers are invited to place smartphones, tablets and other devices in flight mode.
So still no “Words With Friends”, the Scrabble similar online game that the actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011 when he had to leave a jet from American Airlines, because he refused to turn off the device while the plane was parked on the platform.
And heavier devices such as laptops must continue to be stored because there is a risk of injury here if they fly through the cabin.
Mobile phone calls during the flight are also prohibited.
The regulatory competence for telephone calls is the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), not the FAA.
FAA may impose ban on certain electronic devices on start-up and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker from the National Transportation Safety Board, safety expert on national traffic issues on CBS News, mobile phones would still be considered as risk.
"Handy is really a problem, not only because they could cause potential interference in navigational devices, but because we know from the FCC that transmission from the air can also disrupt transmission masts," says Rosenker.
A industry advisory committee launched by the FAA to investigate this issue recommended last month that the government allow a wider use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years the pressure on the FAA has increased to ease restrictions on use.
Critics such as the democratic Senator Claire McCaskill from Missouri consider that there are no valid safety grounds for the ban.
The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce because the use of the equipment has become omnipresent.
In some studies, up to a third of passengers forget to switch off or ignore the device.
The FAA began to restrict the use of electronic equipment by air passengers in 1966, after reports on interferences of navigation and communication equipment had become known by passengers of VHF radios, which were the latest technological trends at the time.
New aircraft are far more dependent on electrical systems than earlier generations of aircraft, but they are also designed in such a way and approved by the FAA that they do not constitute any electronic interference.
Passengers have been offering Wi-Fi for some years, when the flight height has been reached.
The flyers adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also more insensitive to interferences.
The vast majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for the greater use of electronic devices according to the new guidelines, Huerta said.
Today's electronic devices generally deliver much less radiation than earlier generations.
E-reader, for example, only emit minimal radiation when you turn around.
However, when downloading or sending data, the transfer values are stronger.
Amazon.com is among the providers of a easing of the restrictions on passenger device use.
In 2011 company employees were locating a passenger aircraft full of Kindle e-reader and doing a test flight to determine problems, but could not detect any.
Members of the FAA Board expressed mixed feelings as to the risk of using equipment.
Douglas Kidd from the passenger association National Association of Airline passenger said that he thought the interference with the equipment was real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other members of the committee said there were only isolated reports of pilots who spoke of a disruption of aircraft systems through the devices, and most of them were very old.
The Committee recommended, however, that the FAA allow pilots to order the switch off of the equipment by the passengers in case of an instrument landing under poor visual conditions.
A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes and described them as a reasonable adjustment for travellers who would be widely equipped with technology today.
"We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not in conflict with security," said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
Re-release of bird rescued by an air rescue service from North Sea Island
A bird flown to the coast by air rescue service, which had been found exhausted on a North Sea island, was released into nature again.
The water rale was flown last month with a helicopter to Aberdeen, where it was stacked up by the Scottish animal welfare organization SPCA in its rescue center in Alloa.
Colin Seddon, head of the Centre, said: "This water ralle was probably a winter bird from northern Europe, which was stopped by the strong winds over the North Sea."
Apparently, the exhausted bird sought refuge on the drilling island.
He added: "He could no longer fly on, so we were contacted with the request for help."
When released, the water ralle was fit and healthy again.
Is Europe's elite ready to do business with Britain?
Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention to bring the economy to a table and define what those who are responsible for prosperity and employment in the UK want to change our relations with the EU.
To this end, we have commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey among British economic leaders and asked them what they think about the UK, the economy and the EU.
YouGov surveyed more than 1,000 business executives representing the UK business sizes, sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will be very surprising.
We have found out that the vast majority of companies are now exporting outside Europe, focusing on countries that are modernising and growing, while the states are stagnating in the EU.
They wish the government to promote new trade connections with countries such as China, India and Brazil rather than the long and strenuous process of reforming the obscene EU institutions.
In their opinion on certain legal issues – from antitrust law to product legislation – the majority of economic leaders consider that control of these key competences should be recovered to Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction over the internal market, as, according to the companies, the costs of Brussels rules would now outweigh the benefits of being part of Europe's trading zone – even 40 percent of large companies agreed to this, which is traditionally the most European-friendly.
Finally, and that is probably the most, our survey of economic leaders showed that a significant majority of Britain wants a course towards change of the agreement and a relationship with the EU based on trade, not on policy.
This knowledge of companies of all sizes and leading companies shows that the economy is pressing for a "senseful change" which will bring the issue of action back to Britain.
It is about much – a change in the agreement and better conditions for Great Britain would lead to a change of opinion in favour of the EU's residence in a referendum.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt: this survey shows that the UK economy is behind its plan of renegotiating the British conditions for EU membership.
It also shows that the companies expect a significant shift of power back to Great Britain from a renegotiation.
A better deal for the UK economy is possible and increasingly necessary after the Eurozone is now moving towards a closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in the UK, as the result of our survey shows, which means greater attention to business and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach to rules.
Alexei Miller von Gazprom refers to pipeline in Bulgaria as the beginning of a new gas era
The construction of the South-Stream Pipeline in Bulgaria marks the start of one of the largest European energy projects, explained the Gazprom Board.
"Today's event is a milestone: the construction work on the Bulgarian section of the South-Stream Gaspipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, has begun," said Gazprom's CEO Alexei Miller, in a statement on Thursday.
The project is a key element for the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream aims to increase the diversity of Russia's export routes through Europe.
A contract dispute between Gazprom and its counterparts in Ukraine, in which most of the Russian gas is stored for Europe, creates an increased risk in conventional routes, as can be heard from the official side.
Miller said that the direct link to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are "forever" disabled.
Bulgarian consumers receive gas from South Stream at discounted tariffs when the entire project starts in 2015.
According to Gazprom, the construction work in other subordinate countries should begin on the planned route to the end of the year.
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic metres of natural gas.
For national and international investors there is no way past the real estate location in Germany.
The economic framework data are correct and the financing possibilities are excellent.
This has been the tenor of the 9th day of real estate of the stock exchange newspaper.
The German real estate markets benefit from the economic strength and the sound economic conditions in the country in Europe.
Christian Ulbrich, CEO of Europe, Middle East and Africa of Jones Lang LaSalle, pointed out this on the 9th anniversary of the stock exchange newspaper.
According to Ulbrich, as was being sought, German commercial real estate shows the volume of transaction.
In the first three quarters of this year, it increased by 31% compared to the previous quarter.
In the UK the plus was only 6%, in France at 19%.
"Real estate investments offer attractive interest rates," Ulbrich said.
The yield gap between real estate and federal bonds was at a historically high level.

Hearing before the Royal Commission: Two YMCA employees accused of accusations against Jonathan Lord for sexual offences
Two YMCA employees from New South Wales (NSW) had been charged with sexual offences in connection with children before 2011 charges against child caregiver Jonathan Lord from Caringbah were raised, as the Royal Commission on Sexual Abuse of Children learned.
However, in the opening statement before the Commission, the YMCA had stated that "the organization had never been dealt with as an incident of sexual child abuse".
Managing Director Phillip Hare was asked about a case in which an YMCA employee had been charged with child pornography crimes, and another in which a sports teacher of the YMCA Caringbah Hall had been sentenced in 1991 for the abuse of familiar children.
Hare said Gail Furness, one of the Commission's lawyers, that he knew about the first case but had not known the second.
He acknowledged that the YMCA's opening statement to the Commission had also been inaccurate in the claim that "the YMCA had external inspections in which the YMCA was recognised as the leading front in the field of child safety".
On the contrary, evidence before the Commission shows that the YMCA has been informed that it has received the second-lowest evaluation of four possible results in a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities (Ministry of Education) in August of the year.
Hare, who started with the YMCA by 21, admitted that the management had failed to "from me to the downwards" in the recruitment of Lord and did not ensure that employees were aware of their obligations to report infringements of the child safety guidelines.
Lord had been sentenced to YMCA for sexual abuse at the beginning of the year to twelve boys during his two years of activity.
He was sentenced to at least six years in prison.
Here disagreed, however, that the YMCA would have a cultural problem which had prevented employees from reporting Lord's violations regarding the safety of children.
The employees said that they had observed violations, among other things, that Lord was alone with children, that she was private as a babysitter, they sat on his lap, said to one that he loved it, and had children play with his cell phone.
Danielle Ockwell, whose superior was Lord and who had asked for a training on child protection because she was concerned about his behaviour, said that the head of the children's service Jacqui Barnat, who was Lord's superior in YMCA Caringbah, was "very intimidating and most of the time very immature".
The managing director explained that he would not accept statements from employees according to which they would not have dared to return their superior report.
Instead, he said, instead, their friendship with Lord had affected their judgment, so they had not reported him.
Hare explained that he had told the Board of Directors of the YMCA NSW that the lesson the organization had to draw from the "Jonathan Lord incident" was "not reporting" by employees, and the board had agreed to him.
Hare said that the decision to force employees to sign secretarial obligations shortly after the allegations occurred was made by the managing director of the YMCA Children's Services, Liam Whitley.
He said that it would be necessary to prevent the contamination of the evidence, but it would have been "exhausted" and misplaced.
The YMCA NSW was not a safe organization for children in the period when Jonathan Lord was employed there between 2009 and 2011, explained Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University, the Commission's sexual abuse expert.
He explained that there had been 'serious problems' in recruiting, checking, invoicing, training and supervision of employees.
The hearing was postponed until 20 December.
Tony Blair said he would use the chance to return as British Prime Minister, but acknowledges that a comeback is unlikely.
In an interview this evening on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his retirement from office, the 59-year-old announced his views on various internal policy issues.
Since his resignation in June 2007 after a decade as head of state, Blair has largely avoided expressing himself to British politics, and his comments mostly limited to foreign policy and his role as ambassador of the quartet of peacemakers in the Middle East.
On the question of whether he would like to return to the office of the Prime Minister, Blair was quoted by the Evening Standard from London as saying: "Yes, sure, but it is unlikely that this will happen, so ..."
When the equestrian experts found themselves in crowds in Cardiff to kiss the horse of the year, they were aware that a hard competition was imminent.
But no one was prepared for the three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
The Knirps, who is not even in the kindergarten and only took its first steps a few months ago, and his Shetland-Pony Toffee loosely troved through the three rounds and won the first prize – leaving 30 adult opponents behind.
The inseparable couple, both equally large, were praised for their appearance, behaviour and style in the annual competition organised by the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
When he appeared in competition with men and women with elegant melons, he had put his plate cap in a bold angle and led the two-year-old toffee through the ring.
Fenton was praised by the jurors for his natural skills in dealing with the pony that lie far beyond his age.
And Toffee got best notes for his appearance and personality.
Fenton had been given to Toffee last March as a gift for his third birthday and since then had practiced every day with the Shetland pony.
His mother, Donna, 30, said: "Fenton and toffee are a great team."
They had to go against the entire field of participants and went out of the square with goldpocal and rosette.
It was only the second time he had participated in a competition with Toffee, and we were all excited when he won.
Perfect strangers in the arena thought he was so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
The little boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been performing horses for over ten years.
Howells said: "The whole audience was like electrified, and everyone fired and clasped him."
He ran on sand the entire length of the arena and although he looked so tiny, he did fantastic work.
Fenton is crazy about animals – he loves horses, tractors and farms and has two chickens he cares for.
Just as he started, it won't take a long time until he's on the "Pferd of the Year" show – and I'm sure he'll cut off well.
A speaker from the annual horse show said: "Fenton is only three, but he knows how to deal with his pony."
Together, they're a great team.
The jurors evaluated Fenton and Toffee for how well they had beaten and presented themselves in the lead ring.
They pay attention to good cooperation between pony and leader – and there were Fenton and Toffee the best in the ring.
I'm sure Fenton's sweet clothes contributed their part to that, which was really perfect for the occasion.
Chinese newspaper is to be "re Reformed"
A Chinese newspaper on the front page who had demanded the release of a reporter who had been sued for diffamation was to be reformed, explained a press regulator.
The New Express, based in Guangzhou, had printed a rare public call for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Chen later admitted on television that he had accepted bribery money to fake reports about a state-owned company.
Now the new expression is being subjected to a "comprehensive rectification", the regulatory authority explained.
The Rectification Order was issued by the Department of Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television in Guangzhou.
Preliminary investigations showed that the New Express, which belongs to the Yangcheng Evening News Group, had published several inappropriate reports on the listed company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
"The editorial management of the New Express was disorganised", the regulatory authority announced in a statement.
She said that it had been decided that "an administrative penalty should be imposed on Chen Yongzhou and that he should be withdrawn from his reporter's licence".
In addition, “the Yangcheng Evening News Group was instructed to complete the rekectification of the New Express and recommended that those responsible for the New Express be identified and immediately checked the management team of the New Express.”
Chen had written several articles for the New Express, in which he reported alleged financial irregularities in a manufacturer of construction machinery called Zoomlion.
After he was arrested, the newspaper published two calls for his release on the front page and put himself behind his journalistic work.
But then Chen appeared in state television and admitted that he had published false reports against payment.
"In this case, I have damaged Zoomlion as well as the entire news industry and its ability to gain public confidence," he said to the CCTV state news station.
I did it primarily because I was on money and fame.
I realized that I was doing the wrong thing.
Following Chen's apologies, the New Express published an excuse on the cover page and stated that it was not possible to check the reports correctly.
Several well-known suspects have recently filed confessions on television.
Experts say that confessions are still routinely forced, despite an amendment to the law at the beginning of the year in which the authorities were forbidden to force someone to accuse themselves.
Drug tunnel with own railway between the USA and Mexico
One of the most sophisticated tunnels for drug smuggling between the USA and Mexico, which was fully equipped with lighting, ventilation and electric rail operation, has now been discovered.
The U.S. authorities described the 120 - 90 - inch tunnel as one of the most sophisticated passages they have ever found.
The tunnel, which runs in the zigzag pattern over a length of just under six football fields, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
In the area there are countless inescapable warehouses, which makes it easier to hide lorries loaded with drugs.
The tunnel had been closed before drugs could be transported undetected, the authorities explained.
In the discovery of the tunnel, eight and a half tons of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine had been ensured, according to the records of the Court.
Three men, who, according to the authorities, worked as a driver, were accused of the property and intended sale of marijuana and cocaine.
They threaten a debt sentence between ten years of age and life.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers rely on an extensive underground network of dehydration channels.
The tunnel is the eighth large passage, which has been discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered after the marijuana harvest in Central Mexico in October, which presents the drug cartels the challenge of bringing their product to consumers quickly.
In 2010, authorities found a nearly 640-metre passage with rails, which ran from a kitchen in a residential house in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr still love themselves
Actor Orlando Bloom and Model Miranda Kerr want to go separate paths in the future.
In an interview, however, Bloom said that he and Kerr still love themselves.
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are parents of the two-year-old Flynn.
Actor Orlando Bloom has expressed himself for the separation of his wife, top model Miranda Kerr.
In an interview with U.S. journalist Katie Couric, who should be broadcast on Friday (local time), Bloom said, "life sometimes doesn't go exactly as we plan it or hope it will."
Kerr and he still loved himself, emphasized the 36-year-old.
"We will support and love each other as parents of Flynn."
Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010, in 2011 their son Flynn was born.
Vegetarianism, according to Lexika, is subordinated to vegetarianism, but it is very different from that.
Because while vegetarians allow the consumption of creams, ice cream or a powerful Edamer, these munchies are not on the menu of a vegan.
Milk, cheese, egg, in addition to the absence of meat and fish, the vegan leaves off from all consumption of animal products - honey is also denied.
What remains may be asked, but upon closer consideration, the vegan food world is characterized by a considerable ingenuity.
"Bread spreads are very popular," explains Ute Henkelmann, the owner of this reform house, which provides a variety of special products for vegans.
Reuben Proctor also likes to visit the store at Domgasse.
For 13 years, the native New Zealand has been living vegan, and in Lampertheim he (almost) finds everything he needs to live. "In 1997 I changed my diet and became vegetarians".
The next step took place around the turn of the century and I became a vegan.
"The conviction came not only because of the diet, but because of the choice of shoes," says Proctor, who prefers synthetic leather.
He recognized that it is also in other everyday interests without animal products.
First of all, vegan is an ethics.
"I don't want animals to die for me," Proctor says the maximum of the vegans, which extends to the entire consumption behaviour.
Instead of apprehensioning burgers, hatchers, or rubber bears, the vegan quickly discovered new products, and the enthusiasm increased.
"It's a double bonus," says Proctor today, "in fact, vegan's not abandonment, it's not an ascetic, but it's an enrichment." Assuming that with the change of diet one reduces the choice of food options, Proctor is more likely to lead back to the power of habit.
And just these conditionings made some still so well-intentioned attempts fail.
"The addiction factor is a very crucial factor that makes many give up quickly, similar to smoking," Proctor compares.
And say: "Some tastes are not to be stuck to the beast."
Often it is the spices or the type of preparation that make up the taste.
"But you can also create the same effect in another way," explains the vegans.
For example, Proctor brings eggplants, mushrooms and also a few vegan sausages to a barbecue festival.
He pays attention to a balanced, varied diet, in which it should also taste delicately once.
Of course you want something between your teeth, that's legitimate.
"It should taste, but that is not just to reduce on animal food," says Proctor.
Health damage up to eating disorders, another widespread assumption, he did not suffer.
For me, the changeover had a positive aspect.
I don't take any foreign cholesterol and have an increased vitamin content.
There are high-performance athletes that feed exclusively vegan.
"My blood levels are best, I often let myself be checked," Proctor tells me.
In particular, many Vegansimus critics warn against the lack of vitamin B12.
"Since animals are fed with feed instead of grassing on the pasture, it is questionable whether the vitamin B12 portion is high in the meat you buy in the cold rest," Proctor finds.
For vegans, there was also the possibility of taking the coenzyme in the form of tablets.
"My B12 values are fine," he explains.
Proctor did not have to go far enough to obtain food.
Finally, there are basic foods everywhere, and every supermarket now has soy milk and other products.
Everything I need I find on the spot.
I only occasionally buy something special.
"Many people overlook the fact that only the finished products are expensive, but so it is known to be the case with "ordinary" finished products".
In any event, the preparation of vegan dishes was much cheaper and less time-consuming than generally accepted.
"There is a lot to discover in the kitchen, with a few small tricks you can achieve good if not partly better results," says Proctor.
Margarine instead of butter, a little more baking powder and carbonic acid instead of egg, with its vegan cheese cake, Proctor could also amaze his brother-in-laws.
Family festivals give the vegan a new sausage.
This has a new significance when you cook together.
"The situations that can arise are as different as the people themselves," says Proctor.
Of course, however, skepticism has already been shown to him.
Don't you taste my food?
"Should I feel bad now because I drink milk?" - You have to act as a vegan with a sense of fingertips on such questions.
"I don't reject people, I'm part of this society," Proctor doesn't want an enclave.
And more precisely, the everyday world does not seem as vegan as thought - and the vegan does not limit as much in everyday life as commonly assumed.
Fast food is also allowed.
Pommes are everywhere!
"Many dungeons offer falafel, or a vegetarian yufka," says Proctor.
In a pizzeria he deviates on pasta dishes, or just ordered a pizza without cheese, all a question of habit.
The restaurants adjust to it so slowly.
"When I started feeding vegan 13 years ago, everything was even more difficult," the New Zealand country can find out a development: "You have to talk to the people, make them aware of it."
"If there are enough demand, they may be inclined to supplement the menu," he hopes.
Vegan restaurants develop, for example, the kitchen in Mannheim or the café Vogelfrei.
Proctor wishes that other restaurants also have at least one vegan dish on the menu.
Basically, vegan dishes are there for everyone.
Everyone can eat them, so they're exactly the opposite of exclusive.
"On the other hand, meat dishes are exclusive, in the truest sense of the word, because they exclude others," Proctor notes.
"If you want to avoid food scandals, veganism is a sure way to make the most of it impossible," says Proctor.
However, the purchase of vegan products can be a bit difficult at the beginning.
Especially when one learns to understand that animal additives can also be included in peanuts as a colorifier, one seems to be quick to abandon the courage with the pursuit of ethics in so many obstacles and traps.
Not only did Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen write a book: "Veganissimo - Animal Ingredients and their Alternatives" explains the many ingredients that are used as food as well as cleaning agents.
"Sometimes you develop a scanner view and know what signs and logos you have to pay attention to "It's sometimes better to do small steps than to stay still or to stumble," Proctor knows.
Veganism, he is an important moral finger's eye, beating on consciousness.
He may not be able to put away his habits, but at least he can teach consumers to critically question his habits.
The stock exchange operator Nasdaq OMX keeps its customers in touch.
Trade at Nasdaq Options Market was interrupted on Friday afternoon German time.
The operator was responsible for technical problems in a communication.
The other eleven US options markets, including two of the Nasdaq OMX, continued their business unimpeded.
The latest incident continues a whole series of smaller and larger pans at the stock exchange operator.
Only on Tuesday the indexes of Nasdaq had not been calculated for an hour due to errors in data transport.
In August of this year there had been two pans alone in a week.
First, the US Investment Bank sent Goldman Sachs to the option markets because of technical problems.
The stock exchange operators then needed almost a whole day to look through and delete the orders.
Two days later, half of the total stock trade in the US came to life for several hours because of a computer pan on the Nasdaq stock exchange.
In addition, the Facebook stock exchange last year had provided a lookout.
The Nasdaq systems had not grown the flood of purchase and sales orders, later the SEC issued the stock exchange supervision and donated the company to a record penalty of 10 million dollars.
Constance: Radler runs over 63-year-olds
According to the police, the accident occurred when a 26-year-old man was on his way to market on Thursday evening, at around 22 o'clock, with a ladies' bicycle unorderably on the left footpath from the station square.
When a 63 - year - old man suddenly walked from a locality, the bicycle driver, according to the police, could no longer brake in time.
In the next collision, the pedestrian was pushed against the house wall, went to the ground in the further course, and a space wound of about 15 centimetres was added to the head.
A rescue car team brought the injured to the hospital for medical treatment.
British Police Appointes Assange
Today, the British police handed a delivery order to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who sought refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and applied for asylum.
Scotland Yard said that the 40-year-old Australian had a "call to make himself" that required him to appear at a police station and added that if he did not comply, he threatened arrest.
Assange threatens extradition to Sweden because of the charge in a sexual crime after its possibilities have been exhausted under British law since the Supreme Court rejected its opposition to extradition at the beginning of the month.
Fearing that Stockholm would hand him over to the United States, on 19 June he had sought refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and asked the South American country for political asylum.
Scotland Yard "has sent a call to a 40-year-old man to sit at a police station at a time we have chosen," said one speaker.
He continues to violate the conditions of his release to bail.
The message did not comment on the delivery of the police request.
Assange fears that he will be handed over from Sweden to the United States and accused there for possible espionage accusations, after publishing more than 250,000 diplomatic news on WikiLeaks' website.
Driver, who has been raced between the legs with 210 km/h and a hot drink, receives 1,000 pounds of penalty
A driver was charged a penalty of £1,000 because he had been driven up to 210 km/h and a hot drink between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree, Essex, was stopped on 27 May with his Mercedes Benz at the A120 at Braintree.
After the police stopped him, they discovered the drink cup between his legs.
In front of the District Court, Howie was guilty without having taken the necessary care and attention.
He received seven points and a six-month driving ban.
Howie was also sentenced to pay 90 pounds of costs as well as a 100 pounds victim allowance.
Tax for foreign property owners against London's speculation bubble
The Ministry of Finance has provisionally calculated the CGT measure, but is still waiting for the final decision of treasurer George Osborne, who in the 2012 budget had imposed a stamp tax of 7 % on apartments costing over two million pounds and annual fees for buyers who hold homes as company and not as individuals.
Already now, the revenue from the stamp tax on residential property in the Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea districts, which in the 2012/13 tax year were 708 million pounds, took together the proceeds for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the northeast, Yorkshire and the Humber region.
Cook said: "After the increases in the stamp tax on high-priced dwellings and the introduction of the related legislation against circumvention, it can be difficult to claim that high-quality real estates are too low, regardless of the effects of the obsolete community tax system."
"But this step could make some foreign investors more reserved in terms of the purchase of real estate in London, or stop owners from selling them," he added.
First-class real estate – the top five to ten percent of the housing market by price – in the wealthy Southwest belt of London, which extends from Fulham to Wimbledon, has become expensive around the record value of 11.8 % last year.
The prices in Central London showed a steady annual growth of 5.6%, but were overestimated by an emerging domestic market where the south-western part of the city, the north (7.4%) and the east (6.5%) experienced an upward trend, such as a Savill study.
Scientists have been able to shed more light on the relationship between a dog's tails and his mood.
Previous research had shown that happy dogs with the tail were more to the right (from the dog's point of view), while in nervous dogs it was the left side.
But now scientists say that other dogs can perceive and react to these subtle differences.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trent, said: "It is well known to people that the left and right brains react differently to stimuli, causing positive or negative emotions."
Here we have tried to look at other species.
He also noted that in dogs, just like in humans, the right brain half was responsible for the movement of the left side and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played different roles in the feelings.
To learn more about how dogs react to the lateral tails of their fellows, the researchers monitored the animals while these films looked at other dogs.
They measure the heart rate of the four-legged and analyzed the behavior.
Probably we will soon understand why the cock moves into the one, once in the other direction
Professor Vallortigara said: "We have shown the dogs films with dogs – either a natural version or a silhouette to eliminate divergent other aspects, and we have thus been able to control the movement of the cock more to the left or to the right."
When the animals saw how an otherwise expressive dog had moved the tail to the right (seen from the perspective of the bedding dog), they remained completely relaxed.
However, the tail inclination was mainly left (again from the perspective of the dog who was rolling), so their heart rate rose and they looked restless.
According to Professor Vallortigara, the dogs do not deliberately communicate with each other through these movements.
Rather, he is convinced that the dogs have learned from experience in which movements they should worry and when not.
He said: "If you have different encounters with other dogs and weeding is more linked to the tail in a direction with friendly behavior and the right side produces a less friendly behavior, then you react on the basis of these experiences."
The researchers say that the findings could help dog owners, veterinarians and trainers to better understand the emotions of their animals.
John Bradshaw, expert in dog behaviour and guest scholarship at the Faculty of Animal Medicine at the University of Bristol, explained that this was not the first study to investigate whether left and right was important for dogs.
Last year, a team at Lincoln University found out that dogs turn their heads to the left when they look at an aggressive dog, and to the right when it's a satisfied dog.
Another research at Victoria University in Canada said: “Hunds are more likely to go to a robot dog when their “swine” is to the left and not to the right, rather than to become restless – exactly the opposite to the Italian study.”
According to his statement, the differences could therefore cause the dogs in the various studies to not interpret the animals in the films or the robot dogs as dogs.
A study of how dogs react to real dogs could help, he explained.
"While there is considerable evidence for many different mammals that the two brains are used for different purposes, many of the details need to be determined – and dogs are no exception," says Bradshaw.
Since their behavior is simply recorded, it will probably not take long until we understand why the cock sometimes moves into one, sometimes in the other direction.
Arctic Monkeys postpone appearance in Glasgow due to the disease Alex Turners
The rock band Arctic Monkeys has postponed an appearance in Glasgow after her lead singer has been infected with keel head inflammation.
Sheffield's band was supposed to play in the hydro on Friday.
However, because of Alex Turner's illness, the concert has to be relegated.
The band's announcement came after she had to move a performance in the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on their official website, Arctic Monkeys announced: "After the decision to cancel the show at the LG Arena in Birmingham tonight and on medical advice, Arctic Monkeys will also have to cancel the show at Hydro in Glasgow on Friday, November 1st."
"In Alex Turner a throat head inflammation was diagnosed, which is why he unfortunately cannot occur."
The show at the LG Arena in Birmingham will take place on November 20, which was moved to the Hydro in Glasgow on November 21.
All tickets are valid for these shows.
We apologize to all ticket holders for the inconveniences caused by this.
Please contact the customer service at the sales points where you bought your ticket if you need further support.
Pope Francis appoints first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will first appoint new cardinals of the Catholic Church on 22 February, as the Vatican announced on Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest-ranking clergy in the Catholic Church after the Pope, and they also choose a Pope, so that Francis will thus appoint the first group of men who will eventually participate in the election of his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, a Cardinal who has reached the age of 80 can no longer participate in the Pope’s election – this is due to a group of 120 “elected cardinals”.
In a statement in which the message was announced, Father Federico Lombardi, a spokesman of the Vatican, said that a meeting of all cardinals would take place before the ceremony was held to appoint the new cardinals, also known as the Consistorium.
"Papst Francis has decided to announce his decision to convene the Consistium in February in advance so that other meetings that require the participation of cardinals from all over the world can be planned," said Lombardi.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that the number of candidates would probably have fallen by February.
He declared that a pope would normally appoint as many cardinals as necessary, so that the number of cardinals entitled to vote would be 120 again, and as many cardinals as he would like.
The Consistium next year is therefore significant because it is the first since the election of Francis in March this year, says Valero.
At present, there is a certain amount of overhang on the side of Europe and, in particular, Italy.
"It will be interesting to see if the new Pope Cardinal will appoint from the rest of the world to restore the balance," he said.
Forty percent of Catholics live in South America, but they only have a tiny number of cardinals.
The cardinals will also be the first to be called since the Council of Cardinals founded by Francis, a group of eight cardinals from all over the world to find ways to reform the Church.
In the past, the Pope decided everything alone.
"Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him," said Valero.
He said it was "good possible" that Francis asked the cardinals for advice.
But so far we have not been in this situation – that is all completely new.
Valero said that the bishops would typically be called to cardinals from large places, but Francis is "full of surprises – so we don't know who he appoints".
GM returns new pickup trucks in the USA to repair the seatrest
General Motors recall almost 19,000 of its brand-new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra Pickup trucks with built-in 2014 to fix a problem with the manually adjustable seatrest, according to a communication from the US regulatory authority for vehicle safety on Friday.
In some of the cars, there may be a defect in the mechanism for resetting the front seatrest.
For this reason, they do not comply with the Federal Guidelines on vehicle safety in the case of head restraints.
“When driven from behind to the vehicle, it is possible that the head restraint does not protect the inmates properly so that there is an increased risk of injury,” was read in the message on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) website.
The recall models were produced between August 1st and September 10th.
The delivery of GM trucks began in June and is the main model launch of the leading US car manufacturer since insolvency-related restructuring in 2009.
In the first half of October GM informed the owners of the vehicle about the defect.
The NHTSA could not verify the notification letter due to the 16-day Government Shutdown, which had a negative effect on car sales in October.
The sale of the Silverado and Sierra trucks, which were newly developed for the 2014 model year, increased by 20 percent in the first ten months of the year, said GM on Friday.
In October GM sold 42,660 Silverado and 16,503 Sierra Pickup trucks.
The GM share rose by 1.4 percent on the New York Stock Exchange to $37.47 on Friday afternoon.
Desperation of an Obama chooser
I have elected President Obama twice in the hope that change will be possible
He says Obama has made commendable efforts that have been eroded by the blockade tactics of Republicans
The blockade policy does not excuse Obamacare's website problems, the drone attacks
Obama's memoirs about the 2008 election were a sad reminder of what would have been possible
Nathaniel P. Morris is a student at Harvard Medical School in the second year.
I am currently reading a very sad book.
It's a book I believed it would cheer me up during the sad second year of my medical studies and give me hope again.
It is called "The Audacity to Win" (to win mut) and describes Barack Obama's memoirs on the 2008 presidential election.
When I'm done with my patient’s articles in the evening and go to bed, the book leads me back to a time when politics could rob millions of inspired people and a speech.
The election was held in the wake of the historic significance of this hour to win the land slide and news spokesmen.
My classmates cried with joy and my parents gathered all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of visionaries was on their way to the White House and the nation was ready for change.
At that time, Obama moved to office and received 82% of his approval.
And then I close the book.
Switching back to the present is a bad awakening, as if being torn out of a dream.
It is difficult to remember these optimistic times – they seem to be a vague memory, a sad reminder of missed possibilities.
In the years since I first voted, something has actually changed.
But it's just nothing I could have imagined.
I recognize the great and versatile things Obama has achieved, from the adoption of the Affordable Care Act for Health Insurance to the military withdrawal from Iraq, the end of the forced absence of homosexuality in the army and the killing of Osama bin Laden.
I also believe that party political blockade tactics have shrunk too many efforts to advance our nation: immigration reform, a public option for health insurance and the closure of Guantanamo Bay to name just a few.
But after numerous times defending the Obama government to colleagues and acquaintances, I have reached an end to my attempts at explanation.
I have reached a point of political despair.
Republican blockade politics cannot explain why we allow the listening of foreign heads of state or the killing of innocent children by drones in overseas.
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data about the private life of Americans and why Whistleblower is punished, which reveal state misconduct.
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, was murdered without trial, and why the public funding and spending limits are being bypassed during the presidential elections.
It does not justify the results of a report that states that the White House's efforts to calm the media are the 'aggressive ... since the Nixon government'.
And recently, it cannot excuse the inability to design a simple website in the more than three years since the adoption of the Affordable Care Act.
I don't know if it's what I should have expected.
Whether I should have understood by 18 that government work could contradict the political campaigns ahead.
Obviously, the parliamentary office is not a predictable course, as an opposition party and random events such as the Newtown-Massaker shape the public debate.
But if I look at the examples mentioned above, they seem to be largely elected by the government itself.
And that bothers me the most.
I chose Obama again in 2012, not because I was enthusiastic about his candidate.
Mitt Romney represented a confusing and unbridled alternative that he seemed unable to determine his direction and positions.
I had the impression that a second term of office for Obama, free from the pressure of future elections, would fulfill the hope we had heard so long.
But with the fall of the approval values for Obama on less than 45% this week, the return to 2008 by this book has become all the harder.
It awakens in me the longing for the many promises that have dissolved into air.
This week I read a section in the book describing how Obama had to put a serious loss to Clinton in the pre-elections in Pennsylvania.
In a meeting with the Electors after the decision, he told his employees that they had to come back on course and follow the purpose of their cause.
"I want us to find our magic again," he said.
We need to remember who we are.
It's five years later, Mr. President, and I couldn't agree more with you.
The views expressed in this comment are exclusively those of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claimed that Prime Minister Tony Abbott had conflict of interest on parental leave
The billionaire and MP Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in a conflict of interest in his plans for parental leave because his daughters become pregnant and could therefore benefit from it.
The Mining Magnate, who is in a judicial dispute about the payment of 6 million dollars of CO2 tax, made the claim when he wanted to wipe out questions from the table, whether he was in a conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four units in the Senate, which are important for deciding whether to delete or reduce the CO2 and mining taxes.
But Palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest and the daughters of Abbott would personally benefit from the laws.
"He's in a big conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave, because when one of his daughters gets pregnant, he has a direct interest in whether she gets a vacation or not," said Palmer.
Two months after the election, Palmer, with 53 votes in favour, officially declared the winner of Fairfax's Sunshine Coast seat to be the winner.
Palmer called for a revision of the voting list process so that it can be done more quickly.
Tony Abbott's daughters Frances and Bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after the end of the vote?
"We need a better system," he said.
Why should we not have a system where one enters the data into a computer, immediately selects it, and then has the result at 6:30 p.m.?
Palmer also criticised the use of pencils in marking the polls.
Do you use it because you can erase the results if you don't like them?
Consisting with pencils today is incredible.
The Electoral Commission has examined the options for an electronic election and recently published a joint legislative proposal with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, stated that his policy included an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new office very seriously.
At a public office it is about the service to the public.
"We do not strive for any reward except history, namely that we can serve in a critical time of this community," he said.
RBS suspends two foreign exchange dealers
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two dealers from its foreign exchange department, so two people who are familiar with the situation, which is another indication that the worldwide regulatory investigation is rapidly taking on board the alleged manipulations on the monetary market.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are working with the authorities in the world's largest financial market, at which 5.3 billion dollars change ownership every day.
The two traders would be the first RBS employees to be suspended in the expanding investigation that the scandal is about the Libor interbank business.
The Bank, which did not comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it had received information requests from authorities.
"Our investigations on this issue continue and we cooperate fully with the FCA and other regulatory authorities," said the bank two weeks ago.
Last month, people close to the situation indicated that the RBS had forwarded the records of emails and instant messages sent by and to an earlier dealer to the UK Supervisory Authority, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This dealer, Richard Usher, had left the RBS 2010 and is now to have been deprived of his current position as European head of the Forex-Spot trade at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of the European spot trading at Citi, was vacationed this week and Matt Gardiner, former leading currency dealer at Barclays and UBS, was suspended this week at Standard Chartered.
None of these traders were accused of any misconduct.
The Instant Message Group of Usher belonged to bankers at Barclays and the Citigroup, who said the situation was close.
UBS announced this week that it had taken steps against some of its employees after the Swiss regulatory authority had declared Finma that it was investigating a suspected manipulation of the foreign exchange market in a number of Swiss banks.
At least six authorities around the world – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss Competition Authority Weko, the FCA, the US Ministry of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are currently dealing with allegations that banks should have agreed on transactions on the monetary market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also initiated internal investigations or received information requests from authorities, said people familiar with the situation.
Banks comb instant messages and emails from several years in search of cases of misconduct.
The news of these investigations has put the dealers in a state of turmoil, which has been one of the most profitable of the trading units of investment banks in recent years, but this year was under pressure because low volatility in currencies limits the chances for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to play down the affair and said that it is almost impossible to manipulate the extensive and highly liquid foreign exchange market, but leading traders believe that this is not necessarily true.
One leading dealer noted that, despite the enormous daily volume of foreign exchange trade, the fragmentation of liquidity between the different trading platforms and the increasing use of own internal platforms by banks leads to "the market being affected by very low ticket prices".
The news came out on the same day as Credit Suisse announced that she had announced this week to a dealer of her London Exchange Traded Funds office after having caused a loss of nearly six million dollars at the end of last year.
The Bank immediately informed the competent authorities and cooperates with them.
"We are sure that the dealer has acted alone and that the business is restricted," said Credit Suisse.
Painted the fence on the Bechtle base
A group of the "Schweizer Wiese" citizens' initiative has adorned the construction fence on the Bechtle base on the Kurpromenade in Bad Herrenalb.
In addition, she cleaned and widened the footpath, says in a press release.
The planned cover of the disintegrating house in the rear part of the property had not been allowed for security reasons, because the site threatened to slip off.
Alfred Abel, who currently manages the property, had agreed to the beautification operation with his colleague Reinhard Domke from the BI.
Before the BI's action, a transparency had been attached to the message "We are for it".
However, the approximately 20 members of the citizens' initiative had little to do with their action.
Her motto on the big poster was "We are against the ruins".
In this way, she wanted to point out the danger of even larger ruins on the Swiss meadow - the giant project was supposed to fail one day.
In conversation with many passers-bys in front of the "building site", it became clear that some citizens believe that the city's project will be much better, although few have the same questions about the dimension of the project presented as the BI.
But they're starting to resign because the city is further delaying these answers, it says from the BI.
As it was to be heard, the mayor's public statements also have an impact.
In May, at the municipal council meeting, he said that he feared the outdoors for the thermal bath, the people should vote against the plans for a bathing and wellness complex on the Swiss meadow.
Some of them seem quite scared, others feel they are "plumping blackmail" to the population, says the BI's press release.
The BI thanked the donors for the color and all the helpers.
Rangnick-Schelte für Schiris: Mane no Schwalbenkönig
As satisfied Ralf Rangnick with the current high-level of Bundesliga-table leader Red Bull Salzburg is also, the sports director of the "bulls" showed himself disappointed by the referees.
"There is a dangerous trend at the moment that Mane and Alan are being pushed into the Schwalbenkönige category," he took the two offensive swirlers in protection on Thursday at a press conference in Salzburg.
The last occasion for Rangnick's critique was yellow for Mane at 3:0 against Grödig last Sunday, where Senegalese became a alleged actor for death - which was of course none, as the TV pictures showed.
"A sharp mistake," said Rangnick, the referee of Harkam as "fully overwhelmed".
Harkam would also have contributed "his part" to the escalation between Salzburg-Coach Roger Schmidt and Grödig-Trainer Adi Hütter after the game.
He defended his German countryman: "In every individual situation I would have behaved the same as Roger Schmidt".
Schmidt himself wants to have no contact with his colleagues after the Scharmutzel with Hütter.
I don't know why.
"For I am the one who has been offended," stressed the 46-year-old.
In the face of success, however, Rangnick voted in favour of a hymn of praise.
"For that, there are only two words: Rightly good," he noted.
There's not much to put off.
Especially the way the team plays is impressive.
It's supposed to go on like this.
There will be hardly any cash changes in the winter transfer period.
There are no great reasons to change anything.
"In addition, a player takes on the wish that he wants to leave the club," said Rangnick.
Supreme Court confirms Obama's health law
It is a great victory for the Obama government: The US Supreme Court today decided that the closely linked health law is constitutional.
With five to four votes, the judges judged that the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – it forces US citizens to conclude health insurance or pay a penalty by 2014 – is constitutional within the framework of the State tax authority.
The Chief Judge John Roberts beat himself on the side of the four more liberal members of the Chamber, while the judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy opted against it.
The Court also confirmed the remaining sections of the 2700-page law and also held that the provision of the Health Act, according to which states should either extend the conditions for access to medicinal products or otherwise remove all state-owned medicinal products, was not unconstitutional.
The appeal against the law had been tried by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The law had been strongly rejected by all the leading Republican presidential candidates, including the final challenger Mitt Romney, in the pre-election campaign 2012.
Norway: Norwegian place makes itself light with giant mirrors
With huge mirrors, the inhabitants of a Norwegian village have brought light into their dark valley.
Due to the low degree of sunfall, the Rjukan located in the Vestfjord valley normally sinks from autumn to spring in the shade of the surrounding mountains.
With three gigantic reflectors at 45 meters altitude a century's dream came true on Wednesday.
"At last!" Mayor Steinar Bergsland warmed at the launch ceremony on TV2.
Some people in the valley had to deal with the sun's chairs, and others set up sunglasses for safety.
So far, sunpongy had to ride a cable car to a nearby summit in winter.
Ten years ago, the local artist Martin Andersen presented the proposal to direct the rays into the valley with mirrors.
However, this basic idea has been in the town since 1913.
After several years of debate, the City Council finally adopted the 5 million crown (about 615 000 euros) of expensive projects.
A similar construction has been providing winter sunshine to the Italian Alpine town of Viganella for several years.
Post emptys hardly any Sundays
"Many citizens will not yet have noticed that the red points for Sunday emptying are still on different letter boxes of the core city and the districts, but if you read the small print on the yellow containers of Post AG, you will quickly find that the emptying on Sundays and holidays is no longer taking place," says the FDP.
A request from the FDP confirmed this.
On Sundays and holidays only in front of the post building in Ernst-Ludwig-Straße 36 and in the Jakob Müller-Straße 1 in Hüttenfeld were emptied.
Whether to be emptied in Hofheim and Rosengarten on Sunday will not be answered in the answer to the request of the FDP.
The Social and Youth Policy Spokesperson of the FDP, Fritz Röhrenbeck, wants to look here.
The Sunday emptying is an important post service at Terminpost.
"This company is radical and inconceivable despite the price increase for letters on January 2013".
Thomas Bittner, president of the Liberals' political groups and city associations, supports his group members: "What upsets me is the fact that here the emptying times are secretly changed or deleted."
Close to the citizens, the post is miles away.
"At least the letter boxes in the districts of Neuschluss and Rosengarten have to be emptied again on Sundays," said Bittner and Röhrenbeck unisono.
Also for the core city, especially not mobile citizens would have to be able to reach a letter box with Sunday emptying even on foot.
In the city parliament, Röhrenbeck asked if the city administration was planning to talk to the post about this matter.
Mayor Erich Maier replied that the post did not communicate with Lampertheim.
His knowledge, however, also existed in Hofheim.
Your party has expressed its support for privatisations.
"Then decisions are made elsewhere," said Maier.
Frankfurt parking charges are expected to rise strongly
Parking in Frankfurt could soon become more sensitive.
The City Magistrate advises this morning on a presentation of transport expert Stefan Majer (Green).
Hence, parking charges are to be increased by 50 percent.
For this purpose, however, the prices should not be increased, but the time interval of parking watches and vending machines should be reduced from 30 to 20 minutes.
In December the city council will have to decide.
The IHK Frankfurt Retail Committee believes that this is a "no good idea".
The parking possibility immediately before the business was "an underestimating advantage for smaller retailers".
The transport club Germany believes that an increase after two decades is "adequately appropriate and actually long overdue".
Public transport is also becoming more expensive.
Freudenstadt: Quick actions overlapping host
With a narrow cadre, the gentlemen I of the TSV Freudenstadt in the Schiller-Schulturnhalle in Reutlingen had to compete against the TG Gönningen from the Swabian Alb.
The elders were on the other side with an experienced team.
Soon however, it was shown that, even age-related, they were not able to keep up with the fast actions of the cities of joy.
The gönningers were extremely hard to deal with with with the hard and placed impact.
Repeatedly, they missed the passports and attacks played by Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz cleanly across the network center and were not in place during the block defense.
Two high firstset gains clearly expressed the superiority of the cities of joy in all matters.
In view of this oppressive and play-determining performance, the third set was won a little lax and lustless to the 3rd0 end (25:13, 25:14, 25:22).
On November 2nd, with the TV Baiersbronn, who was able to put himself in a clear position in Nagold, a much more powerful opponent will be on the field.
TSV Freudenstadt I: Dominik Bäuerle, Yannik Bückle, Sebastian Dölker, Felix Pälchen, Stefan Räller, Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz.
In the B-Class, the second teams from Baiersbronn and Freudenstadt were in the Murgtalhalle in Baiersbronn.
They delivered a hard-fighted two-hour match.
Nervousness on both sides caused mistakes and score gifts in particular; even at the passes, the precision was sometimes faulty and in some critical games the overefer prevented the look for possible score wins.
In this very well-balanced encounter, Marcus Blasutto's TSV team voted consistently for the great physical commitment and an encouraging commitment of both teams.
Care day at the small English cottage
A group of dedicated participants met at the small Engländerhütte in Ibach on the fifth day of care in the wake of the Natura 2000 project of upper hotzenwald.
Due to suggestions from the population, the area of the hut of view to the valley should be freed on this day, said Mayor Helmut Kaiser.
Many hikers, according to Kaiser, described this area as the gleaming part of the canyon, on which the landscape offers the ideal setting for magnificent views.
He thanked the present for their willingness to cooperate and stressed that the day of care was an appropriate instrument to strengthen the connection between man and nature.
He offers every citizen the opportunity to set their own accents in nature.
At the same time as the tourist aspect, environmental considerations could also be taken into account.
This ecological aspect explained Friederike Tribukait from the Nature Conservation Division of the Government Presidium Freiburg following the welcome by Councillor Tilman Bollacher, who had taken over the patronship and wished the action a good success.
According to Tribukait, the tourist goal of the wide-view is to preserve the now heavily grown old allmendweidfeld with its specific protected habitat types by opening up and connecting to the still existing pastures.
Certain species such as rare butterflies and grasshoppers cannot overcome barriers in the form of forest areas.
You need these free connections to conservation.
Tribukait said that they do not want to fail at this point to break a lance for the planned biosphere area.
In this planning, the current measure is not only seamless.
A biosphere area also offers the opportunity to achieve sustainable economic and environmental development on the basis of the internationally recognised Unesco status and thus a continuous addition to the life project as well as the previous day of care for the future.
After these various presentations, Vice President Christoph Wehle and Life Project Manager Cornelia Bischoff shared the helpers into groups.
The larger trees had already been beaten in advance, the forsschlepper might be ready to call.
A group of helpers should take care of the release of juniper bushes and the maintenance of a dry stone bar.
The objective was the free view at the vantage point.
Löffingen: Kopfler still only candidate
Information on the Internet: Although the Baartädtchen Löffingen with its 7514 inhabitants, an intact infrastructure, a forward-looking school, child, youth and senior policy, as well as its own city works can be called an attractive city, no second mayor has yet reported.
As the only candidate for the succession of the mayor Norbert Brugger, who is no longer a candidate for the age, the 46-year-old banker and business owner Dieter Köpfler from Löffingen has been established.
The application deadline expires on Monday, November 11, at 6 p.m.
Google, Samsung, Huawei sued for Nortel patents
The group, which owns thousands of former Nortel patents, imposed on Thursday an avalanche of complaints for patent infringement against mobile phone manufacturers, including Google, the company that was oversawed by Nortel in the insolvency auction.
Rockstar, the consortium that bought the Nortel patents for $4.5 billion, sued Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringements in front of the U.S. District Court in Texas.
Rockstar is owned by Apple, Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is charged with the patent infringement in seven cases.
The patents involve technology that reconciles search terms on the Internet with relevant advertising, according to the claim that thus meets the core of Google's search engine business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not directly accessible.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC manufacture mobile phones that work with Google's Android operating system, which is in sharp competition with Apple's and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011, Google issued an initial bid of over 900 million dollars for the Nortel patents.
Google increased its offer several times and offered last time 4.4 billion US dollars.
After it was oversold by Rockstar's Nortel patents, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a business that was also partly motivated by Motorola's library of patents.
"Although Google failed with its attempt to acquire the patent at the auction, Google has violated the patents and continues to do so", states the Letter of Appeal.
Rockstar demands a high compensation from Google, as it claims that Google's patent infringement is intentional, so the accusation.
Egypt defends first freely elected president
Muhammad Mursi takes office, but his day of triumph should not mean the end of the political disputes in Egypt.
Islamist Mohammed Mursi promised a "new Egypt" when he was the first freely elected president of the country and thus followed by Husni Mubarak, who had been expelled from office 16 months earlier.
With his introduction to the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mursi became the first freely elected Islamic president of the Arab world and Egypt's fifth head of state since the fall of the monarchy about 60 years ago.
He laid the oath before the 18 judges of the court dressed in black robes, who have his seat on the Nile and who have received an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We are striving for a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic," said Mursi at the solemn ceremony, which was broadcast live on state television.
"Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom, genuine democracy and stability," said 60-year-old Mursi, an engineer trained in the USA and member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group, which, since its foundation, had been largely taken as a banned organization by the respective government.
Hundreds of soldiers and police guarded the building when Mursi arrived in a small car convoy shortly after eleven o'clock.
Only a few hundred followers had gathered in court to cheer the new president, and unlike the presidential prek from the Mubarak era, the traffic was stopped only for a short time so that the autoconvoy could cross the usually busy road that connects the city centre with the southern suburbs.
As an uncharismatic “replacement wheel” of the brotherhood, his personal prestige has increased since his victory and a Friday speech in which he presented himself not only as a candidate for Islamists, but all of those who wanted to bring the aspirations of the uprising of 2011 against the authoritarian Mubarak.
"Egypt is today a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," Mursi, dressed in a blue suit with red tie, explained to the judges in the wood-plated chamber in which he took office.
Later Mursi went to the University of Cairo, where he was supposed to hold his address for entry.
He was officially welcomed by an army chapel who played the national anthem, which he listened to in homage.
The military leader Feldmarschall Hussein Tantawi was present.
On his arrival he was welcomed by hundreds of people in the university's largest listening hall with a speech by "The army and the people are a hand".
The University of Cairo, built in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, has developed into a stronghold of Islamic student groups in the 1970s.
Mursi made a symbolic oath on Friday on the Tahir Square, the birthplace of the uprising, which led last year to the end of the authoritarian rule Mubaraks, and he promised to call back presidial powers that the military council had taken over from the head of state who had been chased out of office.
But by putting off the official oath before the court and not as usual before Parliament, he bears witness to the will of the military, which indicates that the power struggle will continue.
Mursis speech on the Tahir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
Falkenberger Discothek provides two great evenings
The new season in the Falkenberger discotheque "Blue Velvet" has begun.
On Friday evening it's called "Pump this party", on tomorrow Saturday evening it continues with an Ü 25 party.
Fat Beats and cool sounds are of course promised by the organizers on both days.
Workers crashed by ladders: severely injured
On Thursday, when a defective outsider was changed, a 51-year-old worker in Eggelsberg fell from a ladder and was badly injured.
The man from Lamprechtshausen wanted to replace a defective heating sensor on the exterior facade of a guest house.
As he stepped on the ladders leaned on the roof, he slipped away and the man fell to the concrete floor.
He suffered serious injuries and was brought to the Salzburg State Hospital with the "Christophorus 6" rescue helicopter.
Rapeer in South Africa: twice life imprisonment
Nine months after the brutal rape and mutilation of a 17-year-old girl in South Africa, the perpetrator was sentenced to twice a lifetime on Friday.
This was reported by SABC.
The victim died later on from the consequences of the serious injuries.
Johannes Kana had been found guilty at the beginning of the week of the crime.
The act had caused horrors throughout the country.
The then 21-year-old raped Anene Booysen in February in an industrial site in Bredasdorp near Cape Town.
For 14 hours the doctors fought for the victim's survival, but in vain.
The sight of the young people was so terrible that the nurses and sisters needed psychological assistance.
Kana had admitted to be in a bar during the trial night with Booysen.
He was also able to beat and rape her, but he opposed being responsible for the death of the girl.
At first, the police had gone out of prison by several perpetrators, but released two suspects because the evidence against them did not suffice.
The prosecutor also stressed during the trial that she was convinced that Kana was alone at the time of the attack.
In South Africa rapes are part of everyday life: annual, there are some 64,000 ads of sexual violence.
These are almost ten times as much as in Germany, but with 82 million people, they have significantly more inhabitants than South Africa (50 million).
Police and women's associations in South Africa value the dark figures in sexual violence but on the 10 to 25 times.
Jumbo visits the Black Forest ham
Jumbo looking for the "best ham in the world": For the TV broadcast "Galileo", the Pro7 star Bonndorf visited.
The speaker makes it clear right at the beginning: the most important thing for the ham are the pig's culls, Turbomast is not a good condition.
Can ham you get in every supermarket be a quality product?
Uli, head of the large ham factory in the Black Forest, explains Jumbo's operation of the company "Adler" in Bonndorf.
"Germany's dearest ham", as Jumbo announces the Black Forest ham.
Only with hair protection and kettle does he come into the factory.
Jumbo also needs to disinfect his hands before he can grab the micro.
Jumbo sighted for strengthening fast food in forest hut
"This is where huge amounts of work are being done," amazements the TV makers, Black Forest hams as a mass product.
16,000 Colognes per week speak for themselves.
Weight, fat content, color: Uli explains what the quality is.
Most pigs are slaughtered at the age of six months.
Television with level?
Details such as the Ph-value of the meat also play a role.
The darker the flesh, the higher the ph-value.
"There I am excited when you measure Roberto Blanco, what happens then," says Jumbo cynically.
Here the level of private television is presented in pure culture.
But watching is still worth watching.
The viewer sees that cutting the Cologne is still hand-worked.
Because: Black Forest ham is traditional without finding bones in the shelf.
The secret of the ham is the mixture of spices with the salt.
The smoke tower and smoke-fire remind Jumbo visually of a "U-boat".
The trick: fir branches here in the smoke provide for the special taste of the Black Forest ham.
20 days in the smoke make the ham almost black.
"Now the disc disappears in the Jumbo," he announces the test feed.
"This is really delicious," says the conclusion of the TV star.
This will enable everyone involved to live.
You thought travel agencies belong to the past thanks to the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to be resisting the trend.
The company has increased its profit prospects for the year as a whole and expects record revenues from holidaymakers in Australia and Great Britain.
The travel company now expects a adjusted annual profit before taxes between 325 and 340 million dollars, compared to 305 to 315 million dollars in its previous forecast.
When the current target values are achieved, this means an increase of 12 to 17 percent compared to the record profit of 290.4 million dollars in the period 2011/12.
As CEO Graham Turner announced, in the first half of the year, Flight Centre gained eight percent profit and made a strong start to the second half of the year, especially in the Australian and British private business.
"Since the beginning of the year, our ten countries have been profitable, and some of them are well in the direction of record revenue before interest and taxes," he said.
These include Australia and Great Britain, which are typically among our strongest winners.
In Australia, the leisure industry recovered in the second half of the year, resulting in a slightly weaker market for business travel.
Similarly well it went for the leisure business of Flight Centre in Great Britain, while also business customers were less spending.
The US business recovered from the seasonally weaker first half of the year, so a profit for the year as a whole is expected for the third year in a row.
Flight Centre's shares rose by 3 cents to $38.20 last night.
Schools are considered to be more focused on mathematics, spelling and grammar
In courses on English literature, students will have to treat at least one piece of Shakespeare, a 19th-century novel, romantic lyrics and contemporary British novels from 1914 onwards.
The test also contains 'unseen texts' to stimulate wider reading.
The combined course of English literature and language is abolished.
Starting in 2015, students will have to carry out an independent GCSE examination for language, with strong incentives for selecting English literature as a separate qualification.
The Ministry of Education will publish tomorrow’s new curriculums for English and mathematics – the first subjects that have been radically reformed.
Other core barrels will be changed next year.
In a separate initiative, Ofqual, the audit supervisor, will announce a reorganisation of the GCSE structures, including a new pricing system and less price work.
In a speech in summer, Minister of Education Michael Gove said that there is a "wide consensus that we need to reform our audit system in order to restore public confidence", stressing that the GCSEs would "be more demanding, ambitious and strict".
Studies show that in English schools less time is spent on mathematics – 116 hours per year or three hours per school year – than in most other countries.
On the other hand, Australian schools teach on average 143 hours a year and students in Singapore receive 138 hours.
While there will be no formal requirement to provide more time for mathematics in the timetable, coalition circles say that the comprehensive math examination – combined with a stronger weighting of the subject in ranking lists – will probably encourage schools to use more hours.
More attention will be paid in the curriculum to 'problems from the right life', including financial issues.
Beautiful animals and delicious cakes attract
The most beautiful rabbits of different races and colorings are presented by the Kreisverbandsdienstsau on this weekend in the Bürgerhaus.
The evaluations have already been made on Thursday.
Again, the local association W514 is setting up this large exhibition.
Breeders of the associations in the district of Soest show their best animals here as well as young Wickeder hobby farmers their rabbits.
On Thursday six prize judges presented the evaluation of the numerous rabbits and were able to mark outstanding animals.
Visitors to the show are well informed as the assessment of all animals is appropriate to the cages.
The official opening of the exhibition will be held by Mayor Hermann Arndt on Saturday at 2.30 p.m.
The rabbit show is open to all visitors on Saturday from 10 a.m. and on Sunday from 10 a.m. to 15.30 p.m., where the award ceremony begins.
The guests are also invited to a Tombola and a delicious cafeteria, which is decorated with local prices.

Salem: Johanna Rahner at the Ecumenical Talk Forum
At the next Ecumenical Talk Forum on Monday, 21 October, the New Museum of the Castle is about the topic "To Hell with Hell - Theological considerations about the treatment of the last things today".
Speaker is Professor Johanna Rahner.
The Ecumenical Discussion Forum is an initiative of the Catholic and Protestant churches of Salem, Salem Castle and the Bodenseekreis Cultural Office.
In the forum, Johanna Rahner wants to consider how people today will measure the "last things" after death.
If people in the past centuries had known too much of it and had placed on those images of heaven and hell, "who have shaped our ideas to this day", the contemporary prophetic doctrine of the hopes of completion is rather due to a certain embarrassment or even speechlessness.
"The greater hope has been properly driven out by Christians through the criticism of religion," says the speaker.
She "has provided us with so many question marks that the exclamation marks seem to have come to us".
Johanna Rahner continues: "But the crucial challenge remains the trouble of death".
With this is the question of that yearning, "that dreams that in the end everything may be good".
Johanna Rahner, born in 1962 in Baden-Baden, studied Catholic Theology and Biology at the University of Freiburg from 1982 to 1989.
She received her Ph.D. in 1997 from Dr. Theol., also in Freiburg.
The habilitation of fundamental theology and ecumenical theology followed in 2003 at Wilhelms University in Westphalia.
Since 2010, Johanna Rahner has been chair of Systematic Theology at the Institute of Catholic Theology at the University of Kassel.
Geislingen: More than 100 young Catholics from the Kleine Heuberg reaffirm their creed at the firming
In two divine services 101 15- and 16-year-olds of the Soul Care Unit Am Kleinen Heuberg have been founded.
On the morning, the service was accompanied by the Laudato-Si group, in the afternoon of the Youth Choir The Spirit.
With the reception of the firmware, the young people said yes to their baptism and asked for the power of the Holy Spirit.
In recent months, under the direction of Diakon Reiner Dehner and the assistance of many parishioners, the firmwares had prepared themselves for the great holiday.
In different projects, they learned different tasks of the Christian community life and shared their experience of the youth day in Untermachtal.
Illmensee: Second mountain bike race inspires participants
In wonderful weather, 214 cyclists came to Illmensee to take the round course over the hill chains around the lake.
This tells Ulrich Knobel of the organizing sports club Illmensee.
Among the participants were, in particular at the short distance of 15 kilometers and 300 metres, also numerous everyones cyclists who once wanted to practice their hobby in competition atmosphere.
Two junior drivers of the German top class were also at the start in this competition: Felix Bader from Bad Waldsee and Pascal Treubel from Aachen-Linz came with the recommendation good rankings at the German Championships.
These two could be expected to get out of the field.
As in the previous year, Felix Bader was able to save a small time gap to the finish and defend his title as overall winner of the short distance.
In the second place Pascal Treubel could once again place himself.
At the ladies it was Theresa Duelli from the team nightmare that made it on top of the winning steps.
Anne Adel from Illmensee and Leonie drivers from Owingen came in second and third place.
An encouraging development is the increasing number of drivers who live or work in the municipality.
Not only in terms of performance was the whole range of athletes represented.
The age structure also ranged from ten years for the youngest to over 70 years with the oldest starters.
In the main race this year there were even more absolute topathists at the start.
Four drivers were able to take off from the top regional drivers.
Among them Philipp Pangerl, a mountain bike half-profi from the Black-Tusk-Racing team.
Pangerl was already the world champion in the twelve-hour ride together with a team-mate.
This year he became European champion in this special discipline.
In addition, Roland Ballerstedt, who already mentions two German champions in the duathlon as his own.
After 45 kilometers and 900 metres of altitude, a whimper finale came to the finish in front of the three-sea hall.
Pangerl was the first to race across the finish line.
The Routinier Ballerstedt was able to win the second place in the overall ranking.
At the same time, Hermann and Warthmann as a third party came to the finish.
In the ladies' ranking Christiane Cohsmann was the time fastest in the main race.
Areane Blersch took second place from Binzwangen before Natasha Werner from Stuttgart.
Sportsmen and helpers were very satisfied with the smooth and well organized course of the event.
On the way through mud, rivers and jungles for free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle brings free medical assistance to remote villages in Cameroon
Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend treating hundreds of patients
In the West African country there are not many doctors, only one for 5,000 people
Vote here or with your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 of the "CNN Heroes of 2013".
You can vote for him or one of the other heroes in the Top 10 to choose him as "CNN Hero of the Year".
The winner receives $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years Georges Bwelle saw how his sick father repeatedly lost consciousness and traveled to hospitals that did not have the means to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in 1981 in a car accident near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
First he had only a broken arm, but then there was an inflammation that spread to his brain and caused a hematoma there that would affect him for the rest of his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," says Georges Bwelle.
We would have brought him out of Cameroon if we had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years accompanying his father in crowded clinics and hospitals to get the treatment they had to offer.
"It's not easy," says Bwelle.
You can leave the house at five in the morning and run to the hospital to be the first one, and you're not the first one.
There are a lot of patients.
Some people even die because they have to wait.
The situation has hardly changed since Bwelle's father died in 2002.
In Cameroon there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organization.
On the other hand, the relationship in the United States is with a doctor for 413 people.
But even if a doctor did, most Camerooners could not afford to visit.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line and nearly three-quarters of health spending in the country is private.
"The only problem they have is poverty," says Bwelle.
And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life.
His father and so many of his compatriots suffered in Bwelle to make a decision to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer team performed 700 free operations last year.
He became a doctor himself and works as a vascular surgeon at the Central Hospital in Yaoundé.
He also founded a non-profit organisation called ASCOVIME, which travels on weekends in rural areas and offers free medical care there.
Since 2008, he and his volunteer group have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 people shov themselves in small buses and drive on the roof with the shredded medical equipment over unpaved terrain to the villages that need help.
It doesn't always go smoothly.
More than once they had to push the vehicles through rivers and mud.
But when they arrive, they are received like heroes: a feast, singing and dancing and the best accommodation the place has to offer.
In these villages, free medical care is really a reason for celebrating and bwelling – with its wide smile and its limitless energy – is happy to attend the joyous celebration.
The next morning, the team will start studying hundreds of patients.
"We treat 500 people per trip," says Bwelle.
They come from a radius of 60 kilometres around the village – and this on foot.
Each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others receive crutches, glasses or free birth certificates – a document that is necessary for school, but many poor families simply cannot afford.
In the evenings, the team performs simple operations with local stunning.
Operations usually take place in a school, town hall or apartment; after the operation, the patients stand up and go to the recreation area to make room for the neighbor.
The lighting for the surgery and disinfection equipment is fed by the generator of the group, so Bwelle and his volunteers work until early morning hours on Sunday.
It is a strenuous pensum, but the village musicians usually help keep the team motivated.
"They're drumging all night, so we can stay awake and continue our work," says Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team will return to the city, tired but proud of the work done.
The group – a mixture of Cameroonn doctors and foreign medical students – carried out 700 free operations last year and knows that with her work she makes a huge difference for the people she helps.
A man explained that the free operation of a performance break he had received now allows him to work again.
"This changes the future of my family," the man said.
In addition to the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon in the hospital, Bwelle also works at night in private clinics in Yaoundé.
With this second job he finances 60% of his non-profit activity, according to Bwelle; the rest of the tribes from private donations.
"I really don't know when he's asleep," says Katie O'Malley, who studied medicine at Drexel University in Philadelphia in the second year and volunteered in Bwelles Group.
He's always in the hospital or trying to raise money for the organization so that he can go on these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students like O'Malley, who come from the USA and Europe and support Bwelle, this is a chance to gain practical experience that they would never get at home.
"We can be in operations where we help to remove blood or hold the instruments for Dr. Bwelle," explains O'Malley.
This would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year.
Students usually pay for their journey to Cameroon themselves and bring often donated sanity material.
But once they are in Yaoundé, Bwelle takes over accommodation, transportation and guidance.
"He is no doubt a hero," says O'Malley.
He dedicates his life to this organization and his desire to help the Cameroonn people knows no bounds.
For Bwelle, almost constant work is not a burden.
Helping others to a happier life and to fulfill a promise he has given his father brings him great joy.
"I'm so happy to do this work," says Bwelle.
And I'm thinking about my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
I do it to make people laugh again and to ease the pain.

Excellent mastered the fight
The role of Santiago, the old man in Hemingway's novel "The Old Man and the Sea", is cut to the body.
Janson himself is an old hare in his meteor, acting art.
No one can do anything to the old man Santiago while fishing.
That's how the two just complement.
It's almost supposed to be able to see the folds in the neck of the old man, whom the fisherman speaks of Manolo.
If Santiago sits tired of life bent on the chair, it's Janson's real.
In addition, the role of the old fisherman is through and through a role of character which Janson excels in excellence.
Hemingway told the story of a fighter, a courageous man who did not give up and eventually won the fight against the fish through his knowledge and his will.
Janson is on stage alone as a solo actor.
He manages to focus the attention of the audience on himself, so that his monologue is not a moment boring.
His efforts to finally draw the fish to the surface of the water are so real that the spectators forget that the sea is only made of blue-lit water bottles.
Director Jens Hasselmann has the old man in the boat in front of the fishing village.
In the course of the performance, he highlights the active scene: Santiago's hut, the bar of the singer Marie-Luise's favor, which sings with her songs and her magnificent voice the feeling of life Cuba.
The four musicians play Cuba's rhythm and are guests of the bar at the same time.
Tourism: descent to the Romans
A waste water channel from the Roman era is below Cologne for about 120 meters in length.
Whoever visits Cologne does not pass the cathedral.
Around 157 meters the two towers rise into the sky and make it the second highest church building in Europe.
But only a few visitors who marvel at the two filigree church towers realize that there is also a lot to discover under the cathedral.
Rainer Schulze is an expert on Cologne underworld.
Meeting point for its guided tours is the service center of Cologne Tourism directly on the Cathedral.
The tour starts unspectacularly: "We start in the underground garage," Schulze says.
In the 1970s, the city fathers wanted an automobile-right city, so the remains of the old city walls remained standing only what was not too big.
Most of the users of the car park are therefore passing the Roman remains today and just leaving their car.
But if you look more closely, the Parkdeck D2 discovers an archaeological site separated by metal grating rods.
There are about five meters high ruins of hand plate-sized stones.
"There are remains of the Roman city wall, which was built in the second half of the first century after Christ," explains Schulze.
Before it goes back to daylight, Schulze lets the participants on the upper park level take a look at a dark, 15 meters deep shaft.
This is the fountain of the old cathedral, which unfortunately is hardly seen either.
Next stop of the tour is the prestorium, and here the participants climb back down to the depth.
We experience here the seat of the once most powerful man north of the Alps, the Preator of the CCAA.
What CCAA means, a visitor wants to know.
"The abbreviation stands for "Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium", which means in good German as much as "City of Roman Right and City of the Agrippinenses, founded under Emperor Claudius at the place of the altar for the imperial cult".
And the premium is the former palace of governors, the center of power of the Roman Empire on the Rhine.
A tunnel access to the Roman wastewater canal leads from the exhibition's front space, which is preserved at about 120 metres in length.
"You can walk along the so-called Cloaca Maxima quietly if you want," Schultze informs the guests.
Schulz still has a surprise.
After obtaining the key at the cash desk, he leads the group to a 16-metre deep, walkable shaft.
"We are now in the Mikwe, a ritual Jewish bath," he explains.
The Jewish community built its bath deep into the ground to reach the groundwater that was indispensable for the ritual washings.
To date, different water levels can be read by changing levels of the Rhine in the lower end of the Mikwe, whose origins date back to the eighth century.
The Mikwe will be part of an archaeological zone on the Town Hall Square for which the construction work will begin shortly.
However, a few more years will end until completion.
Leg almost hacked: New edition of rocker process
A bloody attack in the rocker environment is rolled up after over four years.
A trial against two 30-year-olds has begun before the Landgericht Frankfurt (Oder) because of attempted death, dangerous physical injury and damage to the property.
It is accompanied by strict security arrangements.
The defendants are silent to start.
They were supposed to have been active in the rock scene and then belonged to the bandidos.
In June 2009, together with unknown compliments in Finowfurt, the public prosecutors proposed that three men have come into a car and hit it.
All the victims were severely injured, a man almost lost his leg.
The victims are supposed to have belonged to the competing group of Hell's Angels.
One should have been a high-ranking member from Berlin.
It seems that before was a multiple-car chase.
According to the charge, it was about reviation struggles and a demonstration of power.
The two defendants had been acquitted in a first trial at the beginning of 2012.
A court judge said that it could not have been proved that the men were actually involved in the bloody feud.
The perpetrators had carried masks and had not been recognized.
The Bundesgerichtshof lifted the verdict after revision of the public prosecutor's office and dismissed it to the Landgericht for further proceedings.
One of the defendants is currently in open execution because of another criminal.
The main focus was on the reconstruction of the procedures in the night of the act.
As a witness, the commissioner at the time was invited.
The center was the cell phone calls of the defendants and other people who had stopped the police.
It's difficult that Rocker almost always adheres to a law that's better for her - and doesn't say it.
This also applies to the victims.
In the first process, only one of the victims had broken out.
Public prosecutor Stefan Golfier from Frankfurt Public Prosecutor's Office (Oder) said on demand that new traces have been revealed since the last procedure.
The process is subject to eleven further negotiation days.
The removal company doesn't think
The night was long, the music was loud and the mood was good, but eventually it went home.
Only: In the bulges of the people on the passenger and rear seat the hunger becomes evident.
Of course, some cocktail or sect may be responsible for this!
What's closer than going to the next drive-in to get a little girl?
I admit, I like to join you when it comes to fast food late or early morning.
A few pommes, a cola, a burger - and then nothing like home and bed!
But on the way home, the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco-genders are evident.
Because what must be missing is that with constant regularity you throw out of the car window its fast-food bags?!
Especially on weekends there are discarded paper bags on street edges and on parking spaces.
"Why?" I wonder.
Are people too deaf to take the bags home respectfully to the next trash?
It's not just a matter of the paperwork damaging the landscape.
Tüten has also covered transport facilities such as guidance boards and thus caused accidents.
However, what "return company" thinks about, it probably does not even know what this word actually means.
When you're on the road more often in the evening, only with several people in the car, you know how a back seat can look like after day-to-days: clothes, bottles and other wastes are ringing.
There would be more or less nothing to do - in contrast to the street, where no one wants to trample on the food leftovers of others.
I already see the day when the cities and communities will fail to clear the way out - and the fast-food chains will have to demand a pledge for their bags.
Obama's withdrawal in health policy
After harsh criticism, President Obama made a withdrawal yesterday in his frequently repeated, clear promise: "If you like your health insurance, then you can keep it."
After hundreds of thousands of their insurers received a notice of termination, the Republicans asked the president in recent days that he had deceived the American public.
Yesterday Obama relativized his original promise.
"The vast majority of citizens who have a working health insurance can keep them," he said in Boston.
In response to the numerous media reports on terminations, Obama invited those Americans who received such communications to look for new insurance on the free market.
Most citizens could get a better, more comprehensive health insurance for the same price or cheaper than forecast.
"They're getting a better offer," he said.
The government called it little surprising that the five percent of the population who have actually completed insurance would have to look for another tariff, as their contract does not comply with the new standards under the Affordable Care Act.
"I would like to say directly to these Americans: you have earned better," said Sebelius at a hearing before the Energy and Trade Committee of the House of Representatives in Washington.
Sebelius, responsible for implementing the Affordable Care Act, stated that the launch of the online platform has been "miserable" since October.
"I am just as frustrated and angry as everyone else," she said.
I'm determined to regain your trust.
This statement by a sebelius who sat behind her was taken up by a hearing in the House of Representatives yesterday after a debate with the Republican MP Billy Long from Missouri. It was about whether she should be obliged to participate in Obamacare.
After more than three hours of hearing, Long Sebelius repeatedly urged the question of why the "architectin" of the Affordable Care Act had not voluntarily waived a state-funded insurance in order to complete a tariff at HealthCare.gov itself, which they now want to sell millions of Americans.
Government in Jerusalem does not confirm attack on Syrian Air Force support
A U.S. government official who wanted to remain anonymous claimed on Thursday to the American news station CNN that Israeli fighters had attacked an air force base in the Syrian Latakia one day earlier.
According to CNN, the aim was to have been "racial and related equipment" of which the Israeli government feared that they were intended for Lebanese Hezbollah.
Syrian and Lebanese media as well as the Arab station Al-Arabiya had previously reported that the base in the port city of Latakia had been shot from Wednesday to Thursday and that the Israelis were responsible for it.
The Israeli TV channel 2 showed satellite images of the Latakia base, on which Russian S-125 Newa defense missiles and a battery of SA-3 rockets could be seen, according to Channel 2, with a range of 35 kilometres and transporting explosive heads up to 70 kilograms.
Uncertain The government in Jerusalem has not officially confirmed the attack.
However, the Reuters news agency quotes an also anonymous Israeli government official as saying that he believes that Israel has launched the attack, but is not safe.
A spokesman from the Israeli Ministry of Defense said: "We do not comment on these reports".
In the newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth, journalist Ron Ben-Yishai stressed that the Syrian regime had already tried, partly successfully, to deliver ground-air missiles to the Hezbollah.
The Israeli government had repeatedly warned against any attempt by Syria to supply Hisbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons that meant crossing a "red line" that would follow a military response.
In an unprecedented admission, John Kerry states that the U.S. spying was "unapproached too far"
John Kerry, with an unexpected admission, indicated that the United States' resistance to their surveillance programmes had been avoided by saying that the espionage was "unapproached too far in certain cases".
The Foreign Minister also admitted that he, together with Barack Obama, was responsible for having taken the car pilot when the explosive revelations of Whistleblower Edward Snowden about the spying activities of the NSA became public.
Due to the information sent through, the U.S. government has become a diplomatic storm of disarmament from the sides of its allies.
In a speech transmitted via a video link at the Open Government Conference in London, Kerry said: "The President and I, as well as others in the government, have experienced a few things that have almost been done by autopilot, simply because the ability to do with what is still going on in the Second World War and the difficult years of the Cold War and, of course, on 11 September."
He then, as the first high-ranking member of the US government, admitted that the US spy had crossed a border, but also stressed that no rights had been abused.
He said: 'In some cases this has gone too far.'
The President is determined to create clarity and therefore conducts a thorough investigation so that no one has to feel that abuse takes place here.
I assure you that the rights of innocent people in this process are not affected.
Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA was a power of good and that their surveillance operations saved many lives.
He added: "We have to do with a new world in which people are willing to blow themselves into the air."
There is a radical extremism in the world that is determined to kill people, blow into the air and attack governments.
So what if you were able to capture it and stop it before it happened?
We have actually prevented aircraft crashes, attacks on buildings and the killing of people, because we have experienced such plans in advance.
Meanwhile, US-American legislators will travel to Europe to dispel the concerns about the alleged American espionage and convince Europeans of the need to continue working with the US in the anti-terrorism efforts, as stated by the chairman of the Senate subcommittee on European Affairs on Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy from Connecticut said that he had talked to representatives of the European Parliament and other people this week and was concerned about their threats of being no longer involved in anti-terrorist organizations due to frustration over the supervision of the National Security Agency.
"It is very important for the US's national security interests that Europeans remain on board with regard to our joint efforts against terrorism," said Murphy, who is a Democrat for the first time in the Senate and is the chairman of the Senate subcommittee on Foreign Relations and European Affairs, in an interview in Washington.
I also go to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism, regardless of their anger over the NSA programmes.
Media reports, according to which the NSA has collected millions of telephone data in Europe, have burdened relations with some U.S. allies, although the head of the intelligence department this week stated that the reports were inappropriate and based on a misunderstanding of the metadata collected by NATO allies and exchanged with the United States.
Other revelations quoted from documents passed by Snowden, according to which NSA monitored the phone of Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other heads of state worldwide.
The head of the national intelligence services, James Clapper, defended the spying of allies as necessary and stated that this was common on both sides.
In all the tumult, Murphy, his authority prepared the journey of the Congress to take place this year, and hoped that the delegation would include members of both parties and chambers.
The names of the other participating Members will be published in the coming days.
He said the exact route is still underway.
While Murphy stressed that the purpose of the trip was to improve relations, he also mentioned that there would be some "most recent words".
He said that European governments would have to be honest with their people about the kind of espionage programmes they themselves have been using for years.
"While we can change our surveillance programmes and thus protect the rights of Europeans better, they must also be based on the fact that we are not the only ones spying," says Murphy.
Meanwhile, John Kerry is on a weekend trip to the Middle East and to Poland to deal with the grroll about the US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran as well as US surveillance activities.
A persistent injury to the jump joint threatens to prevent Nicolai Müller from using the FSV Mainz 05 in the Bundesliga outback game at the FC Augsburg.
Mainz uses Nicolai Müller.
He'll try to train with the team tomorrow.
So far, he has only been able to do so individually.
"We will decide on his commitment in the short term," said coach Thomas Tuchel.
The 40-year-old hopes to have his best goal protectors with six hits.
Because the Mainzers already have to give up the injured performance carriers Niki Zimling, Julian Baumgartlinger and Niko Bungert.
Australian enlists appeal against prison sentences in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney who was sentenced to 15 days in Phuket's prison because she wrongly claimed to have been raped by a taxi driver has filed appeal against the judgment and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was first found guilty of a provincial court in Phuket on June 15th, to have made a false statement after stating to the Thai police that a local taxi driver had raped her in the morning hours on Sunday, June 10, while two other men held her.
Later, however, the recordings of a video camera showed that she had come safely to her hotel after she had been separated from her Australian friend.
The Phuket police interrogated Bamford for two days until she managed to think out the story.
Until the trial, she was on-site in police custody.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison sentence in a low security prison at Phuket's edge, instead of a prison for adult women.
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks, a former player of the Australian Rubgy League, who turned to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra with a request for help for his daughter.
Tunks told the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney that the whole family was "extremely concerned" about the well-being of his daughter and wanted her back in Australia.
"We are of course very worried, but we hope she will be back home as soon as possible," said Tunks.
Bamford has filed an appeal against the judgment and is free against a deposit of 50,000 Baht.
In Australian reports it was to be read that she is on vacation in the resort of Krabi in southern Thailand.
From the court it was to be heard that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket and was warned that the appeal could also lead to the imposition of a higher penalty of up to two years in a prison for adults.
However, it is also possible that, following the recent murder of the travel merchant Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand may be trying to improve its beaten tourist image, and it is therefore an acquittal.
