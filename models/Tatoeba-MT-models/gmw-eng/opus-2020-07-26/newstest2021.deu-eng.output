Mamming: Corona mass infection: 174 harvest helpers infected
After a corona mass infection on a large vegetable farm in the Lower Bavaria mamming, almost 500 people are among quarantines and are no longer allowed to leave the farm.
A security service is monitoring the ban.
A total of 174 harvest helpers were tested positively on the Corona pathogen Sars-CoV-2, as reported by the Landratsamt Dingolfing-Landau on Saturday evening.
"In order to avoid further spread, we must, unfortunately, take this step to protect the population," said Landrat Werner Bumeder (CSU).
Previously, seven employees had already been infected in the plant - this was the occasion for the series test.
The farm is a large vegetable farm, the strawberries, cucumbers, coal and red beet are grown, but the cucumbers are only for inlay glasses.
Mamming is a rural community with well 3300 inhabitants not far from Dingolfing with its large BMW factory.
Treeder appealed to the citizens to maintain peace: "Our information is a closed circle of persons".
In the yard infected by uninfected employees were separated, the site is now surrounded by a barrier fence.
Greens and SPDs gave co-responsibility to the state government.
The two opposition groups accused Prime Minister Markus Söder (CSU) and his cabinet of neglecting the control of seasonal workers' accommodation.
"This can be bitterly revenged if such local infections have to be eliminated and regional lockdowns arranged," said Jürgen Mistol, the Parliamentary Managing Director of the Greens.
This is similar to the SPD: "After the Corona eruption in the Wiesenhof-Schlachthof in mid-May, we have already called for a special control program for farms with harvest workers," said Environmental expert Florian von Brunn.
"In our view, the hygiene conditions at the workplace and the housing conditions need to be carefully controlled.
This has obviously not happened."
The outbreak has come with an announcement.

Report: Seehofer pushes for longer data storage
The stock data storage is currently exposed.
Federal Minister Horst Seehofer, however, requests an extension of the storage period after a media report.
He wants to strengthen the fight against child abuse.
Following a media report, Federal Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU) calls for extended data storage - instead of the planned ten weeks for half a year.
As the "Image on Sunday" reports, Seehofer asked Minister of Justice Christine Lambrecht (SPD) in a letter for a quick legislative change.
Seehofer therefore wants to strengthen measures against child abuse.
He felt it would be useful "to make necessary adjustments in the law already now", the paper quoted from the letter.
The stock data storage is currently exposed.
A decision by the ECJ is expected.
However, Seehofer wants to make the changes in advance so that they can be applied immediately after a possible positive judgment, it continues in the report.
A spokesman from the Ministry of Justice told the newspaper that only if the courts had decided, it would be useful to consider whether legal adjustments would be necessary.
In the fight against child abuse and child pornography, Seehofer, together with the interior ministers of the countries, had already expressed his support for a data storage system in June.
NBA: Stripclub-arrestor for Clippers-Star Lou Williams
Exciting the NBA!
Lou Williams (33), a basketball pro of Los Angeles Clippers, is said to have left the tournament quarter in Disney World in Orlando/Florida with permission for a funeral.
According to the U.S. media reports, he visited the strip club "Magic City" in Atlanta in the evening.
Williams, who is supposed to have admitted to the visit according to ESPN data, is back in isolation, is tested daily on Covid-19.
His reason for the visit: Chicken Wings.
In February last year, "Sweet Lou", as it is called in the NBA, has already expressed his love for just these Wings.
The American wrote: "Magic City and Blue Flame (a different strip club in Atlanta, a.d. R.) have the best Wings in the city".
NBA insider Shams Charania announced on Sunday on Twitter that the NBA had ordered Williams a ten-day quarantine.
The clippers star thus misses the first two official matches after the test game phase.
In Disney World, NBA wants to play the corona season.
Currently, the best 22 teams are preparing for the season finals starting at the night on Friday.
Söder expresses itself after mass infection to the corona site
Munich - Health Minister Melanie Huml (CSU) has already announced a teasing for large farms on Sunday.
The press conference will be available live on our homepage.
The case in Momming in the district of Dingolfing-Landau has sued authorities and politics.
At the large vegetable farm are currently working almost 500 harvest helpers from several countries, more than a third of them have been infected with the corona pathogen.
The farm is now under quarantine and is locked with a fence of construction.
No one is allowed to leave the site, food will be delivered.
The authorities now offer free corona tests to the well-known 3300 inhabitants of the municipality.
Since the harvest workers had little contact with the local population, the Landrat has so far assumed that the infections have not spread beyond the yard.
"Fist of conscience": confession by Nantes's alleged arsonist
"My client has shown himself cooperative," said lawyer Quentin Chabert of the newspaper.
The defender added: "He regrets the deeds very much, the confession was a liberation for him".
His mandate was "puffed with conscience and taken very much of the extent of destruction".
In the event of a conviction, according to the prosecutor’s office, the man threatened ten years of imprisonment and a fine of 150,000 euros.
The Gothic Saint Peter and Paul Cathedral in Nantes had been severely damaged at night on Saturday last week in a fire.
The fire broke out in three places far apart in the church.
Laboratory tests hardened the suspicion of arson.
The suspect who was now detained had been arrested a few hours after the fire.
He was released after a day.
The man works as a volunteer for the diocese of Nantes and was responsible for closing the cathedral on the eve of the fire.
Since there was no sign of a violent intrusion into the church, he quickly got into the eye of the investigators.
Discuss the abolition of the 50+1 rule
The former DFB President Reinhard Grindel recommended thinking about the abolition of the 50+1 rule.
"The German football should at least discuss the conditions and clear rules for investors before the EU Commission creates completed facts," said Grindel of the "image on Sunday".
He stressed: "The 50+1 rules do not work for the clubs, which can become dangerous to the earliest Bayern and Dortmund: see Leipzig or Leverkusen.
In this respect, the debate is not about whether it is appropriate to facilitate the involvement of investors by associations wishing to break into this Phalanx".
However, he has doubts as to whether there is a willingness in the German Football League to allow majority stakes that are prohibited in the Bundesliga by the 50+1 rule.
"There remains a legal risk of attracting investment fences in a European single market around the economic location of Bundesliga," Grindel said.
The former head of the DFB sees the danger that "at the end of the year the attempts to ensure more balance of competition in the Bundesliga only weaken the competitiveness of our top clubs at European level, but do not lead to more tension in the championship".
Even an equal distribution of TV channels will not achieve a decisive effect.
"The FC Bayern makes sales of 750 million euros, Borussia Dortmund of 500 million and RB Leipzig of 300 million.
The differences are therefore immense among the first three clubs alone.
The other 15 associations have an average household of 130 million," explained the 58-year-old.
Grindel feels betrayed with a view to the past.
"Unfortunately, there have been people who have noticed this mistake and passed it on to the press instead of addressing me," said Grindel about the acceptance of an expensive watch that led to his withdrawal in April 2019.
"I've been very busy human beings."
The gift worth about 11,000 euros he had received from a Ukrainian functionalist.
"I committed a compliance violation, and it was right to draw the consequences from it," Grindel said.
"With the ominous gift of watch, I have been completely transparent and outrageous.
Many in the DFB knew about this."
He had never "made a flour out of the present", the 58-year-old assured.
"This may be called naïve, at least this form of transparency was the complete opposite of corruption".

Investigations have been made.
Rakoczy in Bad Kissingen: Despite Historical Costumes
Although the large sauce in the spa town was missing, visitors and actors enjoyed the Rakoczy-Flair of the alternative program.
It was unusual for visitors, performers and organizers: the Rakoczy weekend without Rakoczy Festival.
But: Even if the big party mile in the city centre was missing, the masses and program heights like Saale burn, Rakoczy ball or arrest, many of the corona compliant alternative program came at their expense.
"I think we have been able to spread Rakoczy-Flair," says Kurdirector Sylvie Thormann.
The guests would have accepted it well.
In principle, one returns to the beginnings of the Rakoczy Festival, and the historical focus was on the festival alone.
Comfortable atmosphere
Vesna Konhäuser has been visiting the Rakoczy Festival Bad Kissingen with her husband for more than 25 years.
So did this time in the corona year.
The couple has made it cozy at the Luitpold casino, watching the historical ones while flirting and listening to Cuban live music at the casino restaurant.
"I also find it so pleasant," says Konhäuser.
She doesn't miss the masses of people who otherwise belong to Rakoczy.
For this, however, you lack the usual program heights, above all Saale burns on Friday evening as well as the historic fortress and final fireworks on Sunday evening.
"That's a pity.
The weather would have been great this year," she says.
Rakoczy-Reitturner to take place again
For the performers of the historical spa guests, the alternative program partly meant more work.
For example, for Christina Gold, which participates in a normal year's holiday and can be seen there on the carriage of the Kurgarten café.
This year she was walking in the city on Saturdays and Sundays in costumes.
"That's already more strenuous, or we'll have it easier," she says.
The riders' club had less to do, even though individual riders were traveling in the park.
"We very much hope that the riding quadrilles will be held again in the coming year," says the chairman Ulrike Waldhofen.
She announced that after several years of break 2021 a Rakoczy-reitturn is to take place again.
28 Corona cases in Spanish secondary Fuenlabrada
Because of a corona outbreak, Spanish football second-ranking CF Fuenlabrada is sleeping deeper and deeper into the crisis.

Radprofi Tony Martin: Career continuation imaginable
Zeitfahrerist Tony Martin is thinking about a continuation of his career.
Frankfurt/Main - The seven-time world champion Tony Martin can quite imagine continuing his cycling career.
"I'm currently working with the team on the framework conditions, how and in what way it could continue," said the 35-year-old of the "Frankfurter General Sunday newspaper".

Argentina rejects the offer of creditors
The new claims could not be met, announced by the Ministry of Economic Affairs in Buenos Aires on Saturday.
"This would not only be irresponsible, but also unfair," said one opinion.
"While 50 percent of the children in Argentina live in poverty, we cannot increase the short-term profits of our creditors".
Debts of the second largest economy in South America are no longer viable under current conditions.
Therefore, Argentina requests its private creditors to waive part of their claims of approximately 66 billion US dollars (about 59 billion euros).
If there is no agreement, the country again threatens the state pleite.
It would be the ninth default of payments in Argentine history.
Finally, creditors had called for higher interest rates on government bonds and changes to some contractual clauses.
The Argentine Government, however, is holding its last offer and is not ready for any further concessions.
Argentina is in a severe financial and economic crisis.
The inflation rate was last higher than 50 percent.
For the current year, experts expect a decline in economic power by around 10 percent.
At the end of May, Argentina had failed to calculate interest claims of 503 million US dollars and was thereby slipped into a limited default in payment.
Arrived professional - private not yet
"It's supergood" - this conclusion draws Dr. Stefanie Kramer after her first days in the Notariat in Eggenfelden.
In the end, everything went very quickly: in mid-May, Dr. Stefanie Kramer learned that she will succeed Lutz Feller in the Eggenfelden notary office.
Six weeks later, at the beginning of July, the doctoral lawyer took up the work, and the normal daily business runs on full tours for a long time.
"But I still have to arrive," she explains in conversation with the Rottal Scoreboard and laughs.
Of course, the short lead time did not reach the point of food from Regensburg to Eggenfelden, reports the native Dingolfinger.
She is currently looking for a suitable apartment or house in the city with her husband, who works as a judge at the Landgericht in Regensburg.
At least her husband could still apply for parental leave in the short term in order to ensure the care of the two daughters (31⁄2 and 11⁄2 years old).
In order not to have to commute from Regensburg every day, she also had an overnight stay with her parents in Dingolfing, the 39-year-old explains.
Growing up in the neighbouring district, the town of Eggenfelden has of course long been a term.
When visiting on site with her family over the past few months, she found that "Eggenfelden is a really nice small town".
All the more pleased she was that she had made the race in the selection process around the free position.
Her home country Niederbayern plays a central role in Dr. Stefanie Kramer's professional career: After the Jura-Studium in Passau she made her referendum time and the second state examination in Regensburg.
After several stations as notarasactor, including in Rehau and Hof in Oberfranken, Babenhausen im Unterallgäu and Regensburg - at that time she also trained the doctorate in Arbeitsrecht - in 2012 she took her first position as a notary in Rotthalmünster in the district of Passau.
In 2016 she went into parental life, it eventually followed the move to Regensburg.
Since then, she has taken over representation services in various notarial offices.
The 39-year-old explains that when the post was in Eggenfelden because of Lutz Feller's close retirement, she had come to see the right time for full professional return.
The team of its predecessor, who will take over the vacation representation at the notary office in the future, has taken over all of Dr. Stefanie Kramer - and immediately has a praise for the firm's team: "It's super good!"
The fact that she can rely on played out processes makes it easier for her to take care of the upcoming relocation of the private food point.
She has already contacted a local institution in the area of kindergarten-respective crib sites.
And everything works as desired, hopes to be able to follow her hobby here soon - and to get to know the most beautiful jogging tracks of Rottal.
BVB plans to start the league with a maximum of 15.000 spectators
Dortmund The largest German football stadium in Dortmund will not even be filled with 20 percent at the start of the season in the event of a fan return.
"As a result of the distance regime, which must be enforced, we plan at present with 12,000 to 15,000 viewers," said Borussia Dortmund's Managing Director Carsten Cramer, "days mirror".
Normally, the arena in the Revierstadt at Bundesliga games contains a bit more than 81,000 spectators.
In the ghost games of the previous season caused by the corona pandemic, the BVB had lost around four million euros per game.
Cramer, responsible for marketing, digitization and internationalization at BVB, hopes that in addition to the normal audiences, some of the around 4000 places in the hospitality area can be opened again: "It is of course a blow to the accounter when these revenues break away completely."
In view of the continuing corona crisis, all "good advice is to take a stable side length for the first time".
"If many companies are not well and 6.8 million people alone are in short-term work in Germany, then the need is limited to entertainment," said Cramer.
The Dortmund Marketing CEO praised the BVB professional for their salary-participation, which is intended to contribute to overcoming the crisis: "Of course, the players know that their salary waiver has a different effect than if we put 100 people working in merchandising on short notice."
Little Miracles: Early start in life with a few hundred grams
Harder than a pack of butter, just three tablespoons of blood in his entire body: that was Gabriel when he was born - he weighed exactly 273 grams.
The Bub is one of about 400 young people who are cared for annually at the Graz Children's Hospital.
A quarter of them weigh less than 1,500 grams, a few - like Gabriel and his brothers Raphael and Michael - are extreme lightweights with not even a kilogram of birth weight.
They are born so small and so early that neither lungs, or intestines, nor muscles are fully trained.
Her skin is sometimes so tender that they could hurt the electrodes of an EKG.
And they are so tiny that they sometimes wear doll clothes and mini-windels specially made for them.
But not so small that they are not with voice - "and like", Berndt Urlesberger smiles.
"Even if, of course, they don't scream quite as loud as big babies."
When the Whiteboard becomes the stage
Despite Corona Theater in the classroom: The Whiteboard as a stage experienced the 9th classes of the Sankt-Jakobus-Gymnasium in Abtsgmünd shortly before the start of the holiday.
Actress Julia Sylvester from the Aalen Theatre presented the production "The Home Dress" to the students by video.
After that, the students were able to exchange the piece and the performance with the actress and director Winfried Tobias via Skype.
The idea for the performance format was born in the current corona situation.
Teacher Teresa Nar was pleased about the enrichment of the teaching.
Even though at the end all the participants agreed that the direct encounter in the theatre and stage rooms would offer additional stimuli, one can also see the potential for contact in the schools in the theatre.
"If we further improve the technical framework, this could be an interesting supplement to the game operation," said director Winfried Tobias.

In 1946, she won her first Oscar in the leading role of "To Each His Own".
The film ran in Germany under the title "Mutterherz".
Three years later, the award came as the best actress in William Wyler's "The Heiress" (Die Erbin).
She was also given much recognition as a neurotic eccentricist in "Der dark Spiegel" and "Die Schlangengrube".
In 1952, Daphne du Maurier proposed her main role in filming her novel "My Cousine Rachel".
The piece has been a worldwide success.
She played with her long-standing friend, Bette Davis, in "Little Song for a Body".
From marriage to the writer Marcus Goodrich (1946 to 1953), the son Benjamin emerged.
In Paris, de Havilland married journalist Pierre Paul Galante and had his daughter Gisèle with him.
This marriage also broke up.
However, rumors about an affair with former British Prime Minister Edward Heath have never been confirmed.
"Road to Timmendorf": Beachvolleyball: Thole/Wickler miss finale at Comeback
The World Cup seconds Julius Thole and Clemens Wickler missed the finals at the beach volleyball tournament "Road to Timmendorf".
At the meeting of the top teams in Düsseldorf, they submitted their national team colleagues Nils Ehler and Lars Früggen with 1:2 (17:21, 21:17, 19:21).
In September of last year, Thole/Wickler played at the World Tour Final in Rome.
In the final game at the Rhine, their Bezwinger Ehlers/Flüggen cast a defeat against the surprise team Lukas Pfrechner and his interim partner Steven van de Velde with 0:2 (17:21, 17:21).
In addition to the show tournament, three starting places for the German championships were played in Timmendorfer Strand at the beginning of September: Armin Dollinger/Simon Kulzer, Manuel Harms/Richard Peemüller and Simon Pfreschner/Milan Sivers secured their tickets.
Kalbitz ejection from AfD confirmed - FDP speaks of "Feigenblatt"
The exclusion of Andreas Kalbitz from the AfD is from the FDP's point of view only a "fifle leaf" and does not change the character of the party.
"The AfD is the parliamentary arm of the far right in Germany.
Andreas Kalbitz is only part of the head of the iceberg of the radicals in the AfD," said the FDP internal politician Benjamin Strasser of the news agency dpa in Berlin.
On Saturday in Stuttgart, the Federal Arbitration Court of the AfD confirmed the exclusion of Kalbitz, which the Federal Board had decided mostly in May.
Kalbitz is the chairman of the AfD group in Brandenburger Landtag.
"If the AfD were really about removing right-wing extremists from their party, officials like Björn Höcke and his followers would have long since been excluded," said Strasser.
"But there is no political will in the AfD because right-wing extremism now belongs to the party".
CSU Secretary-General Markus Blume similarly said: "That Andreas Kalbitz is now excluded, says nothing and changes," he said to the "world on Sunday".
"It speaks rather volumes of how many Frenetic supporters still have a right extreme in the middle of the AfD".
Blume assumes that the AfD will again land below five percent in the event of elections.
"The days of the AfD in the parliaments are counted".
Kalbitz was one of the spokespersons of the officially dissolved "wings" around the Thüringer AfD Landes- und Gruppenspresidende Björn Höcke; the constitutional protection has taken the lead as a "secured right-wing extremist struggle".
In May, the AfD board of directors threw Kalbitz out of the party.
As a reason, he stated that Kalbitz had not indicated an earlier membership of the now forbidden extreme right-wing "Heimattreugen Deutsche Jugend" (HDJ) and of the Republicans when he entered the party.
Kalbitz contests membership in the HDJ.
The chairman of the left-wing group in Brandenburger Landtag, Sebastian Walter, also stressed that the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court did not change the character of the AfD: "The wolf has only eaten Creed.
The AfD remains a far-right party, whether with or without calbitz".
Neither the Federal Party nor the right wing were weakened by this decision.
"The maneuver of the Meuthen-Truppe is clear.
You want to escape another observation through constitutional protection and try to get through under the radar," Walter said.
"The AfD won't let go of the spirits she called.
There's nothing yet changing," said the Brandenburger SPD Secretary-General Erik Stohn, commenting on the decision in the case of Kalbitz.
"Here the AfD-Landesverband and the group held up to this day to their right leader".
The legal dispute on the membership of Kalbitz in the AfD will continue.
He announced on Saturday that he would now proceed against the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court on civil law.
North Sea Windparks deliver a good 21 percent more electricity
During the first six months of the year, the wind power plants on the German North Sea fed 11.51 terawatt hours of electricity into the grid.
That's about 21 percent more than the same period of the previous year, the network operator Tennet reported in Bayreuth.
Tennet is responsible for the transmission of the North Sea current to the mainland and the transmission by the German electricity grid.
The wind turbines on the Baltic Sea, which are not part of the Tennet grid area, have fed another 2.22 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity.
Overall, the wind current from the North and the Baltic Sea comes to 13.73 TWh, compared to 11.64 TWh in the first half of 2019.
The wind harvest at sea thus accounts for almost 19% of the total wind current in Germany, which is about four percentage points more than a year ago.
New wind farms provide higher production capacities
The increased contribution of offshore wind energy is achieved in addition to wind conditions from higher production capacities, because new wind farms have gone to the grid over the past twelve months.
If the 1270 wind power plants in the North Sea were all running at the same time, they could produce 6,7 gigawatts of electricity in a computer-based way.
The transmission capacity is sufficient; according to Tennet, it is 7.1 gigawatt.
She is expected to climb to 17 gigawatts in the German North Sea by 2030.
"In Germany and the Netherlands, we have invested 20 billion euros in the development of offshore network commitments," said Tennet Managing Director Tim Meyerjörgens.
In reality, wind farms cannot exploit their capacity at sea, but reach about 40 percent.
The record day this year is the 2nd of January, when the North Sea wind farms generated more than six gigawatts of electricity.
On average, the North Sea windwheels produce about 2.5 to 3.0 gigawatts of electricity, which corresponds to three to four nuclear power plants.
This would allow for electricity supply of nearly seven million households.
Art "Skirmish" - an exhibition by the Leipzig artist Christian Bold in the gallery of the Gmünder Kunstverein.
That was almost a small anniversary celebration at the 130.
Birthday of the Gmünder Kunstverein: The opening of the exhibition "Skirmish" with works by the Leipzig artist Christian Bold sprung the usual framework after the corona break.
Much more art friends than usual followed the dialogue between the artist and the chairman of the Kunstverein, Professor Dr. Klaus Ripper.
The musical equivalent provided the band "Defenders of the Universe" on the southern Kornhausplatz.
In the north of the gallery the club "Sandtogether" was engaged.
Freital: Windbergfest cancelled for Corona
The Windbergfest does not take place this year.
The city of Freital has canceled the three-day celebration planned in September.
In other years more than 30,000 people had visited this city festival.
"We have truly not made this decision easy and – in the awareness of how difficult it is for those involved – hoped until the last minute," said Mayor Uwe Rumberg (partyless).
"But ultimately we are here as organizers for the health of many thousand people".
For if tens of thousands had streamed to the fixed site and to the tent, minimum distances, hygiene regulations and contact tracking could not have been complied with in accordance with the current corona protection regulation.
Or the restrictions would have been so strong that there would not have been much left of a folk festival.
In addition, the organisational and monitoring effort would increase disproportionately by a multiple.
Rumberg was consoling for next year.
Then the city of Freital celebrates its 100th anniversary, including the Winterberg Festival from 7 to 9 May 2021 and the day of Saxony from 10 to 12 September 2021.
Dressage Olympic winner Werth in Achleiten not to beat
Achleiten - The six-time Olympic winner Isabell Werth was the outstanding rider at the dressage tournament in the Austrian Achleiten.
The 51-year-old from Rheinberg came to four wins on the weekend.
After winning a Grand Prix each for the start of the ordination gold and Quantaz, she was also unable to beat on Sunday at the Grand Prix Special and in the course of the course.
At the 15-year-old mare of Weihegold, Werth took a significant stand against the Austrian Victoria Max-Theurer on Abegglen on Sunday.
On Saturday, the Germans were on Quantaz clearly in front of their 34-year-old student Victoria Max-Theurer.
Werth's winner horse Quantaz belongs to Max-Theurer.
The most successful dressage rider in the world is to establish the ten-year-old stallion in the Grand Prix.
For Quantaz it was the first course ever.
Already at the first tournament in Achleiten three weeks ago, Werth had won all the important four tests.
The last of the three international tournaments is planned for 14-16 August.
Future more air traffic controllers in Worms
The Wormser Hochschule goes further into the air: "DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung" creates a professorship for "Air Traffic Management".
A corresponding contract between the university and the DFS has now been signed in Worms.
The contract was first concluded for three years and started in 2021.
With the professorship there is the possibility to allow the beginning of the studies not only in summer, but also in winter semesters.
This allows twice as many students to be trained as before.
At the same time, both the university and the DFS Air Safety Academy are equally charged with capacity.
The DFS will advise the university on the establishment and appointment of the professorship.
represented at the university since 2019
Since the summer semester of 2019, the first students have been at the University of Worms in the Air Traffic Management course as part of their training for air traffic.
This year nine students started.
So far, the experience of the DFS is very positive, the services of the students are excellent.
The combination of study and lottery training contributes significantly to further increase the attractiveness of the lottery profession.
"In these times, the promotion is not easy for us economically.
However, we strongly expect air traffic to recover and grow in the long term.
In order to be able to fulfil our statutory mandate in the future, we need highly qualified staff," says Professor Klaus-Dieter Scheurle, Chairman of the DFS at signing the contract.
"For the DFS, the Stiftungsprofessur is a future-proof investment that will provide air traffic controllers with a broad, professional knowledge base in the long term.
We therefore continue our good cooperation with the university and at the same time support our attractiveness as an employer".
This also underlines Professor Dr. Jens Hermsdorf, President of the Worms University: "The Foundation Professorship is an important bridge between science and business.
With it we would like to join the already existing cooperation with the DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung as a practical partner for the dual Bachelor's degree program Air Traffic Management".
For the Worms University, the confidence of the German Air Safety Authority is both motivation and commitment to further develop its teaching and research expertise in the future fields of aviation.
The university, with its first professorship for a dual degree course, could set very special highlights and innovative priorities for its students in the field of air traffic controllers of tomorrow.
Dr. Denis Alt, State Secretary at the Ministry of Science, Education and Culture, emphasizes: "The Worms University of Applied Sciences has an all-in-one feature in Rhineland-Palatinate with its focus on air transport.
Today's signing of the cooperation agreement strengthens the profile of the university".
Rescue helicopters land on the A 45
The A 45 motorway was fully blocked on Saturday afternoon towards Aschaffenburg, as after a traffic accident the rescue helicopters were in use.
A 76-year-old went straight in the curve with a Ford at about 12.40 a.m. in the Alzenau-Mitte exit and landed at the guiding board.
The impact caused the front airbags, the driver suffered minor injuries on the face and had to be taken to a hospital for treatment.
The injuries of the 72-year-old passenger were taken care of by the emergency doctor and the patient then flew to a hospital with the rescue helicopter.
At present, however, the police assume that there is no risk of life.
The damaged vehicle, which caused a damage of around EUR 2000, had to be removed.
Heil wants to test other industries according to meat industry
The corona crisis brought the conditions to light again in parts of the meat industry.
Law-strengthening is about to come.
But are they right - and will it remain with them?
Federal Minister for Labour Hubertus Heil (SPD) wants to review other industries in the meat industry in accordance with the now planned strict rules against malpractices.
"We will look at the industry for industry and then take appropriate measures for the respective sector if necessary," said Heil of the German Press Agency in Berlin.
Germany's employer is already warning against restricting employment contracts in general.
After the massive corona outbreak at the Fleischriesen Tönnies in Nordrhein-Westfalen, the Federal Cabinet wants to pass a law of salvation on this Wednesday.
In the case of slaughter, decommissioning and meat processing, large slugs should no longer be allowed to use foreign personnel.
To this end, the use of contract and temporary workers is to be prohibited.
Employers' President Ingo Kramer said the dpa: "Finger away from a general restriction on employment contracts and workers' leave if one does not want to completely destroy the economy".
Work contracts are, for example, the basis for their value added to customers for large areas of craftsmanship, construction and plant construction.
"The sins of individuals cannot destroy such an important instrument".
Heil assured: "My aim is not to prohibit labour contracts throughout the German economy".
Work contracts are useful.
"If an industrial company commissioned a craftsman to build a safety facility, this is a normal contract for work."
The German meat industry considers a ban on work contracts and temporary work to be unconstitutional in its sector alone.
It should not be explained why, in the future, the portioning and packaging of cheeses should be subject to different labour law than with sausages, says an opinion on the legislative project, as reported in the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" (Saturday).
According to a ban, the consumer price would rise by between 10 and 20 per cent per kilo and product.
Many East European workers from contract companies worked in the industry according to the results of an examination of the NRW occupational safety management in part 16 hours a day.
Often they didn't have a break.
Pay was retained for protective equipment or rent.
It was also established that the situation in the accommodation of employees was often miserable.
Heil said that a relatively sharp law had already entered into force for the meat industry in 2017.
But through "trick-rich constructions" these had been bypassed.
"Now it is essential to clean up".
The politician announced: "In the Labour Protection Act, which we intend to conclude in the end of July in the Cabinet, measures concerning not only the meat industry - for example, higher testing rates for occupational safety or clear criteria for Community accommodation".
The draft includes amendments to the Law on the Protection of Workers' Rights in the Meat Industry and the Labour Protection Act.
Brandenburg's Minister for Consumer Protection Ursula Nonnemacher (Green) considers that more intensive controls are needed.
"I would like us to be able to make even more checks in many areas of supervision: food control, animal protection, everything possible, for example animal transports," said Nonnemacher on Sunday in the RBB broadcast "Brandenburg Aktuell".
But more personnel are also needed for more controls.
Three dead at crash of ultralight aircraft in Germany
Three people died when an ultralight aircraft crashed on a multi-family house in Wesel in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia, according to police information.
A child was easily injured.
Two more people had been rescued in the accident, said one speaker at the Wesel District Center.
A parachute was found at the accident scene, the police say.
The "Rheinische Post" reported, calling for eyewitnesses, that before the crash the plane was collided with a hot air balloon.
At the house, it is about a one or two-family house.
Further details did not become known at first.
Location of Frankfurt Opera Square peacefully
A week after the outpourings in Frankfurt, the opening of the Opera Square in the night of Sunday was also peaceful.
Most recently, some dozens of people stayed in the square, but left him at 1:00 before the opening of the lock.
The police had been in service with numerous officers since the early evening, and a larger police force was on display throughout the city.
For the first time this weekend from midnight, there was a ban on the Opera Square, on which there was a week ago at Krawallen.
Police officers had been attacked with bottles out of the crowd.
At least five officers were injured after police inputs, several police vehicles were damaged.
The night to Saturday was also quiet.
Car overshadows: Young woman in accident at Bundesstraße 83 in Hofgeismar severely injured
In case of an accident between Schöneberg and Hümme, a 21-year-old suffered serious injuries on Sunday at about 13.25 a.m.
She was taken to the Klinikum Kassel.
With thermal imaging cameras, the fire brigade sought out possible co-drivers.
According to the police on the Bundesstraße 83, the woman was heading towards her place of residence, when her car came off the road from the road and passed over several times from the previously unexplained cause.
In order to save the injured, the fire brigade had to cut the roof of the car free.
Since it was unclear whether anyone else was in the vehicle, the adjacent corn field was selected from the conductor with a thermal image camera.
Also the Drohnenstaffel from Warburg, which also works with thermal imaging cameras, had been ordered for the person search.
The forces, however, did not find anyone between the high corn plants.
The heavy injured was brought to the Klinikum in Kassel by the rescue car.
Almost 50 forces from the Hofgeismar fire brigade, Hümme and Schöneberg were on site.
The federal road was blocked for two hours because of the accident.
Juventus Turin Master in Italy
Turin - After a rescued goal of Cristiano Ronaldo, record champion Juventus Turin secured the Italian championship for the ninth time in series.
The team around the five-time world football team made the 36th Scudetto of the club history with a 2:0 (1:0) on Sunday evening in the home match against Sampdoria Genoa.
Ronaldo met at 1:0 a.m. before mid-term.
With 83 points, Turin, which, without the last long injured ex-national player Sami Khedira, did not displace two days before the end of the series A.
The inter Milan table is seven points lower.
Juventus was harmless despite optical superiority in the first half of the year, then Ronaldo met with the last action after a release.
An example of Miralem Pjanic was the 35-year-old who used a flat shot from the penitentiary border (45.+7).
Ronaldo was also involved in 2:0 against the more offensive guests, and Federico Bernardeschi (67.) dusted off after his shot.
This ensured the smooth but decisive success.
The foulefmeter shot at the latte in the 89th minute should have only Ronaldo, with a view to the Torjager rating, correctly aggregated.
"It's complicated to stay mentally and physically at ball height for 90 minutes.
The games are strange, and the momentum changes very easily," explained Trainer Maurizio Sarri after the 1:2 at Udinese Calcio on Thursday.
Especially the mental exhaustion of its players is great, said the Juve coach.
Because of the defeat, the Turiners had not yet been able to make the championship perfect.
Last but not least, Juve had due to the weakness of the competitors, which was calming down at the top of the table.
For in the eleven matches before the Sunday match, the Sarri team had only won five.
It is questionable whether Ronaldo is still a torschützenkönig.
As the Portuguese superstar has reached 31 goals so far, the former Dortmunder Ciro Immove has already had 34 hits on his account at 5:1 (1:1) of the table fourth Lazio Rome at Hellas Verona - as many as Robert Lewandowski contributed to the win of FC Bayern.
The current Juve-Profi Gonzalo Higuaín holds the record in Italy.
The Argentinian scored 36 goals for the SSC Naples in the 2015/2016 season.
In August, the "Alte Dame" of Italian football awaits the next chance of title.
Juventus is in the eighth finale of the Champions League, but on August 7th, he has to make a 0:1 hit against Olympique Lyon in order to reach the final tournament in Lisbon.
In the next K.o. round, Real Madrid or Manchester City would wait as an opponent.
Baden-Württemberg: More than 250 illegal car races detected
Stuttgart - Despite all threatened punishments and court judgments, motorists continue to give gas in countless illegal races on the Baden-Württemberg streets: Last year and the first four months of this year, the police registered more than 250 illegal car races in the South West.
There is no comparison for the years before, but the shavers are increasingly doing work for the judicial authorities: in 2018, a total of 155 investigation proceedings were conducted in the public prosecutors between Konstanz and Mannheim because of illegal races, a year later they were already 252 and in the current year until early June 151.
There were less organized events during the races, as the Ministry of Interior replied to a request from the Landtags SPD.
In most cases, drivers have been spontaneously opposed to each other or they have taken the flight from the police - this is also shown as an illegal race.
German men aged between 18 and 60 were mainly taxed.
113 fines - 15 times imprisonment
Only in relatively few cases are the shavers caught and also asked to cash: According to the Ministry of Interior, 113 fines have been imposed since 2018 and 15 sentences for freedom have been imposed.
However, there was no evidence that the number of illegal car races actually rose.
Rather, other drivers responded more sensitively because of the tragic accidents and processes of past years and showed more frequently, said a minister speaker.
Especially popular is the motorway 8. Always again and again, motorists brake off traffic there to create space and use the free route for a race.
Last August a dozen riders near Kirchheim under Teck were caught, three months earlier there were even 18 riders on the A8 near Merklingen.
A81 is the most popular track
On the A81 the police even register more races than on any other highway.
At a speed limit, the lawn is tried to slow down on the particularly affected section between narrow and geysing.
The mostly high-priced and routed sports and luxury cars often have Swiss distinguishing marks because of the high penalties for too fast driving and car racing in the neighbouring country for lawning to Germany.
For the SPD, the speed limit should not be reduced to a few routes: "With a general speed limit of 130 kilometres we would create this problem on motorways from the body," says Martin Rivoir, the transport expert in the SPD country group.
"The inhibition threshold for shaver would be much higher if you were not to be here and there legally with 200 kilometres and more on the road."
Rivoir thinks less of education or image campaigns: "Whoever goes beyond all the rules in such a way, not only his own life, but also the lives of other road users, is hardly yet accessible with reason".
ADAC calls for stronger police intervention
On the other hand, it is not enough for the ADAC: "We assume that Razer cannot be deterred from the speed limits," says Holger Bach, Head of Transport and Environment at the ADAC Württemberg.
It calls for additional and also harder checks on the routes concerned.
Not often is more painful and follow-up from the high-touring power measurement: Since January 2019 and April 2020, three people died in the race, two of them in a night crash in Stuttgart's city centre and one in Gerlingen.
Two young men are said to have delivered a car race there in November.
One of the vehicles came off the road, pounded against a garden wall and stayed on the side, the 18-year-old passenger died.
21 more people were injured during the races of the past two years.
However, in the view of Interior Minister Thomas Strobl, sharper penalties are not necessary: "The need for legislative action to penalise illegal motor races is not seen", says the Ministry of the Interior paper.
Blue light from July 23rd: Durst intruder steals drinks from snacks
Rohrdorf: A man broke into an snack on Thursday in Rohrdorf (Kreis Calw) and stole drinks and cash.
A witness heard sounds in the valley road about 3.40 o'clock and ran toward the Imbisse.
There he noticed a man who served on the refrigerator with drinks and then left the snack by a previously struck entrance door.
The culprit fled in the direction of the meadows behind the snack.
According to police, the intruder also served at a cash desk and stole cash in the low three-digit area.
The suspect is described as follows: He is about 1.75 to 1.80 meters tall and of strong stature.
In fact, he wore a black hood powder, black pants and light shoes.
The police are taking up further evidence.
Ackermann sprints for victory on final stage on Sibiu Tour
Radprofi Pascal Ackermann won the second day at the end of the 10th Sibiu Tour.
The 26-year-old palaces of the Bora-hansgrohe team settled on the 109-kilometre-long section with the start and destination in Hermannstadt in mass sprint after he had already won a stage on Saturday.
There were the three and four seasons for Ackermann.
In the overall ranking, his Austrian teammate Gregor Mühlberger was active.
The 26-year-old had opted for the mountain season in the morning and thus took over the top in the classification.
Only 104 drivers had entered the final stage in the evening.
No less than 18 starters had fallen victim to the time limit in the mountain era.
"I'm really happy to start the new season with a victory," said Ackermann after his success on Saturday.
"The sprint was really hectic," said the 26-year-old.
300 meters before the finish he simply put on his sprint, "and it also worked perfectly".
According to the rules of the World Association of UCI, a corona test was carried out six days before the start of the race for all racers and their companions.
During the complete tour, drivers and supervisors were separated in isolated hygiene bubbles from the organizational team as well as the media.
Spectators at the start and destination were not allowed.
Introducing lay-resuscitation instruction
Düsseldorf - Tragic accident on Sunday afternoon in Düsseldorf-Garath.
In a multifamily house, a child (4) was suddenly in the water while bathing.
According to fire brigade, the emergency call started at 1 p.m.
"A control interface opponent immediately gave instructions on lay-resuscitation," said a fire fighter to BILD.
The arrival of the rescue forces took over the revitalization measures a little later.
The child in danger of life was transported to the university clinic under resuscitation.
Why it failed is unclear.
The police routinely took up the investigations on the accident.
The fire fighter: "We are going out of a tragic accident in the apartment".
Nuremberg: Unauthorised Tuning Meeting - Police intervenes, 700 vehicles and around 1100 people
Hundreds of cars and temporary more than 1000 people took part on Saturday night in a "tuning meeting" in the parking lot of a furniture house.
The police put in place their announcement to strengthen control of such events.
On Saturday evening (July 25, 2020) there was a big Tuning meeting in Nuremberg South City.
Several hundred vehicles were involved.
According to the police in Central Franconia, an increased vehicle volume in the area of a large parking area on Ingolstadt street was detected by the Nuremberg traffic police around 22.30 a.m.
The police then took a variety of vehicle controls there.
It was only recently that the police had announced that they wanted to take action against so-called car poses.
Illegal Tuning Meeting in Nuremberg: Only a small part from the "Scene"
The officials were at the top of 700 vehicles and approximately 1100 people, accounting for the police.
However, only a small proportion of those present should be assigned to the "Autoposer" and Tuning scene.
Apparently, the majority of the relevant scene followed the appeal of the police.
On the basis of the on-site vehicles and persons, it was assumed that this was mostly showy.
In addition, the majority of those present kept in mind the current anti-infection provisions, in particular the maintenance of the minimum distance and the wearing of a mouth-nasal protection.
The on-site monitoring measures were completed by 9 a.m.
Overall, in 10 vehicles, officials found such structural changes that the operating permit had been abolished.
Four of these vehicles had to be ensured.
No car racing
Illegal car races didn't exist.
"The police presence of Central Franconia will continue to keep an eye on the situation and will continue to carry out enhanced control measures, including in connection with the rise of showy people," it said.
The agency News5 spoke to Jürgen Schrödinger from the participating drop-off company: "They have all the beautiful rims that we can't scratch", Schrödinger said.
Special bands would be used for this purpose.
Also because the cars are wider, the company must be careful not to cause any damage.
"After all, the young people are supposed to keep their cars back undamaged."
Employment Agency figures: 900 suspected cases of abuse in short-term work
Berlin - The Bundesagentur für Arbeit (BA) is, according to its own statement, investigating about 900 suspected cases of abuse of short-time labour pay.
"This is extremely little for more than 880.000 companies that have shown short-term work," said Daniel Terzenbach, the Executive Board responsible for the operation of the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung".
When, at the beginning of the corona crisis, a lot of companies had suddenly applied for short-term work, BA had to react quickly.
The test normally lasts for up to three weeks.
"So much time was not available to us in this hot phase.
All the more precisely we will look at the final accounts.
I'm sure there'll be a few more things to do.
We are not naïve and have a long breath".
Indications of abuse often came from the affected employees or trade unions.
In addition, use BA analysis software to identify abuse patterns.
According to Terzenbach, the BA prepares for a possible insolvency threshold in autumn.
"Will there be much more insolvency than in the previous year?
The assessments differ, but we are preparing for the case of the case and are already training our employees in the employment agencies for the processing of applications for insolvency fees".
The figures were still inconspicuous, Terzenbach said.
World Heritage in Potsdam: Party dissolved in the New Garden
Potsdam - On Friday evening about 40 young people celebrated a party in the New Garden.
The collection was dissolved at 20.48 a.m. by the Revier Riders of the Prussian Castles and Gardens Foundation (SPSG), the foundation informed on PNN request.
The young people then left the park.
On Saturday evening, some youths would have played in the New Garden Rugby.
The meadow had been cleared by the driver, said PLSG spokesman Frank Kallensee on Sunday.
Time and again, illegal celebrations occur in the parks
The Foundation's parks are constantly gatherings in which the Covid-19 implementing regulation on distance and hygiene is not complied with.
At the end of June, there had been a celebration of about 300 people in the Babelsberg Park, a week later about 150 people celebrated in the New Garden.
Even without corona regulations, the parks are closed when the darkness is broken.
The storage on the meadows is prohibited according to park regulations, there are few exceptions.
The Foundation has been complaining for a long time that visitors would leave more waste and destroy protected biotopes.
In Berlin, illegal park parties have achieved a different dimension.
In the Hasenheide district of Neukölln, 5,000 people celebrated an illegal Techno party at the night of Sunday.
The event was dissolved by the police.
Austria: Mass tests after Corona outbreak in tourist resort
With hundreds of tests, authorities have responded to a corona eruption in the popular Upper Austrian tourist resort of St. Wolfgang.
The number of confirmed cases increased to 48, as the Landebehörte reported in Linz.
More than 100 results were outstanding in the evening.
As a result, many of the infected young interns are in tourism companies, but at least one holiday guest has been tested positively.
Residents, guests and tourism staff were asked to stay in their accommodations on Saturday evenings.
The closing hour was set at 23 o'clock.
"There are cancellations and cancellations there," said the head of the tourism association Wolfgangsee, Hans Wierser, the dpa.
Also, single guests had left early.
St. Wolfgang is the most important tourist resort in Upper Austria, with more than 400,000 nights spent last year.

The new infections focus on Vienna and Upper Austria.
Premier League: Man United and Chelsea qualified for Champions League
London (dpa) - English football recordmaster Manchester United returns to the Champions League after a year of absence.
On the last day of the Premier League, the Red Devils secured third place by a 2:0 (0:0) success against the direct competitor Leicester City.
The Foxes now have to be satisfied with the Europa League because the Chelsea FC was still passing and the fourth was also qualified for the royal class.
In the fight against the descent, Aston Villa was able to cheer.
Manchester United was led by Bruno Fernandes (71st minute).
After a red card for Leicester City in the post-gathering period Jesse Lingard (90.+8) came to an end.
Chelsea, in the Champions-League-Achtelfinals opponent of FC Bayern, won thanks to Mason Mount (45.+1) and Olivier Giroud (45.+4) in parallel with 2:0 (2.0) against the Wolverhampton Wanderers.
"This means a lot to me," said coach Frank Lampard, who in his first season as Chelsea coach is also in the finale of the FA Cup against Arsenal.
From Chelsea's victory against Wolverhampton also benefited Tottenham Hotspur, who passed the Wolves with a leaner 1:1 (1:0) at Crystal Palace and started sixth in the Europa League.
Aston Villa decided to join FC Watford and AFC Bournemouth for a long time at West Ham United.
The late lead by Jack Grealish (84.) immediately looked out to Andrej Jarmolenko (85.).
The 1:1 (0:0) was enough, because Watford lost at Arsenal with 2:3 (1:3).
The club, who shot three trainers in the season, descends after five first league years.
Just like Bournemouth, who couldn't save himself through a 3-1 (2:1) at Everton FC.
At the end one point was missing.
The FC Liverpool, which has been established as an English champion since the end of June, secured an club record with a 3:1 (1:1) victory at Newcastle United.
99 counters are the highest value the reds have ever achieved in a football season.
Coach Jürgen Klopp and his team just missed the score record in English football.
Manchester City has 100 points in the 2017/18 season.
After the Newcastle leadership in the first minute, Virgil van Dijk (38.), Divock Origi (59.) and Sadio Mané (89.) turned the game on Sunday for Liverpool.
"For this wonderful club it was an extraordinary season," said Torschütte van Dijk after the game, "this should motivate us to defend the title.
It's gonna be hard."
In the end, the Premier League boss is expected to be satisfied.
Because of the coronavirus crisis, football operations in England were interrupted from 13 March to 17 June.
In the meantime, it was even discussed about an early termination or a release of the remaining games on neutral ground.
Finally, however, the season could be finished without special events - however, as in Germany without spectators in the stadiums.
Arrest and violence in demonstrations against Netanyahu
The protests in Israel against head of government Netanjahus are becoming more and more fierce.
During the night there have been violent conflicts.
The Israeli police went violently against participants in a demonstration against the law-conservative chief of government Benjamin Netanyahu at the night of Sunday in Jerusalem.
Twelve people had been arrested for participation in unrest, told police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld.
The police, among other things, used waterthrowers to disband the rally.
According to media reports, on Saturday evening, about 6000 people gathered near Netanjahus's headquarters.
They protested against unemployment, corruption and Netanjahus dealing with the corona crisis.
The protesters beat drums, blew in horns, and called Netanyahu to retreat.
Participants of an area demonstration that supported Netanyahu were also arrested, reported the news page "ynet".
People in many other places in Israel also demonstrated themselves, including in front of the private villa of the head of government in the coastal city of Caesarea and in a park in Tel Aviv.
A man was arrested after police statements near Tel Aviv because it is suspected of spraying from a driving car pepper spray on demonstrators on the roadside.
Another man was arrested after an attack on a demonstrator in the south of the country.
The Demonstrant had been easily injured.
In Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, there have been multiple demonstrations against Netanyahu.
The demonstrations accompany the corruption process against the head of government.
Netanyahu was last criticized for handling the corona crisis.
Among other things, he is kept under guard for speedy easings and a lack of preparation for a second corona wave.
The corona crisis has severely increased the economy of the country.
The unemployment rate was last higher than 20 percent.
The number of new infections with the coronavirus in Israel last increased to ever new record values.

North Korea draws the border town off after Corona's suspicion
North Korea has so far seen in its own anti-coronavirus measures a "shining success".
Now the country reports a suspicion for the first time.
Because of a first official Corona suspicion in the country, fear of a disaster, North Korea has completely locked down a big city.
Despite the most severe epidemiological defenses in the past six months, "the malignant virus could have been dragged into the country," the state media reported.
The need for the region around the border town of Kaesong has been imposed.
The Communist leadership called out the highest level of alarm.
Should the suspicion be confirmed, it would be the first official infection with Sars-Cov-2 in the killed country.
According to their own statements, North Korea had not registered a single infection and described its defence measures as "shining success".
The data were doubted abroad.
According to the reports, the symptoms of disease have been identified by a "emissioner" who illegally crossed the military demarkation line between South and North Korea on 19 July.
The person had moved to South Korea three years ago and has now returned across the border.
There was no confirmation of the border crossing within the four kilometres wide and largely still mined military buffer zone from South Korea at first.
However, South Korea's military, according to reports from the national news agency Yonhap, admitted the possibility of illegal border crossing to North Korea as high.
Studies were carried out with some persons.
According to Nordkore, on Saturday, because of the suspicion that a emergency meeting of the Labour Party's political bureau led by Kim Jong Un was called up.
The "hazardous situation in Kaesong could trigger a deadly and destructive disaster".
Kim had already ordered on Friday as a preventive measure to "block Kaesong completely and isolate every district and region from others," it continued.
The data subject, as well as all the people in Kaesong who had had contact with her, had been put under quarantine.
The party's central military commission is therefore to investigate the "outsight" as well as the behaviour of the responsible military unit and, if necessary, impose severe punishment.
It is estimated that some 300,000 people live in Kaesong.
Stress before Council meeting: City East and noise protection are still a big summer break to discuss
"In addition to environmental issues, the board members will also vote on the development plan for the large-scale urban development east project," says the city press release to the next municipal council meeting on Tuesday, July 28, at 4.30 p.m. in the Grand Hall of CongressCentrums Pforzheim.
In particular, the revaluation of the Eastern City is, however, controversially discussed until the end.
The majority of these are narrow, most recently in individual committees, even if they are present.
An appeal from the economy (construction, real estate, trade and IT), which out of citizenship and then developed by the administration and municipal council not to fail to be prepared after almost ten years now, criticized project opponents Reinhard Klein as "exceptionary opposition", "unscrupulous", "Speculation", "disruption" and "conscious false statements".
"All think it's better to know," said Klein, who has been a member of the municipal council for a year as the only representative of the Pforzheim community list.
In fact, after reading the Treaties, he was in this position: "I know what I'm talking about."
The exit is cheaper for the city to renovate the Technical Town Hall for 8.5 million euros, contrary to statements from the city administration, according to grants, whose existence Small is convinced.
The city will be quite different from the forecasting in the town hall and on the part of the supporters from the economy.
The city by its own strength and not being an investor: that was its plan B. One day after Klein, the FDP/FW/UB/LED Group, which also rejects the project, presented an alternative concept.
It also mainly provides for the renovation of the Technical Town Hall, the opening of the Schloßberg, the rental of the ex-thale for administrative areas and a smaller part of the city centre transformation ideally with local carriers.
Environmental issues play a key role
In addition, priority will be given to environmental issues.
For example, the municipal council will vote on the noise action plan.
This includes various measures to protect the population of Pforzheim against health noise caused by road traffic, including many slow reductions.
In a press release, Germany's local transport club welcomes the widespread introduction of speed 30. However, the political leaders in the city are not innocent of the need to do so because by neglecting line bus traffic with thinned tacts and with little commitment to bicycle traffic they have only contributed to the massive increase in car traffic and thus noise, says the VCD.
The municipal council also agrees on the participation of the city of the energy and climate protection agency Pforzheim/Enzkreis.
In addition, the agenda for accession to the Baden-Württemberg climate protection pact, the redefinition of parental contributions in the municipal day-to-day facilities and the application for inclusion in the federal support of the federal government is on the agenda.
Citizens are welcome, but they need to look at the protection measures of Corona.
Tim Zimmermann starts the new season with a lot of delay
With almost half a year's delay, Tim Zimmermann starts his first season in ADAC GT Masters on July 31st.
Before the league of the supersport cars could start the regular operation, the first test rides were now on.
For Zimmermann, it was mainly about getting to know his Lamborghini Huracan GT3.
The Corona crisis has long prevented Tim Zimmermann from taking up his first service in the new Lamborghini Huracan of Grasser Racing.
This was now possible under special hygiene conditions.
The 23-year-old Langenargener turned his first rounds on the Lausitzring and was able to get used to his premiere in the GT3 car.
"There are already a few things that are different from the Porsche from the pre-season," Zimmermann says.
"With the ABS, for example, you have to go into different curves.
But it really was a lot of fun".
Zimmermann also had fun with Steijn Schothorst, with which he will share his orange sports car in GT Masters.
Despite its 25 years of experience in GT sports, the Dutchman was able to help his new teammate in many things.
"I'm not a beginner in motorsports, but every new series also brings new challenges," says Zimmermann.
"Steijn and I understand ourselves dazzling and we have also made tremendous progress from session to session at the Lausitzring."
Right there - at the Lausitzring - the GT Masters will also take off his first race.
As of 31 July, the 33 super sports cars will race through the Lausitz.
Zimmermann, who is one of 15 new serials, knows the route.
In 2015 he was the last guest in the motodrome.
"It worked fast and I had little to get used to," says Zimmermann, who starts for the Friedrichshafen race community Graf Zeppelin.
"The Lausitzring has many fast passages that you have to meet optimally to be quick."
How fast Zimmermann really is, that turns out in two weeks.
"The teams of poker, of course, are a little bit in the tests," he says.
"But finally we are very happy and are looking forward to the first weekend at the Lausitzring".
The race in Brandenburg will be the start of a densely pressed calendar.
By the beginning of November, seven races are on.
Currently, no viewers will be allowed - but there is a prominent guest.
In mid-August at the Nürburgring, ex-formel-1-pilot Niko Hülkenberg will reach the GT-Lenkrad.
British Minister for Transport of Quarantine Decision coldly caught
According to the press reports, the British Government's decision to put Spain's citizens under quarantine for two weeks after their return has caught the Minister of Transport of the country cold.
Thus Grant Shapps is currently on holiday in Spain, while his colleagues at home on Saturday decided on the measure.
Because of the increase in the Corona figures in Spain, the London Cabinet pushed the country from the list of those countries from which entry is possible without quarantine deposits.
The new regulation will apply from today, Sunday, so Shapps will have to return to quarantine.
In Austria, the government has also imposed quarantine measures for returnees.
But the rule applies to those who are just on holiday on the day of the day, only from Saturday, August 1st, and was not introduced overnight.
Spain has, by the way, been regarded as one of the "safe countries" in Austria, for which no quarantine is needed in Austria.
"In advance, countless ministers may have known that there is a possibility that a quarantine will be imposed on holidaymakers in Spain," said Labour Member Diane Abbot.
"But apparently no one has bothered to tell Grant Shapps."
Nearly one month after the end of the Corona emergency in Spain and the absence of the strict source barrier, the infection figures in the country are rising again.
Virologists are primarily responsible for the new spread of night life.
Spain is one of the most popular holiday countries in the UK.
The British Government currently advises on unnecessary travel to the mainland of Spain, with the exception of the Canary Islands and Canary Islands, which are particularly popular among British holidaymakers.
Up to now, more than 272,000 infections have been registered in Spain with the novel corona virus and more than 28,000 dead.

Russia has such a large coastal area as no other country in the world.
For 300 years, the Navy has been protecting Russia reliably, said Putin on the national day celebrated by sailors.
In many other Russian coastal towns, the maritime forces also began the day of the Navy with parades.

Hurricane "Hanna" reaches Texas: Help because of Corona makes difficult
Washington - The first Hurricane of this year’s season above the Atlantic has come to Texas on land.
Life-threatening floods, strong winds and violent rainfall now threatened parts of the U.S. state, reported the Hurricane National Center of the NOAA National Aviation Authority at night on Sunday (local time).
Governor Greg Abbott called for an emergency for many districts.
According to the U.S. media, the corona pandemic that is sprawling in Texas makes the work of the helpers difficult.
Evacuated for Caution
"Every Hurricane is a huge challenge," said Abbott, according to the newspaper "Houston Chronicle".
With a view to the cyclone in Texas, he added: "This challenge is complicated and is even stronger, considering that it is swept through an area that is the most affected by Covid-19 area of the state."
According to Johns Hopkins University, about 5,000 people have died in Texas alone as a result of the corona pandemic.
Abbot called for caution from people who had to leave their homes.
You should not disregard practices, "to whom we used to be", such as wearing masks, said the governor, according to CBS.
It is important that all distances were kept.
Therefore, hotel rooms would have been provided in some places.
In addition, it was planned to be tested on Corona in emergency accommodation.
Damages had initially been reported only from the coastal city of Port Mansfield.
Storm Warning Removed
At wind speeds of up to 150 kilometers per hour, according to authorities, "Hanna" was hit on land on the island of Padre Island right off the Texan coast.
The tropical storm had previously been raised to the Hurricane of the lowest level one.
For the coastal section from Port Mansfield to Sargent, a stormy flood warning had been first issued and later withdrawn.
Authorities expected a weakening while "Hanna" continued to move to the interior of the country and taxed to the northeast of Mexico.
"Douglas" moves to Hawaii
In the Pacific, Hurricane "Douglas" was heading for Hawaii during the night on Sunday with wind speeds of about 150 kilometers per hour.
The Hurricane centre, however, expected to further weaken.
According to the forecast, he is to be on Sunday (local time) near the largest islands of Hawaii - then as a storm just below the Hurricane threshold.
This year, after a May forecast, NOAA expected an above-average active Hurricane season across the Atlantic Ocean.
From June to the end of November, up to ten hurricanes could be expected to become up to six very strong cyclones, the Authority had declared.
On average, there are six hurricanes per year across the Atlantic, three of which develop into storms of great strength.
In view of available climate data and the higher water temperature in the Atlantic and the Caribbean, the probability of a normal season was only 30 percent, which was an under-average even at ten percent, at that time.
U.S. President Donald Trump wrote on Twitter that his government observed the storms closely and was in contact with the states concerned.
Four goals unknown: Video assistant "punished" Sassuolo
Sassuolos Filip Djuric was recognized by two goals
Naples - Four goals scored, four goals ignored: Sassuolo Calcio experienced a rough black evening at the 0:2 (0:1) at the SSC Naples in the Italian football league series A - and was really mad at the video assistant of the referendum.
"A festival not given gates for Sassuolo.
The VAR has never been so hard on a team," commented the "Corriere dello Sport".
Host Naples had been led by a gate by foreign defender Elsied Hisaj in the 8th minute, in which 32nd minute Filip Djuric celebrated the compensation.
The video Assistant Referenceee (VAR) took the hit back because of a remote position.
Five minutes later Djuricic shot the ball again into the net - again the VAR attacked.
Also the gates of Angrefer Francesco Caputo (50.) and Domenico Berardi (61.) took back the referee team according to the VAR.
In the post-playing period, Allan made the 2:0-end for Naples and the bitter evening for Sassuolo perfect.
"The VAR is worse for Sassuolo than a radar trap on the road and punishes Sassuolo like no team before.
The new technology provides records", writes the "Gazzetta dello Sport".
FC Bayern München: Pavard injured
Munich (dpa) - The start to the hot preparation phase for the Champions League began for double winner FC Bayern with a setback.
After a short holiday and a few days of training, Hansi Flick has to think about how he can rebuild his successful defense after the injury of World Champion Benjamin Pavard.
The Frenchman, behind captain Manuel Neuer and middle-field chief Joshua Kimmich, has the third-major use-minutes, has suffered a gang violation at the left-hand foot root and threatens to be missing in decisive king-class duels.
In the Munich Schmuddelwetter, the legal defender broke off a training game and was driven off the square with a golf cart.
How long the unrestricted regular player has to pause in the fight for the title is open.
An effort in the eighth final game against the Chelsea FC on August 8 is likely to be difficult, with the final tournament beginning on August 12 in Lisbon, the 24-year-old can hope.
The Bayern don't want to stop from miscarriage from training on Sunday.
In his personal triple formula Flick called the three attributes he wants to see from his stars on the way in Portugal's capital city.
Quality, intensity and concentration are expected to show his winning titles in the ideally following 28 days until the King's Class Play on August 23.
"We have just mastered the duties with championship and cup excellent.
Now it is important to create the special thing," said Flick.
Until the Munichers can deal specifically with the final tournament and before a training camp on the Algarve, the eight-end finals against the Chelsea FC will be held for the first time.
After the 3–0 play in front of the Corona break, the Londoners in the domestic arena should not become Bayern's nightmare again, as in the lost "Final dahoam" 2012.
"First we have to go through the door.
We want to win, create good conditions and trust with a good game," asked Flick.
A vote will be taken on Friday against Olympique Marseille.
With a long speech, Flick had sworn to his stars, who had been on a unique August 13 day vacation after the double.
31 players welcomed him on Saebener Straße, including the new actors for Edel-Shopping Leroy Sané, who for the first time met all new colleagues in the place after his change from Manchester City.
"Leroy has been well inserted like all the new ones," said Flick.
But instead of talking about the new season, if Sané & Co. is no longer allowed to train, Flick preferred to talk about the current title project of the German series champion.
After days of individual and small group training, the Londoner is now trained in team strength, which are in contrast to the flick ensemble in the game rhythm.
After that, the Munichs could face a quarter finale against Barcelona and Lionel Messi, with Real Madrid, Manchester City or Juventus Turin as their opponents in the semifinal.
A way to the Lisbon final "is not quite as easy," said the head coach, who from Tuesday can rely on the services of his new assistant Miroslav Klose in training.
The WM Recordor Protector Klose and Flick know of some of the common tournament preparation, which is particularly important in the 0-to-100 agreement.
With his current team the work was "a pleasure", Flick praised.
The "Focusty on winnings" is an imposing essence of his team.
The tournament with Neuner teams was also an ambitious event on Sunday.
Among the performers were all there, also the refugee-willing Thiago and defender David Alaba, whose residence is not secured beyond the king-class season.
The Formula 1 needs a special rule in order to win their world champion
Since the required number of continents cannot be driven, FIA must improvise in order to award the World Cup titles.
All the American races were actually canceled.
Racing calendar is becoming more and more concrete
The racing calendar of the current Formula 1 season continues to take shape.
Three more races were added to the ten confirmed Grand Prix during the week.
In October, it will be run at the Nürburgring in Germany and in Portimão in Portugal.
On November 1st, Lewis Hamilton and Co. are fighting World Cup points on the Italian traditional race track in Imola.
As a result, the racing calendar for 2020 includes 13 races at current level.
"We are pleased that we continue to make great progress in completing our plans for the 2020 season," said Formula 1-Boss Chase Carey.
Overall, 15 to 18 races will be completed in the King's Class of Motorsport in this exceptional season.
The Formula One finalises its season in Asia.
The final racing calendar will be fixed and published in the coming weeks.
Prior to the race already officially scheduled in Bahrain and Abu Dhabi in December, media reports could still take place in Vietnam and Malaysia at the end of November.
Rules require racing on three continents
However, the rules of procedure of Formula 1 require at least three continents for the award of the World Championship.
Although, as planned at the moment, only two continents are to be driven, there is to be a world champion.
With the help of a special rule, the FIA intends to award the titles to "extraordinary circumstances" because of the coronavirus pandemic.
The traditional start of the season in Australia in March had to be cancelled in the short term due to the onset of the corona crisis.
A return to the continent this year is not an issue.
In addition, Formula 1 will not be a guest in America this year.
Absorpenses in Brazil on Criticism
Due to the tense corona situation, the races in Canada, the USA, Mexico and Brazil will not take place.
"We are looking forward to being with them again in the next season," said Carey.
The rejection of the U.S. races was particularly critical in Brazil: "The rejection was not surprising for us, but we cannot accept the reasons for this," said Tamas Rohonyi, promoter of the Grand Prix in São Paulo.
Thus, infection figures in the region of São Paulo are significantly lower than in other regions of Brazil.
Furthermore, the concerns of some teams not to drive in Brazil would not justify abjection.
We are prepared to take the necessary security measures.
Greta Thunberg: Evil view against Donald Trump went around the world
Greta Thunberg spoke about her encounter with US President Donald Trump.
Greta Thunberg was a guest in the well-known Latight show by Stephen Colbert and revealed in the interview what she had in mind when she met Donald Trump.
Klimatkivistin Greta Thunberg was a guest in a popular US latent show via video.
She told of, among other things, her struggle against the powerful in the world.
The teenage woman also spoke about her famous "bad look" during her encounter with Donald Trump.
New York City - In the past two years, climate activist Greta Thunberg has been drawing attention to her tireless commitment to the Fridays For Future movement.
Now, in a well-known Latight show, she talked about her plans in the future and her meeting with US President Donald Trump at the UN Climate Summit last year.
The 17-year-old Thunberg welcomed Latight moderator Stephen Cobert on Tuesday in your show and conducted a longer interview with the Swedish woman.
She talked not only about her fight against climate change, but also about her conflict with the powerful in the world.
"There are some things that surprised me," she said.
"How far people go to divert the focus from the climate crisis," she shook.
"All from organized hate campaigns to threats, only because a group of children goes to the streets," she experienced.
Head of state and leading politicians who mocked against them in social media or even trying to silence them, she finds them "lustious" as she showed the reactions "because they have no other answer".
It became particularly interesting at the end of the interview when Greta Thunberg was addressed at a well-known scene in which she threw a bitter looking behind US President Trump.
At the 2019 UN Climate Summit in New York, for which the activist sailed over the Atlantic, her expressive view was captured by the cameras and has since been seen by countless people on the Internet.
From the short clip came a GIF, i.e. an animated image, which eventually became one of the most commonly used images for Trump opponents.
But what did the 17-year-old think about the US President at this moment?
In response to Stephen Colbert's relatively open question, she replied only briefly: "To be honest, I do not think that needs any further explanation".
With the quick answer, the experienced satirian Colbert did not expect and disappeared from the picture for a short time.
With her "How Here You?" speech on the principles of climate protection, she remained in her memory at the climate conference.

Fleetwood-Mac co-founder Peter Green died
His life was like a roller coaster ride: After a rapid climb with Fleetwood Mac it went steeply downhill and then slowly up again.
Now Bluesrock guitarist Peter Green died at the age of 73.
Genuine guitarist, drug junkie, cult pendant: The co-founder of the band Fleetwood Mac, Peter Green, is dead.
He died peacefully in sleep at the age of 73 years, told family members on Saturday in an official opinion that a further opinion would be announced for the next days.
Top musicians like Peter Frampton honored Green as one of the best blues and rock guitarists.
Mick Fleetwood spoke in an emotional reaction of a "monumental loss" for all former and present members of the band Fleetwood Mac.
The drummer Fleetwood and guitarist Green had founded the long since legendary band in London in 1967, until today his dreamy instrumental hit "Albatross".
The life of the musician ("The End of the Game", "In The Skies") was like a roller coaster ride.
With Fleetwood Mac, Green experienced a rapid rise - the band celebrated its greatest successes but then without him.
There were, among other things, disputes because Green wanted to donate all the profits of the group for benevolent purposes.
He began to appear in wide robes and with a big crucifix.
Mental problems should also have played a role.
Green left the band in 1970 three years after the founding.
It followed a social descent.
The bluesrock guitarist suffered from drug abuse and schizophrenia, as biographers reported.
Green was treated in the psychiatry for a long time.
During much of the 1970s, the musicians disappeared from the picture area.
He should have lived on the street temporarily when cemetery gardeners worked and spent some time in an Israeli kibbuz.
Green was born in 1946 as the son of a Jewish working family in the Bethnal Green district of London.
As early as he was, he was excited about US blue musicians such as B.B. King and Muddy Waters.
At eleven years of age, he learned the first guitar grips.
At the age of 15 the teenager started playing professional guitar and five years later got the chance to stand on stage as a lead guitarist for the instrumental band Peter B's Looners.
Little later, he was engaged in the Bluesbreakers as a substitute for his Idol Eric Clapton.
In the middle of the Blues boom, Green founded Fleetwood Mac in the summer of 1967, together with his Bluesbreakers colleagues Mick Fleetwood and John McVie.
In the winter of 1968/69, the band won the first number 1 hit by Green's composed song "Albatross" and catapulted it to the top of the British music scene.
But the rapid rise soon showed its shadow sides: Green did not rape the media rumble, his experiments with the drug LSD became more and more extreme.
He once commented in an interview about the life between music and addiction: "The worst thing that happened to me in life is the drugs - the best thing was to land a number one hit".
Towards the end of the decade, Green in 1979 achieved a surprising success with a religiously inspired album.
Fleetwood Mac was swimming on a wave of success without him in a new formation.
Her 1977 album "Rumours" sold more than 40 million times worldwide.
Despite various small solo successes, Green did not succeed in any larger comeback until he started a new start with a group of friendly musicians in 1996.
The British "Daily Telegraph" spoke back then of a rock star returning to Earth.
Green released several albums with the Peter Green Splinter Group, free of drugs, until the band dissolved in 2004.
For music experts he was a blues legend at the time of his life - and with his gentle sound one of the most influential guitarists of the past decades.
