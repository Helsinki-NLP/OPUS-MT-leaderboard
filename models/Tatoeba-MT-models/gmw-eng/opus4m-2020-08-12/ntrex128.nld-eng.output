Members of the National Assembly of Wales ensure that they “will be compared to Muppets”
There is an uproar among the members of the National Assembly of Wales by a proposal that would change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament - Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The proposal is a consequence of the plans to change the current name 'Welsh Assembly' to 'Welsh Parliament'.
Members of the National Assembly of various political parties are concerned that the new name is ridiculous.
A member of the National Assembly of Wales of the Labour Party said that MWP "is rhyming on Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: twp is Welsh for crazy and pwp is Welsh for poop.
A member of the National Assembly of Wales of the Plaid Party said that the group as a whole is 'unsatisfied' and has proposed alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said that his party is 'open' to the name change, but notes that the words MWP and Muppet are very similar.
In this context, the Welsh letter W is pronounced as a short you.
The Commission of the National Assembly of Wales, which is currently drafting legislation to implement the name change, said: 'It is of course the members of the National Assembly of Wales themselves who are taking the final decision on their new title.'
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the members of the National Assembly of Wales the right to change the name of the Assembly.
In June the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which showed that most people felt that the National Assembly should be renamed Parliament.
As regards the title of the members of the National Assembly, the Commission proposed ‘Welsh Parliament Members’ or ‘WMPs’, but the option MWP received the most support in the public consultation.
At the moment, the members of the National Assembly would propose alternatives, but President Elin Jones will find it difficult to reach a consensus, and in a few weeks' time, she will have to submit a draft law on the changes.
The reform legislation also includes other changes to the way the National Assembly works, including rules on suspension of members of the National Assembly and the structure of the system of committees.
Members of the National Assembly will be able to vote on their new title as they debate legislation.
Residents of Macedonia vote in a referendum on the amendment of the name of their country
On Sunday, voters will vote to change the name of their country to 'Republic of Northern Macedonia'.
The popular referendum was organised in an attempt to resolve a ongoing dispute with neighboring Greece, which itself has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of its northern neighbour means that the country would claim its territory and has repeatedly objected to Macedonia’s applications for membership of the EU and NATO.
The Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who is against popular consultation on the name change, has said that he will not take into account the results of the referendum.
However, advocates of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the names are simply the price to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of Saint Martin's silence. Harlem's bells have a hard time.
"The older people I spoke to said that there used to be a café and a church at every corner," said Mr. Adams.
Today there is neither a café nor a church to be seen."
He said it's understandable that cafes have disappeared.
'People now have social contact in another way,' he said.
‘Cafés are no longer the living room of the neighborhood, where people regularly go by.’
However, he is concerned that the proceeds of the sale of the assets of the churches will last less long if the leaders expect, 'and sooner or later they will be back at the beginning.'
Churches, he adds, could be replaced by apartment buildings with flats where the type of people would live that will not help in the remaining resorts of the neighborhood.
'The vast majority of people who will buy flats in such buildings will be white,' he says, 'which will lead to these churches being closed even faster, because it is unlikely that the people moving to these flats will become members of the church community.'
Both churches were once built by a white church, before Harlem became a black metropolis: the metropolis community in 1870, Saint Martin's 10 years later.
The original church of white methodists left in the 1930s.
A black church nearby took over the building.
Saint Martin's was taken over by a black church led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of the shopkeepers on 125th Street, an important shopping street in Harlem, where blacks could rarely get a job or be promoted.
In 1939 the building became seriously damaged by fire, but when the parishioners of Reverend Johnson made plans to rebuild the church, they also bought a carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Reverend Johnson and his successor in Saint Martin's, proudly called the carillon "the bells of the poor".
The expert who played the carillon in July referred to the instrument in another way: 'a cultural treasure' and 'an irreplaceable historical instrument'.
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the first carillon in the world ever played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger carillon of the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said Saint Martin's didn't replace him.
The events of the last few months in Saint Martin's are a complicated story of architects and contractors, some hired by the lay leaders of the church, others by the diocese.
The Consistory (the governing body of the parish, consisting of lay leaders) wrote to the diocese in July to express its concern that the diocese would 'will pass on the costs' to the Consistory, although the Consistory would not have been involved in hiring the architects and contractors who had sent the diocese.
Some parishians complained about the lack of transparency of the diocese.
Shark injures 13-year-old who dives for lobsters in California
On Saturday, on the first day of the lobster season, a shark attacked a 13-year-old boy who was diving for lobsters in California.
The attack took place just before 7 o'clock in the morning near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he had been working with friends for about half an hour on Saturday when he heard the boy screaming for help, and along with some others, he went to the boy to pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought the boy was crying because he had caught a lobster, but then he realized 'that the boy was crying, 'I'm bitten!
I'm bitten!"
His keybone was completely open," Hammel saw as he approached the boy.
'I screamed that everyone had to leave the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'.
The boy was taken with a helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is said to be at risk of death.
It is not known which species of shark is responsible for the attack.
In a press conference, Captain Larry Giles told us that a few weeks earlier, a shark had been mocked nearby, but it was then concluded that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim was seriously injured by the upper body.
The authorities closed access to the beach of Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours with a view to research and safety.
Giles noted that more than 135 shark species live in the area but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's wants to break through the British beauty market
Sainsbury's competes with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams and sets up beauty departments where specialized assistants work, such as in wholesale houses.
The initiative is part of a strategy to conquer the UK beauty market, worth £2.8 billion and continues to grow, while the sale of fashion and household items continues to fall. The larger beauty departments are being tested in 11 shops throughout the country. If they are successful, they will be introduced into more shops next year.
The investment in the beauty market is also a result of the fact that supermarkets want to fill the rack where TVs, microwaves and interior items once stood with other products.
Sainsbury's wants to double his beauty offer and offer 3,000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing range of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also has more space, with a per-brand tableau, as in shops such as Boots.
The supermarket also re-opens its boutique make-up, now that most products are suitable for vegans, something that younger shoppers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, perfumery the Fragrance Shop will test concessions in two shops of Sainsbury's. The first one was opened in Croydon, in the south of London, the second one will be opened later this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
As more and more people are shopping online and buying small quantities of food on a daily basis in local supermarkets, supermarkets must make more effort to convince people to shop with them.
Mike Coupe, Chief Executive of Sainsbury's, says that the stores will look more and more like wholesale stores, now that the supermarket chain is recording it against discounters Aldi and Lidl, with more services and non-food.
Sainsbury's has integrated Argos sales outlets into hundreds of shops and has also opened a number of habitats since both chains were taken over two years ago. According to the company, the sale of food has increased and the acquisitions have yielded more return.
The last time the supermarket tried to give his departments Beauty and Pharmacy a makeover, it became a flop.
Sainsbury's tested a collaboration with Boots at the beginning of the 2000s, but the cooperation ended when a conflict arose over the distribution of the income from the pharmacy department in supermarkets.
This is a new strategy since Sainsbury's 281 pharmacy departments were sold to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain three years ago for an amount of £125 million.
Lloyds would also play a role in the plan, by adding an extensive range of luxury skin care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director of Sainsbury's, said: ‘We have completely changed the design of our beauty department so that it is more pleasant for our customers.
We have also invested in the specialized training of our employees, who will be ready to give advice.
With our range of brands we offer something for everyone, and thanks to the attractive surroundings and the convenient locations we ensure that our customers like to buy their beauty products from us, and no longer shop in the old way.'
Peter Jones 'anger' after Holly Willoughby withdraws from 11 million pounds deal
Peter Jones, one of the stars of Dragons Den, is angry because TV presenter Holly Willoughby has withdrawn from a deal of £11 million with his lifestyle company. She wants to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time for True, their brand for homewear and accessories.
The company of Jones and Willoughby is compared to the brand Goop van Gwyneth Paltrow.
This Morning's 37-year-old presentation announced on Instagram that she was leaving.
Peter Jones van Dragons Den is keen on Holly Willoughby because at the last moment she has withdrawn from their profitable lifestyle company to focus on her contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was ‘fragrant’ when Willoughby announced on Tuesday during a difficult meeting in the company’s headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire that she did not have enough time for Truly, their brand for homewear and accessories because of her new contracts (valued at a value of up to one and a half million pounds).
The company is compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and is expected to double Willoughby's fortune of estimated £11 million.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she would leave True, Jones left for one of his vacation homes abroad.
A source said, "Truly was one of Holly's top priorities.
It would ensure her future in the long term, and provide enough for the next decades.
Everyone was astounded when she decided to withdraw.
No one could believe his ears last Tuesday, because the launch was planned for soon.
The warehouse of the main settlement in Marlow is full of products ready for sale."
Experts believe that the departure of the presentatrice, one of the most profitable stars of Britain, could cost the company millions, due to the large investments in products from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear, and because the launch could now be further delays.
And that could mean the end of a long-term friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin, who have three children, have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby started Truly in 2016 with Capp, and Jones, 52, became president of the company in March.
The two sets often go together on vacation and Jones has a 40% share in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will soon become M&S brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as the presenter of the program I'm A Celebrity on the British channel ITV.
A source from Jones' entourage said last night, "We have no comment on his business."
Hard language 'and then it was love between us'
He joked at the criticism he would get in the media for a remark he made that some people would find ‘unfortunately for a president’, and for his positive view of the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump imitated a news anchor when he said:
"I haven't given up anything."
He added that Kim was interested in a second meeting. Trump described their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards the dismantling of weapons in North Korea.
But the negotiations on the removal of nuclear weapons are under way.
More than three months after the Singapore Summit in June, top diplomat Ri Yong Ho of North Korea told leaders of the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea does not see a ‘corresponding reaction’ by the United States after the first disarmament initiatives of North Korea.
The United States is now continuing its sanctions to keep the pressure on the boiler, he says.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech during the election rally.
"We're doing very well in North Korea," he said.
“We were close to a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a fantastic relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim have led to positive results, and the missile tests have ended, hostages have been liberated and the physical surpluses of American soldiers have returned to their own country.
He also defended his unusual approach to his relationship with Kim.
'It's as easy to behave as a president, but instead of 10,000 people trying to access this busy arena, about 200 people would be standing here,' said Trump, pointing to the public before him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroyed an island, with hundreds of deaths falling
In the aftermath of the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs were told that their aid was not needed.
Although more than 10% of the population of Lombok no longer had a home, no national disaster was announced, which is a requirement for the launch of international aid.
'In many cases, it is unfortunately clear that they do not apply for international aid, which is difficult for us,' said Mrs Sumbung.
Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Palu, but it is not certain whether the aid providers from abroad can work on site.
Mr Sutopo, spokesman for the National Disaster Relief Agency, said that Indonesian officials were still evaluating the situation in Palu to see if international organisations would be given permission to help.
Although Indonesia is constantly plagued by earthquakes, the country is still very badly prepared for the wrath of nature.
In Aceh hiding places were built to hide at tsunamis, but along other shores you rarely see them.
That there was no warning siren for tsunamis in Palu, even if there was a warning of force, probably contributed to the number of deaths.
Even in ideal circumstances, it may be difficult to travel from one Indonesian island to another.
National disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship moored in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is now on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days for the ship to reach the place of the disaster.
The improvement of Indonesia's portless infrastructure was one of the key points of President Yoko Widodo's election campaign, and he has already spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
But President Yoko's government is facing a shortage of funding, which he hopes will be re-elected next year.
President Yoko is also pressured by persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Islamic majority today follow a rather conservative form of their faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to leave their homes because Christian and Islamic gangs were fighting on the streets, with machetes, arrow, and bow and other primitive weapons.
Look at: Daniel Sturridge from Liverpool provides impressive equalizer against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing Chelsea in the Premier League last Saturday, with a goal in the 89th minute, during a race in Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge got a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri when he was at a distance of about 30 meters from Chelsea's goal, when his team was behind with 1-0.
He tapped left against the ball and then kicked in the direction of the distant pole.
The ball flew high above the criminal area, towards the top right corner of the net.
He escaped the jump of Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
"It was very difficult to reach that position, to reach the ball, and players like Shaq always play forward as much as possible," Sturridge said to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante approaching and tried. I didn't really think about it, I was just kicking at the ball."
Chelsea was at rest with 1-0, after a target of the Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The top of The Blues kicked the ball with his heel to Mateo Kovavic, after which he rushed through the civil society to Liverpool's play half.
Kovavic did a quick one-two on civil society.
After that, he gave a nice passport, which allowed him to reach the criminal area.
Hazard was faster than the defense and kicked the ball with his left foot past Alisson Becker of Liverpool in the net, next to the rear pole.
On Wednesday at 3:00 p.m., Liverpool plays in the Champions League against Napoli, in the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will record in London on Thursday at 3:00 p.m. against Videoton in the UEFA Europa League.
Death of tsunami in Indonesia amounts to 832
The death toll of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, said the National Disaster Relief Agency on Sunday morning.
Many people were trapped in the ruins of buildings that had collapsed as a result of the earthquake with a force of 7.5 last Friday, with waves also forming 6 m high, spokesperson Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a news conference.
The city of Palu, where more than 380,000 people live, is full of ruins of collapsed buildings.
Police arrests 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after wife is stabbed to death
This morning, a woman's body was found in Birkenhead in Merseyside, after which a murder investigation was opened.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7.55 in Grayson Mews on John Street. The body showed stab wounds. A 32-year-old man was arrested for suspicion of murder.
The police are asking the local residents to report if they have seen or heard anything.
Police inspector Brian O'Hagan said: ‘The investigation has only just started, but I want to ask anyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead who has seen or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I would also like to ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, to contact them if they may have filmed something through a Dashcam, because they can have information that is essential for our research."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found is a local resident of Birkenhead and that she was found in a building.
This afternoon friends came to think that they knew the woman on the spot to ask questions about the place where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and the police have confirmed that they are currently informing the victim's family.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews tried to enter his apartment, but was told by the police that no one should be allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he found out what happened.
The inhabitants are now told that it will be hours before they can return home.
A policeman would have told someone that the area was being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared crying on the spot.
She just keeps repeating: ‘What a pity!’
At 2:00 p.m., two police cars were inside the parking lot, and a third was just outside.
Within the deposit, a number of agents were watching the apartment building.
Whoever has information is asked to send a message to @MerPolCC, to call 101 or to contact Crimestoppers anonymously on the number 0800 555 111, stating log 247 of 30 September.
Statue of Cromwell to the British Parliament is the latest victim of the 'rewriting history' rule
The banishment of the statue would be a poetic justice to the Taliban-like destruction of the many cultural and religious art objects performed by his fanatical puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's suggestion as "foolish" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable that the current debate on the removal of statues would lead to the visualisation of Oliver Cromwell’s figure just outside the Houses of Parliament.
The iconoclasm of the English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the last century.
The beautiful image of Cromwell, made by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, testifies to the opinion that existed in the 19th century and is part of the history of a figure that, according to many, still has to be recognized.
Mr. Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: ‘Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of the parliament against external pressure, in his case of course the monarchy.
Whether that is a completely correct presentation is still being debated.
What is certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individually recognizable figure representing one side of that gap.
His achievements as Lord Protector must also be recognized and remembered."
Murderous Pig Kills Chinese Farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in southwestern China, according to reports in the local media.
The man, of whom only the last name 'Yuan' is known, was found dead at a stable on the market in Liupanshui in Guizhou Province. His arteries were pierced and he was under the blood, reported the South China Morning Post Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares for the vaccination of pigs in a pig stable, on 30 May 2005, in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He was said to have traveled with his cousin from the neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead and turned out to be a door to a neighboring pigfold.
According to the cousin, there was a large male pig with blood on his mouth in the pigfold.
A forensic study showed that the pig of 250 kg killed the farmer, according to the report.
'My cousin's legs were bleeding and mutilated,' said the nephew with the last name 'Wu', according to the newspaper Guiyang Evening News.
On surveillance cameras, it can be seen that Yuan arrived on the market at 4.40 p.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man wasn't Yuan's or his cousin's.
A market manager told the Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking others, while the police collected evidence on the spot.
The Yuan family and the market authorities are said to be negotiating a compensation for his death.
It is rare, but there have been cases of pigs attacking people before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their Massachusetts farm, causing the husband to get seriously injured.
Ten years earlier, a pig of 300 kg pushed a farmer from Wales against his tractor until his wife drove the animal away.
When a farmer from Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba at CBC News testified that pigs are not normally aggressive, but that the taste of blood can provoke aggression.
‘They’re just playful.
It's like kids, very curious... they're not out to hurt people.
You just have to show them the right amount of respect," he said.
Hurricane Rosa's tail brings heavy rain to the southwest of the USA
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is weakening now that she has reached the cooler waters of the north coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days Rosa will bring heavy rains to the north of Mexico and the southwest.
At a wind speed of 135 km/h, Rosa was a Category 1 hurricane at 5 o'clock local time on Sunday morning and was 620 km from Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a trog starts to emerge above the Pacific Ocean, which is heading east towards the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, tropical humidity is pushed northward, to the southwest of the US.
Rosa will bring 10 centimetres of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, tropical moisture that reacts with the approaching trough will cause widespread heavy rainfall in the southwest over the next few days.
Locally, 2 to 10 cm of rain will cause dangerous floods, ruins and possibly landslides in the desert.
Tropical moisture will cause precipitation of 5 to 8 cm per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
As much as 5 to 10 cm of rain is expected in parts of the southwest, especially above most of Arizona.
There may be sudden floods with rapidly worsening conditions, as the tropical rain may be very widespread.
It is strongly recommended that you enter the desert on foot when tropical rainfall threatens.
The heavy rainfall can turn ravines into wild rivers, and storms will produce local winds and dust.
The approaching trough brings some heavy rain to parts of the southern California coastline.
There is rain of 1.5 cm possible, which could lead to small debris streams and smooth roads.
This would be the first rainfall of the region in the rainy season.
Scattered tropical rains will approach Arizona on Sunday evening until Monday morning, after which the rain will spread more Monday at the end of the day and Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall will spread over the Four Corners on Tuesday and will continue to fall until Wednesday.
In October, the temperature in the United States may fluctuate strongly, because the Arctic is getting cooler, but the tropics remain quite warm.
This sometimes leads to large differences in temperature over short distances.
There is a fine example of impressive temperature differences in the middle of the US on Sunday.
The temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, is almost 20 degrees.
In the coming days, the persistent summer heat will try to build up and expand again.
In much of the middle and east of the US, October is expected to start warm, with temperatures fluctuating everywhere around 30°C, from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
In New York, Tuesday can be 27 degrees, which is about 10 degrees hotter than the average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows that the odds are high until mid-October at above-average temperatures in the eastern United States.
Over 20 million people looked at Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people watched on one of the six television networks on Thursday the gripping testimony of Brett Kavanaugh, candidate for the U.S. Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of an assault reportedly occurred in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political impasse continued, while broadcasters interrupted regular programming for the surprise of Friday: an agreement arranged by Jeff Flake, Senator of Arizona, to investigate the charges for a week.
Ford told the Senate Committee on Justice that she was 100% sure that a drunk Kavanaugh would touch her and try to take her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh in an invigorated testimony stated that he was 100% sure that this had not happened.
Probably more than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen looked on Friday.
The company included the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
No immediate figures were available for the other networks that sent the hearing, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble counting people looking in an office.
For comparison: this is about as for a play-off of a football match or for the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, which gives all the support to the appointment of Kavanaugh, had most viewers during the day of the hearing: an average of 5.69 million viewers, according to Nielsen.
ABC followed with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC had 2.94 million viewers, MSN had 2.89 million viewers, and CNN had 2.52 million viewers, according to Nielsen.
Even after the hearing, the public remained very interested.
Flake was the central figure of the events on Friday.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that he would support Kavanaugh with his voice, the cameras of CNN and CBS registered that protesters shouted at him on Friday morning when he tried to take the elevator to a hearing of the Commission for Justice.
He kept standing with his eyes down for a few minutes as he was reproached, live on CNN.
"I'm right here," said one woman.
‘Do you think he's telling the people the truth?
Someone cried out, "You have power, while so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office had issued a statement, and just before the elevator closed, he added that he would say more during the hearing.
The various channels broadcast everything live when the court committee had to vote hours later on the appointment of Kavanaugh in the Senate.
But Flake said that he would only vote in favour of it on the understanding that the FBI would investigate the accusations against the nominee by the next week, something the Democrats of the minority insist on.
Flake was convinced, among other things, by his friend Chris Coons, Senator and Democrat.
Flake made his decision after a conversation with Coons and several senators.
Flake's choice was important because it was clear that the Republicans would not have the necessary votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump opened an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of 'a political game' around Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper, Prime Minister Theresa May accused politicians who criticized her plans to leave the European Union of 'a political game' with the future of Britain and undermining national interests.
Prime Minister of Great Britain Theresa May arrives for the Conference of the Conservative Party in Birmingham, Great Britain, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, on the same front page of the newspaper, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson stressed his attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit. He said that her proposal that Britain and the EU should collect each other’s taxes was ‘absurd’.
Shooting Wayde Sims: Police arrests Dyteon Simpson as suspect of the death of the LSU player
The police arrested a suspect for the shooting that killed Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and in prison was suspected of murder, said Baton Rouge police.
The authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson and the police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police found the glasses on the crime scene and found Simpson's DNA on the glasses, reports WAFB, a CBS television station.
The police interrogated Simpson and later declared that he had confessed that he had shot Wayde with death.
His deposit is set at 350,000 dollars, reports the Advocate.
The coroner of the municipality in East Baton Rouge published a preliminary report on Friday stating that the cause of death is a gunshot wound in the neck.
The report states that the Fugitive Task Force of the Louisiana State Police, the State Police Crime Lab, the Southern University police and local residents all contributed to the investigation that led to arrest.
Sports director Joe Alleva of LSU thanked the local police for his ‘commitment and pursuit of justice.’
Sims was 20 years old.
He grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He scored an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said that the team was "broken" and "in shock" by Waydes dead.
"This is an event you always hope will never happen," says Wade.
Volcano spits as in Mexico City
The axis spewed out by the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern districts of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned the Mexicans last Saturday to stay away from the volcano, after activity in the crater had been picked up and 183 emissions of gas and ashes were registered in a period of 24 hours.
The center detected rumblings and vibrations several times.
On social media, photos of a thin layer of ashes appeared on autorouts in neighbourhoods of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysics have seen an increase in activity in the volcano, located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital, the first time since September 2017, when an earthquake of 7.1 on the Richter Central Mexico scale occurred.
The volcano, called 'Don Goyo', has been active since 1994.
Police flashes with Catalan separatists on the eve of the birthday of the vote for independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence activists were hit with the riot police, while thousands of participants in rival demonstrations took place on the occasion of the first birthday of the vote on independence in Catalonia which caused the region to disintegrate in two groups.
A group of masked pro-separatists held back by the riot police cooled the agents with eggs and powder paint, resulting in dark dust clouds in the streets that are usually filled with tourists.
Later in the day, skirmishes broke out with the police, and the agents took their bat up to stop the fights.
For more than an hour, pro-independence groups sang: 'Don't forget, don't forgive', while their opponents called 'Long live Spain'.
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries they suffered during the protests, reported the local press.
The tensions continue to rise in the independence region, one year after the referendum of 1 October, which Madrid considers illegal, but which is celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The voters voted overwhelmingly to become independent, although the rise was low and the people who were against separation were boycotts.
According to the Catalan authorities, last year nearly 1,000 people were injured after the police tried to stop the vote in the polls in the region, resulting in violent skirmishes.
Pro-independence groups had camped on the ground on Friday on Saturday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration continued, but it was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who, together with his wife, attended the separatist protest, said that he was no longer hoping for the prospects of Catalonia to become independent.
‘Last year we’ve been through one of our most beautiful moments.
I saw my parents crying for joy because they could vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Although the Catalan pro-independence parties won an essential victory in the regional elections in December, even if it was nifty, it was difficult for them to build on their success this year, because many of their most famous leaders are absent, either in self-imposed exile or in prison, awaiting a trial on their role in organizing the referendum and proclaiming independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who filmed the protest in support of the police on his phone, said that the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
"The tensions are getting higher," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who has been in provisional custody since the end of last year, declared that he was taking part in the European Parliament elections next year.
'A candidate for the European elections is the best way to sue the decline in democratic values and repression we have seen from the Spanish government,' he said.
Londonderry: men arrested after house was rammed by car
Three men of 33, 34 and 39 years of age were arrested after a car was repeatedly rammed in a Londonderry house.
The incident occurred around 7.30 p.m. on Thursday in Ballynagard Crescent.
Police inspector Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building itself had been damaged.
A cross-bow on the car may have been fired at some point.
Livingston wins 1-0 against Rangers thanks to destination of Menga
Dolly Menga's first target for Livingston gave them victory
He has been a member of the Ibrox Club since then, and has been a member of the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Menga's goal made the difference and Gary Holt's team came to be on the same level with Hibernian.
Gerrard's team failed this season to win a competition during the Premiership. They have to take the Sunday against leader Hearts, who represents eight points on them.
But first the Rangers will receive Rapid Vienna Thursday in the Europa League.
The team already won six consecutive matches in his department, and trainer Holt has not suffered any defeat since he had Kenny Miler replaced last month.
Livingston misses opportunities against strong visitors
Holt's team could have made a head start long before the first goal, because their direct way of playing caused all kinds of problems with the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but failed to finish it with a target. Then Alan Lithgow, who caught Craig Halkett's headball, kicked the ball above the target.
The home team let the Rangers play with great pleasure, and waited his chances quietly and confidently.
And that eventually led to the crucial goal.
The Rangers allowed a free stairway and Livingston provided an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson worked together to create an opportunity for Menga, who scored from the criminal field.
At that time, the Rangers had been holding a ball for some time, but the defense of the home team was immutable and target man Liam Kelly had not had much to do yet.
That pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos had to prevent Kelly from reaching a goal.
Scott Pittman kicked the ball at the feet of Rangers-goelman Allan McGregor and Lithgow missed the goal after a move of his colleagues from Livingston.
Ongoing progress reached the criminal area of Livingston, but they were refused every time. Twice a penalty kick was refused, one after Halkett's attack on invader Glenn Middleton and one for handball.
'Fenomenal' by Livingston - analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
They played invariably excellent and continue to exceed expectations in their race to the top.
Their style of play and the composition of their team has hardly changed since their return to the highest regions, but Holt in particular deserves much recognition for the way he has pushed the team up since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Commander Halkett was fantastic, with an excellently organized defense, while Menga Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall walked on the tops of their toes throughout the game.
The Rangers, however, did not know how to break through.
Even though they have often played very well under Gerrard, this time they have not reached their usual level.
Their final phase was not good enough (they managed only once to hide the home team) and the Rangers will now realize that they have to play better, because they are somewhere in the middle of the classification.
Erdogan is received with mixed feelings in Cologne
Under a radiant blue sky and with a broad smile, the leaders of Turkey and Germany went together on Saturday (29 September) breakfasts in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, aimed at restoring relations between NATO allies.
They disagree on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan left for Cologne for the opening of a huge new mosque.
Cologne is the home of the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police called for security reasons when they let the crowd of 25,000 people gather for the mosque, but many sympathizers came near to see their president.
Hundreds of demonstrators, many of them Kurds, also heard their voices, condemning both Erdogan’s policy and the decision of the German government to welcome him in the country.
The rival protests reflect the division over a visitor praised by some German Turks as a hero and accused by others as autocrat.
Traffic accident in Deptford: Biker dies after car collision
In London a cyclist died in a collision involving a car.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, in the southeast of the city, at about 10.15 a.m. local time.
The driver of the car stopped and the ambulance staff was present, but the man died on the spot.
A few months ago, another cyclist died in a flight crime accident on Childers Street, about a mile from the Saturday accident.
The Metropolitan Police said that agents were busy identifying the man and his immediate family.
The road is closed in different places, buses are diverted and motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six textures injured in violation of order
Six cipiers have been injured in an order disorder in a heavily secured prison for men, according to the prison office.
The riots broke out on Sunday at about 9.30 a.m. local time in HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire and are still going on.
Specialized 'Tornado' pioneers are used to resolve the situation, involving eight prisoners in one department.
The cipiers were treated for slight facial injuries.
A spokesman for the prison system said: “Specially trained prison personnel have been employed for an up-to-date incident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and those responsible are at least referred to the police and may have to stay behind bars longer.'
In HMP Long Lartin, more than 500 prisoners live, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the director of the prison had been treated in the hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, the riot police were called to prison for a serious disorder in which personnel were attacked with billiards.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with sudden floods (with possible positive effects on drought areas)
It is rare for a tropical depression to reach Arizona, but that is exactly what is likely to happen at the beginning of next week, because the remaining energy from Hurricane Rosa is moving across the southwest of the desert area, which poses risks to flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings for sudden floods for Monday and Tuesday for the west of Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, and the southeast of California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to hang just above Phoenix on Tuesday night, and it will rain already on Monday night.
The Phoenix National Weather Service noted in a tweet that since 1950 only ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of tropical storm or depression in the area of 200 miles from Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border.'
The most recent models of the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 centimetres of precipitation, with isolated quantities up to 15 centimetres in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
Other parts of the southwest of the desert area, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to get 3 to 5 cm of rain, and here and there is 10 cm possible.
For areas that are not at risk of flooding, Rosa's rain can be a blessing because the region is affected by drought.
Although floods are very worrying, part of this rainfall is likely to be favorable, as the southwest is currently experiencing a drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, the map showing current drought areas, just over 40% of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought, the second highest category,' reportedweather.com.
The route of Hurricane Rosa reaches the mainland through the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa is still at hurricane strength on Sunday morning at a maximum wind speed of 140 km per hour, is located 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moves north at a speed of 20 km per hour.
The storm hits cooler waters in the Pacific, weakening them.
That is why it is expected to arrive Monday in the afternoon or evening with the force of a tropical storm in Mexico.
There may be heavy rain in parts of Mexico, which entails a significant flood risk.
'A total impact of 8 to 15 cm is expected from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, with up to 25 cm possible,' reportedweather.com.
Rosa moves north across Mexico like a tropical storm before she reaches the Arizona border on Tuesday in the early morning hours as a tropical depression, which will then pass through Arizona and south of Utah on Tuesday evening.
'The greatest danger expected from Rosa or her tail is very severe rainfall in Baja California, northwest of Sonora, and southwest of the desert area' said the National Hurricane Center.
This rain is expected to lead to life-threatening sudden floods and ruins in the deserts and landslides in mountainous terrain.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: four arrests on suspicion of attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old with stab wounds was found in Somerset.
The teenager was found wounded on Saturday at about 4 hours local time in the Excelsior Terrace district in Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to the hospital and his condition is stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested in the Radstock area at night, says Avon and Somerset police.
The police are asking anyone who may have filmed something about what happened to report.
Trump says Kavanaugh 'has been under the meanness, the anger' of the Democratic Party.
'A voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to reject the ruthless and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party', Trump said during a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that during his appointment procedure Kavanaugh constantly 'was under the meanness, the anger' of the Democratic Party
Kavanaugh witnessed to Congress on Thursday and strongly and emotionally denied the accusation of Christine Blasey Ford that he had sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also witnessed her accusation during the hearing.
The president said on Saturday that the 'American people saw 'the beautiful and incredible character, the quality and courage' of Kavanaugh that day.
'A voice to acknowledge Judge Kavanaugh is a voice that recognises one of the most complete legal opinions of our time, a lawyer with an excellent state of service,' he told the crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The President indirectly referred to the appointment of Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of Republican attendance at the mid-term elections.
‘Over five weeks, one of the most important elections in our lives takes place.
I'm not taking part, but actually I'm taking part," he said.
"That's why I stand up for great candidates everywhere."
Trump explained that the Democrats are on a mission to 'resistance and hinder'.
The first important procedural vote in the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh is expected to take place no later than Friday, said a leading member of the GOP management to CNN.
Hundreds kill by Indonesian earthquake, tsunami, and the toll is increasing
In a large earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, at least 384 people were killed, with many being wiped away when huge waves crashed on the beach, the authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday, when waves of up to six meters high hit the land at the time it began to slumber. Many people plowed and the waves destroyed everything on their path.
The tsunami was the result of an earthquake with a force of 7.5 on the Richter scale.
‘When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, there were still people on the beach. They did not walk away immediately and thus became the victim of the tsunami,’ said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman of the Indonesian Agency for Aid to Natural Resources BNPB during a briefing in Jakarta.
'The tsunami also led to other dangers: he dragged cars, tree trunks, houses, he touched everything on the land,' said Nugroho, who added that the tsunami had traveled over the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coastline.
Some people climbed into a tree to escape the tsunami and survive, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
In air pictures released by the natural disaster relief agency, it can be seen that many buildings and shops are destroyed, bridges are distorted and collapsed and a mosque is surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal city remained shaken by aftershocks.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) stated in a statement that the energy released during the massive Friday earthquake was about 200 times the power of the atom bomb that had fallen on Hiroshima in the second half of the year.
It is possible that the geography of the city, which lies at the end of a long, narrow bay, has enlarged the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as ‘significant’ and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had collapsed.
Some fatal victims were trapped under the ruins of collapsed buildings, he said, some 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the number of victims and damage could be even greater along the coastline 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communication with Donggala "is completely flat, we have no information at all," said Nugroho.
More than 300,000 people live there,” said the Red Cross in a statement. The Red Cross staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
‘This is already a tragedy, but it can get even worse,’ said the Red Cross.
The organization received a lot of criticism on Saturday because it had not said that a tsunami had hit Palu, although employees said that the waves had reached the country within the time the warning had been given.
In amateur images shared on social media, it can be heard how a man on the upper floor of a building panicked at people down the street to warn them that a tsunami is coming.
Minutes later, a wall of water collapses on the coast and buildings and cars are dragged away.
Reuters could not check the images immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major current disruption that cut off communication around Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army is currently sending cargo aircraft with auxiliary goods from Jakarta and other cities, said authorities, but the evacués still need food and other basic needs.
The airport of the city is only reopened for aid and remains closed to the public until October.
President Yoko Widodo will visit evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
Tsunami death toll rises above 800.
It's very bad.
Although World Vision employees from Donggala arrived safely in the city of Palu, where employees in the courtyard of their office were looking for shelter in tents of deck, but passing scenes of destruction along the way, said Doseba.
'They told me they saw many houses that had been destroyed,' he said.
It's very bad.
Even when relief groups began the difficult task of launching emergency aid, some complained that certain foreign aid providers with great expertise could not travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian legislation, financing, goods and personnel from abroad can only be authorised if the site of a disaster is declared as a national natural disaster area.
That hasn't happened yet.
‘It’s still a disaster at the provincial level,’ said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
'As soon as the government says, 'O.K., this is a national disaster', we can provide international assistance, but that status has still not been declared.'
When the second night after the earthquake and tsunami of Friday fell on Palu, friends and relatives of missing ones kept hoping that they would find their loved ones alive, such as in the miracles that people like to hear from terrible natural disasters like this.
Saturday a boy was taken out of a sewer.
On Sunday, relief workers liberated a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days with the corpse of her mother next to her.
Gendon Subandano, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paraglidings for the Asian Games, which had taken place earlier this month in Indonesia.
His students were also stuck in the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi.
"As a veteran in the paragliding world, I carry my own emotional tax," he said.
Mr. Gendon told us that the news that the Roa Roa Hotel had collapsed had spread in the paragliding community and that in the hours thereafter he had sent desperate WhatsApp messages to the athletes in Palu, who participated in the beach festival.
In his messages, however, only one gray fin appeared instead of two blue finches.
"I think that means the messages have not been delivered," he said.
Thieves steal 26.750 dollars during vending of ATM in Newport on the Levee
Friday morning thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who was filling a vending machine in Newport on the Levee, according to a Newport police press release.
The driver had just emptied a ATM in the entertainment complex and wanted to fill him with money, said Inspector Dennis McCarthy in the report.
When he was busy, another man from behind Brink's employee walked and stole a bag of money that was ready to deliver.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing, according to the press release, but the police did not say how many persons were involved in the incident.
Those who have information about the identity of the perpetrators are asked to contact the Newport police on number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapid turns his name into Ye
Rapid Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
Last Saturday he announced the change on Twitter with the words: ‘The being that is formally known as Kanye West’.
The 41-year-old West has been named Ye for a short time and used this nickname as a title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The name change was announced in the run-up to his performance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to introduce his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled her performance during the show for ‘emotional reasons’, says the creator of the show.
Ye is not just an abbreviation of his current artist name. Previously West already told that the word has a religious meaning for him.
In my opinion, 'ye' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you',' said West earlier this year, when he told about the title of his album by radio presenter Big Boy.
‘So I am you, I am us, we are.
I've been transferred from Kanye, which means 'the only', to just Ye, a reflection of the good in us, the bad, the confused, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are."
He's not the only famous rapper who changes his name.
Sean Combs was formerly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy of Diddy, but this year announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who used to work with West, has already worked with and without the interconnected sign and capital letters.
Mexican President Promises Not to Use Armed Forces Against Citizens
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the elected president of Mexico, has promised never to use military power against civilians, and the country is on the eve of the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday on Tlatelolco Plaza that he would never use military violence to suppress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, military forces fired in a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing as many as 300 people, during which period left-wing student movements occurred throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to help young Mexicans by giving monthly grants to students and opening up more free public universities.
He said that young people often become members of criminal gangs as a result of unemployment and a lack of opportunities to study.
United States should double the financing of A.I.
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount they spend on research of A.I., says investor and A.I. specialist Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for all Google, Microsoft and Apple.
He says this in response to the announcements of A.I. coming from different departments of the U.S. government, despite the fact that the US does not have a formal strategy for A.I.
In the meantime, China announced its plan last year: by 2030, the country wants to be number one in the field of A.I. innovations.
'Doubleing the budget for research into A.I. would already be a good start, given that all other countries are so far behind the US, and we are looking for the next breakthrough in A.I.', said Lee.
A doubling of funding can lead to a doubling of the chance that the next major achievement for A.I. will take place in the USA, said Lee this week in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book 'AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order' this month was published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which invested in Face++, one of China's most important A.I. companies.
In the 1980s he worked in Carnegie Mellon University on an A.I. system that defeated the best player of American Othello, and later he was manager of Microsoft Research and President of the Chinese department of Google.
Lee expressed his appreciation for technology competitions organised by the U.S. government, such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when the next contest would take place because it would help to discover the next visionaries.
In the US, researchers often have to work hard to get government subsidies, said Lee.
"China doesn't pick up our best academics, the companies do," said Lee.
In recent years Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recruited the best powers of universities to work on A.I.
Lee said that American efforts in the area of A.I. would also benefit from a change in immigration policy.
'Whoever holds a doctorate in A.I. should be offered a green card automatically,' he said.
The Chinese National Council issued its next-generation development plan for artificial intelligence in July 2017.
The Chinese Science Foundation provides financial support to staff of academic institutions, just as the National Science Foundation and other public organizations provide funds to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, said Lee.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defence set up a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, designed to involve industrial and academic partners in the initiative, and announced the formation of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced that $2 billion would be invested in the AI Next initiative.
The NSF is currently investing more than 100 million dollars in research into A.I.
However, the US legislation that should lead to the establishment of a national safety committee for artificial intelligence has been in the loop for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on possible change in the name of their country
Last Sunday, the Macedonian people voted in a referendum on the possible change in their country's name to 'Republic of Northern Macedonia', which would result in a dispute with Greece that has been drawing up for decades and would no longer hinder Greece's application for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province also called Macedonia, and says that the name of its northern neighbour means that the country is entitled to Greek territory, so Greece has vetoed the inclusion of Macedonia in the European Union and NATO.
The two authorities concluded an agreement in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalists believe that the change of name would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he was not going to vote in the referendum and by a boycott campaign it is not certain that the required rise of at least 50% will be achieved, so the referendum may not be valid.
The question on the vote is as follows: 'Are you in favour of membership of NATO and the EU with acceptance of the agreement with Greece?'
‘Professors of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that the price to be paid is worth trying to join bodies such as the EU and NATO. Macedonia is one of the countries that originated when the former Yugoslavia broke up.
‘I am today voting for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because that will lead to a safer life for all of us, said 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska in Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, sufficient Members of Parliament have indicated that they will respect the outcome, making it decisive.
The name change would require a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The National Electoral Committee said that there had not been any reports of irregularities at 1 p.m.
However, the rise was only 16% at the time, compared with 34% during the previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of the registered voters came to vote.
‘I come to vote because it’s important for my children. Our place is in Europe, said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, a elector in Skopje’s capital.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev of Macedonia, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted on 30 September 2018 in Strumica, Macedonia, during the referendum on the country's change of name that would open the way for NATO and the European Union membership.
For the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov set up a small stage and placed chairs for tents placed by people who boycotted the referendum.
‘We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to participate as a full member, not via a back gate, said Kavadarkov.
‘We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries, such as China and Russia, and become part of European-Asian integration.'
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20%.
'I am convinced that the vast majority is in favour, because more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO,' said Zaev after he voted.
He said that a 'yes' as a result would be 'a confirmation of our future'.
An opinion poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum, less than the required rise.
Another poll carried out by hot Macedonian TV station Telma TV concluded that 57 percent of respondents were planning to vote on Sunday.
Of that, 70% would vote yes.
If the referendum is to be successful, the rise must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-western government's policy since it came into power in May last year.
Look at: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City passes full defense of Brighton and scores
Last Saturday, Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling made short measurements of Brighton's defense in the Etihad Stadium in Manchester. Manchester City won the 2-0 match.
It seemed like a whistle of a cent, how Aguero scored in the 65th minute.
The Argentine peak was first played on civil society.
He raced between three Brighton defenders, straight into the open field.
There Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He managed to pass a defender and was too quick for some others on the edge of Brighton's criminal territory.
Then he gave a pass to the left, where Sterling was waiting.
The English attacker used his first action in the criminal area to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right shoe to defeat target man Mathew Ryan with a shot in the right side of the net.
'Aguero has problems with his feet,' told Coach Pep Guardiola of Manchester City to the press.
‘We decided to let him play for 55 to 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal at the time."
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the first advantage in the Premier League.
The target came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball when he was deep in Brighton's field.
He sent a beautiful stick pass along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane held the ball for a while and then sent Sterling to the second pole.
The Sky Blues player typed the ball in just before he was too far.
City takes place on Tuesday at 12.55 p.m. against Hoffenheim in the group phase of the Champions League. The race takes place in the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in the German Sinsheim.
Scherzer wants to play along and make it difficult for the Rockies to reach the play-off
Now that the Washington Nationals have been eliminated for the playoff, there was not much reason to force a new start.
However, the increasingly competitive Scherzer hopes to play Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still consequences for the participation of the Rockies in the play-off. They currently have one match at the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies have at least a game card for the play-off, thanks to their 5-2 victory against the Nationals last Friday, but now they want to do everything possible to ensure their first section title.
‘Although there is nothing left for us, we can at least pitch with the knowledge that the atmosphere here in Denver will be optimal with this audience and the other team will probably play at the highest level that I would encounter this year.
Why wouldn't I want to play with that?"
The Nationals still have to announce who is going to be on Sunday, but are said to be inclined to draw up Scherzer as a pitcher in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th start, stood in the field on Thursday and would still pitch next Sunday, although that is normally his rest day.
Washington's right-handed pitcher is on 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 traps in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump organizes meeting in West Virginia
The president referred indirectly to the situation surrounding Brett Kavanaugh, his candidate for the Supreme Court, while he spoke about the importance of Republican attendance at the interim elections.
‘All we have already achieved is at stake in November.
In five weeks' time, one of the most important elections will take place in our lives.
This is one of the really big elections. I'm not taking part, but actually I'm taking part. That's why I stand up for great candidates everywhere," he said.
Trump continued: ‘We see a terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, we see it happening now.
And they're determined to take power back, no matter what they need to do, you see the meanness, the blasphemy.
It doesn't matter who they hurt, who they have to push away to gain power and control. That's what they want: power and control, but we won't give them that."
The Democrats, he said, are on a mission to "resistance and hinder us."
'And we've seen that in the last four days,' he said, calling the Democrats 'evil and mean and false and lying'.
He named the name of the Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, who sits in the Senate Committee on Justice, which led to a loud protest from the public.
‘Do you remember what she replied?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, no, I'm waiting for one... that was really a bad body language, the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer a broad church.
The party is intolerant for people who say what they think
When the Momentum activists voted in my local party to censor me, that was no surprise.
After all, I am the latest in a whole series of Labour Members who have received that we are not welcome, just because we say what we think.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received a similar treatment because she stood firm against anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was punished for the censorship motion because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of sound economic policies, on national security, on Europe, ironically enough similar issues to those in which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The announcement of the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday stated: 'We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.'
And that was the case during most GC meetings on Friday evening during the eight years that I have already been a local Labour Member.
Unfortunately, this is not the tone of many meetings today and has long forgotten the promise of a 'more pleasant, softer' politics, if it had ever started.
It is becoming increasingly clear that a different opinion is not tolerated in the Labour Party and any opinion is assessed on whether it is acceptable to the Party leadership or not.
This started shortly after Jeremy became the leader. Colleagues who, as far as I knew, had a political view similar to mine, suddenly expected me to make a turnaround and take a position I would otherwise never have agreed to, from subjects such as national security to the European single market.
Every time I speak to a public, whatever I say, there are abuses on social media calling for the rejection of my candidacy as a Member of Parliament for the next elections, exposing the centre's politics and telling me that I should not be a member of Labour.
And that's just what I'm going through.
Indeed, I know that I am more lucky than some of my colleagues, because the remarks to my address are generally political.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who have to do with a flood of sexist or racist reactions every day, but are not intimidated.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is that there seem to be some sort of disparity.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that broad church and with every 'motion of distrust' or change of selection rules, the party becomes more petty.
For the past two years, I have often received the advice to keep myself down, not just to express my opinion out loud and then I would not be in trouble.
But I didn't go into politics for that.
Since I became a member of Labour 32 years ago, provoked by the neglect of the government of Thatcher which literally collapsed my classroom, I have always pleaded for better public services for those most in need, both in my role as a municipal council member and in my role as a minister.
I've never kept my politics hidden, not even at the last elections.
Everyone in Nottingham East had clarity about my policy positions and my contentious points with the current leadership.
I can only say one thing to those who have promoted the motion on Friday: when the country is moving towards a Brexit that will harm families, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But actually I have only one message, and it is not addressed to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters, whether they are members of Labour or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that threats to reject my candidate as parliamentarian for the next elections will not prevent me from acting according to what I think is in your interest.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unbeatn Ayr on the way to the top
Two late try's may have pulled the end result a little off, but there's no doubt that Ayr is rightly triumphant in this wonderful contest of the day in the Tennent's Premiership.
They're at the top of the classification, the only unbeatable team in the ten.
In the end, it was both their superior defense and their better chances that gave the home team the victory, and coach Peter Murchie was allowed to be satisfied.
'We've had a hard time in our matches so far, and we're still unbeatable, so I'm a happy man,' he said.
Robyn Christie van Melrose: 'All credit to Ayr, they have taken advantage of their opportunities better than we have.'
Grant Anderson's try in the 14th minute, finished by Frazier Climo, led to an advantage for Ayr, but by a yellow card from Rory Hughes from the Scottish national team (which he received during the Warriors match) Melrose was able to speak the figures and Jason Baggot managed to break down a try.
With a penalty, Climo provided an extra advantage for Ayr and scored a conversion after a solo just for the rest. Thus it became 17-5 for Ayr after the first half.
But Melrose started the second half well and the try of Patrick Anderson, followed by a conversion of Baggot, reduced the advantage to five points.
The match was held for a long time before a serious injury by Ruaridh Knott, who was led off on a stretcher card, and once the match had started again, Ayr was able to continue with a try of Stafford McDowall followed by a conversion of Climo.
Then captain Blair Macpherson of Ayr got a yellow card, and again Melrose settled with the extra man then no conversion followed a try by Bruce Colvine at the end of a game where the pressure was very high.
However, the home team came back, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card because he tangled Climo without the ball, MacPherson behind the moving Ayr mouth provided a touch-down at the penalty-line-out.
Climo took care of the conversion, and did so almost immediately after the restart, after Kyle Rowe picked up the box kick of David Armstrong and sent halfback Gregor Henry away for the fifth try of the home team.
Star of Still Game is ready for new career in the restaurant world
It looks like Acteur Ford Kieran is going out of Still Game in the restaurant. Apparently, he has been appointed director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old is playing Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he writes in and in which he acts together with his comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo has announced that the coming ninth series will be the last in the series, and it seems that Kirenn is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor did not want to comment on the story, but a source from the Scottish Sun suggested that Kirenning was looking for a way to participate in the 'flowering restaurant business' in Glasgow.
'The sea is ours': the Bolivian country-locked hopes that the court will reopen the path to the Pacific
Seamen patrol in a Navy in La Paz.
On public buildings, an ocean-blue flag is waving.
On all marine bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the motto is: ‘The sea is ours.
It's a duty to win them back."
In all the country-rounded Bolivia, the memory of the coastline that the country has had to hand over to Chile after a bloody 19th-century conflict of raw materials is still alive, as is the desire to re-enter the Pacific.
That hope may have reached its highest point in the last few decades, since Bolivia is awaiting a ruling from the International Court of Justice, which should be held on 1 October after five years of debate.
‘Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity, and of course looks forward to the outcome with positive prospects’, said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians throughout the country will look at the ruling of the Court of Justice on large screens, hoping that the Tribunal in The Hague will plead in favour of Bolivia that, after decades of spicy discussions, Chile is obliged to give Bolivia sovereign access to the sea.
Also for Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who next year stands for a controversial fight for reelection, much is at stake with the decision of Monday.
"We are very close to the return to the Pacific," he swore at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to decide in favour of Bolivia, and even if it did, there would be little change.
The United Nations body established in the Netherlands does not have the power to allocate the Chilean territory and has indicated that it will not determine the outcome of possible calls.
According to Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law, that the International Court's ruling is only six months after the final statement.
And the prospects for a positive outcome from Bolivia have certainly not improved, on the contrary, in the last four years the situation has perhaps become even worse.
'The case of access to the sea was hijacked by the current Bolivian government,' said Zárate.
The warlike rhetoric of Morales has all the good will that Chile might have completely undermined, she claimed.
Bolivia and Chile will continue their discussions at some point in time, but it will be extremely difficult to talk about this next.
The two countries have not had an ambassador in each other's country since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, who represents Bolivia in The Hague, denys that the decision of the court has been taken unusually quickly.
On Monday, Bolivia 'will have an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of international relations with Chile' and a chance to 'end 139 years of disagreements, with mutual benefits', he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, uses the maritime issue as a political crutch.
"Bolivia will never give up his right of access to the Pacific," he added.
'The verdict is an opportunity to see that we have to leave the past behind.'
North Korea says that nuclear disarmament is only possible if it can trust the US
The North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says that his country will never remove his nuclear weapons if Washington is unable to trust it.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to keep the promises made at a summit between the leaders of the rivals in Singapore.
He said this at the time when Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be about to restart the determined nuclear diplomacy, more than three months after the Singapore Summit with Kim Jong Un of North Korea.
Ri says that it is a 'utopia' that the continuing sanctions and the American objection to a declaration that will end the Korean war will ever get to the knees of North Korea.
Washington is not inclined to agree to the declaration without Pyongyang taking important steps in the field of disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is scepticism and there is a doubt that Pyongyang is serious if he says that he would waive an arsenal that the country probably sees as its only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo intends to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Fashion Shows in Paris reveal the latest collection of huge headgear, soon for sale in your area
If you want to expand your hat collection or keep the sun completely out of your sight, do not look further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne revealed a series of crazy oversized headgear for their SS19 collection on the catwalk, a striking move during the Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical hats were unthinkable this summer from Instagram and these designers have sent their eye-blinding creations on the catwalk.
The striking piece of Valentino was a gigantic beige hat decorated with a feathery wide edge, hanging over the eyes of the models.
Other oversized accessories were watermelons filled with precious stones, a wizard hat and even a pineapple, but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre masks, just in time for Halloween.
With many of the colorful masks, the lips were sewn, more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creation looked like diving equipment, complete with snorkel and glasses, while another looked like a melted ice cream.
And if you want to follow this bold fashion, you're lucky.
Stylwatchers predict that the huge hats will find their way to the clothing shops in your area.
The giant hats may have been inspired by 'La Bomba', the straw hat with a two-metre-wide edge that everyone wears, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the very impractical hat that appeared everywhere on social media also provided another great creation on the catwalk: a straw beach bag that was almost as big as the model in bathing suit that the bag carried.
The red orange raffia bag, lined with raffia franjes and finished with a white leather handle, was the most striking piece in the La Riviera SS19 collection of Jacquemus during Paris Fashion Week.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: 'I expect to see big hats and beach bags in the shops next summer. Since the designer has made such a huge impact, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for extra large accessories.'
John Edward: Languages skills essential for world citizens
The independent schools in Scotland have an excellent record of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with another series of excellent exam results, as well as individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community initiatives.
With more than 30,000 students in Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best service to their students and parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their pupils for secondary and higher education, their chosen careers and their place as world citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a custom-made school curriculum, we see that modern languages remain popular and desirable subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: ‘If you talk to someone in a language he understands, you reach his head.
When you talk to him in his own language, you reach his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely on English alone when we want to build relationships and a bond of trust with people from other countries.
From the recent exam results of this year, we can conclude that languages are at the top of the ranking, with the highest success rates within independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of the students who studied foreign languages achieved a high score.
The data, collected from 74 schools joined SCIS, show that 72 percent of the students scored a high score (‘A’) in Mandarin, while 72 percent of the students received an A, 69 percent of the students in French and 63 percent of the students in Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now valued as much as STEM subjects (science, technology, technology and mathematics) in independent school programmes and elsewhere.
A 2014 study of the UK Employment and Skills Commission showed that 17% of the obstacles to filling in job vacancies were attributed to a lack of language skills, according to employers.
Language skills thus become increasingly important to prepare young people for their future future.
As more and more jobs require language skills, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Whatever career a person chooses, if he has learned a second language, he will have a real advantage in the future with such a skill for life.
Communicating directly with people from abroad automatically gives a multilingual person the advantage of competition.
According to a YouGov survey of over 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75% were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation. French was the only language that exceeded 10%, with a total of 15%.
This is why investing in language education is now important for today's children.
Several languages, especially those of emerging economies, will provide children with a better chance of finding a meaningful job.
In Scotland, schools choose which languages they teach.
A number of schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while other schools will teach languages that are most important to the United Kingdom when they look ahead to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the interest of your child, there will always be different languages to choose from in independent schools, with teachers specializing in this field.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares children and gives them the skills needed to succeed, regardless of the future.
It cannot at present be denied that languages in a global business environment remain vital to the country's future, so this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should actually be regarded as 'international communication skills'.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
Il fat bee le faire.

LeBron makes his debut at the Lakers in San Diego on Sunday
Fans waiting for LeBron James' first match at the Los Angeles Lakers, waiting's almost over.
Lakers-coach Luke Walton announced that James will play Sunday in the opening competition before the season against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It still has to be determined how many minutes he will play.
"There will be more than one, and less than 48," said Walton on the official website of the Lakers.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell said in a tweet that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After the training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' schedule for the six matches prior to the season.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need any matches before the season to prepare myself," he said.
Period of Trump election rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia, on a long series of election rallys
It's the first of five planned Trump rallys in the coming week, including stops in places that he's naughty, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the vote has been held on the appointment of the candidate he chooses for the job in the Supreme Court, Trump wants to build support for the forthcoming mid-term elections, because the Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when voted in November.
What time does Trump’s rally in West Virginia begin tonight and how do you look online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, starts tonight, Saturday 29 September 2018, at 19:00.
You can view Trumps rally in West Virginia online via the live stream on YouTube.
Trump will probably talk about the hearings for candidate Chief Justice Brett Kavanaugh of this week. These were extra-laden when Kavanaugh is accused of sexual misconduct and the Senate may wait a week to vote on his appointment, while the FBI is investigating the case.
But the main aim of this series of rallys is to help the republicans who are candidate for the November elections get more momentum.
President Trump's campaign management said that in the next week these five rallys are intended to 'encourage volunteers and supporters, while the republicans try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Deputies', Reuters says.
'Conference control is so important for his programme that the president is travelling to as many states as possible now that the busy campaign season begins,' said a spokesman for the Trump campaign who did not want to be mentioned by name against Reuters.
The rally of tonight in the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could attract fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania and be discussed in the media of Pittsburgh, said West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday is the second time in the last month that Trump visited West Virginia, the state he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for the Senate of West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who remains in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come to give him a boost in the polls," said Simon Haeder, political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA is willing to fight to keep the hope alive in the run-up to Sunday's singles
After three one-sided sessions, the foursomes of Saturday afternoon might have been just what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging sling of opportunities is a completely invented sports concept, but it is a true player who really believes in it, and especially in competitions like this.
So who gets the best chances at the moment?
'They first had a six-point advantage, and now that's only four more, so we find that happiness is currently on our side,' said Jordan Spieth before he left at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe has the advantage of standing before four points, while there are twelve more in the game.
The Americans find, as Spieth said, that they have a little wind in their sails, and there are many things that give courage, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have played together all day long and scored three points of the four.
Spieth has been a fearless opponent from tea to green and he gives the good example.
The typical throat sounds he makes when he plays well became louder as his round progressed and he achieved a crucial pit with which he and Thomas became a success when he and Thomas were behind two points after two matches.
His pit with which they won the match at 15 was followed by a similar scream, the kind from which you can conclude that he believes the American team has not yet been defeated.
"You have to dig deep and worry only about your own game," said Spieth.
That's all these players can do now.
18 holes to press your stamp.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable story of the Ryder Cup.
This remarkable, but delicious European duo has four in four and can do nothing wrong.
'Moliwood' was the only duo that did not play bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the back nine on Friday morning they avoided bogey's.
As a result of that series, and the way they seem to exchange energy with their noisy audience, they are the players to be defeated on Sunday. If Fleetwood or Molinari wins, he will be the most popular player ever to win a European victory when the sun sets above Le Golf National.
preferably both at different holes at the same time.
However, it is premature to speak of a European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made short measurements with Sergio Garcia, the four-ball hero of that morning, when he made a duo with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the front nine led to a backwardness for the Spaniard and the Swede they no longer managed.
On Sunday, however, there is no one who can help to catch up.
The four-balls and foursomes are so fascinating to see through the interactions between the duos, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and the way a strategy can change in an instant.
The European team has played the best so far and has a good lead in the run-up to the last day, but this foursome session has also shown that Team USA is willing to take the fight, something that some, especially in the US, doubt.
Europe takes the lead with 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe starts with a nice advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup. After the four-balls and foursomes of Saturday, they are at the forefront of the United States with 10-6.
The ingenuity of the duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led their team with two victories more than Tiger Woods, who had difficulty, making them have four points in Le Golf National.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who wanted the trophy she lost two years ago in Hazeltine, was stronger than the blundering Americans in the four-balls in the morning, with a score of 3-1.
The US offered more resistance in the foursomes, where it won two games, but could not catch up with its backwardness.
Jim Furyk's team has to score eight points during the 12 singles competitions of Sunday in order to maintain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European newcomer to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, who were nicknamed 'Molliwood', are only the second duo in the history of the Ryder Cup after a sensational weekend that wins four points in their four opening competitions.
After playing Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-balls, they were beautifully played together and defeated a disappointing Woods and American newcomer Bryson Dechambeau with a powerful 5&4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two matches on Saturdays, occasionally showed a wonderful move, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in four-balls and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, equipped for the four-balls of the morning, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes and together beat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the number one and three of the world, with 2&1.
Yet, it was not a lean night for Europe on this pleasant day with a breeze southwestern of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, who already won the Major three times, and Justin Thomas set the norm for the Americans on Saturday with three points.
They won after a difficult match with 2&1 of the Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-balls and later defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 4&3 in the foursomes, after losing the first four holes.
It happened only twice before in the history of the Ryder Cup that a team has been able to catch up with four points at the beginning of the singles, although the team of Furyk has enough to play the game, as they currently have the trophy in their hands.
But now that they have been in second place for two days, a counterattack on Sunday seems too high.
North Korea says it 'in no case' will unilaterally disarm without confidence
The Foreign Minister of North Korea told the United Nations on Saturday that the continuing sanctions are leading to more and more distrust in the United States and that under such circumstances the country could in no way unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told the UN's annual General Assembly that over the past year North Korea had taken 'important goodwill measures', such as stopping nuclear and rocket tests, decommissioning the site for nuclear tests and promising not to spread nuclear weapons and technology.
"But we don't see a similar reaction from the US," he said.
'Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances we will under no circumstances disarm ourselves unilaterally.'
Although Ri repeated the known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phased" approach to denuclearisation, which would reward North Korea as it continued, it was noted that he did not a priori disapproval of unilateral de-uclearisation, as Pyongyang used to do.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between an active American president and a North Korean leader on June 12 in Singapore, when Kim promised to work towards the "denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula", while Trump promised guarantees for the security of North Korea.
North Korea is seeking a formal end to the Korean war of 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up his nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls for tough international sanctions against North Korea.
"The US insists on 'denuclearisation first' and increases the pressure by means of sanctions to achieve their goal in a compelling way and even by objecting to the 'declaration of the end of war'," said Ri.
‘The perception that sanctions can bring us to our knees is an air castle of the people who are ignorant of us.
But the problem is that the continuing sanctions only strengthen our distrust.'
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, something that the American leader did raise earlier in the week at the United Nations.
Instead, the Minister stressed three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: 'If the other party were South Korea and not the United States on this issue of denuclearisation, the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula would not have come to such an impasse.'
Yet, the tone of Ri's speech was quite different from last year, when he told the United Nations General Assembly that it was inevitable that North Russian missiles should be directed to the American continent after 'Mr Evil President' Trump Kim called a 'raketman' on a suicide mission.
Trump, who threatened to destroy North Korea completely last year, praised Kim to the United Nations this year to take his courage to take steps to disarm, but said that much still needs to be done and that sanctions should continue to deucrate to North Korea.
On Wednesday Trump said he had no timetable for this: 'Whether it takes two years, three years or five months, that doesn't matter.'
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council on Thursday: 'The enforcement of the Security Council sanctions must be continued forcefully and firmly until we have achieved the complete, final, verified denucliarisation.'
Since 2006, the Security Council has made unanimous sanctions against North Korea in order to significantly reduce funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo had a meeting with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and said that he would go back to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit was not good.
Almost a few hours after he left Pyongyang in July and said that progress had been made, North Korea accused him of making 'concealed demands'.
North Korea promised this month during a meeting with Moon to dismantle a rocket site and also a nuclear complex if the United States were to take 'appropriate measures'.
He said that Kim had told him that the 'appropriate measures' he wanted were security guarantees that Trump had promised in Singapore, and steps towards normalising relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on the importance of adequate rest
A new course at Harvard University this year ensures that all students get more sleep, in an effort to combat the growing macho culture in which it seems cool to study all night while drinking a lot of caffeine.
A professor noted that the students of the world's largest university often have no idea of the basic principles of caring for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School, a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, set up the course. As far as he knows, this is unique in the US.
He had the idea of starting the course after giving a talk about the influence of sleep deficiency on learning.
'At the end of my speech, a girl came to me and said, 'Why am I only getting to hear this now, in my last year?'
She said no one ever told her how important sleep is, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, organized for the first time this year, explains to students the basic principles of how good sleep habits help improve academic and athletic performance and how they also promote their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of university health services, said the university decided to organize the course when it was found that students had a serious sleep shortage during the week.
The course lasts one hour and includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one of the parts, the students see a picture of a dormitory, where they click on coffee cups, curtains, exercise appliances and books to learn more about the effects of caffeine and light and the way sports performance are influenced by sleep shortage, and the importance of a routine when going to sleep.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep deficiency increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Using a campus map, with interactive icons, participants are encouraged to think about their daily routine.
‘We know that this will not immediately change the behaviour of the students.
But we believe that they have the right to know all of this, just as people have the right to know the consequences of the choice of cigarettes on their health, added Czeisler.
Studying the culture of fidelity on a night still exists, he says, and because of modern technology and the increasing pressure on students sleep shortage is an ever-increasing problem.
Ensure sufficient sleep, of good quality, must be the student's 'secret weapon' to combat stress, fatigue and fear, he said, and even to avoid weight gain, because sleep deficiency makes the brain give them a constant hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from Calfornia who is studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to set up the course, after all, last year he had taken lessons with the professor when he studied at Harvard in his first year.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to ensure that the course became available to everyone on campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all students to follow a similar study program before coming to the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler advises students to set an alarm for their bedtime, and not only an alarm to stand up, but also to be aware of the harmful effects of the 'blue light' of electronics screens and LED lighting, which can disrupt your circadiaan rhythm, which may make you have difficulty falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: destination of Menga destroys Gerrard's men
The Rangers saw their competition again disappointing as Dolly Menga scored and the weak team of Steven Gerrard defeated with 1-0 in Livingston.
The team of Ibrox hoped for a first victory in a competition since they defeated St. Johnstone with 4-1 in February, but Gary Holt's team made the defeat, barely the second of Gerrard as manager in 18 matches. His team now stands eight points behind Hearts, which continue to run at the top of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga scored seven minutes before rest, and the Rangers failed to score the equalizer.
The Rangers now drop to sixth place, Livingston rises to third, with only a difference in number of goals compared to Hibernian.
And the Rangers could get even more trouble, as border judge Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound after apparently an object was thrown to him by the visitor team supporters.
Gerrard made eight changes in his team. They stopped by Ayr and went to the semifinals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt stayed with the same eleven for Livingston, who had managed to cut off the Hearts a point last week. He would have been thrilled by the way his well-trained team managed to block the opponents at every move.
The Rangers may have owned the most, but Livingston did more.
They should have scored after two minutes, when Menga gave the ball for the first time and Scott Pittman had the target of Allan McGregor in his sight, but the civil society could not finish it.
A deep free staircase of Keaghan Jacobs reached commander Craig Halkett, but his colleague-defender Alan Lithgow kicked against the rear pole.
The Rangers managed to take control, but they seemed to hope for a good outcome rather than that they really believed in it if they could approach the goal.
Alfredo Morelos found at least that he was entitled to a criminal kick when he and Steven Lawless collided after a quarter of an hour of playing, but referee Steven Thomson waved away the Colombian's request.
The Rangers were only able to shoot at the target twice in the first half, but Liam Kelly, who was formerly a target at the Ibrox, could easily stop Lassana Coulibaly's headball and the tame shot of Oviedo Ejaria.
The opener of Livingston in the 34th minute may not be in the length of the general game, no one can deny that they deserved this, even if it was only for their hard work.
Once again, the Rangers were not up against Jacobs' deep game pattern.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher passed the ball on to Scott Robinson, who remained cold-blooded and chose Menga, who easily stepped the ball into the target.
Gerrard caused an interruption with the change of Coulibaly/Ryan Kent. This move had almost immediate consequences when the wing player Morelos passed, but an impressive Kelly raced away from his line to stop the ball.
But Livingston continued to force visitors to play the kind of game that Livingston prefers to play, while Lithgow and Halkett continue to kick long balls.
Holt's team could have increased its lead in the final stage of the game, but McGregor stood well and blocked Jacobs, after which Lithgow came wide from the corner.
Invading Glenn Middleton of the Rangers, at the end of the game, asked for a criminal kick after a hit with Jacobs, but Thomson looked the other way.
Almanak: Geigerteller's inventor
And now a page from the almanac of our 'Sunday Morning': 30 September 1882, today exactly 136 years ago, for whom it is possible to tell TELLEN... the day when future physicist Johannes Wilhelm 'Hans' Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device called Geigereller.
Since then, the Geiger counter has been unthinkable from science, and has also become an icon in pop culture, for example in 'Bels or Coronado', a 1950 film with the unlikely cowboy scientist Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: 'What the hell is that?'
Rogers: ‘That’s a Geiger counter, which is used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
If you set up this headphone, you'll hear the effect of the atoms released by the radioactivity in the minerals."
Evans: ‘It’s really banging now!’
'Hans' Geiger died in 1945, barely a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name remains relevant.

Vaccin learns immune system to recognize malignant cells in the context of treatment
The method includes the extraction of immune cells in a patient to transform them into a laboratory
They can then ‘see’ a protein that often occurs in many cancers and are then re-injected
A test vaccine produces promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months
The method removes immune cells in a patient, after which the cells in the lab are adjusted in such a way that they can ‘see’ the protein HER2, which often occurs in all kinds of cancers. Then the cells are re-injected.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 'stimulates the growth of different types of cancer', including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer and intestinal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar way to remove immune cells from patients and ‘learn’ these cells to tackle cancer cells has been shown to work in treating a particular type of leukemia.
Kanye West turns pro-Trump tyrade off and wears MAGA-pet after his appearance in Saturday Night Live.
That wasn't what he was hoping for.
Kanye West was released during a Saturday Night Live broadcast after an incoherent performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he was a presidential candidate in 2020.
After bringing his third song of the evening, Ghost Town, with a cap on his head with the text Make America Great Again, he set off a tyrade against the Democrats and repeated his support for Trump.
‘Often when I talk to a white man, he asks, ‘How can you be kind to Trump now? He’s a racist!’
If I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
The release of Saturday Night Live began with a parody in which Hollywood star Matt Damon stopped the dragon with Brett Kavanaugh's testimony in the Senate Committee on Justice in connection with the alleged assault of which Christine Blasey Ford accuses him.
The tyrade of West was not broadcast, but comedy Chris Rock uploaded them on social media.
It's not clear if Rock wants to stick the dragon with West with his post.
West also complained to the public that he had been taken backstage for his cap.
‘They fought me backstage.
They said, "Don't step on the stage with that cap."
They fought me!
And then they say I'm apathetic," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: ‘Do you want to see what apathetic looks like?’ He said he would put on her superman cape, ‘because that means you can’t command me. Do you want the world to get better?
Give me some love."
From the audience came at least twice the call and the castles of SNL seemed embarrassed, according to Variety. The magazine was told by one present: 'The whole studio was suddenly quiet.'
West was guested as last-minute replacement of singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-friend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West surprised many with a performance of the song I Love it while he was dressed as Perrier bottle.
West received support from the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: 'To one of our bravest spirits: BETWEEN YOU DE MASSA TROTSEERT.'
But talk show presenter Karen Hunter tweeted that West was just "just himself, and that's wonderful."
‘But I do not choose to reward someone who does not harm, support and spit out an ideology that harms my community (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his ‘art’).
He's free to do whatever he wants.
So did we," they added.
Before the show started, the rapper had announced on Twitter that he had changed his name. From now on, he says, ‘the being that is formally known as Kanye West’.
He is not the first artist to change his name. He was led by Diddy Puff, also known as Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Colleague rapper Snoop Dogg also bore the name Snoop Lion and the late music legend Prince once turned his name into a symbol and then into The artist formally known as Prince.
Accused of attempted murder after stabbing in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was accused of attempted murder after a man was stabbed on Friday in a restaurant in eastern Belfast.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, the police said.
The defendant is expected to appear before the police judge in Belfast on Monday.
The accusation will be investigated by the Public Ministry.
Game of Thrones-star Kit Harington brings out to toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as sword fighter Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones of HBO.
But the 31-year-old actor goes to the macho's stereotype and says that young boys often think they have to be tough to get respect when seeing such roles on the screen.
In a conversation with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that he felt that 'there was something wrong' and asked himself how the problem of toxic masculinity should be addressed in the age of #MeToo.
Kit, who recently married his co-star of Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, who is also 31, admitted that he is strongly convinced that the problem needs to be addressed.
'This is really an important question for me personally at the moment: where did our masculinity go wrong?' he said.
"What did we teach men when they were growing up, which makes us face this problem now?"
Kit believes that television might be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity, due to its very male characters.
He continued: ‘What is innate and what has been learned?’
What is being taught on TV and on the streets that makes young boys think they should be a certain kind of man?
I think that is one of today's big questions: how do we change that?
Because something clearly went wrong for young men."
In the interview he also admitted that he will not act in prequels or sequences of Games of Thrones when the series is over next summer, because he is ‘ready with battlefields and horses’.
Since November, Kit has been playing in a revival of True West by Sam Shepard, the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he feels that his meeting with his wife Rose is the most beautiful result of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife during the show, so that's how I've left my future family and my life from now on," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the great love of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the fantasy series that was awarded with an Emmy.
The couple married in June 2018 on the estate of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase of 14% new cases
China reports that the number of Chinese with HIV and AIDS has increased by 14%.
Health authorities say that more than 820,000 people have been affected in the country.
40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
In the vast majority of new cases, the diseases were passed on through sex, which was not the case before.
HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China in the past due to transfusions of contaminated blood.
But the number of people in this way HIV is now almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, compared to the same period last year, the number of people with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
The transmission of HIV via sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has no longer been punishable in China since 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be widespread.
Because of the conservative values of land, studies estimated that 70 to 90% of men who have sex with men would eventually marry a woman.
Often the diseases are transmitted by inadequate protection in sexual relations in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV drugs in the context of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denys that staff member leaked data from Republican senators and extracts it from 'hazardous lies' and 'complot theories'
The American Congressman Maxine Waters opposes allegations that one of her staff members has placed the personal data of three U.S. Republican senators on the Wikipedia page of the legislators.
The Democrat from Los Angeles claims that the allegations are spread by 'extremely right' disputers and websites.
'Lies, lies and even more mean lies', said Waters in a statement on Twitter.
The published data would include, among other things, the private address and private private number of the U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The data appeared online on Thursday. They were posted by an unknown person in Capitol Hill during a hearing of the Senate Committee on the charges of sexual misconduct at Brett Kavanaugh, candidate judge before the Supreme Court.
The leak came after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
According to conservative websites such as Gateway Poundit and RedState, the IP address that indicates the source of the posts was linked to the Waters office and contained the information of a Waters employee, said the Hill.
"This unfounded accusation is completely false and a flagrant lie," said Waters.
‘My colleague, whose identity, personal data and security are compromised as a result of these false accusations, was in no way responsible for leaking this information.
This unfounded accusation is completely false and a flagrant lie."
The declaration of Waters quickly met with criticism online, including by former press officer of the White House Ari Fleischer.
'This denial sounds angry,' wrote Fleischer.
‘From this you can imagine that she doesn’t have the temperament to be a Congressman.
If someone's accused of something he hasn't done, don't get mad.
He shouldn't rebel.
He should not question the prosecutor's motives.
He must remain calm and serene."
Fleischer appeared to compare the reaction of Waters to the criticism of the Democrats against Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of excessive evil during the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who wants to take over Waters' place in the mid-term elections, also gave his opinion on Twitter.
"Hungry, if it's true," he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had informed the relevant services and law enforcement authorities of these false accusations.
'We will ensure that the perpetrators become known,' she said, 'and that they are legally held liable for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to my staff workers.'
Review: Johnny English Strikes Again - weak spy parody with Rowan Atkinson
In every new film with a British impact, we are now traditionally looking for references to Brexit, and that is indeed applicable to this revival of the Johnny English franchise, the comic action films with a weak spy in the lead role, which started in 2003 with Johnny English and was created back in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Is this airy selfatire about how bad we are doing the latest export product for our country?
The incompetent Johnny English with his eye-catching eyes and flexible visions manages at least to send everything in the hundred, including with his second comeback. From his name, you can already conclude that he is a common comic character designed for cinematists in countries where one speaks a language other than English.
He is of course the foolish secret agent who, despite his bizarre claim to smooth glamour, has a little Clouseau, a touch of Mr Bean and a grain of that guy who contributed one note to the theme number of Chariots or Fire at the opening ceremony of the London Olympic Games in 2012.
He is originally based on the traveler and the international mysterious man Atkinson once played in Barclaycard's TV spots (who's forgotten everyone in the meantime) who always leaves behind a certain chaos.
His latest portrait of Johnny English contains one or two beautiful moments.
I loved how Johnny English approaches a helicopter in his medieval armor and tick the rotor blades against his helmet.
Atkinson can well show in this film how much talent he has for physical comedy, but the humor is rather weak and crazy enough excessive, especially now that the "serious" film series like 007 and Mission Impossible itself include as an ingredient, and do well.
The humor seems to be more for children than for adults, and Johnny English's wild disaster is less original and focused on me than the jokes without the text of the character Bean who plays Atkinson.
The constant theme now is that Britain is in great difficulty.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the super-secret spy network on the web, which has made the identity of all the active secret agents of Britain known, to the great horror of the agent in function, a unfortunately small role of Kevin Eldon.
That is the drop that causes the bucket to overflow from the prime minister, a pretentious woman with problems on her head and terriblely unpopular as a politician. Emma Thompson is doing her utmost with this character that reminds of Teresa May, but the script does not offer much to work with.
According to her intelligence advisers, she must use a retired spy, since each active spy is compromised.
And that means the stunning Johnny English himself, who now works as a schoolmaster in a chic institution, but unofficially teaches about undercover work. Here are fun jokes in the story, because the spying lessons of English remind you of School of Rock.
English is quickly invited to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with his former pathetic help Bough, replayed by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man. His wife is captain of a submarine, a turbulent and jovial role that lies below Vicki Pepperdine's level.
The Batman and Robin of the disastrous conditions of Her Majesty's Secret Service are thus back in action and meet Olga Kurylenko's blood-moving femme fatal Ophelia Bulletova.
In the meantime, the prime minister is unfortunately in favour of the charms of charismatic technology billionaire who claims to be able to solve British computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssee of crazy crazy fun: dressed as waiters, they set fire to a careful French restaurant, kicking noise aboard the luxury yacht of Volta and English uncooks pure anarchy when he tries to use a Virtual Reality headset to familiarise himself with the interior of Volta's house.
For the latter, all registers are opened, but however well-intentioned and turbulent the scene is, it reminds a little of children's television.
It's not all very original.
And just like with the other movies of Johnny English, I wonder: can the British film industry really not think of a role that honors Rowan Atkinson's talent?
Labour denys that the party is planning a plan in which Britons work four days a week but get paid for five days
The Labour Party of Jeremy Corbyn would consider a radical plan in which Britons work four days a week but get paid for five days.
The party is said to want bosses of companies to pass on the savings they make as a result of the revolution of Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) to their employees by giving them an extra day's holiday.
For example, employees can enjoy a three-day weekend, but still earn the same amount.
According to sources, the idea "fits" into the economic agenda of the party and plans to make the country's balance-sheet shone in the direction of the workers.
The transition to a four-day working week has already been approved by the Federation of Trade Unions, which finds it a good way to ensure that workers can benefit from the changing economy.
A high-ranking Labour Party source told The Sunday Times: ‘A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
"It will not happen at one time, but a four-day working week is a goal that fits within the party's efforts to make the balance in the economy more beneficial to workers, and that also fits within the party's overall industrial strategy."
Labour is not the first party to support such an idea, given that the Green Party has already promised a four-day week of work in the 2017 national election campaign.
However, the aim is not yet supported by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesperson said, "A four-day workweek is not a party policy intention, nor is it considered by the party."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Conference last week to make his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy clear.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back the power of the "facial drivers" and the "profiters" in utility companies.
The Shadow Chancellor's plans also mean that the current shareholders of water companies may not regain the full value of their share, because a Labour Government could apply 'reductions' based on observed misconduct.
He also confirmed that there are plans to include employees in the management boards of companies and to set up inclusive property funds (including Ownership Funds) to give 10% of private sector companies to employees who can earn up to £500 a year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell '60 Minutes' if the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh can make them change their mind
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least one week and raises the question of whether the FBI's findings could ensure that Republican senators withdraw their support for the candidate.
In an interview that is broadcast at '60 Minutes' on Sunday, correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham or the FBI to discover something that could lead them to change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more open in this than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I told the hearing I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, after the accusation came out, and I asked him, "Did you do it?"
He was determined, determined, unambiguous."
However, Graham's voice seems to be wall-resistant.
"My opinion of Brett Kavanaugh is firm and the accusation should contain dynamite," he said.
"As for Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett strongly denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And no one she mentioned could verify it.
It was 36 years ago.
I don't see any new developments."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it contributed to reducing poverty?
This Saturday, the Global Citizen Festival will be held in New York, an annual music event where a very impressive line-up of stars will be performed, with an equally impressive mission: the end of poverty in the world.
For the seventh time again, tens of thousands of people will come to the Great Lawn in Central Park for the Global Citizens Festival. Not only to enjoy acts like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes but also to generate awareness for the real purpose: ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizens Festival, which was organised for the first time in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, a group of international stakeholders hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting against it.
Concertgoers who want to get a free ticket for the event (unless they were willing to pay for a VIP ticket) had to complete a series of tasks, or 'actions', such as volunteering, e-mailing a world leader, making a phone call, or otherwise generating meaningful awareness for the purpose: an end to poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizen Festival been, with another 12 years to achieve this goal?
Is it the idea to reward people with a free concert a suitable way to convince people to demand a call for action or is this just another form of 'clickivism', making people feel that they are making a real contribution by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, according to Global Citizens, more than 19 million 'actions' of supporters have been registered, targeting a large number of different goals.
According to Global Citizens, these actions have contributed to the commitment of world leaders and have made policy proposals worth more than 37 billion dollars to change the lives of 2.25 billion people before 2030.
Early in 2018, the group quoted 390 initiatives and declarations based on the actions, at least 10 billion of which have already been paid out or brought together by sponsoring actions.
The group estimates that the funds obtained have so far had an impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Among the most important declarations of intent is that of The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and executives from the United Kingdom with the aim of 'helping children realize their full potential', which has promised Rwanda 35 million dollars to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the help of the British government, donors, other national governments and global citizens like you, we can make a footnote of social injustice in history," said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, to the public during a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also announced that, after more than 5,000 actions were sent in which the UK government was asked to improve the nutritional situation for mothers and children, the government announced to support a project, the Power of Nutrition, that 5 million women and children will reach with food interventions.
In answer to one of the frequently asked questions on the website of the Global Citizens asking "why do you think we can put an end to extreme poverty?"
the group replied: "It will be a long and difficult way, sometimes falling and failing.
But, like civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will ultimately succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of the artists who will perform this year at the New York event presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States can use the Navy for a 'blockade' to hinder Russian exports of energy - Minister for Home Affairs
Washington can 'if necessary' resort to the Navy to prevent Russian energy from entering the market, including in the Middle East, said Ryan Zinke, the US Minister of Home Affairs, as mentioned by the Washington Examiner.
Zinc claimed that Russia’s involvement in Syria, where the country is acting on invitation from the legal government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe that they are only in the Middle East to be able to act in energy, just like in Eastern Europe and the southern flank of Europe," he said.
And according to the staff, there are ways and means to combat this.
"The United States has that possibility, with the Navy, to ensure that the shipping routes remain open and, if necessary, to block them to ensure that their energy does not get on the market," he said.
Zinc spoke for invited people during an event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that is self-reflecting as the 'voice of the energy consumption' in the USA.
He went further and compared Washington's approach to Russia with Iran's approach and noted that these did not differ significantly.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less to use and replace fuels," he said, referring to Russia as a country that knows only a 'art', with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a time when the Trump government is trying to stimulate the export of liquid natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which is by far the cheapest option for European consumers.
For this reason, officials of the Trump government, including President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "unfit" pipeline project Nord Stream 2, which, according to Trum of Berlin, made Moscow's "prisoner".
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, worth 11 billion dollars, which will double the current pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is purely an economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's strong opposition to the project is governed only by economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we agree with the view that energy should not be used to exert pressure and that consumers themselves should be able to choose their suppliers," said Aleksandr Novak, the Russian Minister of Energy, after a meeting with Rick Perry, the US Minister of Energy, in Moscow in September.
The US position has triggered a reaction from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The Bundesverband der Deutschen Industrie (BDI), the leading industrial organisation in Germany, called on the US not to interfere with the EU's energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third power interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, the head of the German Industry Federation (BDI) after a recent meeting between German chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren 'thinks seriously' to participate in the presidential elections in 2020, says the Senator for Massachusetts
Elizabeth Warren, the Senator from Massachusetts, said on Saturday that she was "thinking seriously" about taking part in the presidential elections after the mid-term elections.
At a local meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was thinking about taking part in the elections.
"It's time for women to go to Washington to repair the damaged government, and this also means a woman in the top position," she said, according to the political newsmagazine The Hill.
"After 6 November, I'll think seriously about making myself elected president."
Warren executed against President Donald Trump during the meeting in the town hall and said he was "turning this country in the wrong direction."
"I'm worried about what Donald Trump is doing in our democracy," she said.
Warren has been open in her criticism of Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, his candidate for the Supreme Court.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course, we have to wait for an FBI investigation before we vote on it."
However, an opinion poll published on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own followers believe that it should not be elected by 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the 'probably' voters in Massachusetts said that the senator should not be elected, according to an opinion poll of the Political Research Center of Suffolk University and Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent were in favour of being elected.
The investigation showed that there was more support for former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent before a potential candidate and 48 percent against.
Other names of prominent Democrats associated with possible participation in the presidential elections in 2020 are former Vice-President Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, Senator from Vermont.
Biden said he would make an official decision in January, according to an Associated Press report.
Sarah Palin talks about PTSS from Track Palin at a election meeting of Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26 years old, spent a year in Iraq after serving in September.
He was arrested and charged after reporting domestic violence on Monday night.
"By what my own son has to experience, what he's going through now he's back, I understand for other families that are experiencing the consequences of PTSS and the injuries that some of our soldiers return to," she told the public that was present at a meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said about her son and other veterans "they come back a little differently, they come back and they get harder, they come back and wonder if there is respect for what their fellow soldiers and the pilots and all the other soldiers have given to the homeland".
He was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska on Monday and was charged with domestic violence and assault on a woman, interference in a report on domestic violence and possession of a weapon under influence, according to Dan Bennett, police spokesman in Wasilla.
Washington, D.C. and 18 States support the protest against a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal protest against a new US policy that refuses asylum to victims fleeing gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and Washington D.C. submitted a statement to the Washington Court last Friday to support an asylum seeker who is fighting this policy, reports NBC News.
The full name of the complainant in the Grace versus Sessions case that the American Civil Liberties Union launched in August against federal policy has not been announced.
She says that her partner "and his violent sons who are members of a gang" abused her but that American officials rejected her asylum application on 20 July.
She's locked up in Texas.
The lawyers of the states supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of people have applied for asylum in the US, as countries with major gang and domestic violence problems.
The new US asylum policy has reversed a 2014 Board of Immigrant Appeals decision, allowing immigrants without documents fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Karl Racine, the attorney general of Washington, D.C., said on Friday in a statement that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law".
"Federal legislation requires all asylum applications to be assessed on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application and such an obstacle is contrary to that principle" is stated by the "friend-of-the-court".
The lawyers further argue that the policy of denying immigrants access to the US is damaging to the US economy because these immigrants are likely to become new entrepreneurs and the country 'provide the necessary labour force'.
Jeff Sessions, the Minister of Justice, ordered judges in June to stop assigning asylum to victims of domestic and gang-related violence.
"Asiel is available to those who flee their country because of persecution or fear based on race, religion, nationality or membership of a specific social group or political belief", said Sessions in its announcement on 11 June of the policy.
Asiel was never intended to alleviate all problems, even if these problems are serious, with which people are faced every day, all over the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu while the number of deaths doubled in the race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation also got worse and worse.
"It feels very tense," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, trying to comfort her feverish baby in an evacuation centre in the devastated city of Palu.
" minute minute, new corpses arrive in ambulances.
And clean water is scarce."
Residents returned to their devastated homes and searched in their soaked possessions for valuables they could still use.
Hundreds of people have suffered injuries and the hospitals have been overpopulated, as long as they have not been damaged by the 7.5 earthquake on the Richter scale.
Some injuries, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a broken back and shoulder, rested outside the military hospital in Palu, where patients were treated outside because of the risk of severe aftershocks.
Tears filled his eyes when he told about his feelings when the devastating earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was printed against the remains of a wall," said Haris to an Associated Press correspondent and added that he was in town with his family for a wedding.
"I heard my wife crying for help, and later I heard nothing more.
I don't know what happened to her and our kid.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of 'inimidation' with 'propaganda ads'
A week after an official Chinese newsmagazine placed a four - page ad in an American daily, in which the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China were praised, the U.S. ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump last referred to the paid annex of China Daily in the Des Moines Register, the most sold newspaper in Iowa, after accusing China of interfering in the US Congress elections of November 6, an accusation denied by China.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere with the US elections marked, according to U.S. officials quoted by Reuters, a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to put China under pressure.
Although it is normal for foreign authorities to place ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in an escalating trade war, in which they have imposed increasingly higher import rates.
China's reprisals early in the trade war were specifically aimed at hitting exporters in states like Iowa, who support the Republican Party of Trump, as Chinese and American experts have said.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and previously Governor of Iowa, an important exporter of agricultural products to China, said that China had affected American workers, farmers and businesses.
"China", as Branstad wrote in an opinion paper in Des Moines Register of Sunday, "doubles the intimidation now by publishing propaganda ads in our free press".
"By spreading this propaganda, the government of China uses the freedom of expression and a free press, a long cherished tradition in America by placing a paid ad in Des Moines Register" wrote Branstad.
"In contrast, at a kiosk in the centre of Beijing, you will find in vain divergent voices and will not see any real reflection of the different opinions the Chinese people have on the difficult economic path, because the media are firmly under the thumb of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newsmagazines refused to publish his article," as he did not say which newspaper it was.
Through the Kavanaugh debacle, the Republicans estranged female voters just before the mid-term elections, warning analysts
Now many important Republicans around Brett Kavanaugh, the candidate for the Supreme Court, and defend him against various accusations of sexual violence, warn analysts that they will suffer a setback, especially among women, during the upcoming mid-term elections.
The emotions surrounding this subject have risen enormously, and most Republicans have already told us that they want to continue voting.
"These things cannot be turned back," said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, to The Hill for an article that appeared on Saturday.
Reeher said that he was wondering if the attempt of Senator Jeff Flake (Republic, Arizona) to plead for an FBI investigation at the last minute would be sufficient to please the angry voters.
"Women don't forget what happened yesterday, they didn't forget tomorrow, and they didn't forget it in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior consultant and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn on Friday, according to the Washington, D.C. newsmagazine.
On Friday morning protesters called "November is coming!" during their demonstration in the Senate Hall while the Republicans who have controlled the Justice Commission chose to approve the candidateship of Kavanaugh, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reported Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation for the Democrats will reach a record height," Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst, told the news site.
"People say it's already high, and that's true.
But it can go even further, especially among floating female voters in the suburbs and among younger voters, from 18 to 29 years of age, who often do not vote even though they do not agree with the president".
Even for the public testimony of Ford, in which she further explained her accusation of sexual intimidation against the candidate for the Supreme Court, analysts suggested that a setback might follow if the Republicans pushed through the appointment.
"This has become a confused mess for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former party president of the Republican Party, earlier last week according to NBC News.
"It is not only about the vote in committee, or about the final vote or whether Kavanaugh is taking place in court, but also about the way the Republicans have handled this and how they have treated it," Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, makes clear to the news channel a group that helps Democrats to be elected.
However, the Americans appear to be divided about who they believe after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a small majority standing out for the latter.
A new opinion poll by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents certainly or probably believe Ford's testimony and that 35 percent certainly or probably Kavanaugh believes.
In addition, 38 percent said that they thought Kavanaugh had certainly or probably lied during his witnessing while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After Flake's move, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's accusations and at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Last week Ford told the Senate’s Justice Committee that Kavanaugh had assaulted her under the influence of alcohol when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court showed her his genitals during a festival in the time they both studied at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans a new internet to tackle Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, starts a startup that wants to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the latest technology legend project, is a company based on Berners-Lee's open source platform Solid.
Solid provides users with the opportunity to choose where their data is stored and which persons have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that 'world domination' is the leading thought behind Inrupt.
"We have to do this now," he said about the startup.
"This is a historic moment."
The app uses Solid's technology to enable people to make their own 'personal online data storage' or POD.
It contains lists of contacts, activity lists, an agenda, a music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available together through one browser and all at the same time.
What makes POD unique is the fact that it completely depends on the user who has access to what information.
The company calls this 'personal empowerment through data'.
The idea behind Inrupt, according to CEO John Bruce, is that the company provides the resources, processes and necessary skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some developers contracted to work on the project, and a community of voluntary programmers.
From this week on, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralised apps with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team will not be talking to "Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete transformation that will put all their business models completely on their heads once".
"We don't ask for their consent."
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that the "mission (of Inrupt) is to deliver the commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps to protect the integrity and quality of the new web, which is built on Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute even after the start of Inrupt.
"I am incredibly optimistic about this new age for the web," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: spiritual and bearer of the Victoria Cross from World War I honored
The only clergyman of the Church of England who acquired a Victoria Cross during the First First Military is honored in his birthplace 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann received the award following the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt on 29 September 1918.
However, four days later he was killed by a sniper, so he never knew that the highest British military honor had come to him.
A commemorative stone was revealed by its two small zones during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of the grandsons, Michael Vann, said that it was 'brilliant symbolic' that the stone was revealed exactly 100 years after the fact for which his grandfather was distinguished.
According to the London Gazette, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion on 29 September 1918 over the Canal de Saint-Quentin "in a very dense fog and under fierce fire of field gun and machine gun".
Later, he rushed on to the fire line and led the line forward before only running to a field gun and shutting out three members of the deposit.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over one month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "something I know I can never touch it, but also something that makes me feel humble".
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid a wreath after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he "fell honored to be allowed to play a role in the parade" and added that "the bravery of a real hero is shown by the support he receives from a large number of people".
Fans of MMA stayed up all night to see Bellator 206 and got Peppa Pig instead
Imagine, you've stayed awake all night to see a complete Bellator 206 and you can't see the most important moment.
On the San Jose note, 13 battles were mentioned, including six in the main section, and this was broadcast all night in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6:00 in the morning, at the very moment that Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were getting ready for their fight, viewers in the United Kingdom were surprised when the transmitter switched to Peppa Pig.
Some were indignant because they had stayed awake especially for this fight all night.
A fan described the transition to the children's program on Twitter as "a bad joke".
"According to the government's regulations, after 6:00 a.m. there should be no more content that is not suitable for children, and therefore we had to switch to the children's program," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president for marketing and communication at Bellator, when he was asked to broadcast.
""Peppa the pig," yesss."
Scott Coker, President-in-Office of Bellator, said that they are going to adapt their programming to ensure that viewers in the United Kingdom will also have a chance in the future.
"I think, for the sake of the back game, that we can solve this problem," said Coker.
"But it's six in the morning here on a Sunday and we can't discuss anything until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
We're working on it.
When I made the switch, many text messages went back and forth and believe me, not all of them were just as friendly.
We tried to solve it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a public problem.
I can promise this won't happen a second time.
We limit the broadcasts to five nights instead of six, as we normally did, we tried to make it even better for the fans, but we just went too far.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior because of his sexual disposition
The Olympic son-in-law Tom Daley says he felt inferior during his youth because of his sexual disposition, but this gave him the motivation to succeed.
The twenty-four-year-old said that until he went to secondary school, he didn't realize that "not everyone is like me."
In a conversation with Desert Island Discs on Radio 4 with Lauren Laverne, he said he had spoken about gay rights to give others 'hope'.
He also said that the parenthood had contributed to reducing the value of winning at the Olympic Games.
Kirsty Young, the regular presenter of the long-term show has taken a few months off because of disease.
Appearing as a duplication on Laverne's first program, Daley told us that during his youth he felt 'less' than others because it was 'socially not accepted to like both girls and boys'.
He said, "To this day, those feelings, the feeling of being less and the feeling of being different are real facts that have given me the strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "someone" so that he wouldn't disappoint people if they finally found out about his nature.
The winner of two bronze Olympic medals has become a striking campaigner for the LGBT community and used his presence at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year to call on more countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said that he spoke out because he felt happy that he could live openly without further consequences and that he wanted to give others 'hope'.
The three-time world champion said that the fact that he fell in love with a man, the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Back, whom he met in 2013, "has completely surprised me".
Daley married the Oscar last year, who is 20 years older than he, but said the age difference had never been a problem.
"When you have to endure so much so young," he took part in his first Olympic Games at the age of age and his father died of cancer three years later, it is difficult to find someone in your own age group who has experienced the same altitudes and lows.
The couple became parents in June of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said that his "whole perspective" had changed.
"If you had asked me this question last year, I would have answered that it was all about winning a gold medal," he said.
"But you know what, there are more important things on earth than winning gold Olympic medals.
My golden Olympic medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father, who died in 2011 at the age of 40, after having been diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father had not accepted that he would die and one of the last things he had asked was if they had already got the tickets for London 2012, because he wanted to be in the first row.
"I couldn't get it about my heart to say, you won't be there anymore to be in the first row, Dad," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and not until his breathing actually stuttered and he died, I could finally admit that he was not invincible," he said.
He competed in the 2012 Summer Olympics and won bronze.
"I knew I had dreamed about this all my life. To dive for a home in the Olympic Games, there is no better feeling," he said.
It was also the inspiration for his first choice of music, Proud by Heather Small, that had taken him heavily on his way to the games and which he still got chicken skin from.
Desert Island Discs can be heard on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, not in form, on bank during the Ryder Cup on Saturday
The American Phil Mikkelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th match in the Ryder Cup, but he must find his shape to avoid making it a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who for the 12th time participated in the biennial event, a record, was placed on the bench by the team captain Jim Furik for the fourballs and foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being at the centre of the action, as he has often done for the United States, the winner of five majors divides the day between supporting his teammates and practicing on the driving range, in an attempt to find out what it is about.
Because he was never known for his right drives even at the top of his career, the 48-year-old is not the ideal choice for the narrow fairways of Le Golf National, where the long grass routinely punishes the roughs wandering balls.
And if the job on itself is not even terrifying enough, Mikkelson will come in the ninth match on Sunday the always accurate Francesco Molinari, winner of the British Open, who is linked to newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four the matches this week.
If the Americans behind four points at the beginning of the 12 single matches start well, the match of Mickelson can be absolutely crucial.
Furyk has shown confidence in this man, even though he could honestly be difficult to do otherwise.
"He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a slap on the back, hit his arm around me, and said he's ready for it tomorrow," said Furyk.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He has been recorded in the Hall of Fame and he has contributed so much to these teams, in the past, but also this week.
I probably didn't expect him to play only two matches.
I expected more of it, but it's the way it is and it's the way we should act.
He wants to be there, just like everyone else."
Mickelson can improve Nick Faldo's record on Sunday for the highest number of Ryder Cup matches played.
It can also mean the end of a Ryder Cup career in which he has never completely matched the highlights of his personal career.
Mickelson has won 18 matches, 20 lost matches and 7 equal games on his name, but Furijk said his presence had a certain irresistible impact on the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's taken, he likes to take jokes with people, and he's a great guy to have on the team," he explained.
"I think the younger players liked to keep him crazy every now and then last week, which was funny to see.
He has so much more to offer than just his game."
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows that great advantage can quickly disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that the comfortable lead ahead of the single matches on the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a less comfortable situation.
The Danish made his debut in the 1997 Valderrama game, where the team with Captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead on the Americans, but finally the finish line passed with the smallest possible margin: 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a big advantage in Valderrama; we had a big advantage in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but just now," said Bjorn, calling here after seeing the 2018 lights win with 5-3 on Friday and yesterday, good for a 10-6 advantage on Le Golf National.
So history shows me and everyone else on the team that this isn't a game yet.
Everyone will have to make a full effort tomorrow.
Get to work and carry out the plan on the right.
It's not over until the points are on the board.
We have a goal, and that's this trophy win, and we need to keep focusing on that.
I keep saying, I'm focusing on the 12 players we can have, but we're also aware of the people on the other side, some of the best players in the world."
Rejoicing the performance of his players on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never be ahead of things in this field.
Tomorrow's a new challenge.
Tomorrow, the individual achievements will be discussed, and that is another very different discipline.
It's great to be out there with a partner when it's all right, but when you're alone, your golfer skills are really being tested.
That's the message you need to tell the players, try to get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
So now let your partner go and he must also get the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent, Jim Furyk, expects his players to perform better individually than their partners. The exceptions are Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas who conquered three of the four points.
Furijk himself has experience with both sides of this kind of turnaround on the last day, as a member of the winning team in Brookline and as a loser when Europe realized the 'Miracle of Medinah'.
"I remember every damn word of that speech," he said in answer to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had picked up his players for the last day.
"We have 12 important matches for the bow tomorrow, but let's try to start well, like in Brookline, or like in Medinah.
When we have the momentum, there is a lot of pressure on the matches in the middle.
We have adjusted our line-up to this and send the men on the way in the order that we believe is the best and, you know, we're going to try to spell something out of the high hat tomorrow."
Thomas has the task of trying to lead the counter-offensive and Rory McIlroy is playing for the first match, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are the other Europeans in the first half of the battle order.
"I have chosen this group in this order, because I think we are so constantly covered," said Bjorn of his selection of single players.
The new warship of Germany postponed again
The latest frigate of the German Navy should have come into service in 2014, replacing the outdated warships from the time of the Cold War, but it will take at least one year before it is ready, due to faulty systems and rising costs, reported local media.
The launch of the 'Rheinland-Pfalz', the leading ship in the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg class of frigates, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newsmagazine Die Zeit, which quotes a military spokesman.
The vessel should have been part of the Navy in 2014, but the distressing problems after delivery have plagued the fate of the ambitious project.
The four vessels of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ordered by the Navy in 2007 serve to replace the outdated frigates of the Bremen class.
As far as we know, they have a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles and a form of stealth technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic characteristics.
Other important features are longer maintenance cycles, it should be possible to use the latest frigates up to two years in a row, far from home ports.
However, the continuing delays mean that the advanced warships, which are intended to allow Germany to project its overseas power, are already outdated by the time they are put into operation, notes Die Zeit.
Last year, the fatal frigate F125 already caught the headlines, when the German Navy officially refused to operate the vessel and sent it back to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy sent a ship back to a shipbuilder after delivery.
There is little known about the reasons behind this return, but German media quoted a number of crucial 'software and hardware defects' that would make the warship useless if it were deployed in a battle mission.
Software defects were particularly important because the vessels of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class are operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, helped the manpower on the frigates of the older Bremen class.
It also became clear that the ship suffers from a serious overweight, which will reduce performance and reduce the possibilities of the Navy to carry out further upgrades.
The 'Rheinland-Pfalz' weighs 7,000 tons, which is twice as much as ships of a similar class used by the Germans in the Second World War.
In addition to the defective hardware, the price tag for the entire project, including the training of the crew, is already a problem.
It is said that this has reached a staggering €3.1 billion, compared with the original € 2.2 billion.
The problems that the latest frigates have in their grip become more important because of the recent warnings that the power of the German Navy is diminishing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the Parliamentary Defence Commission in Germany, acknowledged that the Navy actually "has a shortage of employable ships".
The officer said that the problem had grown over time as a snowball, because old ships were taken out of operation but no replacement vessels were delivered.
He complained that none of the frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class were yet available to be included in the Navy.
National Trust listens to the secret life of bats
New research carried out on a estate in the Scottish highlands is trying to reveal how bats use the landscape in their quest for food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and contribute to future conservation activities.
The study carried out by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland follows the ordinary and the small dwarf bat, the brown large-eared bat and the water bat at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment is placed at key locations around the estate to track the activities of bats throughout the season.
NTS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile investigations using hand detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of the bat's screams and what kind of thing to do.
A map of the habitat and a report is then produced to make a detailed picture on the landscape scale of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, NTS Nature Conservation Advisor, hopes that the results show which habitat areas are the most important for bats and how they are used by the species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of pastures and how we can best maintain the forests for bats and similar species.
Bat populations in Scotland and the rest of the UK have decreased significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development activities affecting sleeping places and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lightnings can also pose a risk, as can fly-catchers and certain chemical treatments of building materials and attacks by domestic cats.
Bats are actually not blind.
Their night hunting habits, however, make their ears more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching a prey.
They use an advanced echo location technique to determine the position of insects and obstacles in their flight route.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, takes bats very seriously.
The NTS has ten trained experts, who regularly investigate, inspect sleeping places and sometimes perform rescue actions.
The organization has even set up the first and only reserve for bats in Scotland at the estate Threeave in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight of the ten species of bats of Scotland live.
Landscape manager David Thompson says the estate is the ideal territory for bats.
"Here in Threeave we have a great environment for bats," he said.
"We have the old buildings, many very old trees and the right habitat.
But so much is not yet known about bats, and that's why the work we're doing here and at other locations will help us better understand what they need in order to thrive."
It emphasises the importance of monitoring bats before maintenance work is carried out, as the possible unconscious destruction of a dormitory can lead to the death of 400 female bats and their young, possibly eliminating a full local population.
Bats are a protected species of animals and it is illegal to kill, trouble or disrupt them or to destroy their sleeping places.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer for the Bat Conservation Trust, asked the public to make a contribution to help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and many of our species, we just don't know how their populations are."
Ronaldo rejects charges of assault while his lawyers are preparing to prosecute a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo accused of assault qualified as 'fake news' and said that people 'want to promote themselves' by using his name.
His lawyers are about to sue the German weekly Der Spiegel, in which the accusations were published.
The top of Portugal and Juventus is accused of assaulting an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is also accused of having paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, reported Der Spiegel on Friday.
Through a video for his 142 million followers on Instagram Live Ronaldo, 33, just a few hours after the accusations were reported, mentioned the reports 'fake news'.
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they say today, fake news," says the winner of five golden balls on camera.
"They want to promote themselves by calling my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous by calling my name, but that's part of the trade.
I'm a happy man, and I'm a good man," the football player added, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing a trial in which they want to prosecute Der Spiegel for the accusations they called 'an unacceptable report of suspicions in the area of privacy', according to Reuters.
Christian Schertz, lawyer, said that the football player wants compensation for the 'moral damage for an amount corresponding to the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years'.
The alleged incident reportedly occurred in June 2009 in a suite of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After they met in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga went back to the football room, where he reportedly raped her anal, as can be read in the charges filed at the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and that he told her he was a "good guy" for '99 percent', but that he is sometimes abandoned that 'one percent'.
The documents state that Ronaldo confirms that it has had some sex, but that this was with mutual approval.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that there were pictures of her injuries in a hospital, but that she later agreed to an extrajudicial arrangement because she was "fear of the consequences" and because she was worried about the "public humiliation".
The 34-year-old now says that she wants to make the scheme invalid because she has been permanently traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to go from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged assault and left for the Italian giant Juventus this summer in a deal worth €100 million.
Brexit: the United Kingdom 'will eternally regret it' as car producers leaving
The United Kingdom 'will eternally regret it' if it loses its position as world leader in car production after Brexit, said Greg Clark, Minister of Economic Affairs.
He added that it was 'anxious' that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, the company would temporarily shut down production at the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Clark.
The Japanese car producer said that the impact of border delays in the case of a 'no-deal Brexit' job would cost.
The factory in Burnaston, where the Auris and Avensis are made of Toyota, produced almost 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other countries in the European Union.
"My vision is that if Britain crashes from the EU at the end of March, we will see production shut down in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, the managing director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other car products in the UK, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also expressed their fears about the effects of leaving the EU without agreement on the functioning of cross-border trade.
For example, BMW has already told us that it will close the Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
Most concerns concern the car manufacturers about risks in the supply chain in the case of a 'no-deal Brexit'.
The production line of Toyota runs on the basis of the 'just-in-time' principle, whereby every 37 minutes parts of suppliers arrive in the UK and in the EU for cars made on order.
If, on 29 March, the UK leaves the EU without a deal, there may be unrest at the borders which industry believes may lead to delays and shortages of components.
Toyota cannot store more than one day in stock at the factory in Derbyshire, so the company announced, and therefore the production would be shut down.
Clark said that Theresa May's Chequers plan for the future relationship with the EU is "exactly aligned to avoid these border controls".
"We must have a deal. We want the best deal, which will not only enable us to continue the current success, but also to seize this opportunity," he told the listeners of the BBC Radio 4 Today programme.
"The proof, not only of Toyota but also of other producers, is that we must be able to continue with these very successful set of supply chains."
Toyota could not say how long production would be shut down, but warned in the longer term that the additional costs would affect the competitiveness of the company and that this would ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years, and who is a representative of the union Unite at the factory, said that his members are increasingly worried: "In my experience, once these jobs have been lost, they never return.
A public spokesman said, "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump and Rosenstein meeting can be delayed again, says the White House
The crucial meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein can be postponed 'one more week' while the fight over the candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, continues, said the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special prosecutor Robert Mueller, who investigates the Russian influence of the elections, links between Trump and Russia assistants, and possible obstacles to the justice of the President.
The question of whether Trump is going to fire the Deputy Attorney General and thereby endanger Mueller's independence has kept the Washington gossip machine going for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility to carry a microphone to record conversations with Trump and to drop the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied this report.
But when he went to the White House last Monday, rumours made the round that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he wanted to release Rosenstein 'not rather', but then the meeting was moved to avoid a conflict with a hearing of the Senate's Justice Committee, in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both would testify.
On Friday Trump gave the FBI orders to carry out a one-week investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh, which delayed the vote in the entire Senate.
On Sunday, Sarah Sanders, Trump's press chief, appeared on Fox News.
In response to the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "There is no date for that, it could be this week, but it could also be postponed for another week, given all the other things going on with the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I always want to keep the press informed."
Some reporters had difficulty with this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since 10 September.
The host Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said that the scarcity of press conferences was not caused by a loathing of the "attractive" TV journalists, although she added: "I will not deny that they are trying to attract attention."
Then she suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The President does more question-and-answer sessions than any president for him," she said, without proof, "we've looked at the figures."
Press conferences will still take place, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, that is infinitely better than talking to me.
We are trying to do a lot of that and you have often seen us do it in the past weeks and that will take the place of a press conference when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in public sessions or during press conferences with poets who are visiting.
Press conferences with only the President are rare.
In New York this week, the president was able to demonstrate why, making an open and bizarre appearance for the collected reporters.
Minister for Health writes a letter on Brexit to employees of the NHS Scotland from other EU countries
The Minister for Health has written a letter to the EU staff working in the NHS Scotland to express the country's gratitude and the wish that they continue to work at the NHS after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent a letter of less than six months before the UK withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already agreed to bear the costs of applying for a permanent status for EU citizens working for decentralised public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU continued, and this autumn the expected decisions will be taken.
But at the same time, the UK government has also backed up the preparations for a possible scenario in which no deal is reached.
I know this must be uncertain times for all of you.
That is why I would like to stress once again how much I appreciate the contribution of all staff, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from all over the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the NHS and provide benefits for the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is fixed and certainly you are home and we would like you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after head injury
The Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, had an emergency operation yesterday after he had suffered a head injury in the 31-27 lost match against the Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Mike Organ of the Tennessee.
Rod Reed, the head coach of Tennessee State, told reporters that the accident took place shortly before rest.
"He came to the sideline and more or less collapsed there," said Reed.
The trainers and the medical staff gave Abercrombie direct oxygen on the sideline, before they laid him on a stretcher and took him with him for further investigation.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had come out of the operating room at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that 'no details are yet known about the type/size of the injury' and Tennessee State tries to find out when the injury has occurred.
Abercrombie, a 'redshirt sophomore', is in his first season at Tennessee State after a transfer from Illinois.
On Saturday, he was beaten five times before leaving the field, which resulted in a total of 18 hits this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher empties when they buy a house in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher empties when they buy a house in the UK and the proceeds will be used to help the homeless according to new plans of the Conservatives
This action will have to neutralise Corbyn's success in order to attract young voters
The increase in emptiness is levied on persons who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Ministry of Finance expects this to raise £120 million a year to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher empties when they buy a house in the UK and the extra proceeds will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn who attracts young voters with promises to provide more affordable homes and to tell this on many earners.
The increase in the emptiness is levied on persons and firms who do not pay taxes in the UK, where the extra income is reflected in an attempt by the government to combat homelessness.
The supplement, which is on top of the current emptiness, including the higher levels introduced two years ago for second houses and houses purchased for the rental, can be up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects to collect up to £120 million a year in this way.
It is estimated that 13 percent of the new building in London is purchased by people who do not live in the UK, which drives up prices and makes it difficult for starters to get a foot on the housing ladder.
Many affluent areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become practically "spook cities" because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
This new policy comes just a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the emptys to help young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping prices high by buying up land and not using it and he called May to abolish quotas on affordable homes in order to restore the 'incest' in Britain.
Corbyn has announced a striking range of housing reforms, including rental ceilings and an end to disfellowshipping 'without negligence'.
He also wants to give local authorities more opportunities to build new houses.
May said: "Last year I said that I wanted to spend my time as prime minister in restoring the 'British Dream', that life is getting better for every new generation.
And that means that our defective housing market needs to be restored.
Great Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it cannot be that it is as easy for people who do not live in the UK and for foreign companies to buy houses here as it is for hardworking British residents.
For too many people the dream of having a house has once become too vague a dream and the humiliation of life without a roof above the head is too real."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is the management of Scotland."
Jack Ross, Sunderland's boss, says it's his "ultimate ambition" to be one day manager of Scotland.
The Scottish, 42, enjoys the challenge of revitalizing the club from the northeast of England, which currently stands third in League One, in three points of the first place.
He went to the Stadium of Light last summer after he returned to the Scottish Premiership last season St Mirren.
"As a football player, I wanted to play for my homeland.
But I was selected for the B-team and that's how it was done" Ross told Sportsound on BBC Scotland.
"When I was a child I saw with my father Scotland often playing in Hampden Park and it's something that keeps on attracting me.
However, that possibility would not come until I was successful in managing a club."
The predecessors of Ross as managers of Sunderland include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former boss of Alloa athletic says that he was not intimidated to become the successor of these established names at a large club, before he had refused advances from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Succes for me are currently being measured by 'can I have this club return to the Premier League?'
Because of the structure and facilities at this club, it should undoubtedly be in the Premier League," he says.
"It's not a simple task to achieve this, but I can't see myself as successful until I get the club back there."
Ross only spent three years in his career as a manager, after a period as an assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months in the coaching group of Hearts.
He then helped Alloa to recover from the third division and transformed St Mirren from the edge of degradation to winning the Championship in the next season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did during his career as a football player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably really a crossroads," he remembered the moment he took charge of Alloa.
"I really believed that the management was the right choice for me, much more than playing.
It sounds bizarre, because I did the best I could, I deserved fairly well and I knew some reasonable highlights.
But football can be heavy.
There's a lot of things you're confronted with weekly.
I still have that, given the stress and pressure of the trade, but management just feels good.
I've always wanted to be a manager and now that I'm real, I'm as good in my skin as I've never felt in my adult life."

The perfect time for a pint is 17:30 on a Saturday, reveals research
The heat wave in summer has increased the income of British pubs who have difficulty surviving, but has also put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Groups with pubs and bars saw turnover increase by 2.7 percent in July, but the revenue in restaurants was 4.8% less, showing the figures.
Peter Martin, of the CGA business consulting agency, who collected the figures, said: "Consistent sunshine and the fact that England participated longer than expected in the world championships meant that July showed a similar pattern to June, when the pubs had 2.8 percent more turnover, with the difference that the restaurants were now becoming even louder.
The fall of 1.8 percent in the sales of restaurants in June only got worse in July.
Pubs and bars focused on drinking performance were by far the best, with better LFL growth (like-for-like) than restaurants went down.
Pubs that also focus on the sale of food are also members of the sun, but not as dramatic as the restaurants.
Looks like people went out alone to drink.
In pubs and bars under management, alcohol sales were 6.6% higher for the month, while food sales were 3% lower."
Paul Newman of RSM, analysts for the leisure and hospitality industry, said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of important social or sporting events remain the main factors for sales in the outgoing market.
It is no surprise, therefore, that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although a 4.8% year-to-year turnover is particularly painful given the constant cost pressure.
The long, hot summer could not have come at a worse time for the food-oriented operators and only learn the time or give the more moderate temperatures of August the necessary rest."
The total turnover growth in the pub and restaurant industry, including new openings, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the decline in the introduction of new brands.
In the Peach Tracker case, the UK pub, bar and restaurant turnover monitor, performance data are collected and analysed from 47 operational groups, with a joint turnover of £9 billion. This is the established benchmark of the industry.
One in five children has a secret social media account that they keep hidden from their parents
One in five children, some no more than 11 years old, has a secret social media account, which they keep hidden from parents and teachers, reveals a survey
Survey among 20,000 high school students revealed the growth in 'false Insta pages'
This news has strengthened the fear of postponing sexual content
Twenty percent of the students say they have a 'head account' that they show their parents too.
One in five children, some no more than 11 years old, makes accounts for social media that keep them hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed rapid growth in the 'false Insta accounts', a reference to Instagram, the site for sharing photos.
This news has strengthened the fear of postponing sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students say they use a clean 'head account' that they show to their parents, while they also have personal accounts.
A mother who happened to be on the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter discovered there a teenager who asked others to "rape" her.
The research, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and HMC (Headmasters" and Headmistresses" Conference) of independent schools, discovered that 40% of 11 to 18-year-olds had two profiles and that half admitted to keep personal accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HCM, said, "It is disturbing that so many teenagers are being enticed to create online spaces where they are not found by their parents and teachers."
Eilidh Doyle becomes the 'voice of the athlete' in the Scottish athletic board
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Board of the Scottish athletics world, as non-executive director at the general annual meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most decorated athlete in Scotland on the track and in the field and President Ian Beattie described her election as a great opportunity for the drivers of the sport to learn from her extensive experience at an international level over the past ten years.
"Eilidh enjoys a lot of respect in the athletic community of Scotland, the UK and the world and we are sure that the athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly from her election in the council," said Beattie.
Doyle said, "I'm happy to be able to serve as a voice for the athletes, and I hope I can make a contribution and help control the sport in Scotland."
The American who won the 200 meters and the 400 meters during the 1996 Games in Atlanta, two of his four gold Olympic medals, and who now regularly comments on the BBC, could no longer walk after a TIA.
He wrote on Twitter: "Today a month ago I had a TIA.
I couldn't walk anymore.
The doctors told me that only time will tell whether I will recover and to what extent.
It's been awfully hard work, but I've been completely restored now, I've learned to walk again and do my flexibility exercises again today!
Thank you for all your support!"
Advertisement for breast pump comparing mothers with cows divides online opinion
A company that makes breast pumps has divided online opinion with an advertisement comparing nursing mothers to cows that are milked.
To mark the introduction of what is called 'the most silent portable breast pump in the world', Elvie, producer of consumer technology, has issued an ironic, music-video-inspired ad to illustrate the freedom that this new pump has to offer to capable mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a hay-filled barn on a song that contains lyrics like: 'Yes, I'm milking myself, but you can't see it' and 'In case you didn't watch it, these aren't udders, these are my breasts'.
The chorus then continues with: 'Pomps, pumps, pumps, I feed the babies, pumps, pumps, pumps, I milk the lady's'.
However, the ad, which was published on the Facebook page of the company, has immediately created an online controversy.
The video has been watched 77,000 times and has caused hundreds of comments, especially mixed reactions from viewers, in which many people say that it condones the 'horror' of the agricultural industry.
"A bad choice to use cows to advertise this product.
Just as we do, they must be expected and delivered to produce milk, but in their case the babies are taken away within a few days of delivery" is written in a response.
Elvie's breast pump fits discreetly into a nutritional bra (Elvie/Mother).
Someone else commented: "This is, of course, traumatic for mother and baby.
But yes, why don't we use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Another added, "This advertisement is so far from reality."
Others defended the ad and a woman admitted that she thought the song was 'hilarious'.
"I think this is a genius idea.
I'd buy one if I was still breastfeeding.
Those pumps made me feel like a cow.
The ad's a little weird, but I haven't been looking too much for it.
This is a genius product," someone wrote.
Someone else had the following comment: "This is a funny ad, aimed at moms who are flasks (often at the workplace or in a toilet) and then feel like being just 'cow'.
This advertisement is not at all positive or negative about the dairy industry."
At the end of the video you can see the group of women who are all dancing with the pump discreetly hidden in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who collide sometimes feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is completely quiet, has no wires or snakes and fits discreetly in a nutritional bra, so that women have the freedom to move, hold their babies and even go out while they are on the flasks.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother says: "The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it earned a tough and provocative introduction.
By making a comparison between curly mothers and dairy cows, we wanted to put the flask and its challenges in the spotlights and at the same time show in a entertaining and understandable way how the new pump will provide an incredible sense of freedom.
This is not the first time Elvie's pump's front page.
During the London Fashion Week a mother of two appeared on the catwalk of Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent camp on the border with Texas
The number of migrant children in detention has reached a peak, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, partly because the harsh rhetoric and harsh policies introduced by the Trump government make it more difficult to accommodate children in sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors themselves are undocumented immigrants and fear their own chance to stay in the country by signing up for a child.
This risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households should print out their fingerprints and that these data will be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week Matthew Albumnce, a senior officer of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, declared in a testimony to the congress that his organization has arrested dozens of people who have signed up as sponsors for unaccompanied minors.
The organization later confirmed that 70% of the arrested had no prior criminal record.
"Nearly 80% of the sponsors or family members of the sponsors are illegal in this country and a large part of it are criminal strangers.
We're persecuting these people," said Mr. Albumnce.
In an effort to speed up the process of children, officials introduced new rules, requiring some of them to appear before the court within one month of the start of detention, rather than within 60 days, which was previously the standard, according to the Shelter staff
Many of them will be in court through a video conference, instead of in person, to advocate their application for a legal status for an immigration judge.
Those who are considered not eligible for aid will be deported quickly.
The longer the children remain in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent eruptions or attempts to flee, according to the shelter staff and reports that have come out of the system in recent months.
Lawyers said these concerns are stronger in a larger facility, such as Tornillo, where the signs that a child is struggling are more often ignored because of the size of the camp.
They added that moving the children to the tent camp without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say good - bye to friends can contribute to the trauma that many of them are already struggling with.
Syria recommends the immediate withdrawal of the US, France and Turkey's 'occupied forces'
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid Al-Muellem also called on Syrian refugees to return, even now that the war in the country is in the eighth year.
Moualem, who is also Vice Prime Minister, said that the foreign forces are illegally on Syrian soil, under the pretext of combating terrorism and that 'this will be dealt with accordingly'.
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he told the Assembly.
According to Moualem, the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more have been uprooted and displaced from their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue "this sacred struggle until we have liberated all Syrian territories" from terrorist groups and from a "possibly illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, which are mainly engaged in training and consulting the Kurdish troops and the Syrian Arabs fighting against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops in the war torn country.
As regards the refugees, Moualem said that the conditions are favourable for their return and he reproaches 'some Western countries to spread irrational fears' so that most refugees stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate this return," he said.
"They're politicizing a case that should only be a humanitarian problem."
The United States and the European Union have warned that no reconstruction aid will be available for Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
Diplomats from the United Nations say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in Idlib, the last major bulwark of the rebels, has created the opportunity to start political talks.
The deal between Russia and Turkey has averted a large-scale attack on Russia-supported Syrian troops in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that this agreement knows 'clear deadlines' and said that he hoped that the military action would focus on jihadists, including fighters of the Nusra Front, which is linked to Al-Qaeda, who will be 'cut off'.
Staffan de Mistura, the UN representative, hopes to convene the first meeting of a new committee composed of members of the government and the opposition to draft a constitution after the war for Syria and to pave the way for elections.
Moualem made clear the Syrian Government's terms of participation in the committee and said that the work of the panel should be limited 'to reviewing the articles of the current constitution' and warned against external interference.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Term
According to that logic, Mr. Trump would win the elections in 2020 unless, as many 'liberal' viewers probably hope, his presidency is ended prematurely by a deposit procedure and scandals.
In what would undoubtedly be 'the most dramatic finale of a presidency ever'.
At present, however, there are no signs of conspicuousness.
Since 2014, the views of CNN's "prime-time" have been more than doubled to 1.05 million and almost tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers during 'prime-time', compared to 1.7 million viewers four years ago, and 'The Rachel Maddow Show' by MSNBC is at the top of the reviews for cable programs with 3.5 million viewers on evenings with important news.
"This is a fire that attracts people, because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, the responsible behind the ABC drama 'Designed Survivor', a series about a minister who becomes president after an attack destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an experienced writer of comedy and author of 'Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club' has a different theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told her he was going to vote for Trump.
Why? she asked.
"He said, "Because he makes me laugh," Scovell told me.
There's entertainment value in the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the storylines coming from Washington can influence the future of Roe v. Wade or determine whether immigrant families can reunite or influence the status of the world economy.
Disabling is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, it goes beyond being a well-informed citizen, when you get to know that you've been watching a panel expert discussing the use of sources from the 'deep background' by Bob Woodward in his book 'Fear', who's talking about the jacket of peacock leather from Paul Manafort that cost $15,000 ('a garment full of haughtiness' according to The Washington Post) and who discuss the implications of the colorful description by Stormy Daniels of the, uh, anatomy of Trump.
At least I'll never be able to look at Super Mario in the same way again.
"What he's doing to give you the idea that it's a reality show is partly that he's stopping you up with something new every night," said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of 'Pawn Stars', about the rotating roll division of the Trump show and the daily plot changes (fighting the N.F.L., Kim Jong-un praises).
You can't afford to miss an episode or you have the idea that you're behind.
When I reached Fleiss earlier this week, it was sunny and 26 degrees outside his house on the north coast of Kauai, but he sat inside watching MSNBC while he was recording CNN.
He could not pull himself off the screen, with Brett Kavanaugh who had to appear before the Senate's Justice Committee and the future of the Supreme Court at stake.
"I remember we were doing all these weird shows, not so long ago, and the people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but now it turns out they were right."

External money flows into the most exciting mid-term elections for the House of Delegates
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania sees an inflow of money, thanks to a redeployment of an constituency that requires two sitting representatives to fight for the same seat.
The recently reclassified district of Pittsburg meets the Democratic representative Conor Lamb, who has acquired his seat in another district in a special special spring.
Lamb has to face another sitting representative, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the 12th district of Pennsylvania, which has much overlap with the new 17th district.
The maps were reclassified after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January held that the old districts were unconstitutional ('gerrymandering') in favour of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district has led to a knock-off in the field of campaign financing between the financial arms of the two major parties, the DCCC (Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee) and the NRCC (National Republican Campaign Committee).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a short victory in a well-viewed special for the 18th constituency of Pennsylvania.
This seat had been occupied by a Republican for more than ten years and President Donald Trump had conquered this district by 20 percentage points.
According to political experts, the Democrats have a small advantage.
The US is considering punishing El Salvador for support to China and has waived
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing and had received little negative response from Washington.
Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and he owned a hotel in Panama until his partners expelled the management team of the Trump Organization.
Officials of the United States Department of Foreign Affairs have decided to recall the American heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the 'recent decision to stop recognizing Taiwan', said Heather Nauert, spokeswoman of the Ministry, in a statement earlier this month.
But punishments were only considered in the case of El Salvador, because the country received $140 million in American aid in 2017, for control of narcissistics, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, including reductions in financial support and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country with a high level of unemployment and murder rates.
As the internal meetings continued, North American and Central American officials held a high-level conference aimed at security and economic prosperity as a follow-up to a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step forward in the efforts to prevent migrants from leaving for the United States.
But in mid-September, some government top officials announced that they wanted the conference to continue, making all possible sanctions against El Salvador impossible in advance.
The plan is now that Vice-President Mike Pence is giving a speech at the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance the government assigns to the meeting, say diplomats.
And the three American envoys have returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without further ado, without any hard messages on Washington sanctions.
A spokesperson of the White House on behalf of Mr Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal discussion subject to anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an external analyst who was also close to the government and also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Study History
The next step could be the report by Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller on the possible counter-action of Trump's justice, for which serious evidence has now become public.
Mueller is also likely to focus his research on the interdependence between Trump's campaign and Russia in an attack by Russia on our elections.
If Congress changes color, Trump has to blame himself for that institution, just as he gets ready to turn to the voters again, and perhaps he has to take responsibility for a jury in a court.
These are a lot of mittens, and I do not want to suggest that Trump's fall is inevitable, nor that of his equivalents in Europe.
We will all have to make choices on both sides of the Atlantic, which will determine how long the battle will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to carry out a 'coup d'état' against Hitler, but only if the West had resisted and Czechoslovakia had supported it in Munich.
We failed and therefore missed an opportunity to avoid the years of bloodshed that followed.
This speeds up or slows down the course of history around such bending points and the inexorable march of democracy.
Americans are currently confronted with various bending points of this type.
What will we do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who has the fate of Mueller's investigation in his hands?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult position since this journal reported that he, last year, suggested that he take up discussions with the President in secret and that he had speculated about the suitability of the President for his office.
Rosenstein says the Times report is not correct.
"How will we react if the FBI's new investigation to Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or unfair, or if it is appointed to the Supreme Court despite credible accusations of assault and unfair testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the mid-term elections for a Congress that will call Trump to account?
If we fail in these tests, democracy is waiting for a very long winter.
But I don't think we'll fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had once occupied my ambassador's home.
She survived, immigrated to America, and sent me away, 60 years later, to light candles for the Sabbath on that table on which a swastika was pictured.
With that as my inheritance, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans of Glasgow Rangers is optimistic about the match against Rapid Vienna
Rangers are visited by Rapid Wien on Thursday and know that after the impressive match in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, a victory on the Austrians puts them in a strong position to qualify in Group G of the Europe League.
Due to a knee injury, civil society player Graham Dorrans could not play his first game from the season to the 2-2 match at Villarreal, but he believes that the Rangers who can use the results as a jumping board for better results.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal really has a good eleven," said the 31-year-old.
"We entered the game with the idea that something was to be won and came out of the game with a point.
Maybe we could even have won at the end, but all over the game, a match is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half but when we came out in the second half we were the better team.
Thursday is a new big European evening.
I hope we can score three points, but it's going to be a tough game because they also had a good result in their last match, but if the audience is going to be behind us, I'm sure we can push on and we can achieve a positive result.
Last year has certainly been heavy, of everything that happened to my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now there's a feeling-good factor on the club.
The team is good and the boys really enjoy it.
Hopefully, we can now push through, leave the last season behind and become successful again."
Women cannot sleep because of fear of their retirement
Despite the fact that the participants in the survey had a clear idea of how they wanted to receive care, few people discuss this with their relatives.
About half of the participants in Nationwide research said they were talking to their wives about the cost of long-term care.
And only 10% said they had talked to their children about this.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't take the steps needed to hold this conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president for life insurance at Nationwide.
Here we go.
Talk to your spouse(o)t(e) and the children: You can't prepare your family to care if you don't make your wishes known in good time.
Work with your consultant and your family to discuss where and how to receive care, as these choices can be a significant factor in determining the costs.
Take in a financial advisor: Your advisor can also advise you on how to pay for these expenses.
Your long-term financing choices, among other things, can be a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with cash value to help cover these expenses, or use own funds as insurance, as long as you have money.
Create legal documents: Avoid legal struggle when the insurance needs to be used.
Take care of health care so that you can designate a trusted person who can overlook your medical care and ensure that professionals adhere to your wishes in case you can no longer communicate.
Consider also a proxy for your financial affairs.
In that case, you select a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and ensure that the invoices are paid if you can't do it yourself.
Don't forget the little details: Imagine that your elderly father or mother is hit by a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
In that case, can you answer questions about medication and allergies?
Put these details in a written plan, so that you have the information at hand.
"It's not just the financial matters that matter, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What medicines are used?
Who cares for the dog?
Make sure that plan comes."
Man shot several times with air pressure gun in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air pressure gun when he walked home after an evening out.
The victim, 40 plus, was in the Oxford Grove neighborhood of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was hit in his chest, belly and hand.
Agents described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as a 'voluntary act'.
The victim didn't see who attacked him.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police have called witnesses to report.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and a tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and the death toll is expected to continue to rise.
In the absence of the means of communication, the official authorities have not yet received information from the Donggala Regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake with a force of 7.5 on the Richter scale.
More than 16,000 people have been evacuated in Palu after the disaster took place.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Celebes and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Celebes, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th birthday when the tsunami struck.
Donggala is a regency stretching over 300 km along the coast of northwest Celebes.
The government, an administrative region just below a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main activities in the economy of the province of Central Celebes, particularly in the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but they are located for the most part in Moravali, on the opposite coast of Celebes.
Palu and Donggala have been hit regularly over the past hundred years by tsunamis according to the Indonesia disaster response agency.
In 1938 a tsunami claimed more than 200 lives and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck in the west of Donggala in 1996, with nine deaths.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific Ring of Fire and is often hit by earthquakes.
Here is a list of some of the most severe earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh on the north of Sumatra on 26 December caused a tsunami that affected 14 countries and claimed a total of 226,000 lives along the coasts of the Indian Ocean, more than half of which in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes occurred on the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and the beginning of April.
Hundreds of people were killed on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake with a force of 6.8 on the Richter scale took place south of Java, the most densely populated island of Indonesia, and caused a tsunami that struck the south coast and claimed nearly 700 lives.
2009: An earthquake of 7.6 on the Richter scale struck the city of Padang, capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people found death.
2010: An earthquake with a force of 7.5 on the Richter scale struck one of the Mentawai islands off the Sumatra coast, causing a tsunami of more than 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and claimed around 300 human lives.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the regent Pidie in Aceh and caused destruction and panic, because the people were reminded of the devastations of the 2004 deadly earthquake and tsunami.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people found death from crashing buildings.
2018: Several earthquakes occurred in the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, where more than 500 people were killed, for the most part on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and caused thousands of tourists to be temporarily stranded.
Oldest son of Sarah Palin arrested on charge of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of Sarah Palin, former governor of Alaska and candidate for the Vice-Presidentship, was arrested for accusing domestic violence.
Palin, 29 from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for suspicion of domestic violence, interference on a report of domestic violence, and offering opposition during the judgment, according to a report released on Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took the phone off her.
Palin is held in custody in the home of Mat-Su detention with a bail of $500, reported KTUU.
He appeared before the judge on Saturday and declared himself "innocent, certainly" when asked, the network reported.
Palin is charged for three Class A infringements, which means he can be sentenced to one year in prison and to a fine of up to $250,000.
He is also charged with a class B offense, which is punishable by a day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
It is not for the first time that Palin is being charged with criminal offences.
In December 2017, he was accused of mistreatment of his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged abuse.
This case now serves for Alaska's veteran court.
In January 2016, he was accused of being abused in the domestic atmosphere, interference in a report of domestic violence, and possession of a weapon in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed he had beaten her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized in 2016 by a veteran group, after having linked the violent behavior of her son to PTSS, that he would have remained in his service in Iraq.
Indonesia, earthquake, tsunami: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday.
The earthquake with a force of 7.5 on the Richter scale has led to a tsunami and has destroyed thousands of houses.
Electricity and communication networks are disabled while the number of deaths is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake took place just next to the center of Celebes, which lies northeast of Jakarta, the Indonesian capital.
There are circulation of videos on social media that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami reached the coast.
Federal prosecutors demand a rare death penalty for suspect of a terrorist attack in New York City
Federal prosecutors in New York demand the death penalty for Sajfoello Sajpov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York City, killing eight people, a rare punishment that has not been executed in that state since 1953.
Sajpov, 30, was charged with using a rented truck from Home Depot to hit a bicycle path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, overturning pedestrians and cyclists on his way in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors will have to prove that Sajpov 'wildly' killed the eight victims and 'wildly' seriously injured them, according to the declaration of intent in which the death penalty is claimed, which was filed in the Southern District of New York.
For both charges, the death penalty is possible, according to the document submitted to the Court.
Weeks after the attack, a federal Grand Jury approved the charge with 22 charges, including eight charges of murder for a racket, typically a charge used by federal prosecutors against organised crime, and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required 'substantial planning and preparation', according to the prosecutors, and it described the way Sajpov carried out the attack as 'gruesome, cruel and corrupt'.
"Sajfoello Habiboellajevich Sajpov has caused injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erleij, Hernánd Ferruchi, Hernándro Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco" is in the intention.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been more than ten years since the Southern District of New York saw a case in which the death penalty was demanded.
The suspect, Khalid Barnes, was sentenced to the murder of two drug suppliers but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple executed after being sentenced two years earlier for espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
The Rosenbergs were both executed by means of the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Sajpov, from Uzbekistan, did not show any remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to the judicial documents.
He let the detectives know he felt good about his act, she the police.
Sajpov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching videos of ISIS on his phone, according to the charges.
He also asked to hang the flag of ISIS in his room in the hospital, told the police.
He did not plead to be guilty of charges with 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Sajpov, said he was "of course disappointed" with the decision of the prosecutors.
"We think that the decision to demand the death penalty instead of accepting a confession of guilt in exchange for a lifelong prison sentence without possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for all concerned," said Patton.
The defense of Sajpov had earlier asked the prosecutors not to demand the death penalty.
Conservative Member says that NIGEL FARAGE should lead Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage today promised to mobilize a "people's army" during a protest at the Conference of the Conservative Party.
The former leader of Ukip said that politicians should feel the 'heat' of Eurosceptics, while one of Theresa May's own MPs proposed to give him the lead of the negotiations with the EU.
The conservative backbencher Peter Bone told the participants at the Mars in Birmingham that the UK would 'be out' if Mr. Farage Brexit had been Minister.
But the challenge that May faces in the reconciliation of the strongly divided ranks is underlined by two conservatives who are pro-Remain and who participate in a separate protest meeting against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister struggles to keep her Chequers compromise on the road while this is being attacked by Brexiters, Remainers and the EU.
Fellows maintained that they will continue and will try to make a deal with Brussels despite the setbacks, forcing Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between their package and 'chaos'.
Bone said at a meeting of Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wants to throw "Chequers in the trash bin".
He suggested that Farage should be knighted and given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he were out of service, we'd be out now," said Bone.
The Member of Parliament for Wellingborough added: "I will support Brexit, but we must throw Chequers into the trash bin."
To clarify his opposition to the EU, he said: "We have not fought in two world wars to be subordinate.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Bone rejected suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 referendum: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay in the EU is completely untrue."
The conservative Brexitist Andrea Jenkyns also took part in the march and told reporters: "I'm just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequers is unpopular with the general public, the opposition is not going to vote, it is unpopular within our party and with our activists who go from door to door and make sure we are elected.
Drop Chequers and listen."
In a targeted message for May, she added: "Premiers keep their job when they keep their promises."
Farage told the meeting that politicians should 'feel hot' if they want to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them, "We won't let you get away with this."
In a message to the enthusiastic masses, he added: "I want you to betray our political class, which is about to betray Brexit, to set fire to the fire.
We mobilise the national army of this country that has given us victory in the Brexit referendum and we will never rest until we have become an independent, sovereign, proud United Kingdom."
In the meantime, Remainers marched through Birmingham and concluded this march with a meeting of two hours in the city center.
A small group of activists waved with flags on which Tories Against Brexit stood, after the founding of this group during the weekend.
Lord Adonis, a member of the Labour High House, joked about the security problems of a Conservative party app at the beginning of their conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can provide IT systems and all the technology for Canada plus, for the frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
It's a complete farce.
There's no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Warren's plan is "to think well" about candidacy for presidency
Senator Elizabeth Warren says that after the November elections, she 'will think well about her candidacy for the presidency'.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat told about her future at a meeting in a town hall in west Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent criticism of President Donald Trump, wants to be re-elected in November against Geoff Diehl, Republican Member who was co-chair of Trum's Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
She has been at the centre of speculation that she could possibly fight Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters in a town hall since Trump came into power.
A present asked her if she would be elected to the presidency.
Warren answers that it is time for women to go to Washington to repair our defective government and that includes a woman at the top."
Arrest after killing Wayde Sims of LSU
The Baton Rouge police, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that a suspect was arrested after the shooting of Wayde Sims, LSU basketball player on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at an ET press conference at 11:00.
They released a video of the shooting incident on Friday and asked for help to identify the man who was in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims got a gunshot wound in his head and died of the consequences," police commander Murphy J. Paul told the press on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wayde stepped forward to defend a friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson has been interrogated and has known to have been present at the crime scene, in possession of a gun and have shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson has been arrested without further incidents and is held in the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims was a junior player of 1.98 meters who grew up in Baton Rouge. He played 32 matches and started in 10 matches last season. He has an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per match.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after Sebastian Vettel has let him win after orders from team
When Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that Mercedes team orders would play a role in the race.
Bottas had a good start from pole position and left Hamilton almost completely in the cold when he defended his position and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went into the pit and let Hamilton ride in the tail of the group, something that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes entered the pit later on and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton came back on the head after a wheel-up-wheel action which allowed the Ferrari driver to release space with reluctance on the inside after a double movement in the third bend.
Max Verstappen started from the last place and was seventh after the first round on his 21st birthday.
After that, he was the leader of the race for a while, because he stayed with his tire choice and aimed for quick finish, so that he could catch up with Kimi Raikkonen for the fourth place.
He finally went to the pit in the 44th round, after which he could not increase his speed in the remaining eight rounds, so that Raikkonen became fourth.
It's a difficult day because Valtteri did his best all weekend. He was a real gentleman and left me over.
The team did its best for the places one and two," said Hamilton.
That wasn't a good body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at an election meeting on Saturday on the fact that she continued not to be the source of the leaked letter of Christine Blasey Ford, in which the candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, was accused of assault.
Speaking at an election meeting in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly about the testimony given by Ford to the Senate's Justice Committee. Instead, he showed that what took place in the Senate showed that people could be "common, unkind and untrue."
"The only thing that can happen and the beautiful show that takes place the last days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you are the people who are angry and mean and unkind and untrue," he said.
"When you look at the press releases and leaks and then they say 'oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak?
Remember her answer... did you leak the document-- "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak."
Well, wait a minute.
Did we leak... no, we didn't leak," he added, in an imitation of the senator.
In July the letter in which the accusations to the address of Kavanaugh were mentioned were sent to Feinstein by Ford and it was leaked in September, but Feinstein denied that her desk was the leak.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't leak her story," Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
"She asked me to deal with it confidentially, and I treated it confidentially, as she had requested."
But the president turned out not to believe her denial and he commented at the meeting on Saturday night: "I'll tell you what, that wasn't a good body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
In addition to defending the candidate for the Supreme Court, accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats used the accusations for their own purposes.
"They are determined to seize power, with all necessary means.
You see the meanness, the unkindness, they don't care who's hurting them, about who they have to drive to seize power and regain control," the president said according to a Mediaite report.
Elite League: Dundee Stars vs Belfast Giants: 5-3
Patrick Dwyer made two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars made up for the loss of Friday in the Elite League against Belfast Giants by winning the return game with 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants had two goals in lead by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie took the home team side by side before Dwyer brought the Giants back to the lead.
Francois Bouchard made the equalizer for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured victory with two goals.
It was the third loss in the Elite League this season for the men of Adam Keefe, who had to make up for a delay on Friday night to defeat Dundee with 2-1 in Belfast.
It was the fourth time this season that the two teams met, where the Giants won the previous three matches.
The opening goal of Dwyer came in the fourth minute at 3:35 on an assistant to Kendall McFaull. David Rutherford gave the assistant with whom Beauvillier doubled the lead, four minutes later.
In a busy opening period, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game at 13:10, before Matt Marquardt made the lead for the equalizer of Cownie at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure that the Giants entered the first rest with a lead, when he made his second goal of the evening at the end of the first period.
The home team recaptured and Bouchard brought them back to an equal position with a power-play goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran then combined well to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the race, late in the second period. He ensured victory with the fifth goal for his team, halfway in the last period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of the last five matches, play home against Milton Keynes in their next race on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies while making sure that hundreds can escape the earthquake in an airplane
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is honored as a hero after he died because he made sure that a plane with hundreds of people on board could safely take off.
More than 800 people have been killed and many have been missing after a severe earthquake struck the island of Celebes on Friday; an earthquake that then caused a tsunami.
Powerful aftershocks still plague the area and many are buried under the point in the city of Palu.
In spite of the fact that his colleagues fled for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gwaman Agung refused to leave his post in the wild traffic tower of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
He continued to ensure that flight 6321 from Batik Air, which was ready on the runway at the time, could safely take off.
Then he jumped out of the traffic tower when he thought it was on collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, a spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said that his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, reported ABC News from Australia.
We had arranged a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"It breaks your heart when you hear that," he added.
In the meantime, the authorities fear that the death toll can rise to a thousand, and the country's disaster response agency announced that access to Donggala, Sigi and Boutong cities is limited.
"One assumes that the death toll is still rising because many bodies are under the rubble and have not yet been reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Waves reaching a height of five feet [6 m] have destroyed Palu, where a massive funeral ceremony will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute bodies are brought in by ambulances.
Clean water is scarce.
The minimarkets are looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, CNN said: "The Indonesian Red Cross is involved in a race to help survivors, but we do not know what they will find.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse."
President Yoko Widodo of Indonesia arrived in Palu on Sunday and said to the soldiers present: "I call upon you all to work day and night so that all tasks necessary for the evacuation are completed.
Are you ready?" reported CNN.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
Air Niugini now says one man is missing after a crash in the lagoon
The airline operating the flight that crashed in a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says that one more man is missing after they had previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew members had safely left the lowered plane.
Air Niugini said in a press release that one male passenger is missing on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said they worked with the local authorities, hospitals and detectives to find the man.
The air carrier did not respond immediately to the questions of more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped to rescue the other passengers and crew members after the plane was watered during the landing at the Chuuk Islands airport.
The authorities announced on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday and that everyone's condition was stable.
What caused the crash and what is the exact order of events remains unclear for the time being.
The airline and the American Navy both say that the plane has landed in the lagoon and the runway.
Some witnesses believe that the plane was shot across the runway.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said the plane was approaching the airport very low.
"That's good news," said Jaynes.
Jaynes told us that he himself and some others succeeded in waving the water, which came to their means, to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He also said that the stewardesses were panicking and screaming and that he had a non-serious head wound.
The U.S. Navy announced that seamen who were working nearby on a yard also helped in the rescue work by carrying people to the coast with an inflatable boat, before the plane sank further into about 30 metres [30 m] of deep water.
Aviation Safety Network data show that over the last twenty years 111 people have died in air carriers' crashes registered with the PNG, but none of them relate to Air Niugini.
Analyst sets the timeline of the night when a woman is burned alive
The prosecutor closed his requisitory on Friday in the reopening trial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, analyst of the U.S. Department of Justice, gave a single hourly witness as a witness in the field of information analyses.
He made it clear to the jury how he had used the phone records of mobile phones to record the movements of the 29-year-old suspect, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night she died.
Rowlett reported that he had received the location data from various mobile phones that showed that Tellico was at Chambers on the night of her death, which was contrary to his earlier claims, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers during the time he claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went back to Sanford.
Sanford was in the witness bench on Saturday and told me he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he told me he was at Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "lying because my truck was in Nashville at the time."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis had told him that he knew Chambers about two weeks when she died.
The cell phone records indicated that they only knew each other for one week.
Rowlett said that Tellis knew the text messages, calls and contact details of his phone some time after Chambers died.
"He knew her from his life," said Hale.
The defense starts on Sunday with the final arguments.
The judge said he expected the jury to start the deliberations later that day.
The High Breed: What is 'conscious hiphop'?
A hiphop trio wants to debate the negative image of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol argues that hip-hop is alienated from its origins with political opinions and addressing social problems.
They want to return to the roots and repopulate 'conscious hiphop'.
Artists such as The Fuges and Common have recently had a revival in Britain by artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black?!
A nanny from New York presents a couple to the judge for a 'racist' text
A New York pediatrician is a courtwoman because of dismissal for discriminatory reasons, after receiving a missent text in which the mother complained about 'again such a black'.
The couple deny being a racist and call the trial 'epressive'.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, showed her horror when she discovered that the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, proved to be a negroid woman when she met her first working day in 2016.
"NO MORE than ZWARTE," wrote Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman in a message to her husband.
Instead of sending it to her husband, however, she sent it to Mrs. Maurice twice.
According to the U.S. newspaper New York Post, Plasco-Flaxman, who felt uncomfortable, dismissed her blunder when she realized that her former nanny, who was African-American, had done bad work and that she had therefore expected a Philippine.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for a workday and was then sent home by taxi.
Now Maurice is bringing the couple to court to get a compensation of $ 350,-- a day for the 6 months she was hired to bivg- in-house with the family, although without contract.
'I want them to feel that you just don't do that,' said Maurice last Friday in the New York Post, adding, 'I know it's discrimination.'
The couple bit themselves with regard to the claim that she was a racist by saying that it was reasonable to fire Maurice after, by insulting her, they were afraid that they could no longer trust her.
"My wife sent her a message that she didn't want to send her.
She's not a racist.
We're not racists," husband Joel Plasco told the New York Post.
'But would you leave your children to someone who had insulted you, even if it was accidental?
Your newborn baby?
Get out of here."
Compared to "epressive," Plasco said his wife was expecting a baby in two months' time and was "in a very difficult situation."
"Are you going to persecute someone like that?
That's not so sympathetic," added the investment banker.
While the trial is still in progress, public opinion is quick to capitulate the couple on social media, where they are squatted for their behavior and reasoning.
The publishers of Paddington feared that the public would not have much interest in a talking bear, reveals newly revealed letter
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the approval of the book, said about the letter: 'It's hard to get in the shoes of someone who reads it for the first time, even before the first publication.
With what we now know about Paddington's enormous success, it's very enjoyable."
She told her father who, before being inspired to write the children's book about a small toy bear, worked as a cameraman at British BBC, was optimistic about whether his book would be rejected. She added that the 60th birthday of the publication of the book 'bittersweet' felt after his death last year.
About Paddington, who describes her as 'a very prominent member of the family', she said that her father was secretly proud of the ultimate success.
She said, "He was a quiet, modest man."
'But because Paddington was so real to him, it almost seemed like a child's performance; you're proud while you didn't do anything for it yourself.
I think he felt about the success of Paddington.
Although Paddington was the creation of his own imagination, he honored the bear for its success."
My daughter was dying and I had to say good-bye to her on the phone.
Immediately after the landing, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where the doctors tried to save her life in vain.
'Nad had called several times to say it looked very bad and was expected to not make it,' said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then came Nad's phone call to say that she would die in two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much.
We'll be together soon.
Then I'll be back with you.
The medications the doctors had given her to keep her heart pumping slowly worked out and left her body.
She had died some time before, and this process stopped everything.
I could only sit there knowing what was going on.
I couldn't cry, scream or cry, because I was in the middle of a lot of people and families.
I really had to be big."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who was now mourning the death of her daughter, got on the plane with the other passengers, who had no idea what trial she had to go through.
"No one knew," she said.
"I sat down with my head and the tears kept coming.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight I got an overwhelming feeling of compassion for Nad.
I felt he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Rouding women paste messages on bridge to prevent suicide
Two women who have been lost to suicide become strong to keep others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys paste inspiring messages and phone numbers that people in need can call for help on a bridge in Wales
Ms. Davis was her son, Tyler, 13 years old when he first became depressed and he committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45 years old and residing in Lydney in the English county of Gloucestershire, tells us that her son was a promising chef with an infectious grin.
"He was known for his smile.
They always said that his smile lit every room."
Yet he stopped working before his death because he was deep in the pit."
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 years old at the time, found him after robbing himself of life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm constantly worried about a chain reaction."
Mrs Davis has made the cards; 'to let people know that there are others where you can go and what you can talk to, even if it's just a friend.
Don't keep silent - talk about it."
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs. Davies for years, did not lose Mark, who was her partner for 15 years, long after his mother died.
"He didn't say he felt sad or depressed or something," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He was all on the ground on Christmas Day - when the children undressed their presents he didn't look at them at all or something."
She said his death was a great trauma for them, but they have to deal with it: 'It's tearing the whole family apart.
It's driving us apart.
But we all have to go on and keep fighting."

Brett Kavanaugh's future uncertain as FBI starts research
'I thought that if we could actually get what he was asking for; a study limited in time and in scope, we could perhaps create some more unity again,' said Mr Flake last Saturday, to which he added, that he was afraid that the committee was falling apart, amid a firmly anchored pacing within the party.
Why did Mr Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance has everything to do with timing.
In five weeks' time, on 6 November and if, as expected, the Republicans are doing badly, their attempts to get their husbands elected to the highest court in the country are seriously hampered.
George W. Bush has already called with members of the U.S. Senate to lobby for Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush, and so he met his wife Ashley, who was the Bush's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI's done the report?
There will then be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 republicans and 49 democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr Kavanaugh can count on at least 50 votes in the Senate, and this would allow Mike Pence, Vice-President, to issue the decisive vote to confirm Kavanaugh's appointment to the Supreme Court.
Number of floods in North Korea "down" under Kim
According to a South Korean legislator, the number of North Korean flooders has fallen to South Korea since Kim Jong-un came into power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-sug, quoted from data from the South Russian Ministry of Singleness, states that last year there were 1,127 flooders, compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park noted that stricter border controls between North Korea and China, and higher penalties for human smugglers, were the main factors for the decline.
Pyongyang didn't respond publicly.
The vast majority of the flooders from North Korea are finally offered to the South Russian nationality.
According to Seoul's sources, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most fled through China, which has the longest external border with North Korea and where you can make the crossing easier than in the heavily secured demilitarized zone (DMZ; Demilitarized Zone) between the two Koreas.
China regards the floodors as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often banishes them with violence.
North-South relations, which are still formally at war, have improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries had a meeting in Pyongyang, with particular reference to the stagnated negotiations on denuclearisation.
This meeting took place after the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June, where they agreed largely to work towards the nuclear dismantling of the Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the US of lack of progress in lifting US sanctions since then.
'Without faith in US action, confidence in our national security is also lacking, and under these circumstances there is no first step of unilateral disarmament', said Mr Ri in a speech for the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh 'hysterical', and finds him inadequate to serve in the Supreme Court
President of the House of Deputies, Nancy Pelosi, called candidate judge to the U.S. Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh 'hysterical', and found him inadequate to serve in the Supreme Court
Pelosi made the comments in an interview, Saturday at the 'Texas Tribune Festival' in Austin, Texas.
'I couldn't help thinking that if a woman behaved like this, they would call her 'hysterical',' Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Committee on Justice on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied the allegations that he would have sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional; at times he almost screamed and was particularly upset when he told about his family and his high school age.
He also strongly condemned the Democrats in the committee, calling the accusations against him 'grotesque and coordinated character murder', organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi explained that she felt Kavanaugh's testimony showed that he was not fit to serve the Supreme Court because he was full of prejudices against the democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with his statements and the way he talks about the Clintons and the Democrats," says Pelosi.
Pelosi protested when she was asked if she would try to initiate an impeachment procedure against Kavanaugh if he was appointed, and the democrats would get the majority in the House of Delegates.
"I can say this about that; if he doesn't tell the truth in Congress, or against the FBI, then he's not only unfit for the Supreme Court, but also for the court where he now serves," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Court of Justice of the District of Columbia (usually abbreviated D.C.) District Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that as a democrat, she was concerned that Kavanaugh would speak out against the 'Affordable Care Act or Roe v Wade' (the affordable health care law) because Kavanaugh is known as a conservative judge.
Kavanaugh bypassed questions about the revision of certain decisions of the Supreme Court during the hearings.
'Don't expect us to be delighted when a hysterical, prejudiced person is now appointed to the Supreme Court', says Pelosi.
Women just have to admit to this.
It's a just tyrade of months and years of bottled anger that's running out, and she can only cry to get it out.
'We'll cry when we get angry,' Mrs. Steinem said to me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's weird, do you?"
She continued: 'I was greatly helped by a woman who was a leader and who told me that she too would cry when she got angry. She developed a method where she would cry every time she got angry. To the one she spoke to, she said, 'You might think I'm sad because I cry.
I'm mad."
And then she just cried.
I just thought that was brilliant."
Tears are partially permitted as an expression of anger, because crying is essentially ununderstood.
One of my best memories from a former job, in a men-dominated office, is when I had to cry terribly because I was extremely angry. An older woman, a cold company manager who everyone was a little afraid of, grabbed me in my neck and dragged me into a stairwell.
"Never show them you're crying," she said to me.
'They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and happy they got you on the closet.
Patricia Schroeder, then a member of the Congress in Colorado for the Democrats, had worked for Gary Hart on his candidate for the presidency.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was involved in an extramarital affair aboard a boat called 'Monkey Business' (informally means 'cat' or 'apes') and withdrew from the race, the deeply disappointed Mrs. Schroeder felt that there was no reason why she would not stand for herself.
"It wasn't a deliberate decision," she told me laughing 30 years later.
'There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last one they needed was another candidate.
Someone was talking about "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Because the campaign was already advanced, she was behind with fundraising, so she vowed not to join if she couldn't raise $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters, who would give $1,000 to men, wanted to give her only $250.
"Maybe they think I'm getting a discount?" she asked herself.
When she gave her speech in which she announced that she would not start a formal campaign, she became so overwhelmed by feelings - of gratitude to the people who had supported her, of frustration because the system made it so difficult to raise money, and to reach voters instead of delegates, and of anger over sexism - that she choked into it.
'People will have thought I was having a nervous breakdown,' Mrs. Schroeder remembered about how the media responded to her.
'They'll have thought Kleenex was my company sponsor.
I remember thinking, what will they put on my tombstone?
"She cried"?
How the US-China trade war can benefit Beijing
The opening salvos of the US-China trade war were deafening, and although the battle has not yet been fought, long-term experts believe that a gap between the two countries could be beneficial to Beijing.
Earlier this year, Donald Trump, the U.S. President, gave the first warning by increasing taxes on major Chinese export products, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation became known this week when new effective, increased tax rates were revealed for 200 billion dollars (150 billion euros) of goods, half of all goods coming from China to the US.
Beijing has every time taken in natura reprisals, most recently by raising rates from 5 to 10% for $60 billion in American goods.
China has pledged to equalise the US every time, and the world on a second-largest economy is unlikely to blink with the eyes quickly.
In order to make Washington bow, requests have to be accepted, but public bending for the US is far too painful for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts claim that if Beijing plays smart, the trade war with the US, China could be a positive support in the longer term, by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
'The fact that a rapid political decision could create conditions in Washington or Beijing, which would allow one of the two countries to enter into an economic free fall, is actually much more dangerous than spectators have recognised before', says Abigail Grace, a research assistant from the 'Center for a New American Security', a think tank specializing in national security issues, which focuses on Asia.
Syria 'ready' to return refugees, says Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help to rebuild the country that has been destroyed by a war of more than seven years.
In his speech to the UN General Assembly, Minister for Foreign Affairs, Walid al-Moualem, stated that the situation in his country improved.
'Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safer, thanks to the progress made in combating terrorism,' he says.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas that have been destroyed by terrorists and to normalize the situation on the ground.
All circumstances now exist for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they have had to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that threaten their daily lives and existence.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled their country since the war began in 2011.
It is estimated that there are still about six million people living in the country who need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would welcome help to restore the devastated country.
However, he stressed that Syria would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that had subsidized the uprising.
Europe wins the 'Ryder Cup' in Paris
The European team won the '2018 Ryder Cup' by defeating the American team with a final score of 16.5 against 10.5 on the golf course 'Le Golf National' south-west of Paris in France.
The US has now lost six consecutive times on European soil, and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the title when the Danish commander Thomas Bjorn's team won the necessary number of 14.5 points to defeat the US.
The star of the American team, Phil Mikkelson, who was struggling almost the entire tournament, let his long blow from the tea end up in the water at point 3, hole 16, and admitted his loss of Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer, Molinari, excelled in all his rounds and became one of the four players who ever reached 5-0-0 since the tournament in its current form began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was thrown out by playing the lowest score of the European team, Thorbjorn Oles from Denmark, with 5 holes down and 4 holes.
The top-ranking world ranking player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 holes down and 1 hole to play from Ian Poulter from Great Britain, who may have played his last match in the Ryder Cup.
The Spaniard Segrio Garcia, veteran with eight Ryder Cups, became the best European player of all tournaments ever with 25.5 points in his career.
"I don't cry so soon, but today I can't help it.
It's been a tough year.
I'm so grateful to Thomas that he chose me and believed in me.
I'm so glad we got the cup back.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I was able to help," said an emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He passes the torch on to his fellow countryman, John Ram, who beat the American legend Tiger Woods with 2 holes down and 1 hole in the game for singles on Sunday.
"The great pride I feel because I defeated Tiger Woods. I always followed that guy when I grew up," says 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
A strange statistics of one of the biggest players ever; winner of 14 major championships, second only behind Jack Nicklaus.
The American team struggled the weekend to find the fairways, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level throughout the tournament.
The American commander, Jim Furyk, after his team's disappointing performance, said, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
Shortly this morning, we made Europe a little more difficult.
We were resisting.
All respect for Thomas.
He's a great commander.
All 12 players in his team played very well.
We're going to regroup. I'm going to work with the American PGA (Professional Golfers' Association) and our Ryder Cup Committee and we're looking ahead.
I love these 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their commander.
You have to take your hat off for the opponent.
We're overplayed."
