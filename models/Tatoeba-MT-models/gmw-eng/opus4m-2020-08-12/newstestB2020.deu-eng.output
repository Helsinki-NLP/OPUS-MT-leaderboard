Fire deleted in French chemistry
The large fire in a particularly dangerous chemical plant in the northern French city of Rouen has been removed. This was reported by the Normandie prefecture on Friday. The fire broke out on Thursday at night. No one was hurt during the incident. The fire brigade was used with about 200 fire vehicles.
The fire could be stopped
The locals were called upon not to leave their homes. Buildings within 500 meters were evacuated, schools and kindergartens were closed on Thursday. In the chemical plant on the banks of the Seine, additives for lubricants are produced. The factory belongs to the company Lubrizol by US billionaire Warren Buffett and is subject to the so-called Seveso Directive of the EU, which requires particularly strict security requirements.
About 400 people are working in the plant. The chemical factory already provided headlines in the past - for example, when the gas methanethiol was released by a leak in 2013 and the environment rose widely after lazy eggs. After an operating accident, about 2,000 litres of mineral oil flowed into the city's wastewater system in 2015.
Woman announces her job to look for 57 days after her missing bitch
For two months, a woman from Washington was looking for her missing dog - and gave her extra job. Seven-year-old Border Collie had left the hotel room during a short vacation in Montana. 57 days missing any trace from the dog - but Carole King did not give up.
"It was terrible. I got bad," Carole King told the "Daily Inter Lake". She and her husband had left Hundin Katie in the hotel room while they went to dinner. When they returned to the hotel, Katie disappeared. They were looking for the animal, but without success.
Donner panicked dog
In the hope that Katie could still stay at the hotel, Carole King went to the reception. "The employee says, "She left about four or four and a half hours ago," Carole King recalls to "Daily Inter Lake". When the automatic door opened, Katie immediately ran out. Probably a loud thunder had panicked the dog.
With flyers and calls in Facebook groups, the Kings were looking for their beloved dog. But out of days, weeks were coming. "I never gave up. I never lost hope," Carole King told the "Daily Inter Lake", who quit her job as a postman to continue her search for Katie.
"Floating the Tears"
57 days after Katie's disappearance, Carole King got a call: A man came in and said that Katie was in his yard. But when King arrived, Katie had already disappeared. She was looking for the neighborhood and suddenly stood her dog under a tree. "I just embraced her. I didn't want to let her go," King recalls, "Daily Inter Lake." "The tears flowed. The people stopped in their vehicles, got out and embraced us. I think the whole neighborhood knew we had found them."
Losses in the Bundeswehr: Machine guns disappear without trace
Friday, 27 September 2019
Six MG3 machine guns have still disappeared.
In recent years, the Bundeswehr has lost many weapons and tens of thousands of shots of ammunition, including three machine guns. In most cases, the remains are unclear. The opposition speaks of a "fearing" extent.
Weapons and ammunition are disappearing again and again in the Bundeswehr - many of them so far without trace. Since the beginning of 2014, the troops have recorded the loss of 39 weapons, 39 parts and almost 20,000 gun ammunition. This is the result of a classified list of the Federal Ministry of Defense, which the editorial network Germany reports on.
According to the paper from the Office of Defense Secretary Peter Tauber of the CDU, two weapons, one part of the weapon and 3474 gun ammunition have been re-appeared. The remaining weapons and parts of the weapon are, among other things, six type MG3 machine guns, eleven type G3 rifles, four type G36 rifles, six P8 signal guns and two P8 guns. In addition, 30 MG3 machine guns are missing.
The extent of arms and munitions losses in the Bundeswehr was "frightening," said the left-winger member of the federal government Martina Renner. This was all the more true, as there was hardly anything to be found in the course of investigations. The left-winger spoke of a "poor balance sheet". Renner criticised that the listing was not clear whether under the missing ammunition was also the one found in connection with the investigations against the terrorist-suspected Federal Defence Officer Franco A. "And that although a supporter of Franco A. was recently condemned for the possession of this ammunition," said Renner.
Oil tanker "Stena Impero" left Iranian port
More than two months after being determined by the Iranian authorities, the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" left the port of Bandar Abbas on Friday. As reported by ship observation data from Refinitiv, the tanker set off and left the Iranian port. Port Rashid was designated as destination port in the United Arab Emirates.
The tanker had actually been released by the Iranian government on Monday, but at first he remained in Iranian waters. From the shipping company it was said that one wanted to wait for an official notice from Tehran.
The "Stena Impero" had been accused on 19 July of breaching security regulations by the Iranian revolutionary guards in Hormuz's waterway, but it was suspected that Iran would react to the controversial, temporary establishment of an Iranian oil tanker in front of the Gibraltar belonging to Great Britain.
The road of Hormuz is one of the most important seaways in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Most of the global oil exports are shipped by the sea narrow. The tensions in the region have been greatly intensified in recent months. Trade shipping has been drawn into the conflict between the USA and Iran. Several incidents have occurred with tankers and drones.
Merkel appreciates the courage of people in the Peaceful Revolution
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel appreciated the commitment of the people in the GDR, who went on the streets 30 years ago during the Peaceful Revolution. In autumn 1989 courageous citizens had caused the then GDR regime to waver, Merkel said at a ceremony of the Thüringer CDU Group on the upcoming Day of German Unity in Erfurt. Among other things, the Chancellor reminded us of the occupation of the Stasi headquarters. "State security was taken from terror," she said.
Musk Aims Delivery Record
Teslas Quarter may hold record. Despite the extradition boom, there were last losses at the electric car company.
New York.Tesla CEO Elon Musk has given his electric car company a strong boost on the stock market with the prospect of new record numbers. "We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries," Musk wrote in an email to Tesla employees published by the branch blog "Electrek".
The demand was strong, so that Tesla could book 110000 orders, it continued in Musk’s newsletter. The challenge was to quickly bring the cars to the customers. Tesla had to offer as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked this: Teslas shares went out of business with an increase of more than six percent. For almost four months, the price has stopped increasing. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered over 95000 cars and thus achieved its best value.
Musk needs records to achieve its high targets. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360000 to 400000 cars. This requires six-digit figures in the current and coming quarter. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is needed, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there were last losses.
Puzzles solved: That's why we can't tickle ourselves
A kind of brake in the cerebral brain prevents people from tickling themselves. This was found by scientists at Humboldt University in Berlin with the help of experiments on rats, as they announced on Thursday evening. Progress has also been made on the question of why children are so fiercely resisting the tickling, just to demand more.
Finally, it was also shown why the coming of a tickling hand alone caused laughter before contact. This was due to a deep layer in the cerebral brain, which already caused laughter when waiting for the kittening.
According to the data, earlier research showed that rats react with "laughing" in the ultrasound area when they are tickled by humans. This "laughing" is mediated by the part of the cerebral cortex, which serves the central processing of haptic perception.
Laughing is suppressed during self-contact
So far, it has been assumed that the brain can distinguish between self-contact and touch by others - hence, people cannot tickle themselves. However, the Berlin researchers now found out in the experiments in the rats that the laughter and activity of the area of the cerebral cortex concerned are suppressed during self-contact. This is also true if living beings wash themselves. During the contact with others and the tickling by the scientists, however, the activity in the brain and impulse had been increased.
But if the self-contact and touch pass through others at the same time, the laughter is also suppressed. This suggests that the brain of the rat does not distinguish between the self-contact and the touch of others. The new findings suggest that people cannot tickle themselves, because the self-contact activates a brake in the big brain.
The rats had also been trained to tickle themselves, so they sometimes stopped this initiation early in the experiment, showed escape behaviour or terror. This ambivalence was similar to the behavior of the children. The ambivalence of kittling was a behaviour that was the same in rats and humans.
Catastrophe averted: large fire in French chemical plant deleted
The big fire in a chemical plant that is considered particularly dangerous in the northern French city of Rouen has been removed. This was reported by the Normandie Prefecture of the news agency AFP on Friday. The fire broke out in the night of Thursday.
According to the authorities, no substances harmful to health are supposed to have resigned. The samples taken do not give cause for concern, as Prefect Pierre-André Durand said at a press conference on Friday morning. No one was hurt in the incident. The fire brigade was used with about 200 fire vehicles.
Schools and kindergartens were closed
Residents were called not to leave their homes. Buildings within 500 meters were evacuated, schools and kindergartens remained closed on Thursday.

Brexit: Johnson criticized by her sister
The Prime Minister’s sister commented on Boris Johnson’s speech at the first session in Parliament after the end of the forced break on Wednesday evening. The Prime Minister threatens to lead the country without EU agreements on 31 October should not comply with his demands for changes to the Brexit Agreement, but it is unclear how he intends to achieve this.
About Cox, who had been working for the UK in the European Union, the Prime Minister said, "The best way to honor Jo Cox's memory and restore this country would be to carry out the EU exit." Cox was murdered by a right-wing extremist during the referendum campaign in 2016.
Memorial to attacks by Oslo and Utöya is revealed
More than eight years after the attacks in Oslo and Utöya with 77 deaths on Saturday in Norway, a memorial is revealed in honor of the victims. The monument "Jernrosene" (German: the Iron Roses) consists of about 1,000 iron rose replicas. They remind of the roses that had been deposited by thousands of people in the days and weeks following the attacks in front of the Cathedral in Oslo.
In the same place the project of the artists Tobbe Malm and Tone Karlsrud is now to be revealed - the roses were forged by people from all over the world, including survivors and members of the victims. The opening is expected, among others, of Crown Prince Haakon and Crown Princess Mette-Marit.
On 22 July 2011, the right-wing terrorist Anders Behring Breivik first fired a car bomb in the government quarter of Oslo and, following Utöya Island, killed dozens of participants in a holiday camp of the youth organization of the Social Democratic Workers' Party. In total, 77 people were killed during the attacks.
Iran Releases British Tankers
The UN general debate did not solve the Iran conflict, but now there is a problem less. The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" held in Iran could get back into the sea. It could be a piece of puzzle in the Iranian President Ruhani's peace plan.
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" held in the street of Hormus in Iran since mid-July is back in international waters. After the release by Iranian authorities, the ship is on its way to Dubai, as the shipping company Stena Bulk announced.
The "Stena Impero" had left the port of Bandar Abbas and the crew is now sailing for medical examinations to Dubai, said Reederreichf Erik Hånell. Around noon the ship had left the Iranian waters. "It's nice that it's over," he said to the Swedish television station SVT.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in London described the establishment of the ship as illegal. "This is part of a pattern of attempts to affect the freedom of the seas. We work with our international partners to maintain shipping and international law," said a communication on Friday.
On July 19 the Iranian Revolution Guards had set the tanker under the charge of disregarding regulations of sea law in the Persian Gulf. Seven of the 23 crew members had already been released at the beginning of September. Hånell said that the remaining 16 crew members are doing well. They would have been professional in the last ten weeks in view of the difficult and disquieting situation. The shipping company is now working to bring them back together with their families as soon as possible.
The British government suspected a reaction to a similar incident in British Gibraltar following the establishment of the "Stena Impero", where at the beginning of July a supertanker with oil from Iran, which is said to have been destined for Syria, had been placed on the chain. According to the authorities, the delivery violates EU sanctions against the country of war Syria. The British had received the reference to the ship from the US.
Iran spoke of "piracy" and threatened with consequences. In mid-August, the "Adrian Darya-1" was finally released. Presumptuously, it had been a trading business to get the "Stena Impero" free, London vehemently said.
The road of Hormus is one of the most important seaways in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Most of the world’s oil exports are shipped by the sea narrow. The tensions in the region have been greatly intensified in recent months. Trade shipping has been drawn into the conflict between the USA and Iran. Several incidents have occurred with tankers and drones.
Behind the tensions between Tehran and Washington is the nuclear dispute between both countries. The Americans accuse the Iranian leadership of wanting to build nuclear weapons. Iran rejects this. In 2018, the United States left the international nuclear agreement alone, which would prevent Iran from building a nuclear bomb and at the same time end its political and economic isolation. Since then, the U.S. government has been putting pressure on the leadership in Tehran with massive economic sanctions against the country in order to force a more stringent and expanded agreement. Iran has been resisting the pressure so far.
Because of the dispute over the "Stena Impero" and further incidents with tankers in the Persian Gulf and oil plants in Saudi Arabia, the US is working on a coalition for military protection of the merchant ships in the region.
Iranian President Hassan Ruhani presented a plan for security and peace in the street of Hormus at the UN General Assembly in New York. Iran, together with the Arab Gulf states and without foreign protection powers, wants to ensure the safety of shipping in the Persian Gulf with the initiative "Coalition of Hope".
India has a better future with its protectionist economic policy.
In fact, India would be predestined to become a "war winner". In view of the tariffs imposed by America’s President Donald Trump against Chinese manufacturers, foreign producers in the People’s Republic are forced to re-dispose. Financial leaders of Asian companies considering moving their production from China to another country call India one of the preferred alternatives in a UBS survey. Of course, this does not only have to do with the uncertainties of the Chinese-American trade war. India seems to have a huge pool of young workers and an internal market of 1.3 billion billion as designed to play a more important role in the global wide-ranging production chain.
But now India itself has become Trump's focus. Depreciating from the Haudegen in the White House as the "Kingdom of Customs", America withdrew the trade advantages for 2000 products from the emerging country at the beginning of June. The USA is prohibitively accusing India of high tariffs and demanding better market access for agricultural goods, mobile phones, spirits, motorcycles and more.
On the world map of trade wars, the reeds with India are, of course, just a sideshow. America also looks at the world’s largest democracy through the security glasses. Delhi and Washington combine the concern about China’s claims for power in the South Indian Ocean. Against this background, a salve of American criminal duties against India is unlikely. India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has just taken up a second five-year term, is therefore likely to weigh in security.
However, the problem lies in another place: the empirically hardened thesis that open markets accelerate economic development has a heavy stand in the socialist republic of India. His reform zeal focuses mainly on bureaucratic madness, which has long been suffocating any entrepreneurial spirit in the multi-national state. Companies now receive rapid building permits for buildings. They benefit from a better energy and transport infrastructure, and a more cumbersome insolvency and bankruptcy law creates prerequisites for speedy liquidating companies with high debts.
The success of these efforts can be seen and measured in the relevant rankings. From an economic point of view, many things have turned to better in India in the first five years of mode. However, this does not apply in commercial policy. The national conservative government even established new barriers to the protection of internationally few competitive companies from foreign suppliers.
In the West, the Nimbus of the energetic reformer, who economically renewed his country, is dependent on the fact that the charismatic prime minister knows only too well what the vocabulary of Western managers likes. At the heart of the "India First" lawyer, however, never departed from a protectionist economic policy, which prevents Indian companies from being forced to get rid of anachronistic processes and thus become fit for global competition. Businessmen who survive thanks to the rejection of their industries are among the regular voters of Mois nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party and clap these shortsighted policies.
Arrest of Jacques Chirac on Monday in Paris
Former French President Jacques Chirac is said to be buried in Paris in the coming week. The former head of state will be buried on Monday at the Montparnasse cemetery in the south of the French capital, the news agency AFP reported on the Chiracs family. The funeral will take place in the close family circle. For Sunday, a public funeral in the Paris Invalidity Centre was set up, as media reported.
Carrying the competitors to the finish line: Dabo is the first secret hero of the World Championships.
The top of the world had long since been the target of the scene when the rained-down Khalifa International Stadium was setting in a warm-up scene. In the first run-up of the men over 5,000 meters Jonathan Busby from Aruba began to wave dangerously. He could hardly hold himself on his legs more than 300 meters ahead of the target, ran in an unhealthy bending position when Braima Suncar Dabo from the West African country of Guinea-Bissau suddenly cut him down and backed him up with the last half round of the stadium to the finish. However, the forces were still enough to stop the clock running after the finish. As if the scene had not been curious enough.
"I just wanted to help him. Everyone in this situation would have done the same thing," said Dabo after the race in Mixed Zone, when he was totally unexpectedly drawing the attention of the assembled journalists. He was shy, he didn't want to talk about his heroic action at all. After all, he wanted to set up his personal best time and when he realized that this would be difficult, he only wanted to help a fellow sufferer. And anyway, he would only be proud to represent his country, which was invited for the World Cup. Under normal circumstances, he shouldn't have even started. "That's why I'm proud to run for my country," he said.
That's what he did that evening with emphasis - and much more intense than he might have thought. Because this heroic act will be remembered. Especially Dabo even left his competitor Busby in the finish and voluntarily took the last place - by the way, good five minutes after the Ethiopian Selemon Barega, who won this lead. In the end, it had nothing to do with everything, because the busby only came into the target was disqualified at the end of the world athletics band.
Dabo, who lives in Portugal and studied there in Lisbon, took part in the World Cup in Doha to set up a personal best time. According to official data, he was still disappointed at 18:10,87 minutes, but he himself was disappointed: "I wanted to walk 17:55 minutes. Under 18 minutes I was already". However, only in training, there are no best times.
Million Masch: Egyptians Arm for Wild Protest Day
In Egypt, security measures have been strengthened in the run-up to possible government-critical protests. A stronger police presence was observed in the centre of Cairo on Friday. Several subway stations remained closed, roads around the central central square were blocked.
In recent days, the police have strengthened their road controls and partly searched the mobile phones of pedestrians for news and photos related to the protests. Hundreds had been arrested according to two non-governmental organizations.
Al-Sisi opponent
Last weekend it was in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura that protests came with hundreds of participants. They were directed against the government of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, the critic of corruption and mismanagement. Such an open protest against the political leadership had not occurred in Egypt for years. The Spanish exile Egyptian builder and actor Mohammed Ali, who played the demonstrations with video messages on Facebook, has called for a "million march" on central places in the country today Friday. Ali demands a "Volks Revolution". The man is not "good" for most young Egyptians, even though he is a subcontractor for the army millions, but his messages arrive.
According to two groups of observers, the number of arrests in connection with the protests continued. The Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF) counted more than 1,570 arrests until Friday. The Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights (ECESR) and the Human Rights Watch (HRW) spoke of more than 2,000 arrests. Independently, these figures were not confirmed at first.
Arbitrary arrests
Many people had been "involuntarily arrested" "only because they were "in the wrong place at the wrong time," said HRW, calling on lawyers to report arresters. According to their lawyers, the charges against the prisoners range from "proliferation of false information" to membership in a "terrorist association". In Cairo, Alexandria and other cities polled and searched security forces in uniform, but also in civilian clothing, according to HRW data, also arbitrarily passersby.
HRW also criticized censorship in the North African country. According to this, the government is blocking websites and online services in Cairo to stop further protests against Sisi.
Online dealers: Delivery dealers should be able to donate returns more easily
For online dealers, many returned packages are lost goods. Around 20 million returns land on the trash. However, there is an alternative.
The Ministry of Finance has shown online dealers such as Amazon and Zalando a way to donate returned products instead of destroying them.
While companies could not be exempted from the turnover tax on property donations, the Ministry explained on a question of the Green Group of the Federal Republic of Germany, which was reported on Friday by the newspapers of the Funke Media Group. However, traders could set the market value of the unsaleable returns so low that they would not have to pay any or only little turnover tax.
Scientists at the University of Bamberg found that the federal citizens returned every sixth package on orders on the Internet. Around four percent of the goods - about 20 million products - then landed in the trash. According to current legal situation, the companies would also cost money, because the financial authorities value donations such as a turnover, which will then be subject to sales tax.
Mr. Katrin Göring-Eckardt called on Finance Minister Olaf Scholz (SPD) to clarify with a decree that companies cannot assess products for sale and donate them to non-profit organisations free of charge. Companies would have to be able to rely on not being punished for donations. This applies not only to online commerce, but also to other shops from fashion store to the DIY market.
Banksy Art for Auction: There was never a better time to sell this painting
The famous work of Streetart-Star Banksy, "Developed Parliament", is about to be auctioned.
For Branczik, Banksys' work emphasises "the return of the oldest parliamentary democracy in the world to the basic attitude of animals and tribes". From Saturday, the painting will be exhibited at Sotheby's in the British capital until it is auctioned on 3 October. It is estimated at 1.5 to two million euros.
The work was first exhibited in 2009 in the Museum of Bristol in the southwest of Great Britain, where Banksy lives. This year the artist had once again exhibited the painting - at the same time as the original Brexit date on March 29. On this occasion the work, formerly called "Question Hour", was renamed "Developed Parliament" ("Delegated Parliament").
The picture could change the owner for a million dollars.
Last Wednesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson delivered a hard exchange of views with the opposition at the first meeting of the House of Commons after a forced break imposed by Johnson by the Supreme Court. Johnson intends to carry out the Brexit already postponed twice on 31 October, if necessary, without any agreement with the EU.
It is not the first time that Banksy, whose identity is still unknown, interferes in the Brexit debate. In Dover in the South East of England, he painted a picture that represents a man who breaks a star of the European flag with a chisel. The work sees thousands of truck drivers and other visitors every day on their way into the United Kingdom.
Brexit debate is like a "walk in the park"
In his opinion, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s violent verbal attacks on Brexit opponents in Parliament do not contribute to a climate of hatred. Compared to the election campaign before the Brexit referendum in 2016, the current controversy is a “walk in the park”, said Dominic Cummings at a book presentation on Friday. “We will enjoy it. We will leave (from the EU) and we will win”.
Johnson had violently attacked Brexit opponents in Parliament in recent days and accused them of, among other things, "treason" to the people. Accuseds that he could put the Members at risk because they could become the target of threats of murder, he put off as "humbug".
Cummings said that the only way to get back to rest was if the British were to finally respect the British's decision to leave the EU, and it was not surprising that people were concerned that the United Kingdom had still not left the EU three years after the referendum.
In view of the charged mood on Friday, even the bishops of the Church of England called for restraint. "We should speak with respect", it said in a statement. "And we should also listen."
Pakistan's Prime Minister Khan calls for uno intervention in Kashmir
With an emotional appeal, Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan once again invited the United Nations to intervene in the Kashmir conflict at his first appearance before the UN Assembly.
Otherwise, a renewed war between the nuclear forces Pakistan and India would be likely, Khan said on Friday at the Uno General debate in New York. "If this is going badly, one hopes for the best, but be prepared for the worst." The United Nations would have a responsibility for Kashmir. "You should have prevented it."
India and Pakistan have waged three wars since their independence from British colonial rule in 1947, two of them around the parted region of Kashmir. Both nuclear powers dominate part of Kashmir, another part belongs to China. At the beginning of August, India had withdrawn the Indian Kashmir region’s autonomy status and thus increased the tensions in relation to Pakistan dramatically.
Not even a bottle of water
The protesters in Cairo call for the fall of the Egyptian President al-Sisi.
Against the current protests in Egypt, the government reacts with a strong hand. With sharp ammunition, it shoots at the population, over 2000 prisoners joined in prisons to the 60,000 political prisoners who are already in there. Protesting has never been harmless in Egypt. However, since the takeover of General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi in 2013, the state apparatus is doing everything possible to avoid a scenario such as at the time of the Arab Spring.
But one of the causes of the 2011 protests was the bad economic situation. Poverty, perspektiveness and the feeling of being suffocated by their own government drove millions to the streets. And this is a problem that the regime of el-Sisi does not get under control, no matter how hard it goes against adversaries. The situation has even worsened.
Today, every third party lives below the poverty line in Egypt. Since 2016, the currency has lost more than half its value, the inflation rate is at 10 percent. If you want to buy a bottle of water in the supermarket, you have to decide who it is financed: Nestlé, Coca-Cola or the military. The latter is not only responsible for oppression but also the biggest economic player. The military builds streets, houses, football stadiums, produces food and much more. That was so before el-Sisi. With authoritarian regimes, the Egyptian people have a lot of experience, even the dilemma in the supermarket is an old one. Critical it will always be when large partss of the population have difficulty to afford themselves a bottle of water at all.
Tüv Terminal Checks: BER Chief: No more "Showstoppers" for Capital Airport
Two months have been checked to see if the complex plant braid works in the BER fire protection system. The operators are satisfied with the process. However, the Tüv is not yet finished at the BER.
After large-scale Tüv tests in the terminal of the future capital airport, the operators confirmed the planned opening in October of next year. This was certain, said CEO Rainer Bretschneider after a meeting of the control body.
Airport manager Engelbert Lütke Daldrup spoke of a successful examination, but also said that there were still shortcomings in the terminal. "We have many detailed topics, but we don't have a real showstopper." He assured, the schedule still contained buffers until commissioning.
However, there are indications that the time reserve should not be too large. The construction notice is now to be submitted to the construction office during the first quarter of 2020, which was scheduled for this autumn at the beginning of the year.
Hundreds of power cable deficiencies are still to be solved; the Tüv wants to examine them by February. "To create the conditions for the take-up of the flight operation, it is necessary to continue to work intensively on the processing of the defects," said a written communication.
Lütke Daldrup said that in many cases it is about missing evidence, less about new cables. There is also no release for all the dowels on which the cable routes hang. The airport boss expects this to be available by the end of the year.
In addition, fire protection at the transition to the station under the terminal is not yet satisfactory. The problems had led the project into another crisis three years ago. This time it is about smoke chimneys that run down a fire like a canvas so that the smoke does not spread out. They go down too far. 36 engines therefore have to be replaced. Then there will be new attempts with hot smoke at the beginning of the year.
The opening of the airport has been delayed for years. Originally, it was expected to start operating in 2011. Costs have increased from two billion to approximately 6.5 billion euros since the start of construction in 2006 to the opening of the next year.
Since the number of passengers in Berlin has increased significantly since then, those responsible are planning to expand the airport. That is why a special meeting of the Supervisory Board will be held on October 18, as the chairman of Bretschneider announced.
The airport company is now looking for two new managing directors. Finance manager Heike Fölster changes to Deutsche Bahn at the end of the year, staff manager Manfred Bobke-von Camen will retire next year, as Bretschneider said. He thanked Fölster. She has placed the airport finance on fixed feet.
Chemnitz: Machines for drugs sprung - Police arrests man
He needed money for drugs - and put a lot of vending machines in the Chemnitz area in the air! Now the perpetrator is finally in jail!
Over the past two years, the number of cigarette and parking ticket machines in Chemnitz and the region has increased considerably.
The police took a 33-year-old German after two detonations at the end of May on the Bürgerstraße and on the Further Straße in Chemnitz.
Police spokesperson Andrzej Rydzik: "In the course of investigations due to the production of explosive explosions in action unit with particularly severe case of theft conducted by the Chemnitz Criminal Police, not only this suspicion against the 33-year-old was confirmed."
Faced with the new evidence, 33-year-old Chemnitzer now confesses a total of eight acts.
The police spokesperson: "With the prey he apparently financed his drug dependence." The bomber alone had sprung up parking ticket machines on the Bürgerstraße between August 20, 2018 and May 31, 2019.
The total damage incurred amounts to at least 60 000 euros!
The auto-bomber is now in detention, and police investigations against him are continuing.
It is possible that he was also responsible for further automatizations in Chemnitz and adjacent districts.
AUA takes over Eurowings flights from Vienna
The Lufthansa Group is reshaping its strategy for Vienna airport. In the midst of the price struggle with low-cost flyers such as Lauda, Wizz Air, EasyJet and Level, Lufthansa subsidiary AUA "takes over the commercial control of all Eurowings flights from Vienna", a press spokesperson of the Austrian Airlines confirmed to the APA on Friday. Previously, "AviationNetOnline" had reported on this.
The Vienna base of the Lufthansa airline Eurowings will thus be dissolved de facto. Of the currently seven Eurowings aircraft, four remain in Vienna. From January 2020 onwards, AUA will take over in the "Wetlease", including Eurowings personnel. In Salzburg, three Eurowings jets will be stationed, which will fly from Salzburg and Innsbruck as chartering machines for holidays. Routes from Vienna to Germany will be taken over by Eurowings Germany.
The spokesperson explained that the Eurowings base in Vienna will be integrated into the AUA hub and network planning. Flight times should be adjusted to connecting flights. The aim is to strengthen the Vienna hub and, on the one hand, to expand the decentralised traffic from the federal states.
According to AviationNetOnline, Eurowings in Vienna only serves as a "production company" for the group sister AUA. For example, Barcelona and Rome would be served with AUA flight number, but mainly with Eurowings equipment. Although the board product should be adapted to those of Austrian Airlines, the pilots and flight attendants are from Eurowings. According to the report, the Eurowings flights launched under AUA number are no longer handled in Terminal 1, but like the AUA in Terminal 3.
At Vienna airport, a price battle broke out after the Niki plea. Ryanair subsidiary Laudamotion announced that it would not be until Thursday that the fleet in Vienna would increase to 16 aircraft next summer. The Irish low-cost aircraft will send four Ryanair machines and crews to Vienna, also in the so-called "Wetlease", which the union criticised as a circumvention of the collective contract.
The battle plan of Ryanair Chief Michael O'Leary, that Lauda will have overtaken AUA in five years, replied on Friday, AUA CEO Andreas Otto: "We will remain the number one at the site in five, six or ten years".
Queen Single Princess Beatrice is engaged
Beatrice, Eugenie, William and Harry: As children the cousins were the best friends. Now the last of the four marriages. Beatrice is engaged!
Wonderful news of the British Royals: Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi (34) is said to have stopped around his girlfriend Princess Beatrice (31) in the Italian holidays at the beginning of the month. This was announced by the palace on Thursday.
"We are extremely pleased to announce our engagement. We are both so happy to start this adventure together and can hardly expect to be actually married," said the couple who have been together since October 2018, according to British media reports, in the official announcement.
And further: "We share so many similar interests and values and we know that this will help us in the coming years with love and happiness."
Sister Eugenie cut the pictures
The official engagement photos have taken her sister, Princess Eugenie (29), and have also been published on her Instagram account.
A Royal Festival
The wedding will take place in 2020. More information about date, place and everything else the palace will announce in the coming months.
However, it is certain that the marriage of the number nine of the British succession and the real estate mogul will be a celebration similar to the wedding of Eugenie on October 12, 2018 with Jack Brooksbank (33).
Study on causes of heart disease
Smoking, overweight, unhealthy diet - there are risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. But what really causes a heart failure or an infarction? Hamburg researchers now want to take a close look at the heritage of 9000 healthy and sick people.
Hamburgers and Swiss scientists want to find out more about the causes of cardiovascular diseases through the analysis of the genetic property of 9000 people.
The research project is the largest of these types in the German-speaking region, the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) announced on Friday. The Kühne Foundation supports the project with 12.5 million euros. From Switzerland, the high-mountain clinic Davos, which belongs to the Foundation, and the University Hospital Zurich are involved.
Obesity, smoking and unhealthy nutrition are among the essential risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. Genetic factors determine the risk. However, the interaction between genes and external influences was not sufficiently known. Now, scientists want to compare the complete heritage of 8000 healthy people with that of 1000 former patients of the University heart and vascular centre at UKE.
Currently, more than 4,000 of the approximately 20,000 relevant human genes are known for possible disease-producing changes in DNA - so-called mutations, it was said from the clinic. Each year, about 200 are added.
The aim of the five-year project is to develop new options for the prevention, detection and treatment of heart rhythm disorders, heart failure and heart attack. Data could also be useful in researching other common diseases, says Stefan Blankenberg, head of the University heart and vascular centre. New insights into the interaction between heart and brain, heart and kidney as well as cancer are possible.
The chairman of the Kühne Foundation, Klaus-Michael Kühne (82), also stressed that there is a firm desire to use the data to investigate other diseases as well. So far, the foundation’s clinic in Davos is mainly dealing with allergies. Now a Center for Cardiovascular Precision Medicine is to be established on the medical campus and a professorship for bioinformatics is being created. To justify his commitment, the logistics contractor living in Switzerland said that he had been operated on the open heart three years ago in Hamburg and was very grateful.
The organic samples of the healthy participants are from Hamburgers, who also participate in the "Hamburg City Health Study". With 45,000 subjects, this is the largest local health study in the world according to the Hospital. In the case of genetic property encryption, strict attention is paid to the protection of anonymous data, the scientists assured. It is about a petabyte (1000 terabytes) of data, said Holger Moch of the University Hospital Zurich.
According to UKE, the inheritance property of a human being can be decoded within 24 hours. The cost of this is 1300 euros. The first gene sequencing worldwide, the results of which were published in 2001, has cost several hundred million euros. The study is expected to begin on 1 October, with all 9000 samples being analysed by the end of 2020. In the following year, first results are expected.
Nigerian Police Frees Hundreds of Mistreated Boys
In Nigeria, the police have freed more than 300 tortured and abused boys from a Koran school. According to locals, security forces searched the school in the northern Nigerian city of Kaduna and discovered the partially minor victims, as police spokesperson Yakubu Sabo reported. "The victims were abused. Some of them reported being raped by their teachers," said Sabo.
The boys had been detained under the pretext of being taught in the Qur'an and "improved". In fact, the protectors had been held by their teachers under "the most inhuman and inhuman conditions", said Sabo. About a hundred students, including children at the age of nine, had been chained in a small room.
The Koran School has been in existence for about ten years. Residents would have warned the authorities of repeated irregularities in the institution. Parents would have been shocked when they were informed about the conditions in the Koran School, said Sabo. They would not have suspected of the suffering of their children. The operator and six employees were arrested according to police.
In the predominantly Muslim north of Nigeria, there are many private Koran schools. They replace the often flawed state institutions. People in the region suffer from frequent attacks by armed gangs. According to the UN refugee aid agency, over the past ten months, more than 40,000 people have fled across the border in the neighboring country of Niger.
Chained and Tortured: Nigeria's Police Frees 400 Children From School
Police have freed nearly 400 students in a school in northern Nigeria from horrific conditions. "Many of them were chained and some had visible injuries that indicate torture," said police spokesperson Yakubu Sabo in Kaduna City.
On Thursday, the children had been discovered in an Islamic-shaped school, and the conditions there had been "inhumane" and the officials had arrested the headmaster and six teachers after the liberation action.
The children, all boys, had been kept in their school like slaves and put on chains. Some had been sexually abused. TV pictures showed mellow and injured students in a badly bad health condition.
World football election: Other accusations after Messis and Klopps Kür
Football "Signature invalid"
Jürgen Klopp, Lionel Messi and Megan Rapinoe Awarded
With a gala in Milan, the World Football Association FIFA is the best player, the best player and the best coach of the year. For Lionel Messi, it is the sixth honor and thus record.
After Nicaragua’s captain declared that he had never voted in the World Cup election, accusations came from other countries to the Fifa. Egypt was not even appreciated - with a curious justification.
In recent years, many of the Fifa's plans have proved to be very good: the World Cup awards, dubious plans of its President Gianni Infantino, the general behaviour of various corrupt officials. However, the FIFA World Cup election has not been suspected of being unclean - if one avoids that the national trainers and national team captains of the member associations often vote in sympathy rather than objectively.
However, after Nicaragua’s captain complained that he had not voted at all, further inconsistencies are taking place: Egypt complains that the votes of National Trainer Hossam El-Badry and Captain Mohamed Salah were not taken into account. In fact, they do not appear in the official and publicly available voting overview.
Fifa apologizes to the fact that "the signatures on the election forms were given in capital letters and therefore were not valid". The Egyptian association had been contacted several times to clarify the situation - without reply.
Sudan’s Trainer Also Surprised
There is also an uproar from Sudan regarding the election. While the situation is understandable in the case of Egypt, the Sudanese association states that Trainer Zdravko Lugaric did not vote as it was finally rated: with Lionel Messi in place one, Virgil van Dijk on two and Sadio Mané on three. According to FIFA, however, the vote was just as taken, with signatures and official stamps of the Sudanese Federation.
Nicaragua’s captain Juan Barrera also made allegations: “Did not vote for the #TheBest2019 Awards. All the details about my voice are wrong, thank you,” he wrote. In his case, it was suspected that the Namibian football association simply voted in his name.
The report came from the association on Friday: the vote, but of course there was no intention. The completed election documents were "wrongly" with the name and signature of Juan Barrera, the captain of the Nigerian selection, it was stated in a communication from the association. However, the second captain, Rosa Rosas, had actually chosen. "We take responsibility for the administrative error", it said in the communication. However, both Rosas and team coach Henry Duarte had voted for Messi, "all as it is in the official FIFA list".
The other cases have Fifa examined in an investigation, but emphasizes that the election process was supervised externally by the consulting firm PriceWaterhouseCoopers. As long as Lionel Messi remains first undisputed winner of the world football election - and Jürgen Klopp World Trainer of the year.
Ukraine-Affaire: Ranghohe Republicans advocate official investigation
Two high-ranking Republicans have openly declared themselves in favour of an official investigation against US president and party friend Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important," said the Republican governor of Vermont, Phil Scott. "Where that leads from here is determined by the facts that are determined." He wants to know more about the whistleblower affair before measures are taken. An impeachment procedure can lead to the decommissioning of the president.
Scott said he was not surprised by the revelations, which had shown that Trump had repeatedly asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyj to investigate the activities of the democratic presidential candidate and former vice-president Joe Biden in Ukraine. According to Scott, Trump Biden has has been watching "for years".
The Republicans have so far held back with criticism of Trump because of the Whistleblower affair, but only a few have shown uneasiness. Scott’s statements are now a first sign of this in Trump’s party. The moderate governor of Virginia had already turned to Trump’s policy several times, for example, against the easing of environmental regulations and the strengthening of immigration rules.
As another high-ranking Republican, Charlie Baker, governor of Massachusetts, also spoke out for the investigation. "It is a deeply disturbing situation," said Baker. "The right approach and responsibility for Congress is now to investigate the matter and get to the bottom of it."
Scott and Baker, as governor of the U.S. states, have formally no say in the trial against Trump, which is decided in Congress. Their statements are therefore above all symbolically important. Nevertheless, the first senators of the Republicans also spoke critically about the situation. With Romney, who represents the state of Utah in the second Chamber of Parliament, for example, said that the case is "extremely disturbing, deeply disturbing". US media also report that internal first cracks occurred among the Republicans.
The affair could lead to the initiation of an anti-Trump investigation, and the Democrats in the House of Representatives have announced an investigation to this effect. They accuse him of abuse of power for the purpose of foreign influence for his own political benefit.
There is no precise timetable for the official collection procedure. With its majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could make a so-called impeachment effort. However, the decision on an actual withdrawal of office was made in the Senate, where Trump’s Republicans have the majority. Thus, the prospects for such a procedure’s success are small. So far, no US President has been disarmed by an impeachment procedure of the Office.
Were torturers on board of Rickete's "Sea Watch"?
Three men have been arrested in Sicily, who are said to have raped and murdered in Libyan refugee camps.
The German captain Carola Rackete (31) had been arrested in June after she had illegally controlled the port of Lampedusa with the rescue ship "Sea Watch 3" and 53 Libyan refugees on board. After violent protests and international criticism - also by Austria's Federal President Alexander van der Bellen - her house arrest was lifted after a few days by an Italian judge.
Now, new heavy accusations against rackets will be loud. Thus, three men accused of torture in Libya’s refugee camps could have arrived with the “Sea Watch 3” in Italy. The suspects have been captured in a recording camp in Messina (Sicily) after migrants recognized their punishments in Italy. “We cannot rule out this, but have no secure information on it ourselves,” said “Sea Watch” spokesman Ruben Neugebauer of of the German press agency.
It was said by the police in mid-September that the suspects in the North African country raped, tormented and even murdered. It was Muhammad C. (27) from Guinea, and the two Egyptians Hameda A. (26) and Mahmoud A (24). "The migrants were systematically harassed and subjected to atrocities - by repeated and constant physical violence," said the announcement at that time.
NGOs and aid organizations now point out that they cannot know exactly who is coming on the ships. "We cannot scan who the people are. They are coming without passports," said Neugebauer. Torture is one of the main reasons why people flee Libya. Therefore, it is likely that perpetrators are also on the ships. "It is therefore very important that they follow it."
Italy's right-wing ex-minister Matteo Salvini called for an excuse from Rackete, who is still being determined in Italy for aid to illegal immigration.
Musk aims at delivery record at Tesla
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has given a strong boost to his electric car group with the prospect of new record numbers on the stock exchange.
"We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 extras," Musk wrote in an email to Tesla employees published by the branch blog "Electrek".
The demand was strong, so that Tesla could book 110,000 orders, it continued in Musk’s newsletter. The challenge was to quickly bring the cars to the customers. Tesla had to offer as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked this: Teslas shares went out of business with an increase of more than six percent. For almost four months, the price has stopped increasing. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered well over 95,000 cars and thus achieved its previous best value.
Musk needs records to achieve its high targets. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars. This requires six-digit figures in the current and upcoming quarter. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there were last losses.
U.S. budget dispute: Once again only one bridge financing
The new financial year will begin in the United States on 1 October without a proper budget. The Senate followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and decided to grant transitional funding until 21 November.
Although the US Congress and President Donald Trump agreed in August to increase the spending ceilings for the financial years 2020 and 2021, the United States will once again be standing before the new fiscal year beginning on 1 October without spending plans. The Senate followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and decided on a transitional financing (continuing resolution, CR) until 21 November. Without such a decision, it would have come to a shutdown on Monday at midnight, a partial conclusion of the Federal Administration. President Trump has yet to put the decision into effect.
Shutdown averted
For the time being, the Federal Administration will now be financed at the level and in accordance with the priorities of the expenditure plans for the financial year 2019 ending on Monday. This is because the Congress has not agreed on the 12 spending laws which allocate the funds to the various departments and authorities in good time. Therefore, the Federal Administration cannot benefit from the expenditure framework extended for the new financial year from $1.3 bio. to $1.4 bio.
The Democrats have completed ten of the twelve laws in the House of Representatives, where they have the majority, but the spending laws reflect the priorities of the Democrats, who have little chance in the Senate dominated by the Republicans. Conversely, the Senate has also prepared more or less ten of the twelve spending plans, which are hardly majority.
In the Senate, Republicans apparently try to force $12 billion for the building of walls, one of the major priorities of President Trump. The Democrats are disrupting the mural plans and financing them, which is actually intended for other military buildings and projects. The struggle over mural construction was already escalated in December 2018 and led to a 35-day shut-down.
The spirits separate from the building of the wall
It is currently unclear how the parties want to get closer to this issue. More likely than an agreement on all twelve spending laws in the next seven weeks is an extension of transitional financing beyond 21 November. Also a shutdown is not excluded.
Against the background of the persistent inability of Congress to agree on the twelve spending laws in good time, and the associated risk of a shut-down gain ideas to automate the process in popularity. Submission S. 1877 to avoid shut-downs would automatically continue to finance the federal administration at the previous year's level, suppress the travel activity of parliamentarians and keep their wages back until the new annual spending plans are available.
France allows artificial fertilization for lesbians and singles
In France, artificial fertilization will be open to women and lesbians living alone in the future: the Paris National Assembly voted by a large majority in favour of a government bill that allows all women to benefit from in vitro fertilization, thus significantly increasing the demand for anonymous seed donation.
The presentation still needs the consent of the Senate. In the three-day emotional debate, critics in the right camp had warned that many "children without father" could grow up in the future. The French Bishops' Conference is also against the innovation.
The new regulation is the core component of a bioethics law that the health minister Agnès Buzyn defended as "opportunity" for society. It depicts the modern family in which there are children with only one parent or with homosexual parents. According to her idea, the costs of artificial fertilization for all women are to be borne by social security.
Fertilization with sperm of dead husband
By a small majority, however, the National Assembly rejected an amendment that would allow widows to access the sperm of their dead husband for artificial fertilization. In Belgium, Spain and Great Britain, artificial fertilization is allowed "post-mortem". In Germany, in the past, there were cases in which women complained in vain about the release of the sperm of a deceased person. The opponents of the advance in Paris argued, such a child then bore a "specially serious fate".
On the other hand, many representatives of the Government Party of La République en Marche (The Republic on the Move, LREM) of President Emmanuel Macron and members of the opposition had expressed their support for the artificial fertilization with the sperm of the deceased partner. They stressed that a widow would have a "double sorrow" imposed if the death of her husband left her child's desire unfulfilled.
The initiators of the amendment that has now failed feel that it is unfair for a widow to be able to fertilize with the sperm of an unknown person in the future, but not with her own partner.
So far, artificial fertilization in France is allowed only heterosexual couples who cannot bear children. They must be married or live together for at least two years. Buzyn had already announced in the summer that the glue motherhood would continue to remain prohibited.
In Germany, artificial fertilization is theoretically open to all women - it is often difficult for single or lesbian couples.
Climate compensation: calls for air pollution for unis are becoming louder
A lot is being flown at universities, so in the future, the country wants to release a climate tax, and the rectors say they don't have any money for it. But now they are under pressure internally.
The universities should also limit themselves when flying. Photo: dpa/Julian Stratenschulte
The discussion of climate taxes on flights from universities and universities, which was delayed before the summer break, is back in swing. After the national rector conference had responded sceptically to a similar advance from the green-black coalition, the plans now receive support from the universities. In a joint statement the doctoral students from six universities of Baden-Württemberg and a university of education for compensation of service flights argue that this is "seriously necessary", at the same time there must be a wide debate on the avoidance of flights, it says in their opinion. The Cabinet decision, originally planned in July, is now still on the ice, because the CDU has still not approved the presentation of the Greens.
Russia again arrests North Korean fishermen
According to the FSB intelligence service, the prisoners were said to have fished illegally in Russian waters. Ten days earlier, 161 fishermen from North Korea had already been arrested. At that time, there was a fire change between the border guards and the boat crew. Three Russians and a North Korean were injured, the fisherman later suffered his serious injuries. This time, however, there were no injured persons, it was said.
The communist North Korea suffers from chronic food shortages, so the North Korean fishermen were on their way to Russian territorial waters, where the Russian Coast Guard operates patrols to protect its marine biological resources.
30,000 squid seized
During the re-checks 30,000 squid were discovered and confiscated on the boats. In addition, three fishing boats and two motor boats were confiscated and taken to Nachodka and Posjet at Vladivostok.
Russia’s fishing authorities had not issued any fishing licences to North Koreans this year even after complaints by local entrepreneurs. According to the media, thousands of fishermen from North Korea have already been arrested there this year.
The head of the association of Russian fishing companies in the Far East region of Primorje, Georgi Martynow, recently complained of high environmental damage by North Korean fishermen. They fished with tight synthetic nets banned in Russia. These would also bring small creatures out of the sea. In addition, the nets would simply be disposed of in the sea where they needed 200 years to be decomposed.
Only 18,000 will be left in the future: USA will lower asylum upper limit
The "most generous nation in history": Donald Trump, here at a meeting with elected police representatives in the White House.
The richest country in the world is turning a blind eye to those seeking protection: As the Washington Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirms, the ceiling for the legal immigration of refugees will be further reduced. In the future, above all, threatened believers and Iraqi asylum will be preserved.
The US government intends to lower the already historically low border for the reception of new refugees once again. In the 2020 marketing year, which runs in the United States from October 2019 to September 2020, a maximum of 18,000 people are to be allowed to enter the country, as the U.S. Foreign Ministry stated. In the now almost expired marketing year, the limit is still at 30,000 people.
The government of President Donald Trump has drastically lowered the willingness to welcome protection seekers from all over the world in recent years. Under Barack Obama’s predecessor government, much higher entrance limits had been applied.
The adjusted ceiling of 18,000 refugees would be the lowest since the introduction of the U.S. refugee programme in 1980. However, the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs called the "most merciful and generous nation in history", a formulation that strongly reminds us of the language use of the US President-in-Office.
A "responsible handling" of refugees aims to enable refugees to return to their homelands to help them rebuild, Trump explained. For his hard course in migration policy, he gets a lot of support from followers, but there is also massive criticism.
A major issue is the border with Mexico, which Trump wants to lock down. In order to finance the construction of a border wall, Trump had imposed the national emergency. Whether there is a temporal link between the current measure and current domestic developments in the U.S. capital, Trump is unclear. Trump is currently under pressure because of the Selenskyj affair and a possible threat of official withdrawal.
The U.S. government intends to focus, as represented by the U.S. Foreign Office, on the reception of two refugee groups: people persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the US military in the country and who are thus at risk, as the statement of the Foreign Ministry states. However, a maximum of 1500 refugees are to be taken up from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador.
The US wants people from this "northly triangle" of Central America to apply for asylum in other countries in particular. Against this background, the United States only concluded with Guatemala and now also with El Salvador and Honduras migration agreements to limit immigration on the US South border to Mexico.
Court orders release of Orang-Utan from zoo
An Orang-Utan female has been transferred to a shelter station for apes in the United States at the request of the Argentine justice from the former zoo of Buenos Aires. The "Sandra" born in the Rostock Zoo in 1986 was granted the rights of a "non-human person", therefore its release is mandatory. The animal was taken to Dallas on Thursday evening by direct flight - but not as a passenger, but in the cargo room, as lawyer Andrés Gil Domínguez explained.
Since the 53 kilograms of human apex are unable to adapt to life in the wilderness, it will live in the open air of the Center for Great Apes in Florida. There are already 21 more orangutans and 31 chimpanzees, among them "bubbles", formerly pet of Popstar Michael Jackson. Before moving into Florida, however, "Sandra" has to survive a approximately 40-day quarantine at Sedgwick County Zoo in Wichita in the U.S. state of Kansas.
After her birth in Rostock, "Sandra" spent several years in the former Ruhr-Zoo in Gelsenkirchen, before being transferred to Buenos Aires in 1995. The 2014 process of "Sandras" fundamental rights has contributed to the conversion of the zoo from Buenos Aires into an eco-park. By 2023, a research and education facility is to be created there to obtain biodiversity.
Record for Swiss extreme climbers: 550 meters in 46 minutes
The extreme climber Dani Arnold has succeeded in a new Husaren ride on the big tin in the Italian Alps, which is almost 3,000 metres high.
Without net, double ground or other tools, the Swiss forced the 550-metre-high northern wall of the Great Tin in a new record time.
Dressed with jeans, T-shirt and only supported by absolute dizziness, Arnold needed 46 minutes and 30 seconds for the ascent. He therefore undercut the old best brand by almost 19 minutes.
Arnold is now record holder in Free Solo Speed on four of the six most important European North Faces.
Nike benefits from new online marketing strategy
The US sports product manufacturer Nike recorded a significant increase in profit despite the trade conflict with China. Net profit increased to 1.4 billion dollars in the last quarter (just under 1.3 billion euros), which is 25 percent more than in the previous year, as reported by the Group on Tuesday. This is mainly due to the new marketing strategy "Nike Direct", with which the Adidas competitor addresses its customers directly online.
Sales increased to 10.7 billion dollars in the three-month period by the end of August. The most powerful increase in the Nike sales figures was 22 percent in China. This led the Group from Beaverton in the U.S. state of Oregon to benefit from its approach to direct consumers via the Internet or smartphone apps in the People’s Republic of China.
Financial Manager Andy Campion announced that with strategic investments, Nike would continue to drive the "digital transformation" of the sports product manufacturer and thus increase its competitive advantage. Investors were pleased to respond to quarterly figures - the shares of the sports product manufacturer increased by more than five percent.
Lifelong Stadium Ban for Racism in Italy
Because of racist comments on football pro Juan Jesus of AS Rome, the club from the Italian capital has imposed a lifelong ban on a fan. The Brazilian defender Jesus had been reproached by the fan on Instagram. Jesus then published the private news and asked his club to take action. "@officialasroma You already know what to do with such a fan. #NoToRacism. Pride on being who I am," wrote the 28-year-old who has been playing at AS Rome since 2016.
The club responded on the late Thursday. He had registered the account of the fan with Instagram and the police. Moreover, the Roma supporters should never visit a game of the club again, wrote the club on Twitter.
Racism is a problem in Italian football. Italian fans regularly scan racist insults against black players of rival teams. "We cannot have racism in society or in sport. In Italy the situation has not improved, and this is very serious. One has to identify the responsible ones and throw them out of the stadiums," said FIFA President Gianni Infantino on the weekend. The occasion for the statement were racist songs at the First League between Atalanta Bergamo and the AC Florence last Sunday.
But there were also discussions about the followers of Juventus Turin. The Italian authorities now have 38 ransacked fans of record champion Juventus Turin with stadium bans. Four of them should not enter the stadium for a period of ten years, the police told us. Therefore, the bans of four to seven years apply.
The fans are associated with ongoing investigations against twelve leaders of ultra-fan groups in the Juventus area. Among other things, the twelve are accused of severe extortion, money laundering and private violence. The club had launched the investigations with an announcement last year.
According to Italian media reports, the ultra leaders are supposed to be behind the black-and-white trade in tickets. They would have "militaryly controlled" the ticket trade for the fan curve and should have extorted Juventus employees to get more cheap cards.
Generation Z: Are they really different from Generation Y?
Millennials are narcissistic, the generation Z is political - entire years are thought of with gripping names. If you look more closely, the awards are full of contradictions. So how well do these labels describe the sense of life of young people?
"The crabs are coming!" On September 21, this call officially launched the crab catch at Lake Gucheng in Gaochun, which also opened the opening event of the 19th China Gaochun Gucheng Lake Crab Festival, as announced by the Department for Public Relations of the Nanjing-Gaochun District Committee.
Gaochun, which forms the southern foothills of Nanjing in Jiangsu Province, is one of the national environmental zones. The city is the first international "Slow City" in China and here is also the Chinese seat of the international "Slow City" movement. The city has ecologically ideal conditions with a mixture of "30 percent mountains, 20 percent water surfaces and 50 percent fields". The great natural environment of Gaochun offers its inhabitants all the conditions to get rich.
As early as the early 1990s, the people of Gaochun started to grow crabs. Over time, the crabs industry has become a significant industry which has generated high incomes and has become an important part of Gaochun’s economic development. Over the past few years, Gaochun has actively developed a large, ecological and scientific development of crabs and a technology-based crabs. And the city has taken care of the promotion of more efficiency in agriculture and the income of farmers.
In recent years, Gaochun has launched a reform on the distribution of power, optimization of administration and government services, and with care has established the service network for "authorisations under one roof, a team for law enforcement, a network of services, a platform for lending", thus fully optimising the environment for permits, services and development.
Gaochun takes full advantage of the local advantages of connecting to southern Jiangsu and southern Anhui and uses the development zone and its position as an international "Slow City" as a signpost for smart high-end production companies, biomedical and medical technology companies, energy storage and environmental protection, the cultural and health sectors, as well as farms for organic agriculture, which are in the "3+2" sector, here. At the same time, Gaochun has promoted the development of a national tourist zone and tourist resorts of national importance, including the ecological and cultural resources of the Gaochun landscape, the state of civil services and public services, the "Tourism +" and "+ tourism" areas, and the development of cultural tourism to a high quality level. It is worth looking forward to the future of Gaochun.
Conflict between Iran and USA: Ruhani speaks of the end of sanctions - Trump contradicts
After his return from the UN General Assembly, Iranian President Hassan Ruhani spoke of a alleged offer from the United States to abolish sanctions. In return for talks with the Teheran leadership, the United States would have put an end to all sanctions, said Ruhani on its official website.
However, US President Donald Trump contradicted the Iranian counterpart on Twitter: " Iran wanted me to lift the sanctions imposed on him so that there would be a meeting. I said, of course, no."
Ruhani describes the events as follows: Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron were present in New York and had insisted that a meeting would take place. "And America says I'm lifting the sanctions," Ruhani added. The type of sanctions that should be terminated has stood for the debate. "And they have clearly said that we are abolishing all sanctions."
However, Ruhani did not criticise this advance in an acceptable way. Given the current sanctions and "the poisoned atmosphere of the maximum pressure", no one could predict the outcome of negotiations.
At the beginning of the week, Chancellor Angela Merkel met Ruhani in New York. Background was the hope of Europeans to save the nuclear agreement with Iran negotiated with Russia and China, which is intended to prevent the Islamic Republic from developing nuclear weapons. Like Merkel, France’s President Emmanuel Macron had expressed the hope that Ruhani will meet US President Donald Trump.
Heavy earthquake near Istanbul - almost 200 aftershocks
After Western Turkey was shaken by two earthquakes within a short period of time, the fear of a disaster grows. 34 people were injured during the earthquake on Tuesday. Since the earthquake on the previous day, there have been almost 200 aftershocks, said Turkish Vice President Fuat Octay on Friday. Thus, the concern of a disaster grows.
14 schools in Istanbul had been closed for security reasons. Hundreds of buildings have been damaged, and the 5-8 strength earthquake had shaken the Marmara region in front of Istanbul on Thursday and caused panic in the million metropolis. Now the government wants to set up a Commission to better prepare the country for earthquakes, Octay announced.
In the last 20 years, Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for earthquakes, said Istanbul’s mayor Ekrem Imamoglu. In the city itself, the latent danger is ignored again and again. Each year, badly built residential houses are falling down, including the many smaller earthquakes that shake Istanbul regularly.
For years, city planners such as the well-known architect Mücella Yapici have warned that large open spaces registered in the centre as refuges have long been built up. Only on the 20th anniversary of the Gölcük bee in August had the building engineering chamber of Istanbul warned that an estimated one million buildings in Istanbul were not earthquake-proof.
The earthquake epicentre of Thursday was located in the Marmara Sea in front of the district of Silivri and at a depth of about seven kilometres, as the Afad Civil Protection Agency reported. A smaller aftershock caused even greater panic on the streets a few minutes later.
Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu informed on Twitter that injury or damage had not been reported at first. State station TRT showed people who ran panicking out of the houses. Students were brought out of the buildings in the district of Silivri for security reasons. Some students cried, as seen in pictures.
Istanbul is considered to be particularly risky of earthquake. Below the Marmara Sea lies a section of the so-called North Anatolian disorder, which marks the border between the Eurasian and Anatolian plates. Turkey is repeatedly shaken by earthquakes. One of the most deadly was the earthquake in 1999 near Istanbul. At that time more than 17,000 people died.
Researchers fear that an earthquake of strength 7.1 to 7.4 might threaten. But when the earthquake comes, it is unclear. During the earthquake on Thursday it already hit the west of the country and Istanbul again.
Companies design emergency plans, private people have so-called go-bags ready to stand by doorsteps with all the necessary needs, and schools teach children how to behave when the earth is waving. When the next big earthquake comes, be unclear.
After his return from New York, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said that eight people had been injured. Some buildings had suffered minor damage. Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu was following developments at the Istanbul Disaster Coordination Center (Akom), which reported that two Mosque minarettes in the districts of Avcilar and Sariyer collapsed.
Warning of aftershocks in Istanbul
In the social networks, many users report panic. Buildings waved. Schools and hospitals were evacuated. Telephone lines had been interrupted. It was stronger than Tuesday, writes a user. The head of the Turkish Red Hemisphere, Kerem Klinik, warned about aftershocks via Twitter. He called on people to stay away from buildings that had suffered visible damage.
According to CNN Turkey, the time of the earthquake is stated to be 13.59 (local time). According to CNN Turkey, only a few minutes after the first earthquake, there was a postquake, which was indicated with a strength of 4.0 on the Richter scale.
Only on Tuesday had an earthquake of strength 4.6 shaken the Turkish Marmara region - it was to be felt until Istanbul. Its epicenter had also located in the Marmara Sea west of the million metropolis, the Afad Civil Protection Authority announced on Tuesday already.
It was not the only earthquake that caused headlines on Tuesday: Pakistan too was hit by a severe earthquake.
Researchers assume that sooner or later a catastrophic earthquake could occur in Istanbul - the tension between the tectonic plates is extremely high. Scientists believe that it will eventually discharge itself - and cause massive damage.
Earthquake researcher Sükrü Ersoy expects the earthquake to be a warning now. This would have made it more likely, he said to CNN Türk. "These could be the signs of a larger earthquake," said Ersoy to the transmitter. "Before or later, the great earthquake will come."
Just a few weeks ago, there had been an incident - the earthquake also caused great concern in Istanbul. In Albania, there had been a violent earthquake only a few days ago - there were 68 injured. Also on Lake Constance, this year the earth had trembled.
Parliament: New ignition in Ukraine affair
Two brilliant documents provide for new ignition in the Ukraine affair for possible abuse of power by US President Donald Trump. On the way to a possible withdrawal of office, the U.S. Democrats see themselves reinforced: the complaint about Trump and his controversial phone call with the Ukrainian president mountains, submitted by an anonymous notifier, are important points for investigation against the President. Trump himself once again sees himself as the victim of a "witch hunt". He also doubted the credibility of the whistleblower.
USA: Passenger of United Airlines locked in toilet - Flyer redirected
Since a passenger was locked in the board toilet, a United Airlines flight has been diverted. The toilet door had been blocked during the flight from Washington to San Francisco in 1554, the airline reported according to US media.
At an extra-planned port of call on Wednesday evening (local time) in Denver, the woman was finally able to be freed from the narrow cabin. About an hour had she been locked in it, wrote US media calling on other passengers. For the next flight to San Francisco, passengers had to change the machine.
In a video spread on the Internet, which is supposed to come from Flight 1554, several people are trying to free the woman. "We are currently working to open the door, Ma'am. We'll get you out soon, okay?" says a man in it. The airline apologized to all passengers. Open was first of all whether the woman received compensation.
The Cakerlake: Inspired by Kafka: Ian McEwan writes Brexit-Roman
How does a writer like Ian McEwan deal with the whole Brexit chaos? He writes a book about it - and his protagonist is unmistakable.
Inspired by Franz Kafka's famous story "The Transformation", British success author Ian McEwan (71) wrote a book on the Brexit Chaos in Great Britain.
The novel "Die Kakerlake" (Original: "The Cockroach") will be published in German on November 27th, the Diogenes Verlag (Zurich) announced. This is about the transformation of a man named "Jim Sams", who was ignored or hated in his former life, but is now once the most powerful man in the United Kingdom. He sees it as his mission to implement the will of the people into action and is determined to let nothing stop him or anyone.
McEwan was quoted with the words: "If Parliament is closed so that the government cannot be challenged at a critical moment when ministers lie shamelessly like the Soviet leaders once when Brexiters in high positions beg for the disaster of a no-deal - then a writer has to ask himself what he can do. There is only one answer to it: write". McEwan only appeared in the spring of the novel "machines like me" about artificial intelligence.
Kafka's first published story in 1915 is about Gregor Samsa, who wakes up one morning and sees himself "turned into an immense monster", is gradually excluded from family and society, and eventually perishes. "Ian McEwan bows down to Kafka to describe a world that stands the head," said the Diogeness Verlag.
EU invests 9.5 million euros in Austria's rail infrastructure
11.200 Wagons in Austria and Hungary get whisper brakes to reduce the noise from freight trains. In addition, sections of the railway connections between Graz and Györ and Wiener Neustadt and Sopron are modernised and electrified.
According to the EU authorities, this should make travel more comfortable and reduce CO2 emissions. The funds come from the EU infrastructure pot "Connecting Europe Facility".
Thomas Cook: All travels cancelled until 31 October
The German tour operator Thomas Cook cancelled all travels by 31 October 2019 one day after his insolvency claim. Travels could not be made "for insolvency reasons," the company announced on Thursday evening.
This also affected bookings of the brands Thomas Cook Signature, Thomas Cook Signature Finest Selection, Neckermann Travels, ÖGER TOURS, Bucher Travels and Air Marin, which are already paid or paid in full. As it stands to travel with start from 1 November 2019, the company left open. In agreement with insolvency insurance the further procedure was examined, it was said.
Thomas Cook in Germany had joined the sock of the British parent company and had made insolvency claims on Wednesday. The company, which includes Neckermann Travel, Öger Tours and Bucher Travel, employs about 2000 people in Germany.
Insurer wants to transfer money to hotels from now on
On the other hand, from this Friday, hotels abroad, which currently still have Thomas-Cook holidaymakers, will receive money from Zurich insurance. According to Zurich, the payments to the hotels are subject to the condition that holidaymakers are no longer asked for extra payments.
Based on the booking information and without the presentation of separate invoices, the hotels in the resorts are now expected to receive 50 percent of outstanding payments, as a Zurich spokesman of the German Press Agency said. "This applies immediately and on condition that Thomas-Cook travellers from these hotels are not immediately asked for individual payment of hotel bills or otherwise required," continued Spokesman Bernd Engelien.
As a result, insurance responded to reports from hotel guests who had been forced to pay their own accommodation on-site. Some had to put more than 1000 euros on the table. The German Travel Association (DRV) and the German Federation of Consumer Centres had severely criticized this.
As many hotels are affected, the insurance spokesman agreed with the insolvent travel provider on Friday. According to information from Thursday still 70,000 Thomas-Cook-Pauschal holidaymakers were on their way from Germany. Zurich Germany has secured the vacation and return journey of Thomas-Cook customers.
Insolvency managers want to try to continue the three Thomas-Cook societies in Germany and find a solution for the future.
However, the now announced payments to hotels by Zurich Insurance only help those travellers who are still on the move. Thomas-Cook customers who want to fly on holiday only look bad. On the late Thursday evening, the company announced that all travels would be cancelled by 31 October. This also applies to such bookings that have already been paid.
The company left open the way to travel on start from 1 November 2019. In agreement with insolvency insurance, the further procedure was examined. In principle, insurance Zurich is also responsible for these cases. The sale of new travel has stopped. dpa
The company refers to the insurer Zurich, who can be represented by the company Kaera. Customers can find out on the Kaera website about possibilities to refund the travel price and claim their claims via a web form.
Prince Harry destroyed explosive mine in Angola
Prince Harry has long continued the commitment of Lady Diana. In Africa he is now walking directly on the tracks of his mother.
Dressed with a blue splinter vest, British Prince Harry in Angola set fire and destroyed an explosive mine.
Near a camp of the British Halo Trust at the place of Dirico, he produced the ignition circle on Friday morning in front of ongoing TV cameras. At a safe distance the body exploded in the savanna landscape without damaging. Although the Halo Trust alone destroyed more than 100,000 relics of the decades-long bloody conflict in the African country, there are still more than 1,000 minefields that threaten the population.
On the fifth day of his African journey, Harry then wanted to walk in the city of Huambo directly on the tracks of his mother Diana (1961-1997). With the same master of explosives, who once accompanied his mother, he wanted to go the way she went at the time. The pictures on which Princess Diana went through a cleared minefield in 1997 had gone around the world. She had also demonstrated support for the Halo Trust.
Harry (35) and his wife Meghan (38) have been on a ten-day African trip since Monday, which started in the South African tourist metropolis Cape Town.
Ongoing Brexit Negotiations: The Risk of a No Deal remains acute
In fact, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had clearly stated that there will be no third postponement of the Brexit negotiations. But what statements have been made by the polarizing British for a long time. The latest judgment of the Supreme Court in Great Britain is floating like a Damoclese sword over the blondhead. His suspension of the Parliament to hold its Brexit course until the date of departure was annulled at the beginning of this week, and a law passed by Parliament obliges Johnson to extend bilateral talks by 31 October in the event of failed negotiations with the EU. However, Johnson had categorically ruled out this.
Boris Johnson thinks deal is possible
However, the pressure does not seem to pass by Johnson. In the meantime, when visiting a hospital, he made allegations that, in the event of a failure, he would support an extension of the negotiations by the end of October:
You know, we're going to comply with the law.
At the same time, however, we are confident that we will leave the EU by October 31st.
And best of all with a deal. I’m cautiously optimistic that this works.
And time is running away from the Brexit negotiators in Brussels. The EU and the British negotiators still have time to prevent Britain’s exit from the European Union without agreements. However, the recent talks have not reached a breakthrough again. An agreement until the end of October seems more difficult to imagine. If the British Prime Minister does not break the law, a further postponement of the exit date is in force. However, the opposition does not trust the Prime Minister’s words. She fears that Johnson could somehow enforce Brexit in the event of a no-deal.
US authorities: Other deaths from e-cigarettes
The number of deaths related to the use of e-cigarettes in the US has increased to twelve. In addition, there have been 805 confirmed and likely injuries in this context, the U.S. Health Authority reported CDC. According to a study in the "New England Journal of Medicine", there have already been more than 900 affected, about 500 of them confirmed. The cause of lung damage is still completely unclear. In Europe no similar increase in lung damage is known. Complaints seem to be limited to users in the US.
Fear of New Protests Growing in Egypt
Millions of times the videos of Muhammad Ali were shared in online networks. The construction contractor and actor living in Spain demands a "people revolution" in this area. For this Friday, he called for further protests against President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and the Egyptian military, which critics blame for corruption and mismanagement. Ali hopes for mass demonstrations with a million participants in central places in the country.
The security authorities have been alerted. In the centre of Cairo, there has already been an increased police presence. Several subway stations have remained closed, streets around the central central square have been blocked. In recent days, the police have strengthened their street controls and mobile phones of pedestrians have been searching partly for news and photos related to the protests.
On September 20, the demonstrators gathered around the Tahrir Square.
Last weekend there were protests with hundreds of participants in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura. There had been no such open protests in Egypt for years. The security forces responded accordingly. According to the human rights organization Human Rights Watch (HRW) almost 2,000 people have been arrested since last week. Many of them had been arrested arbitrarily - only because they were "at the wrong place at the wrong time", HRW informed arresters under appeal to lawyers.
The organization also criticized censorship in the North African country. According to this, the government in Cairo blocks websites and online services to stop further protests against al-Sisi. The General has ruled the country since 2013 after he had overthrown the democratically elected Islamic President Mohammed Mursi. Thousands of Islamists, government opponents, bloggers and activists have been imprisoned and partially sentenced in recent years.
"Ocean Change": Arved Fox of Greenland Expedition Back
The polar researcher Arved Fuchs returned from his Greenland expedition on Friday. On his arrival at the port of Hamburg, he was welcomed by the skipper Boris Herrmann, who had brought climate activist Greta Thunberg across the Atlantic with the race yacht "Malizia".
With a team of scientists, Fuchs had studied and documented on his sailing ship "Dagmar Aaen" on the coasts of Iceland and Greenland's consequences of global warming in recent months.
The Fridays for Future movement was a blessing, said the polar researcher. For years he had waited for the young generation to speak. One knows for decades that the Earth is warming. Nevertheless, many acted as if there were a planet B.
"What happens on the sea often takes place under public exclusion," said Fuchs. He and his team wanted to inform people about the effects of global warming and the pollution of the seas. Among other things, the expedition was measured with a drone of Greenlandic glacier ice and fished with nets for microplastics, it was said.
The polar researcher from Bad Bramstedt was awarded the "Seadevcon Maritime Award" for his "Fight for a Sustainable and Respectful Use of the World Seas" during the Hamburg Climate Week. "Arved Fuchs is a great example for all of us who love the survival of the oceans," said skipper Boris Herrmann at the award ceremony. "He is a witness to the changes that have taken place in the Arctic in recent decades."
Expensive spaghetti in Rome: Tourists paid 430 Euro for noodles
430 euros for two plates of spaghetti with fish in a simple restaurant near the Engelsburg in Rome: that seemed to be two Japanese tourists too much. The bill with 80 euros tip was paid by the two women, but they posted the receipt on Facebook, which triggered hot reactions.
"Such cases harm Rome's reputation. We call on the police to investigate the question of whether this is a fraud," demanded a spokesperson of Federagit, the Association of travel guides in Rome, according to the Roman daily Il Messaggero (Friday Edition).
The Japanese women had ordered not only spaghetti, but also fresh fish, the owner of the restaurant was justified. However, this cannot be taken from the invoice. Also a tip of up to 20 percent of the invoice is normal, said the host.
A call in Ukraine, and everything's broken? US President Donald Trump, after the turbulent revelations of the past days, could actually be confronted with an official withdrawal process, the Democrats want to examine this as soon as possible with their investigation in the House of Representatives - the speech is from weeks until a decision is made.
At the beginning of the scandal is said to be the phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyj. The accusation of the Whistleblower, who finally brought the conversation about the national security and democracy of the United States to the public with his complaint, ismonstrous: The President had abused the power of his office to instrumentalize the government of another country for an influence on the election of 2020. He had blackmailed Ukraine’s dependence and thus wanted to force them to become active against a political opponent.
The core of this project is also to be understood in the recently published article of the conversation with Selenskyj, although it does not reflect the full text. However, the phone call of July 25 is only an episode of a much larger story, in whose center next to Trump stands primarily his personal lawyer: Rudy Giuliani.
From the public's point of view in May 2019, the New York Times of Rudy Giuliani's travel plans to Ukraine began. He wants to meet in Kiev with President Selenskyj, and the lawyer himself knows very well that his intentions are delicate. "We don't interfere in a choice, we're interfering in an investigation of what we have the right to do," he says to the newspaper. One might think that it is inappropriate, but "nothing is illegal." Giuliani wants investigations in Ukraine to be followed, for which there is hardly any basis - "because this information will be very, very helpful for my clients and could prove helpful to my government."
The lawyer and former mayor of New York seems to have been infected with right conspiracy fantasies fixed on Trump's opponent at the 2016 election: Hillary Clinton had condensed with actors in Ukraine, said critics at the time to construct an occasion for the Russian investigation in the US. However, this accusation was never to be taken seriously.
The question is precisely what Trump will talk about on the phone with Selenskyj in July. The version of Giulian and the President reads: The former Vice-President and currently prospective candidate for the presidential candidate of the Democrats, Joe Biden, as Ukraine's representative of the Obama government, has urged the dismissal of the then Ukrainian state attorney-general, Victor Schokin, to stop the investigation of the gas company he was responsible for, in which his son Hunter Biden was active. Biden senior financially extorted Ukraine to cover up his family's corrupt powers.
In fact, the process was somewhat different. When Joe Biden demanded that the Ukrainian general state attorney should go, the investigations against the gas company had already been completed, Hunter Biden was never directly affected by it. Schokin himself was also accused of being deeply corrupt, the U.S. government was not the only Western partner to push for his release. Moreover, the Obama government even explicitly supported the investigations against the company.
Disorders at Instagram Facebook and Whatsapp: Social media are down
Users worldwide report massive disturbances on Instagram and Facebook. According to this, Germany, the United Kingdom and Spain are particularly affected. On the website allegründen.de, users report that Facebook has not loaded again and again since about 15.30 o’clock. Instagram also reports the error message that content could not be loaded. Also, Whatsapp seems to be affected by the disorder, although not to the extent so far.
Instagram and Co. frequently affected by disorders
It is not the first massive crash this year. Already in March and July the services had failed for several hours. And as in previous cases, users use Twitter especially this time to make their anger air.
Polish Scientists Saved in Antarctica
Three Polish scientists have been rescued from the Chilean Air Force from Antarctica’s ice cream. They were on their way with a hose boat and several miles away from their base when their engine failed. They had luck in luck - less than an hour needed the Chilean rescue helicopter for the recovery.
Eduardo Mosquera, commander of the 4th Chilean Air Brigade:
"At 9:30 we received the message, shortly before ten we started, and good 20 minutes later we were above the hose boat".
Poland has been operating the Henryk Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station on King George Island since 1977, 19 scientists are working there. The frozen researchers have certainly been brought back to their research station.
Warning: Smartphone DO NOT charge wirelessly
Practical but harmful
Although inductive technology via Qi-standard is extremely practical, it should still not be used.
Since several new smartphones have recently come on the market, which support wireless charging and sell themselves very well - first of all the new iPhone-11 models, we would like to recall a study from the beginning of July. The wireless charging of mobile devices is extremely practical, but not necessarily recommended.
Higher temperature increases battery
Researchers warn against the wireless charging of smartphones. According to the findings of the University of Warwick, this is extremely harmful for the devices. This is due to the significantly larger heat development. If you charge a mobile phone normally by cable, the battery heats up within three hours to 27 degrees. In case of wireless charging, the researchers have always measured over 30 degrees even when the smartphone is perfectly aligned on the charging pad. If the mobile phone is slightly next to the coil, the temperature increases even higher. In addition, the watt strength of the charging pad increases, which in turn drives the power consumption up.
Capacity and lifetime
According to the researchers, the temperature for the durability of batteries is a crucial factor. Every single degree plays a role. When charging at higher temperatures, the battery not only reduces its capacity, but also does not last as long as it lasts. Thus, the lifetime is less. Therefore, the researchers recommend that the smartphone be charged by cable. Since a battery exchange is always associated with high costs in modern smartphones, this should be a helpful tip. Apple has at last increased the cost of a battery exchange even once again - for all iPhones.
Practical
The technology is extremely convenient: simply put the device on a suitable charging pad - these have already been installed in many restaurants, airports, hotels and cars - and the battery is charged without any annoying cable salad and laborious plugging. Since Qi (represents for inductive energy transmission) has a worldwide standard, in which Apple is exceptionally involved, there are little restrictions. Nevertheless, according to the researchers, the technology should only be applied in exceptional cases.
Everest-Stau Photographer: 13 Eight-thousanders in six months
A Nepalese climber, according to his own data, has climbed 13 of the 14 highest mountains in the world within just six months. Nirmal Purja (36) had reached the top of Manaslu in Nepal and thus set a record, his expedition operator announced.
The former soldier wants to climb every 14 eight-thousanders in seven months. Purja calls his project "Mission Possible". He has already made international headlines: From him comes a viral photograph of climbers standing on Mount Everest snake in spring.
The image of the mass anxiety triggered a debate about stronger security measures on the 8848 meter high mountain and highest peaks of the earth. In May, eleven climbers had died during the ascent.
A problem for Purja could be the ascent of the 14th eight-thousander: Chinese authorities are currently blocking the Xixabangma Mountain in Tibet. The reason for this is, among other things, called bad weather. At the beginning of the week, Purja wrote on Twitter that Nepal’s government wants to talk to China to allow him to climb.
Four dead elephants discovered on Sri Lanka
Among the dead animals is also a pregnant elephant cow, a police spokesperson announced on Friday. "We suspect that the elephants were poisoned."
The four cadavers were found in a protected area near the famous and visited by many tourists former rock fortress Sigiriya. According to the police spokesperson, the animals were probably between 15 and 25 years old. An autopsy was arranged to determine the cause of death.
In Sri Lanka almost 200 elephants are killed every year. The perpetrators are often farmers whose land the animals had previously kept harmless. At the same time about 50 people are killed each year by elephants. This usually happens when the animals travel through villages built near their habitat.
It is estimated that only about 7,000 elephants are still living in Sri Lanka. The death penalty is theoretically related to their killing.
Holding British oil tanker leaves Iran
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" leaves the port city of Bandar Abbas more than two months after his arrest by Iran. According to the news agency IRNA, Bandar Abbas announced this. The Iranian revolutionary guards had established the British flag-driven tanker on 19 July under the charge of disregarding regulations of sea law in the Persian Gulf.
Management of Thomas Cook in criticism
The responsible Economic Committee of the Unterhaus intends to investigate the responsibilities of travel giant Thomas Cook in a comprehensive way. It is intended to cover the salary packages of the Board of Directors as well as the question of why the British government should not have been able to provide financial support to the company fighting for survival. "Our interest applies to supervision in the company as well as control by external auditors," said the chairman of the Committee Rachel Reeves in London. "We are apparently dealing with a bad example of management greed."
According to experts, genes are overestimated in the risk of intestinal cancer
The role of the genes in the familial increased risk of intestinal cancer has apparently been overestimated so far. Researchers from the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) Heidelberg come to this conclusion in a recent study. Other risk factors such as familial dietary habits are therefore probably more severe than previously assumed. This has consequences for calculations of the individual cancer risk, emphasize the DKFZ scientists.
Elon Musk makes Tesla shares rise
Musk wrote this in an e-mail to Tesla employees published on Thursday (local time) by the branch blog "Electrek". The demand was strong, so Tesla could book 110'000 orders, it continued in Musk's newsletter.
The challenge was to quickly bring the cars to the customer’s attention. Tesla had to offer as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked the information: Tesla’s shares went out of business with an increase of more than six percent. This has not been the case for nearly four months. Tesla delivered over 95,000 cars in the second quarter and thus achieved its best value.
Musk needs records to achieve its high targets. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360'000 to 400'000 cars. This requires six-digit figures in the current and upcoming quarter. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there were last losses.
Will British government circumvent Brexit law? Johnson withholding
The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson considers whether he is looking for ways of circumventing the last law against an irregular Brexit, and on Friday he simply said to journalists that his government was going to adhere to the law in force.
The law provides that the government should request a postponement of the retirement date if no agreement with the EU had been reached by mid-October. Johnson criticises this as a "capitulation law" which makes negotiations with the EU difficult.
Former British Prime Minister John Major had said on Thursday that Johnson could try to use "political shocks" to circumvent the law. Johnson could use a procedural trick that would shift the entry into force of the law to the time after the EU exit.
Johnson said that he is seeking a treaty with the European Union. "We are confident that we will leave the EU on 31 October, and the best way is with an agreement".
Iran apparently drives uranium enrichment up
Iran’s President Hassan Rohani has increased the pressure on the European contracting partners in the dispute about rescuing the historic nuclear agreement. “Unfortunately, the European states are showing inability or unwillingness when it comes to concrete actions,” said Rohani at a press conference on the verge of the UN General Assembly in New York on Thursday. In the event that they are not in favour of their promises, he put forward “further steps” from the agreements of the laboriously negotiated agreement of 2015.
The background is the conflict over the international agreement to prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb, which, in return, contained the commitment to Tehran to normalize economic relations. In 2018, the United States left the agreement alone to force Iran to change its course in the aggressive Middle East policy. President Donald Trump’s government wants to negotiate a new agreement with tougher conditions and now again sets out on harsh sanctions against Tehran. Iran’s reaction to this was to re-establish the limited uranium enrichment in the Treaty.
The International Atomic Energy Authority (IAEA) confirmed in a report that the Islamic Republic now uses the centrifuges installed at the beginning of September with uranium or at least prepared for use. According to IAEA data, Iran is also preparing for the construction of more than 300 additional centrifuges.
Perhaps Europeans are not willing to carry their share of the deal and therefore left the Iranians alone with the cost and burden of US sanctions, Rohani claimed. However, there will still be other talks that hopefully would be a solution.
Rohani continues to dispute Iran's development in attacks in Saudi Arabia
However, following an attack on an important oil plant in Saudi Arabia in mid-September, Germany, France and the UK followed on Monday the U.S. assessment that Tehran was responsible for the attack. Originally, the Huthi rebels in Yemen supported by Iran had come to terms with the attack, which was considered a false confession by the US. "We have nothing to do with it," said Rohani on Wednesday.
"Those who make such accusations must provide evidence of this," said Rohani. However, the European leaders in the talks with him during the UN general debate would not have been able to do so. Instead, they would have insisted that the rebels in Yemen could not carry out an attack like this. In recent days, Rohani had met with Chancellor Angela Merkel, France’s President Emmanuel Macron and British British Boris Johnson.
Prior to possible talks with US President Trump, the far-reaching sanctions of the U.S. administration had to be lifted, said Rohani. He called on the Washington government to turn to a policy of "dialogue and reason".
Comet from other star crosses solar system
Astronomers are currently observing a comet from the depths of the universe. This was achieved before. The comet allows conclusions to be drawn on other solar systems.
What was initially only a presumption is now confirmed: an interstellar guest crosses through our solar system. The comet from the depth of space was baptized after his explorer on 2I/Borisov and has aroused the interest of astronomers around the world.
The far-reaching comet had been discovered on August 30, by amateur astronomer Gennadi Borissow at the Margo Observatory in Crimea - with a self-built telescope of 65 centimetres diameter. In addition, observation of various observatories confirmed that it was an unknown comet, but also showed that it was not from our solar system.
After 1I/'Oumuamua of 2017, 2I/Borisov is only the second interstellar object that was seen during a passage through our solar system.
2I/Borisov offers astronomers the rare chance to get insights from nearby into a foreign solar system before he disappears on never-seen. First observations show that the interstellar comet resembles our own system, as reported by the Astrophysical Institute of the Canarys. "The current speed of the comet is high, about 150,000 kilometers per hour, which lies at this distance well above the typical speeds of objects that surround the sun," said Davide Farnocchia of the U.S. space agency Nasa in a communication.
According to the analyses, the comet is on a so-called hyperbola orbit that leads him out of our system - and clearly interstellar origin, as the International Astronomical Union (IAU) announced. It is also responsible for the designation and categorisation of celestial bodies. In honor of its explorer, the interstellar tail star, which was first managed under the catalogue number C/2019 Q4, was named 2I/Borisov, with the first part of the name indicating that it is the second interstellar object discovered in our solar system.
The astronomers are lucky: in contrast to 1I/'Oumuamua 2I/Borisov has already been seen in the approach. Thus the researchers remain for many months for research. "The object will reach the greatest brightness in mid-December and then be visible with medium-sized telescopes until April 2020," Farnocchia explained. "After that, it will only be observed with larger, professional telescopes until October 2020."
Several observatories have already taken visitors into view. For example, a team around Karen Meech from the University of Hawaii, which had already led the characterization of 1I/'Oumuamua, determined the diameter of the object at 2 to 16 kilometres in a first study. Recordings of the Gemini Observatory in Hawaii show a clear tail of the comet.
Researchers from the Astrophysical Institute of the Canary Islands (IAC) have already gained a first so-called spectrum of the interstellar tail star, which offers a kind of fingerprint of its chemical composition. "The spectrum of this object is similar to that of comets of our solar system, and this indicates that their composition must be similar," said IAC researcher Julia de León. This observation suggests that comets in other solar systems could form through similar processes as in our, complemented colleague Javier Licandro.
The discovery of two interstellar visitors within just two years suggests that these objects could open a new way to explore certain processes in other solar systems. However, it is difficult to estimate how often such tips are. One of the next interstellar visitors could possibly intercept a planned satellite mission of the European space agency Esa.
The agency intends to station the three-part space probe "Comet Interceptor" (German for example comet catchers) at a waiting position in 1.5 million kilometres from the Earth until 2028. According to Esa science director Günther Hasinger, it is either to lurk on an unspoilt, fresh comet from our own solar system, or to an interstellar visitor such as 1I/'Oumuamua.
First landing on Beijing's new Mega-Airport Daxing
Just before the 70th anniversary of the People's Republic of China, it's time for the new mega-airport in the south of the Chinese capital, a first passenger machine of China United Airlines has landed, a special honor for captain and crew.
By 2022, around 45 million passengers will be handled annually at the new airport, with 72 million being already in 2025. China’s President Xi Jinping personally announced the opening of the 450 billion expensive project. China’s recent prestige project is also called "Sester" due to its six-arm building structure.
The complex has four runways, which will later be extended to seven, and is equipped with the world's largest automatic air traffic management system. A new subway transports passengers to downtown Beijing in just 20 minutes.
Already during the construction, the Chinese had made several announcements that Berlin could learn from Beijing. The opening of the German capital airport, which had been under construction since 2006, and much smaller, has been postponed. In Beijing, on the other hand, a first passenger machine landed after four years.
New oversonic aircraft is scheduled to fly 2030: in four and a half hours from London to Sydney
From London to Sydney in just four and a half hours - the British space agency UK Space Agency dreams of this. It is intended to make it possible, for the 2030s scheduled flight in the oversounding speed, a special drive (Synergetic Air-Breathing Rocket Engine, Sabre), developed by the company Reaction Engines from Oxfordshire, CNN quoted the agency. "This is the technology that could actually accomplish this," said CEO Graham Turnock to the transmitter. "We are talking about the 2030s for commissioning, and the work is already very advanced."
To advance the project, the British Space Agency wants to cooperate more closely with the Australian. A flight from the British capital to the Australian metropolis takes about 20 hours. The Concorde from 1976 until the end of its operation in 2003 had covered the line New York-Paris and used three to three and a half hours for this. In 2000 an accident occurred when a Concorde was launched at the Paris airport Charles de Gaulle, where all 109 passengers were killed. Last year, US aircraft manufacturer Lockheed Martin announced plans to develop a supersonic aircraft, the "X-Plane", together with the US space agency Nasa. Virgin Galactic also has such developments in the program.
"Sabre will make the world smaller with its high-speed point-to-point transport," writes Reaction Engines, among other things, on its homepage. The Sabre drive could be used for efficient travel at a speed of Mach 5 - that means five times as fast as the sound. In addition, such aircraft can also be used outside the Earth's atmosphere and thus enabled the "next generation of truly reusable framers".
Washington Uproar: Trump wants to track down anonymous tippers in Ukraine's affair
In the Ukraine affair for possible abuse of power of the U.S. president, Donald Trump wants to find possible leaks in the White House.
"I want to know who gave the information to Whistleblower," Trump said on Thursday before U.S. Embassy staff at the United Nations in New York. The person concerned was almost "a spy" and in the past one was "a bit different" from today.
This was considered an intimidation attempt against tippers. The event was actually not public. Several US media, however, spread audio recordings of the speech on Friday. Democrats were indignant to the President’s statement.
On Tuesday, the Democrats in the U.S. House announced preparations for an official hearing against Trump. Their allegations were based primarily on the written complaint of an anonymous intelligence staff member, who raised serious accusations against Trump and his government headquarters. On the basis of great public pressure, the signs of the notifier had been made public on Thursday.
As part of his work, Whistleblower wants to have received information from several government staff, according to which the U.S. president "uses the power of his office" to achieve that another country is interfering in the U.S. election 2020 in his favor.
At the heart of the allegations is a controversial phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj at the end of July, in which Trump encouraged his counterparts to investigate, which could harm his political rival Joe Biden. These are former business of Biden’s son Hunter in Ukraine and alleged efforts to protect his granddaughter from Ukrainian justice. Both are in the race for the democratic presidential candidate for the election of 2020.
The Whistleblower also accused the White House of covertizing the Ukraine phone: leading government staff would have tried to keep the exact wording of the conversation under the ceiling. As usual, an electronic text protocol had been created. This was removed after the conversation at the direction of lawyers from the White House but from a database normally intended for this purpose and instead stored in a particularly protected system. So far only a rough conversation protocol has been published.
The identity of the announcer is not publicly known. The "New York Times" reported that it should be an employee of the CIA foreign secret service.
Trump again questioned the credibility of the source on Friday. In a series of Tweets on the topic, the president wrote, among other things, that the "so-called Whistleblower" had spread information from the second hand, which would have turned out to be inappropriate. Therefore, there might not be any tippers or spies.
How Trump expressed himself in New York about those who were supposed to have given information to Whistleblower, however, aroused indignation. The president of the U.S. House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, was alarmed and complained that Trump’s statement once again undermined the integrity of the government.
In the House of Representatives several investigations against Trump and its environment have been taking place in various committees for months. In the face of Ukraine’s accusations, the Democrats are now carrying out investigations with new force in order to initiate a possible investigation procedure against Trump.
"The Whistleblower gave us a timetable for our investigation," said the head of the Secret Service Committee at the House of Representatives, Adam Schiff. Trump attacked ship sharply, accused him of misrepresenting things and again demanded the resignation of the committee chairman. Trump regularly insulted ship and had already asked for its withdrawal months ago.
More than 300 former U.S. government staff from the security and foreign policy sector, mostly among democratic but also republican presidents, put themselves in a statement published on Friday behind the investigation initiated by the Democrats for a possible investigation of the office. Should the accusations prove true, the "a scrupulous abuse of power" by Trump would be said in it.
There is no precise timetable for the further procedure. With its majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could try a so-called impeachment procedure. However, the decision on an actual withdrawal of office was taken in the Senate, where Trump’s Republicans have the majority. Thus, the prospects for such a procedure’s success are small. So far, no US President has been deposed by an impeachment procedure of the Office.
VW works council: jobs are "sluggishly depleted"
The VW brand’s plans to further reduce production costs could go to the expense of manufacturing in Germany and Europe. This concern overturns the works council of the car manufacturer. The brand wants to reduce its annual factory costs by EUR 10 billion by EUR 2 billion by 2023, of which 500 million will be saved as early as this year.
The "future pact" negotiated between companies and works councils in 2016 already provides for the reduction of 14,000 jobs in Germany by 2020. In principle, it is only possible to reduce a job by the car manufacturer if it is shown that the associated activities are no longer necessary. In addition, employment security will apply until 2029.
As our newspaper now learned from works councils, however, jobs in production, which are not actually to be distributed, are "sluggished" by another way - so by the official course. Thus, regular jobs become free often would not be re-occupied.
In these cases, the Works Council has no way of forcing the re-employment. In many places, staff are missing, the work compression is increasing, the concerns about the gradual bleeding of the vehicle plants would increase. Thus, the fear that the vehicle production could gradually be withdrawn from Germany and Europe because it is cheaper in other parts of the world. VW said only: "As agreed, the employment rate is adjusted socially compatible along the demographic curve".
The VW brand wants to standardize production even more worldwide and centralise new projects. This also reduces costs and speeds up decisions - the goal behind which is to increase productivity and thus competitiveness. At a manager's conference in Berlin, production director Andreas Tostmann said: "We are well advised to make ourselves crisis-proof in uncertain times from Brexit to the imminent trade war between the USA and China."
On this path there are already successes: for example, this year’s production costs per vehicle have been falling for the first time since 2013. Before journalists Tostmann said that the production time for the Golf 8, which is to be presented in Wolfsburg on 24 October, is to be reduced by 1.1 hours. Accurate figures on the production period do not mention VW, according to information from our newspaper it is at the Golf 7 around
20 hours.
In our region, Wolfsburg is the only VW factory in which vehicles are produced. The Braunschweig and Salzgitter plants manufacture components. For Wolfsburg, VW-internal has the rule that 800,000 cars have to be built there every year, so that the plant is satisfactoryly profitable. In 2018, however, the use in Wolfsburg was only around 700,000 vehicles - due to the falling diesel demand and the problems in the transition to the new WLTP consumable and exhaust gas test process.
However, as production director Tostmann announced last year, in Wolfsburg "perspectively" a million cars are supposed to roll off the band. This is to make possible the pooling of the golf production in the main plant - because the plant Zwickau will issue the golf production through the conversion to the location for e-auto production.
In addition, the SUV Tiguan and Tarraco (Seat) are produced in Wolfsburg. However, sales of Golf and Tiguan have fallen at last. Therefore, expectations now rest on the Gulf 8. Despite all efforts to build up e-mobility, the Wolfsburger bread and butter car is expected to remain.
Forced to Prostitution with Voodoo: Human Retailers Condemned
Young women from Nigeria have been sworn, thrown into the Ruhr area and forced to prostitution, and six suspected human traffickers have to be imprisoned for this.
Six alleged Nigerian people's dealers were sentenced to judgment and imprisonment in Bochum on Friday for up to eight years and three months. The defendants had taken young women from Nigeria to the Ruhr area and forced them to prostitution. To force their obedience, the expatriate Nigerians still had to take a ritual oath in front of a Voodoo priest in their home country.
The victims were between 17 and 22 years old. They were brought to the Mediterranean with the help of Libyan lockers. However, the dream of a better future was not fulfilled. In Germany, they were distributed on various brothels to handle the alleged sluice costs of an average of 25,000 euros. Therefore, the wages were completely reduced.
The defendants - four men and two women - had admitted the insertion and subsequent distribution of the young Nigerians on brothels in the trial. "The work made it difficult for women physically and psychologically to make it," said Judge Isabel Hoffmann at the judgment announcement. "Some were correctly opposed".
The judgments are based on commercial and tireless inclusion of foreigners, trafficking in human beings, detention and heavy forced prostitution.
Ufo calls for negotiations with Lufthansa
FIm's permanent dispute with the Lufthansa Group once again threatened Ufo with strikes.
If the company does not return to the negotiating table, the trade union "will inform on October 14th of the labour combat measures in the LH Group", Ufo tariff director Daniel Flohr announced on Friday. Lufthansa and her daughter Eurowings have refused to conduct the Ufo collective bargaining for months. This also concerns whether the union has legally terminated collective agreements with Lufthansa.
On this point, Ufo is now looking forward to a decision by the Frankfurt Labour Court. Lufthansa wanted to state that the collective agreements were not terminated. The court rejected the applications. The company confirmed the decision and examined the appeals against it. "I think that a second court sees the case as completely different," said Ufo Board of Directors Flohr.
In August, Lufthansa also submitted an application to the Frankfurt State Labour Court to have UFO's status as a union legally verified. The company argues that the union has not used a representative board for months and is therefore unable to fulfil its role as a tariff partner.
Prior to this was a fierce leadership dispute in the Divisional Union, during which many members of the Board and the Advisory Board resigned, including the long-standing head of the trade union Nicoley Baublies. The UFO had already suspended a preliminary vote on strike of the cabin staff at Eurowings at the end of July because of the doubts about its leadership.
Easier entry: Saudi Arabia announces new visa system
So far Saudi Arabia has not been known as an international tourist magnet, but this should change now. The country on the Persian Gulf wants to introduce new visa destinations.
With a new visa system, Saudi Arabia wants to attract more international tourists in the future. By 2030, the number of international and local visitors is to be increased to 100 million per year, the Tourism Commission reported.
"The opening of Saudi Arabia to international tourists is a historical moment for our country," said Ahmad Al-Chatib, President of the Tourism Commission.
Saudi Arabia is so far difficult to access for tourists. Visas are usually only granted for short business trips, religious pilgrimages or visitors with relatives in the desert state. With the new rules, the Arch conservativeKingdom hopes for more revenue from the tourism business. According to its own statement, Riad wants to reduce its dependence on oil trading.
In mid-September, several rockets and drones had hit two of the most important oil plants in eastern Saudi Arabia: the largest oil refinery in the country in Abkaik and the Churais oil field. In the following, national oil production broke down dramatically, the oil price shoots increased. It should take several weeks for the Kingdom's oil production to return to its old level.
Justin and Hailey Bieber are in preparation for wedding party
Singer Justin Bieber (25) and his wife Hailey (22) are preparing for their wedding feast. On Thursday (local time) the model posted several party photos in their Instagram Stories, on which she can be seen in the white wedding look. Reality Star Kendall Jenner (23) and others, according to the People magazine, had organized a virgin party farewell in Los Angeles.
Justin posted several colorful suits, including bananas, printed on Instagram and asked his followers: "Help me choose my tuxedo for the wedding." According to media reports, the Celebrity Pair wants to marry at church next weekend.
The beavers gave themselves the yes word a year ago in a New Yorker Stand Office. There had not been a bigger festival at the time.
In an interview with the Australian Vogue, Hailey recently explained that the two had found a common level after initial problems: "If you don't compromise, you can't have a relationship."
Two dead in plane crash in the Czech Republic
Two people died in the crash of a small aircraft in the west of the Czech Republic. The wreck had been discovered on Friday in a forest area near the city of Mecin (Metschin), the police told us. The dead were a 38-year-old woman and a 64-year-old man.
The authorities had been looking for the machine since Thursday evening after the crew had delivered an emergency signal via GPS. In the search was also a military helicopter in use. The cause of the accident still needs to be determined. The crash is about 30 kilometers south of Pilsen (ploughs) and 100 kilometers northeast of Regensburg.
Half of the European tree species are threatened with extinction
In addition to pests, diseases, non-resident species, non-sustainable logging and urban growth are the causes of the threat, the World Nature Conservation Union IUCN reported on Friday in Brussels. It has examined the stocks of all the 454 species known in Europe. 265 of them do not occur on any other continent. Of these 265, 58 percent are threatened. 66 are already at the highest level of danger and thus before extinction.
The IUCN divides endangered species into six categories: from "potentially endangered" to "hazardous", "strongly endangered", "dangered by extinction" and "exterminated in nature" to "decomposed", and lists more than 28,000 species of animals and plants worldwide as endangered.
Eberian and Wild Ross Chestnut Threatened
In Germany, Ebereschen (Sorbus) was particularly threatened, said one of the authors, David Allen, the German Press Agency. "Most are threatened because the populations are anyway small or because of the transformation or weakening of their habitats."
It also looks bad for the wild common Ross Chestnuts. They have been considered "hazarded" since 2017, stage two of the IUCN scale. The largest threat is the Balkan Mining Mot alongside a fungus. It has spread from southeastern Europe throughout the continent since the 1980s and has hardly any natural enemies. IUCN estimates the number of wild Ross Chestnuts (Aescus hippocastanum) in Europe to less than 10,000 specimens. Not taken into account in this assessment are the trees in cities, parks and avenues.
Species of shrubs and moose also in danger
At the same time, the IUCN scientists created new European Red Lists for molluscs, shrubs and moose. More than a fifth of molluscs and moose and almost half of all shrubs were threatened, according to the IUCN. This is mainly due to the destruction of the wild, to inlaid species, agricultural practices and climate change. Molds like snails played a key role in the recycling of nutrients in the soil and were an important source of food for birds and other animals.
"This report shows that the situation is precarious for many overlooked and underestimated species, species that form the backbone of the European ecosystem and contribute to a healthy planet," said Luc Bas, IUCN Director of the European Office. "We must limit the human impact on our ecosystems and make the protection of these species a priority."
Earthquake before Istanbul: 34 Injured reported
In the recent earthquake in Turkey, 34 people were injured. There were no deaths, according to the information, and dozens of people had to leave their homes, and 14 schools in Istanbul had been closed for security reasons, said Turkish Vice President Fuat Octay on Friday.
Hundreds of buildings have been damaged. Since the earthquake the day before, there have been almost 200 aftershocks. On Thursday, the earthquake of strength 5.8 had shaken the Marmara region in front of Istanbul and caused panic in the million metropolis.
Now the government wants to set up a Commission to prepare the country better for earthquakes in the future, Octay announced. Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for earthquakes in the last 20 years, said Istanbul’s mayor Ekrem Imamoglu.
Istanbul is considered to be particularly vulnerable to earthquake. Below the Marmara Sea lies a section of the so-called North Anatolic disorder, which marks the border between the Eurasian and Anatolic plates.
One of the most severe earthquakes was one of the strengths of 7.6 in 1999 near Istanbul. The epicenter was then located in Gölkük southeast of Istanbul. More than 17 000 people died.
On Tuesday, a strong 4.6 earthquake shook the Istanbul region, and the authorities called on the residents to stay away from damaged buildings.
Super Bowl 2020: Jennifer Lopez (Jlo) and Shakira perform in the mid-term show
The Latin pop singers Jennifer Lopez and Shakira will lead the half-time show of the next American football final Super Bowl. This was announced by the singers on Twitter. "Größer won't do it," Shakira wrote on a photo of herself and Lopez. She is insanely excited to be on the Super Bowl stage. On February 2, 2020, it will be ready in Miami.
Jennifer Lopez said that she had dreamed since 1996 of performing at the Super Bowl - at that time she saw Diana Ross flying into the sky at the half-time show. "Now it's even more special because the NFL is 100 years old and I will perform with another Latina". She could hardly expect to "show what we girls can do on the world's largest stage".
In an explanation, Shakira pointed out that she was honored to stand alongside another artist on one of the world's largest stages and to represent Latino and Latina from the United States and the whole world. "And then still on my birthday!" The main sponsor of the event wrote on Twitter that it was the first time that the two "queen" were on stage together.
Shakira comes from Colombia. Jennifer Lopez was born in New York, her parents from Puerto Rico.
Fight against sinking numbers of spectators
The Super Bowl is the highlight of the American football season. The game and the half-time show are among the most popular TV broadcasts in the United States. Even though you’ve dropped by the audience: this February the spectacle in the United States attracted the least audience for more than ten years. Nevertheless, it was still almost a hundred million people on average.
About the half-time show of the past Super Bowl, there had been a riot in advance: in the dispute about dealing with quarterback Colin Kaepernick last February, media reports said top stars like Rihanna, Pink and Cardi B did not appear. Finally, the pop group Maroon 5 led the half-time show - the reviews were not very friendly.
Kaepernick, then quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers, went on his knees in the 2016/17 season before NFL games in the national anthem out of protest against police violence and racism. With his protest resolution Kaepernick took off a movement, many players took over the gesture. This caused great excitement, U.S. President Donald Trump attacked the most African-American football stars sharply. Kaepernick himself has been clubless since March 2017 and has no longer fought any NFL party. He accuses the clubs of not wanting to hire him for political reasons.
Cook plea: Hotels get money from insurance
According to a press report, some banks are expected to pay dearly for the business of travel provider Thomas Cook. There are high amortizations on outstanding bonds and loans. Credit Suisse is also affected by this, writes the Financial Times in its Friday issue.
Banks such as Barclays, Morgan Stanley, UniCredit or Credit Suisse would probably have to make total amortizations of up to 1.8 billion UK pounds (about 2 billion euros), according to the report. This would have shown estimates of the consulting firm AlixPartners.
The creditors of bonds would have to purchase depreciations from 900 million to 1 billion pounds and the lenders between 550 and 825 million pounds. The amounts actually written off would be more likely to be at the top of the range, an expert told the sheet.
How great the creditors’ losses will actually be will be after the insolvency proceedings have ended. A person close to this procedure did not spread too much hope. For example, Thomas Cook’s around 40 planes in Great Britain were "old" and many of the properties were in bad locations. Most money could be taken out with the sale of airport slots and Thomas Cook brand, it continued.
Rockete is said to have brought suspected murderers to Italy.
Sea Watch captain Carola Rackete may have brought men to Italy who are supposed to have tortured and killed people in Libya. "We cannot rule out this, but we do not have any secure information on it ourselves," said the spokesperson of the refugee organization Sea-Watch, Ruben Neugebauer, the news agency dpa.
Other migrants would have recognized the three men in Italy. They were accused of raped, tortured and killed in Libya. The alleged perpetrators had been arrested in the reception camp in the Italian Messina. Neugebauer stressed that the refugee organizations could not verify who left them on their ships. "They come without passports".
Carola Rickete had illegally brought migrants to the port of Lampedusa on June 29th, ramming a ship of the Italian financial police. On that day the three suspects were also to arrive. Investigations are being made against the captain for aid to illegal immigration.
US warn federal government against Huawei
The head of the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Ajit Pai, warned the federal government against trusting the Chinese network equipmenter Huawei.
We believe that the risks are too high," said Pai to the "trade sheet" in view of the construction of the new 5G mobile network.
China has a "national security law" which requires every company "under Chinese law" to follow instructions from the security bodies.
The applicable law also prohibits companies from informing third parties about such requests," continued the FCC chief. This makes it very difficult to have confidence in the integrity of technical equipment and services.
The Federal Government has now agreed to demand a "declaration of trust" from suppliers.
Berlin initially wants to try to control the risks, for example with technical solutions, reports the "trade sheet" using its own information.
Pai doubts that this is possible. 5G technology is not just hardware:
Especially the software is important to keep the devices up to date. This software consists of billions of lines of program code that change over time," said Pai.
It was "very difficult to imagine" that a government authority, "no matter where, would be able to check every single update in real time to detect security risks," continued the FCC chief.
He accuses the Chinese group Huawei of being in close contact with the Chinese state apparatus:
The company, which is said to belong to the company, is not necessarily independent of the government," said Pai to the "trade sheet".
The US has some insights that government employees are placed within the company. Pai was recently for talks in Berlin to advertise for the position of the US.
Chemiefabrik in Northern France burns: schools closed
At night, residents hear explosions. A gigantic fire wall illuminates the sky above a north-French chemical factory. The fire is destroyed after hours - the cleaning work could take days now.
After a fire in a chemical factory in the northern French city of Rouen on Thursday, the schools and children's cribs in the region remain closed.
In twelve municipalities the facilities would not be opened on Friday, the competent prefecture announced. The Ministry of the Interior had asked citizens to stay as far as possible in buildings and not to suspend themselves from smoking. There was no injury. Farmers and breeders were called on to bring their animals inside, to protect their food and to stop the harvest for the time being.
The fire could be completely erased on Thursday evening, as the prefecture reported. There is still the risk that after the deletion odor spread, so the prefecture on Twitter. According to the prefecture, 240 firemen and 90 police officers and gendarmen were in use at the fire site.
A huge black smoke column had previously ascended from the chemical factory. French media reported huge flames and explosions at the factory of the company Lubrizol, which repairs additives for oils. The production plant is located just a few kilometres from the city centre.
According to authority, the Normandie factory belongs to the so-called Seveso category of hazardous sites, which are particularly monitored. In the Italian Seveso in Milan, a devastating chemical accident occurred in 1976.
The prefect of the Normandie region, Pierre-André Durand, told the news channel BFMTV that at first no "high toxicity" was detected in samples. However, a pollution of the nearby Seine could not be excluded. In the river dams had been built against pollution, the prefecture explained.
The fire broke out early in the morning around 02.40 a.m., reported the authorities. At first the cause remained unclear. Rouen is a regional metropolis and lies on the Seine between Paris and the port city of Le Havre.
French Finance Minister: "Germany must invest and now"
French Minister for Economic and Financial Affairs Bruno Le Maire has called on Germany to make greater investments to stimulate economic growth in the euro area.
Germany must invest and now, the sooner, the better," said Le Maire on Thursday evening at the presentation of the French budget for the coming year.
The Eurozone economy was weakening, the Minister warned.
We must not wait until the economic situation worsens in order to make the necessary decisions".
Acting would have to be done by those states that had budgetary room for more investment, said Le Maire, among other things, with regard to Germany.
France had no room for manoeuvre, added the minister and referred to the high state debt of its country, which is more than 98 percent of the gross domestic product. The French government debt had to be "stabilised" and "decreased", said Le Maire.
Over the past few years, appeals have been made to Germany to make more public investments to stimulate the European economy. In return, German politicians have repeatedly asked France to deal with its budget deficit.
The French budget for 2020 presented on Thursday provides for tax relief of more than nine billion euros for households.
Among other things, the French government is responding to the protests of the Yellow West movement. The re-indebtedness is expected to fall to 2.2 percent, expected to 3.1 percent this year.
Is he still trying to trick?: Johnson deviates question about Brexit tactics
British Prime Minister Johnson strongly criticises the "capitulation law" passed by Parliament.
Parliament is back, a law requires the British Prime Minister to avoid a chaos Brexit. However, critics fear that Boris Johnson could still use a loophole. However, the Tory politician addressed this possibility.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson considers whether he wants to enforce an irregular Brexit - despite the last law passed by Parliament, which is intended to prevent exactly that. On a corresponding question, Johnson simply said to journalists that his government would adhere to applicable law.
The law provides for the government to request a postponement of the retirement date if no agreement with the EU is reached by mid-October. Johnson criticises this as a "capitulation law" which makes negotiations with the EU difficult.
Former British Prime Minister John Major had said on Thursday that Johnson could try to use "political shocks" in order to circumvent the law. The Prime Minister could set up a procedural trick that would postpone the entry into force of the law to the time after the EU exit. Johnson said he was seeking a treaty with the European Union. "We are confident to leave the EU on 31 October, and the best way is with an agreement".
Johnson's chief consultant, Dominic Cummings, said that he felt the political debate about Brexit as a "walk in the park" and was confident that the desired exit from the EU was still taking place: "We will enjoy it, we will win, we will leave (note d. Red.: from the EU), not worry," according to Cummings of the British newspaper "Telegraph" in a book presentation.
Cummings, who led the Brexit campaign "Vote Leave" during the 2016 election campaign, now serves as chief strategy in Downing Street, Britain. He is supposed to be behind the uncompromising policy that led the Prime Minister into a very unmistakable situation.
"The Polaroid Diaries" by Linda McCartney
Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan or Janis Joplin - they all stood in front of Linda McCartney's camera, which has become one of the big rock photographers. But it doesn't always have to be the great glamour. The photo book "The Polaroid Diaries" (bags) is deeply immersed in the very private world of the McCartney family.
Paul McCartney, who was married to her from 1969 to Linda’s death in 1998, was visibly proud and touched when he presented the image book "The Polaroid Diaries" in mid-September at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. Among the illustrative guests were Ringo Starr, Stella McCartney, Olivia Harrison and Pretender’s front wife Chrissie Hynde.
After the launch event McCartney wrote to Instagram: "#ThePolaroidDiaries is a glimpse of the life of an exceptional family from before Instagram, a celebration to the legacy of LindaMcCartney as an engaged artist and the instant magic of the Polaroid film".
With Linda McCartney, who had studied art history at the University of Aizona until she found photography, the camera was always there. Thousands of Polaroids have made it, some hundreds of them are now being published in "The Polaroid Diaries" for the first time.
They are portraits, still life, landscapes, several hamsters, a sheep in the kitchen and other interiors from the early 1970s to the late 1990s. "She wanted real moments," writes art critic Ekow Eshun in his preface. And of course one thing is always at the centre: her husband Paul - as one may never have seen him before.
As he dances with his daughter Mary on his shoulders, telephones in the bathrobe with a bag on his head or wears unshaped moonboats. Certainly, the McCartneys were an extraordinary family, but they lived a normal life beyond the spotlight on their farm in southern England or in Scotland. So said Mary McCartney, according to BBC, that she had slept in a bed as a baby that her father had made from old potato boxes. And it wasn't always clean with McCartneys.
Like hardly any other medium, the Poloraid camera catches the immediate moment. Linda McCartney’s recordings are certainly some kind of family diary, but they are much more than just snapshots.
It's about the decision click: You have to recognize when a great photo is happening in front of you. And then you have to cut it in the exact right moment," said Paul McCartney. "You know, two seconds later or two seconds earlier, it can be a completely different photo." And Linda had the gift of always getting the right moment. "She just knew she had it," said Paul in the Eshun essay.
The light, the composition, the cut-out and the colors, which makes "The Polaroid Diaries" not only an entertaining picture book for Beatles fans, but also a great aesthetic pleasure in addition to all the anecdotals, where landscapes also seem like abstract paintings. The perfect addition to the newly released Beatles album "Abbey Road", which was released exactly 50 years ago.
"We will continue to buy oil and gas from Iran"
Despite the U.S. sanctions imposed on Iran, Turkey continues to import oil and gas from neighbouring countries. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in an interview published on Friday that Turkey could not cancel the oil and gas imports from Iran.
We will continue to buy our natural gas from there," said Erdogan in New York, where he participated in the UN General Assembly.
Erdogan admitted, however, that Turkey had problems importing Iranian oil, since some companies had "removed due to US threats".
Nevertheless, Turkey "will continue our relations with Iran, especially on this issue and on many other issues," said the Turkish President, who had repeatedly criticized the US sanctions against Iran in the past.
The US has been pursuing a policy of "maximum pressure" against the Islamic Republic since its exit from the international nuclear agreement with Iran. According to the United States, Iran is secretly pursuing a nuclear programme and does not adhere to the agreement.
Its sanctions have led to the collapse of Iranian oil exports and a severe economic crisis in Iran, and tensions in the Gulf region have increased considerably in recent months.
U.S. government wants to restrict the reception of refugees
The US government wants to drastically limit the reception of refugees. On Thursday, the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs declared that the annual ceiling of a resettlement programme should be reduced from currently 30,000 to 18,000 refugees. This corresponds to a 40 percent cut.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that although the US would continue to see itself committed to support refugees, the most important task was to protect and serve US citizens, and the US immigration system is currently overburdened.
In the future, the U.S. government intends to focus on the reception of two refugee groups: people persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the US military in the country and who have been put at risk by this, as the statement of the Foreign Ministry says, but not more than 1500 refugees are to be taken up from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador.
In the 1980 programme, refugees from UN camps around the world are selected and relocated to the US. The ceiling of 18,000 refugees for the 2020 budget year would be the lowest in the history of the program. Already the current limit of 30,000 is set. As the predecessor of US President Donald Trump, Barack Obama, left the White House, the number was almost 85,000.
Relief agencies were horrified at the announced reduction in the ceiling. "This is a very sad day for America," said the head of the International Rescue Committee, David Milliband. The US would thus continue to damage its leadership role in protecting the most vulnerable people in the world.
Trump tries to strictly limit immigration to the USA - both legally and illegally - and the US government expects 350,000 asylum applications for the coming budget year, according to its own data. These figures are separate from the resettlement programme.
Donald Trump - "Come close to a trick"
US President Donald Trump has given notices in the Whistleblower affair of espionage. Whoever has given appropriate clues to the informant who accuses him of power abuse, "comes close to a trick," said Trump, according to a record of a private event on Thursday in New York. This report is consistent with several US media.
After that Trump spoke to U.S. UN mission staff. When he was asked about the person who informed the whistleblower about controversial operations in the White House, he replied, "This is getting close to a trick." Trump added: "Do you know what we did in old times when we were smart? Right. The spies and betrayal, we used to deal with it a little differently than we do now."
Observers appreciated the latter comment on a possible allusion to the death penalty, and the Democrats strongly criticized Trump’s statements and accused him of intimidating witnesses. In addition, it was an attempt to hinder a Congress investigation into a possible trial against him, the chairmen of the Committees for Foreign Affairs, Secret Services and Supervision in the House of Representatives wrote.
The Whistleblower accuses the President in a complaint that he has now published to abuse his office in order to ask another country to intervene in the US election in 2020. In particular, his controversial phone call with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Selenskyj in the summer: In the conversation Trump urged him to investigate his possible democratic challenger Joe Biden and and his son Hunter in Ukraine. Trump contests any misbehaviour.
It is still unclear who are both the whistleblower itself and its informants. However, as reported in the New York Times, the whistleblower is supposed to be an analyst of the CIA foreign secret service.
Refugee boat known: Baby and small children drown in Aegean
People repeatedly try to get across the Aegean Sea from Turkey to Greece. They regularly know the often far too small boats. Seven migrants have now died in the fall of a hose boat - among them five children.
Seven migrants died in front of the Greek island of Chios. Among the deaths there are also a baby and four other children, reported the Greek Coast Guard. Four children, three women and five men could therefore be saved from the floods from the crew of a passing ferry.
Among the victims is also said to be a locker, reported the local news portal of Chios, Alithia.gr. Migrants started in the morning from Turkey. They had tried to reach the small island group Inousses in the northeast of the island of Chios. Inousses is located between Chios and the Turkish mainland.
The countries from which the migrants come are not yet known. Hundreds of migrants from Turkey are currently transferring to the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean, mostly in too small boats. Last year 174 people were killed on this route according to the United Nations Refugee Aid Agency (UNHCR).
The Who Breaks Concert
A US concert by the rock band The Who has found a year-old end because of an impatience of lead singer Roger Daltrey. In the middle of the performance on Wednesday evening (local time) in Houston his voice failed. At the eighth song Daltrey told the audience: "I think I should leave it while it is still running."
Lead guitarist Pete Townsend apologized and added that Daltrey could not really speak at all. Townsend promised to come to his expense at a reparation concert. However, an appointment is not yet established.
For Fridays in Dallas and for Sundays in Denver, The Who cancels their appearances. They are to be reclaimed at a later date. The 75-year-old Daltrey and his 74-year-old bandmate Townsend are the only remaining founding members. The British cult band formed 55 years ago.
Rental suddenly stopped: WeWork makes real estate markets tremble
In New York, WeWork has risen to become the largest office tenant.
Within a few years, WeWork is rising from the small startup to the driving force on the most expensive real estate markets in the world. But now the company is in crisis.
The crisis of the office rental company WeWork threatens to disrupt the balance on the largest real estate markets in the world. Just a few days ago, the company had abandoned founder Adam Neumann as boss, postponed the planned stock exchange and started selling subsidiaries and values such as the private jet for the executives to gain financial space for the coming weeks and months. Among other things, the British Financial Times reports that WeWork has stopped the conclusion of new leases with immediate effect, thus, among other things, the largest tenant of office space is suddenly off the market in New York and London.
WeWork rents large office space in the long term and rents it into partially small units to members in the short term. This can be individual freelancers, small startups or entire departments of large corporations. So far, WeWork has burned up money with this business at breathtaking speed. Last year, the company entered a loss of 1.6 billion dollars, with sales of 1.8 billion dollars. This year alone, the rental costs are expected to have increased by renting new large areas to an estimated 2.5 billion dollars. In order to limit the loss, the new management is now expected to pull the emergency brake and to effect the renting of new land with immediate effect.
According to the Financial Times, WeWork has now entered into lease contracts with terms of up to 15 years, which generate commitments of more than 40 billion dollars. These huge liabilities could become a problem not only for the company itself and its investors but for entire real estate markets.
According to calculations by economist Dan Alpert from Cornell Law School in New York, WeWork rented in Manhattan, one of the most expensive real estate markets in the world, almost 300,000 square meters of office space in the past 24 months. WeWork’s new contracts alone made sure that the demand for offices in New York was greater than the newly launched areas in the past 24 months. Without WeWork’s expansion, the office space in the U.S. metropolis would have increased at this time, as Alpert wrote in the Business Insider. Similarly, it looks in London where WeWork now operates several dozens of office locations in the best position.
Even in the British capital, the balance in the real estate market could be felt without further expansion of the aggressive startup. Among other things, WeWork is the main tenant, in a office house purchased last year by the Sparkassen fund provider Deka for nearly 100 million euros in the center of the financial metropolis.
Many owners have converted their properties to the demands of WeWork with high investments. If WeWork fails to make its business model profitable soon, the property owners would probably have to write off some of the billions of expected income. They do not have access to the - anyway scarce - reserves of WeWork despite the long-term lease contracts. Because the rental of the individual locations of WeWork is usually carried out by each of the extra-founded subsidiaries, so-called Special Purpose Vehicles, for which the parent company is only liable in narrow limits.
Russia again captured numerous North Korean fishermen
The Russian Coast Guard has again taken action against North Korean fishermen. In recent days, a total of 262 more wilders have been arrested, who had been illegally fished in the waters, according to the Russian Domestic Intelligence Service FSB of the Interfax agency on Friday.
Only ten days ago were 161 fishermen arrested from North Korea. Previously the border guards had been shot and three of them were injured. This time there had been no injured, it was said. Communist North Korea suffers from chronic food shortage.
The North Korean fishermen were therefore on their way in Russian territorial waters. There, the Russian Coast Guard is driving patrols to protect its marine biological resources. 30,000 inkfish have been discovered during the re-controls. Furthermore, the data were confiscated after three fishing and two motor boats and brought to Nachodka and Posjet at Vladivostok. According to the agency Ria Nowosti, the coastguard in 2018 detected a total of more than 8,000 infringements
The Russian Fisheries Authority had not issued any fishing licences to the North Koreans this year, even after complaints by local entrepreneurs. According to the media, thousands of fishermen from North Korea have already been arrested there in 2019.
The head of the association of Russian fishing companies in the Far East region of Primorje, Georgi Martynow, recently complained of high environmental damage by North Korean fishermen. They fished with tight synthetic nets banned in Russia. These would also bring small creatures out of the sea. Furthermore, the nets would simply be disposed of in the sea where they needed 200 years to be decomposed. Also, the ships themselves do not comply with hygienic and technical regulations.
According to Moscow, three members of the Russian Coast Guard had been injured during the last week’s arrests. According to the FSB, a also wounded North Korean later died of his injuries. On 17 September, Russian border guards first set up a North Korean boat and then a second after it opened fire.
United States ban on entry to the United States of America against ex-President Castro
The US has banned the entry of former Cuban President Raúl Castro and his children, and the US Foreign Ministry has founded this in a communication on Thursday with Castro's participation in "warranted human rights violations". As head of the Communist Party of the Caribbean State, he stands for a system in which thousands of Cubans would be arrested arbitrarily and there were more than 100 political prisoners.
As chairman of the armed forces, the brother of the deceased revolutionary leader Fidel Castro was also responsible for human rights violations there by supporting the President of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro. "The violation of human rights and the use of violence by the Cuban regime to support the former Maduro regime are responsible for the ongoing crises in Cuba and Venezuela," said American foreign minister Mike Pompeo.
On Wednesday, President Donald Trump had made a ban on entry, among others, against members of the Venezuelan government and the military. In Venezuela, a fierce struggle for power between the government and the opposition has raged for months. The US has imposed a number of sanctions on Maduro’s government to force him to the knees and to help the opposition leader and self-proclaimed interim president Juan Guaidó to power.
Cuba is considered to be one of the closest allies of Maduro. Venezuela’s socialist Caribbean island receives oil in exchange for the services of sent doctors. Cuba has also sent numerous intelligence agents to Venezuela to help the government suppress government opponents, according to the U.S. and Venezuelan opposition.
New climate protests from Fridays for Future
A week after the largest international climate protests so far, thousands of people want to go to the streets again today for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement plans again for actions and rallys in dozens of countries around the world. Due to the shift in time, New Zealand and Australia are expected to start before the protests move across Europe to North America. Climate activist Greta Thunberg wanted to participate in a large rally in Montreal, Canada.
How big the global promise on this Friday after the record participation of the previous week is relatively unclear. Thunberg himself was good things. "Last Friday over four million people stretched for the climate. This Friday we do it again!", she wrote on Twitter. So far, there have been 6383 actions in 170 countries within the framework of the strike week, she added.
A good third of all world demonstrators - around 1.4 million - had participated in the protests in 575 German cities, according to estimates of Fridays for Future. According to a list of the movement, rallys are planned in at least 65 cities, including Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller communities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or the West on Sylt, people want to go to the streets for the climate.
At the age of 15, Thunberg had set himself up in August 2018 in front of the Swedish Parliament to call on their country’s politicians to make a stronger commitment to climate protection. This led to the Fridays-for-Future movement within a short time. Students and students, but increasingly also scientists and other adults, participate in the climate protests.
Together they demand more ambition from politics in the fight against global warming and the threat of climate disaster. In particular, according to the Paris climate agreement global warming has to be reduced to less than 1.5 degrees compared to pre-industrial time.
Thunberg had arrived in New York almost a month ago after a two-week transatlantic tower with a high-sea racing yacht. There she had last participated in climate protests and summits of the United Nations. On Monday, she gave an emotional speech to the UN, in which she gave a strong conscience to the heads of state and government of the world. On Wednesday, in her home Stockholm, she had been given to the Right Livelihood Foundation’s alternative Nobel Prize for climate protection.
Russia prohibits smoking on the balcony
In the future, people in Russia are no longer allowed to smoke on the balcony. This provides for a change in fire protection. "This also applies to smoking," said a spokesman from the Ministry of Emergency on Thursday in Moscow of the agency Tass. The ban is to enter into force on 1 October.
Anyone who smokes nevertheless has to expect a fine of 3,000 rubles (42,46 euros). If the cigarette should kindle a fire, then the penalty will be higher. According to the Ministry, the same burning candles are prohibited. Even grills on the balcony are no longer allowed.
Strike against cybercriminals - Detectives lift servers
In the fight against crime on the Internet, German researchers have for the first time lifted a large server provider for illegal business in the Darknet.
A total of 13 perpetrators are suspected to have hosted numerous websites in a former Nato bunker in Traben-Trarbach on the Mosel, through which international criminals operate.
This was reported by the General Prosecutor in Koblenz. Seven suspects were arrested on Thursday night in a major action. The Darknet is a shielded part of the Internet.
Clients of the suspects should have been, among other things, the operators of the world’s second largest Darknet market place for drugs, “Wall Street Market” - the investigators had smashed in spring. Also, the attack on 1.25 million Deutsche Telekom router was controlled by a server in the Cyberbunker at the end of November 2016, according to the prosecutor General.
It was said that such a host had been lifted in Germany for the first time. A web host provides the infrastructure for an Internet presence.
During the access campaign with the support of special units such as the GSG9, there have been searches in Germany and in neighbouring countries. It has been a result of nearly five years of investigations. At noon, the investigators want to inform about more details.
New global climate protests from Fridays for Future
A week after the largest international climate protests so far, thousands of people want to go to the streets again today for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement once again planned actions and rallys in dozens of countries around the world.
In Germany, protests are planned in at least 65 cities, including Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, as well as in smaller municipalities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or the West on Sylt. Climate activist Greta Thunberg wants to participate in a major rally in Montreal, Canada.
Climate protests - Who are Thunberg's hindmen?
Justice and courage are high virtues, even in the 21st century, in a world full of war and smoking factories that warm up the climate. All the more amazing that a 16-year-old girl just keeps the power of this time in his head. But what is behind it? Is it helpful or smart marketing of a climate activist? Historical master performance or manipulative tactics for his own sake?
On the one hand, Greta Thunberg sets the masses in motion and brings young people to stand up for a better climate-friendly world. Historically speaking, it is not the first time in Europe that a young person manages to gain a collection of children and young people for himself. As early as 1212, a child named Nikolaus from Cologne felt selected to work for a fairer world. At that time, he has also been able to win a crowd of young people for himself and has persuaded them to cross the sea in order to get to the promised land, similar to Greta Thunberg recently made his way to America with a sailboat.
But is there a shadow side on this? Why does it need a share called "We don't have time" to save the world? In addition, Greta Thunberg has rich PR managers on her side. By the way, her mother has published a book that has sold itself widely, thanks to the daughter standing in the spotlight. Also well-proven followers of Greta Thunberg were a little dismayed at the last PR show, or the trip with the boat was probably set up too thick by some successors. This is also not unfounded, because the action was very good in the media worldwide and it flows a lot of money thanks to the impressive action.
Here the spirits are now separated: Is it morally right to enrich themselves financially in the world’s saving? Is it still authentic when certain groups of people work together with stock exchange brokers during the world rescue action? No matter what position is ultimately involved, a critical and reflected point of view is increasingly important in a democratically shaped society, because democracy lives on different opinions and discussions. Therefore, it can make sense to question even seemingly pious plans of certain trendsets.
Comet discovered: Interstellar guest crosses through our solar system
A foreign comet is currently crossing our solar system.
The assumptions of the astronomers have been confirmed: A foreign comet currently crosses our solar system - it is only the second of its kind.
Garching/Washington - For a long time, the researchers have only suspected it, but now they have certainty: A comet from another star is currently crossing our solar system. He was baptized after his explorer 2I/Borisov and is currently busy worldwide astronomers.
2I/Borisov: Comet discovered by amateur astronomers in Crimea
The said body was discovered by an amateur astronomer named Gennadi Borissov in Crimea. He looked at the sky with a self-built telescope and further follow-up observations confirmed his first suspicion. It is actually an unknown comet that does not come from our solar system. It is only the second of its kind that was seen during transit.
The great opportunity for astronomers is now to catch insights into a foreign solar system from nearby. Apparently, the Comet is similar to that of our own system, as reported by the Astrophysical Institute of the Canary Islands. According to the International Astronomical Union (IAC), the comet is clearly interstellar and is currently moving on a so-called hyperbole orbit that leads him out of our system.
Comet has been seen before approach - and can be observed several months
But before it is so far, the astronomers can observe it in depth. In contrast to its predecessor, 2I/Borisov has already been seen in its approach, which means that it can be investigated from Earth for many months. "The object will reach the greatest brightness in mid-December and then be seen with medium-sized telescopes until April 2020," explains Davide Farnocchia of the US space travel agency Nasa. "After that, it will only be visible with larger, professional telescopes until October 2020."
The predecessor of the new visitor: 1I/2017 U1 "Oumuamua".
Initial knowledge of Comet 2I/Borisov awakens hopes in science
According to the first findings, the comet is estimated at 2 to 16 kilometres in diameter. At the same time, the celestial body seems to be similar to our comets - because, as IAC researcher Julia de León puts it, the spectrum of the tail star is similar to ours. This observation suggests that comets in other solar systems could form through similar processes as in our colleague Javier Licandro.
The observation, however, goes beyond individual knowledge. The fact that two such objects have already been discovered within just two years may allow a new way to explore certain processes in other solar systems.
Again and again, asteroids are busy with the researchers. Only recently a giant asteroid ran past the earth and got dangerously close to it.
"Absolutely repugnant": Rachel Johnson is horrified by brother
Boris Johnson is getting more lonely. First his younger brother leaves the cabinet, now his sister is clearly mocking the warring language of the Prime Minister as "tasteless". It is not the brother she knows.
"Capitulation", "Betrug", contract: Prime Minister Boris Johnson is under pressure and is constantly uplifting - at least verbally. At Question Time in the Lower House on this Wednesday this met with a massive outrage of the opposition, and in the meantime more critics have spoken: dozens of bishops and his own sister Rachel Johnson.
The well-known journalist and author told the sender Sky News that her brother would use words such as capitulation as if the opponents of an EU exit should be "hanged, long-drawn, quadrupled, tarred and feathered." She felt that this was very objectionable. She did not recognize her brother's version again, said Rachel Johnsons, who had taken office in the elections to the EU Parliament for the anti-Brexit party "Change UK".
In particular, she found that her brother Jo Cox mentioned, an EU-friendly sub-house member, who had been murdered by a Neonazi just days before the 2016 retirement referendum. Her memory could best be honored by going through Brexit, Boris Johnson had said in the lower house. "It is very tasteless to refer to a parliamentarian who was murdered by someone who called "Britain first", now criticized Johnson's sister. The perpetrator had obviously come out of the far right camp who felt strengthened "by this kind of language". For all those who mourned about her, be it very tasteless.
The widower of Cox also criticised the Prime Minister sharply. "It makes me sick when Jo's name is used this way," he tweeted. The best way to honor her is if one comes passionately and decisively for what one believes in - no matter what view one might be. But never should one "demonicize the other side". He also complained that an atmosphere had arisen, in which attacks had become more likely.
Just a few weeks ago, Boris Johnson, younger brother Jo, had laid down his office as Secretary of State and his mandate as Tory deputy. "I have been torn between loyalty to the family and the national interest in recent months - it is an insoluble tension," Jo Johnson explained the step.
Johnson’s language also encountered sharp criticism in the Church. As reported by the “Times”, all 118 bishops and archbishops of the Church of England criticise the language that “this country is not worthy”. In a joint statement, they said: “In the past days, the language has not been acceptable, both in debates and outside of Parliament. We should speak with respect”.
Shakira and Jennifer Lopez perform at the Super Bowl
The NFL is a strong sign in the year of its 100th anniversary: in the mid-term show of the upcoming Super Bowl, two women perform with Latino roots. They promise "an explosion of fun and energy".
Latina-Power at the Super Bowl: The Superstars Shakira (42) and Jennifer Lopez (50) will deliver the mid-term show at the upcoming final of the US football league NFL, which was announced by the organizers on Thursday (local time).
"I feel incredibly honored and humble to represent the Latino community next to Jlo, because it has an incredible strength in the USA," Shakira said in a video.
The finale of the American football league, which celebrates its 100th birthday next year, will take place in Miami on February 2. In the metropolis on the southern tip of Florida, many people live with Latin American roots. Shakira ("Waka Waka") comes from Colombia, Lopez ("On the Floor") is of Puerto Rican origin.
"I love that the Super Bowl puts two women on stage this time - and two Latinas," Lopez explained. This sent an important message to all Americans and the world. She promises for the show "an explosion of fun and energy".
The 50-year-old was born in New York after her parents emigrated from Puerto Rico. In the 2000s she landed with songs like "Waiting For Tonight" or "Let's Get Loud" great hits and later also released songs in Spanish. Lopez also works as an actress and from November on in the drama "Hustlers" in German cinemas.
Shakira became known in Colombia as a star of a telenovela and singer. She made her worldwide breakthrough in 2001 with her first bilingual album and the single "Whenever, Whereever".
The announcement of the half-time guests is expected to be very exciting every time in the United States. This year, many also regard the selection as a political gesture. Finally, the country, not least by the immigration policy of President Donald Trump, is deeply divided.
The Super Bowl is the largest U.S. sports event and at the same time a huge advertising spectacle. Musicians such as Justin Timberlake, Beyoncé, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Madonna, Bruno Mars and the Rolling Stones made for furore there. Usually, over 100 million TV viewers watch the NFL finale, and it is extremely popular in Germany as well.
Last year, there was political controversy. The reason was the dispute over the quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who had refused protest against police violence against blacks, to rise up in the play of the national anthem, and for this reason, among other things, the U.S. President Donald Trump. Out of solidarity with Kaepernick, some musicians had refused a super bowl appearance - including Rihanna and Pink. The fact that the Maroon 5 rock group was performing was finally criticized by many.
An actor and Youtuber is increasing Egypt's ruler: Mohamed Ali prefers to stay abroad for the first time.
The two men, who have an influence on whether blood is flowing on the streets of Egypt, both spent the last week abroad. One of them floated back at Cairo airport on Friday. President Abdelfattah al-Sisi returned from the UN General Assembly. The ex-general, who in 2013 transferred the Muslim brother Mohammed Mursi, the first freely elected head of state of the country, had spent a pleasant time in New York: US President Donald Trump had praised Sisi’s action against political Islam and had not lost any syllables about the human rights violations at the Nile - in a week when Egypt’s security forces arrested hundreds of people for dared to protest against the president. He had “no reason to worry,” said Sisi at the airport in the state television. “The Egyptians are not going astray.”
In the view of the president of the other man, who is currently determining the events on the streets, he is trying to lead astray. Of course, Mohamed Ali remained abroad, where he is deprived of the access of the security forces who would immediately arrest him if he tried to enter Egyptian soil. Weeks ago, the 45-year-old was known as only a minority of Egyptians. Today, he is the tone-devoting voice that dominates the political discourse in the cafes, living rooms and tea houses of the country: With his Youtube channel "Mohamed's Secrets" Ali calls his countrymen to rise against Sisi.
While the people are starving, the president is reveling in luxury and let himself be built with magnificent new palaces, it is said. The leadership of the army, on which Sisi relies his rule, accuses Ali of corruption and enrichment. Because, in his second job as a builder, he has been doing business with exactly these gentlemen for 15 years, he seems to know quite well what he is talking about - at least this is the impression of many Egyptians, as shown by the numbers of clicks to be exploded.
After last week's last week since Sisi's grip on power had demonstrated thousands against his rule, and almost 2,000 citizens, among them prominent figures of civil society, human rights lawyers and opposition politicians, had been arrested, Ali called for a "million march" for this Friday. It was unlikely that so many people would really venture on the streets. But there were some smaller protests, for example in Giseh near Cairo and in Kina near Luxor. Videos in social media showed protests whose participants accused Al-Sisi of corruption and demanded his departure. In these protests the police also used tear gas and rubber shots. These videos were initially not independently verified. From security circles it was said that the police had ended the protests.
From the city of Mansura in the Nile Delta, where demonstrators broke banners with the President's portrait last week, massive police presence was reported on Friday. Security forces built checkpoints in the city and on the outlying streets. In Cairo, several underground stations in the city centre were closed because of "maintenance work", most of the streets around the Tahrir Square, the heart of the 2011 Revolution, were blocked. And on the Rabaa Square, on which trailers of the fallen Muslim brother Mursi rode until the army took them under fire and killed up to 800 people, another measure should prevent dissatisfied ones from gathering: Sisi's Future Party wanted to hold a grand rally here for the President.
Mohamed Ali made these arrangements change his tactics: "Our goal doesn't have to be the Tahrir Square," said Ali in Barcelona in his video camera. "Don't let's get into the crowd with police officers." But as a retreater, that's not to be understood: "All Egypt is the Tahrir Square."
If the provider promises too much performance
The Internet connection always seems much slower than advertised by the provider, there are various testing possibilities.
If you enter into an Internet contract, you don’t need to trust the provider’s speed information blindly. Customers can check for themselves how much of it is actually achieved in case of conspicuousness.
Finally, the pre-announced transmission rates are a part of the contract and should therefore also be achieved, explains the Consumer Central Bavaria.
The connection seems to be much slower than advertised by the provider, there are various testing possibilities. For example, the measuring tools of the Federal Network Agency (BNetzA) measure the actual data transfer rates and compare them with the agreed rate in the contract.
"However, the tests of the suppliers are carried out in accordance with provider-specific specifications and are therefore not calculated uniformly and objectively," says the Consumer Centre Bavaria on its side.
If the connection is much slower than announced, customers can provide the provider with an appropriate time limit of usually 14 days to make the promised service. This is best done in writing by e-mail.
This does not do anything even after multiple requests, customers can terminate and may also claim damages. However, in the event of unfavourable success, only the cause of the complaint can be helped.
First high-ranking Republican for investigation
As the first senior Republican, the governor of Vermont has declared himself for an impeachment investigation against US President Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important, yes, and where that leads from here, is determined by the facts that are determined," said Phil Scott at a press conference on Thursday. He wants to know more about the Whistleblower affair before measures - an impeachment procedure can lead to the decommissioning of the president - are taken.
Scott said that he was not surprised by revelations that Trump had repeatedly asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyj to investigate intervention by the democratic presidential candidate and former vice-president Joe Biden in Ukraine, because Trump was watching Biden "for years".
Republicans have so far held back with criticism of Trump because of the Whistleblower affair; few have shown uneasiness. Scott’s statements are a first sign of this in Trump’s party. Scott, a moderate Republican, has already turned to Trump’s policy several times, for example, against the easing of environmental regulations and the strengthening of immigration rules.
Spider-Man remains in the MCU: More Marvel-Film planned
It was a shock to all Spider-Man fans: at the end of August it was known that Sony and Marvel will go separate ways in the future. Tom Holland’s Spider-Man would no longer be part of the "Avengers" universe. It was completely unclear how to continue with the films around Tom Holland.
Now the surprise: Spider-Man receives another final third film within the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) after "Spider-Man: Homecoming" and "Spider-Man: Far From Home". This report is consistent with several US media. According to this, the film is supposed to start in the USA as of 16 July 2021.
In the magazine "Screenrant" Marvel-Boos Kevin Feige is quoted: "I am pleased that Spidey's path is continued in the MCU. I and everyone at the Marvel-Studios are very pleased that we can continue working on it ... He is the only superhero with the ability to play in different universes, as Sony continues to work on his Spider-Verse. You never know what the future will bring".
But how does the sudden good news come? It is alleged that Sony Marvel has submitted an offer. According to industry magazines, the company Disney, which also belongs to Marvel, would participate with 30 percent in the revenue of upcoming Spider Man films. However, the news is not confirmed.
This is how Duchess Meghan and Prince Harry appear in the "Suits" finale.
After nine seasons, the series "Suits" in the USA has now reached the big finale. In the last episode, there were many happy endings and as many Cameo appearances. And also the generous couple Prince Harry (35) and his Meghan (38), who participated for many years in the series, was awarded a charming tribute. Attention, the following sections contain spoilers to the serial finale.
One thing ahead: Duchess Meghan did not return in the final for a final farewell greeting as Rachel Zane, at least not for new scenes. Instead, some retrospects showed once again the most memorable scenes with today’s Duchess. For example, the moments of the failed and the successful wedding with Mike or how she welcomed him after his lost imprisonment.
But her real husband, Prince Harry, was also mentioned casually in the "Suits" finale, of course, in a wedding scene. When Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman, 49) just stepped toward the altar to marry his fiancée Sheila (Rachael Harris, 51), Harvey Specter (Gabriel Macht, 47) makes a very significant remark about his suit. Whether he has actually overthrew a rock, the damned Harvey wants to know about the groom, just to say in a snippy way: "Louis, you are not the Prince of England."
Aegean: Baby and four other children drown in boat accidents
In the face of a refugee boat in the Aegean, a baby and four other children drowned. In total, seven people died during the disaster, as the Greek Coast Guard reported on Friday. Nationalities were still unclear.
The boat sank near the Greek island of Inousses, which lies between the island of Chios and the Turkish mainland. Four children, three women and five men could be saved.
Hundreds of migrants from Turkey are currently transferring to the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean. Last year, according to the United Nations Refugee Aid Agency (UNHCR), 174 people were killed on this route. Federal Minister for the Interior Horst Seehofer has now announced that he wants to visit both countries.
Together with his French colleague and the responsible Commissioner for the EU, he wanted to "informed himself in Turkey about the refugee situation," said Seehofer on Friday. Afterwards, he wanted to learn more about the "administrative problems of the Greeks" in Athens in order to help deal with them.
A speaker from the EU Commission confirmed on Friday the planned journey of Seehofers with EU Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos and France's Interior Minister Christophe Castaner.
In Greece many migrants from Turkey continue to arrive. On Tuesday alone, 654 people transferred to the Greek islands, it was said by the Greek Ministry of Civil Protection on Wednesday.
Does the Turkey deal still work?
The increase in the numbers last raised doubts about the functioning of the EU-Turkey agreement concluded in 2016. This provides that the EU can send back all refugees and migrants illegally crossing Turkey to the Greek islands. In return, the EU wanted to receive a Syrian refugee from Turkey for each displaced Syrian.
However, the processing of asylum applications is only laborious on the Greek side because of the lack of personnel. According to the Ministry of Civil Protection, Lesbos, Chios, Samos, Leros and Kos, they have nearly 29,400 people. The worst is the situation on Lesbos: 5200 migrants are currently accommodated in a camp of 650 people.
Never since the entry into force of the EU-Turkey Refugee Pact in March 2016 had it been so many, reported the State Rundfunk.
Climate change: heat leads to more heart attacks
According to doctors, climate change will test the health system in the future. Climate change is "very sure" to be one of the biggest challenges for the health system in the next 20 to 50 years, said Andreas Zeicher, President of the German Society for Cardiology. Especially the cardiovascular system made high temperatures and high temperature leaps within a short time and led to increased heart attacks. Especially people with cardiovascular diseases, elderly people and diabetics were affected.
Green politician must be responsible for embarrassing photo pans
The head of Canadian Greens, Elizabeth May, in the election campaign - was the cup manipulated for this reason?
The Canadian Green Chefin holds a multi-way cup in his hand in a photo. But now came out: The cup was manipulated.
Ottawa/Canada - It has remained unnoticed for quite a long time - and finally noticed. Elizabeth May, the head of the Canadian Greens, never held the reusable coffee cup with metal straw in her hand. On the party’s website she was shown on a photo with this cup, in conversation with citizens. However, the photo had already been published before and was also distributed to the media - and the cup was still a schnöder (Papp) cup, as the Canadian National Post reported.
Green Chefin must be responsible for photo pans
The National Post subsequently accused May of manipulation and that the Fake News Party produced more credible news to appear on the topic of "environmental protection". And this in the middle of an election campaign to the Lower House election, in which Trudeau is increasingly difficult because of a bribe scandal.
The photo went viral in the social media and objected to the discussion about Fake News. A user shares a comparison of the photos and writes: "The Greens manipulate a photo of their chairmen to hide their disposable cup".
May was shocked, and on her blog she was not aware of this action. To underline this, she immediately posted the original: she, in conversation with citizens, a cup in her hand. However, she said she was right, she was from bamboo. She always had it with her. A spokeswoman of the party said that it was only a matter of keeping the party logo in the picture, and not to cover something up. Of the photo there is only one section to see on the website.
May writes that she is sorry for the employee who did so. "I don't want to call him stupid, but there was nothing to hide," she says to the Guardian and at the same time asked her about her team, "If they want to edit an image again, couldn't they do something with my face, so I look younger?"
The German Greens have also come to shitstorms because of their use of disposable plastic or because of flight trips - but their pictures were not photoshopped. So the head of Bavarian Greens, Katharina Schulze, ate on vacation ice with plastic spoon, as Mercury.de* reported.
Influencerin wants free upgrade: Lifelong flight ban at Cathay
It is alleged that Jaqueline Ng was granted an upgrade via mail from Cathay Pacific. However, when she asked for it at check-in, she was not allowed on board - and she should never be allowed to fly with Cathay again.
Spontaneously get an upgrade for the Business Class - of which many passengers dream. Sometimes they are lucky, and the staff at the check-in offer a change from the Economy Class for free.
However, this case shows how not to do it: A self-explained influencer actively asked the Airline Cathay Pacific for a free upgrade. Followed by Jaqueline Ng more than 65,000 users. On May 30, it flew back from Taiwan to New York and on June 7th.
On the way, employees refused to upgrade Jaqueline, although they had presented an email in which their Cathay Pacific claimed to provide an upgrade. The letter wants the influencer to have received from an airline marketing employee. The airline, on the other hand, accuses Jaqueline of falsifying the mail.
On the return flight Jaqueline tried again to get an upgrade for the long-haul flight. This time the woman was supposed to have shown the same mail, but with another reference number. The staff at the airport JFK were skeptical: they hacked at the headquarters. And in fact, the employee from whom the mail was supposed to have refused mail contact with Jaqueline. This was also confirmed by the mail system in which the messages did not show up.
The airline staff at the airport canceled Jaquelines' ticket and imposed a lifelong ban on flight with Cathay Pacific. For 1,400 US dollars (about 1,280 euros) she had to buy a new flight ticket to Taiwan.
With her case, the influencer turned to Elliot Advocate, a company that represents consumer interests, because Cathay had paid her the price for her original ticket, but Jaqueline also claimed the cost of the new ticket.
But as long as Jaqueline does not submit the metadata of the mail, the case remains clear: for Cathay, the influencer has committed fraud, it remains blocked for future flights. Furthermore, the airline’s terms of business say that it does not have to pay for the new flight. Jaqueline does not want to be satisfied with it - and now turns on a lawyer.
Oil prices according to Yemen report on ceasefire
Oil prices fell by more than a dollar on Friday afternoon. Recently, a barrel (159 liters) of the North Sea type Brent cost 61.83 US dollars - about 1.4 percent less than the previous day. The price for a barrel of the American variety West Texas Intermediate (WTI) fell by 1.3 percent to 55.77 dollars.
The trigger for the course slide was a report from the Wall Street Journal on a ceasefire in Yemen. Saudi Arabia is said to have agreed to a ceasefire in four areas.
A drone attack on the oil plants in Saudi Arabia had caused five percent of the world’s oil production in mid-September. The Huthi rebels allied with Iran in the civil war country of Yemen had reported the attacks for themselves. Saudi Arabia, like the US government, is responsible for Iran. A ceasefire would remove the political tension in the region.
If an agreement is actually reached, one could focus on growth and demand concerns, said Ole Hansen, Head of the Raw Materials Strategy Department at the Saxo Bank of the Bloomberg news agency.
The oil prices continue its downward movement over the past few days. A week ago, a barrel of WTI oil cost up to almost 59 dollars, Brent almost 65 dollars.
Finally, Bloomberg had reported on insiders that the repair work on oil plants in Saudi Arabia after the attack was planned to progress faster than planned in mid-September. Consequently, the production volume had again reached a volume of eight million barrels per day and moved back towards the original quantity.
Last but not least, there were press releases calling on insiders to report on rapid progress made by the state oil group Saudi Aramco in the repair work. Raw material experts pointed out that Saudi Aramco is currently trying to avoid a stock exchange plan and negative headlines.
At the same time, there was some relaxation in the conflict between Iran and Western countries: the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" is more than two months after the arrest by Iran and the recently granted release is on the way to leaving the port. The crew is now preparing the departure, while the ship is still in front of anchor, Reederreichf Erik Hånell informed the Swedish radio in a text message on Friday morning.
However, the US announced that it would move defence missiles and soldiers to Iran’s archenemy to Saudi Arabia. The fear of escalation between the Islamic Republic and countries such as the United States and Great Britain had temporarily increased oil prices in recent weeks.
Complaints against Trump are intensifying
In the affair of possible abuse of power by US President Donald Trump, cover-up accusations against the White House have become loud. Several leading government staff would have made an intense effort to prevent access to the wording of the conversation at the end of July after a disputed telephone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyj. This was explained by an anonymous notifier. The spokesman of the House of Representatives, the Democrat Nancy Pelosi, explicitly accused the White House of "concealing". Trump spoke of a "hazard hunt".
North Korea considers the third summit of Trump and Kim to be questionable
North Korea has expressed doubts that a third summit of power-holder Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump will soon be held in the nuclear dispute. According to KCNA, the top diplomat Kim Kye-gwan said on Friday that the meaning and prospects of such a meeting would be questionable due to the lack of progress in implementing agreements of the first summit in Singapore.
The US has so far done nothing to implement the decisions of the summit in the previous year, said the consultant of the North Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He also criticised US sanctions and the joint military maneuvers of the USA and South Korea. However, he hopes in a "wise" and "terrorous" decision Trumps so that there will be another approach.
Trump had said on Monday that he wanted to know what a third summit with Kim was supposed to do before he agreed to do so. Negotiations on disarmament of the North Korean nuclear and rocket program have been under way since the failed second summit of Trump and Kim in Hanoi in February. In June, both met in the demilitarized zone between the two Korean states. They agreed to revitalize the consultations but so far without great success.
Prince Harry: Weapons manufacturers should help in mine clearance
The British Prince Harry in Angola symbolically lit and destroyed a bomb mine. Near a camp of the British Halo Trust at the place of Dirico, he created the ignition circle. At a safe distance, the explosive exploded. With a view to the goal of getting Angola free of mines by 2025, he later demanded in front of running TV cameras: "I call on all the countries whose names stand on these weapons, but who have not helped in the way to commit themselves to help".
Pounds under pressure - interest rate reduction expected
British Pound under Pressure
In view of the rapid decline in interest rates, the pound loses value over the euro.
Frankfurt speculations on an early fall in the interest rate of the Bank of England (BoE) add up to the sterling pound. The UK currency decreased by up to 0.4 percent on Friday to 1.2269 dollars.
Sales led to statements by the sheet banker Michael Saunder, who talked about a reduction in interest rates, even if a chaotic Brexit could be averted, as the uncertainty would affect the British economy for a foreseeable time. This statement was surprising, as Saunders was regarded as the advocate of a restrictive monetary policy, said Analyst Ricardo Evangelista of the Brokerhaus ActivTradees.
Last week, the Bank of England had already pointed out the burden on the economy of the Brexit hack without directly signaling a reduction in interest rates. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, if necessary, wants to lead his country out of the EU without a divorce agreement until 31 October.
More: With his provocations, the British Prime Minister took a high risk, but it could pay off for him, says Handelsblatt editor Kerstin Leitel.
Doping: Other Russian manipulations proved
Material from the Moscow analysis laboratory is manipulated - this is confirmed by David Howman, former director of the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) and today's head of integrity of the World athletics Association.
At the start of the World Championships, new details of the doping scandal in Russia are emerging - and they are destroying the little credibility that Russian sports had won back at the beginning of the year and even in the beginning. In January 2019, the Moscow doping lab finally delivered the required samples from 2012 to 2015 to the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada). Now it turned out: They were faked.
In December 2014, systematic fraud in Russian sports had been revealed, and the Wada had banned the Russian anti-doping agency (Russia) for three years. During this time, Russian athletes were not completely banished from the world stage. The International Olympic Committee, after an individual examination at the 2016 Summer Games in Rio, had around 270 athletes of the country under neutral flag, and at the winter games in February 2018 168 Russian athletes were on the run. Even at the World Cup in the various sports, they were allowed to be there, in the summer even the World Football World Cup took place with the host as participants.
Missing positive results
In the following September, the Wada lifted the Rusada ban again, but requested access to the laboratory and the said samples. The data should reveal the extent of the cover-up of doping cases in the state doping. They should help punish athletes afterwards. Three months later, they were delivered s.
However, the chairman of the independent integrity commission (AIU) of the World athletics Association (IAAF) has now confirmed that the doping data from the Moscow analysis laboratory was manipulated. "Yes. We have received the data nine months ago. We should check whether the task force has received the right data," said David Howman in the interview of the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung" of Friday. "We have detected numerous discrepancies between the data that the Wada received from a whistleblower and those that it received from the Russians in January". Many positive findings were missing that were mentioned in the McLaren report.
The World Cup not affected
This confirms the attitude of the IAAF: the athletics association is the only organization holding fast to the ban on Russia. At the Doha World Cup, 30 Russian athletes are starting under neutral flag. They had to prove that they are training outside the Russian system and undergo tests.
At the beginning of this week, the Wada manipulations had already been put into the room and asked Russia to respond to the accusations within three weeks. Russia is now threatening the new blockage of the Russian Federation and, in the worst case, the exclusion from the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo.
