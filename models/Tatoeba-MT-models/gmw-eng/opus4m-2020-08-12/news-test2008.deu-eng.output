Food Debt in European Inflation
The main reason for the increase in inflation measured in the euro area is the rapid rise in food prices.
In the 13 eurozone countries, inflation was higher in November than expected - after the 2.6% in October, an annual inflation rate of 3.1 percent was recorded, as reported by the EU Statistical Office in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts are based on only 3%, reports Bloomberg.
In contrast to the US, UK, and Canadian notes bank, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not lowered the leitzsins. Its discretion is that the reduction in interest rates would favour the rise in commodity prices and the slight decline in unemployment in the creation of an inflation spiral.
The ECB is committed to keeping the inflation rate below two percent, or at least close to the two-percent mark.
According to one analyst, the ECB is in the middle of the coin: inflation must be "agreed" to exclude the need for action later on.
With 3.3 percent, the inflation rate reached a 12-year record high in November in Germany; in Spain, the rate climbed from 3.6 to 4.1 percent.
The increase in inflation in the euro area is responsible for rising food and energy prices.
The MATIF wheat quotations increased by 88 percent, and the price for soybeans also reached a record high since 1973.
There was also a significant increase in food oil and dairy products in 2007.
The world market price for crude oil rose by 52 percent this year - last month the price per barrel of black gold reached almost 100 US dollars.
According to the ECB, inflation will rise from 2.1 to 2.5 percent in 2008, but it is expected to fall to 1.9 percent in 2009.
For the next 3-4 months, analysts assume a 3-percent inflation rate, but the annual average rate is 2.1 percent.
In 2008, experts expect the ECB to reduce interest rates twice.
Gallup locates the government crisis
After a long period of stagnation, the number of Fidesz sympathizers grew considerably by the beginning of December. For the first time since 2002, the party has the largest base camp, while the agreement for the socialists has reached an unprecedented low of 13 percent, according to Gallup.
In the case of the party faithful voters, the difference is clearly clear thanks to the high determination of the opposition supporters: more than two thirds (71 percent) are opposed to a fifth (20 percent) approval for the MSZP.
According to the survey, MDF and SZDSZ are under parliamentary entry barriers: they come to two percent in the total population.
The number of party voters has grown by one percent in both camps.
Compared to the last low, the general economic mood has further deteriorated - never before has the proportion of those who consider the country's economic situation to be "expressed bad" been so high (41 percent), while another 46 percent consider it to be quite "bad".
After more hopeful prospects in spring and summer, families see the change in their financial situation as more pessimistic.
For the coming year, the majority of the population expects a further deterioration in the situation; only one-tenth is expected to improve.
A Gallup survey conducted in December revealed that 71% of respondents - a historic high - considered the Prime Minister's work to be "a rather bad thing than right".
Thirteen percent of respondents generally have high confidence or confidence in Ferenc Gyurcsány, while the share of supporters for Viktor Orbán represents 38 percent.
About 54% do not trust the head of government at all, compared with 27% distrust of the party leader of Fidesz.
One of the indicators of political mood is the number of those who think that dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister could be managed without changing government.
After the unrest last October, 35% voted for the government and the head of government, this figure is only 20%, while the relative majority (33%) sees the solution only in new elections.
Asked about their interest in the referendum, 60 percent replied that they would participate "certainly" and another 20% would give their vote "probably".
In comparison, if the parliamentary elections were to take place on this Sunday, only 55 percent would "certainly" go to the urns, another 15% would consider their participation "likely". In view of these trends, the outcome of the referendum would be foreseeable.
74% would vote against the study fees, 79% against the practice fee, and 84% against the hospital's daily allowance.
Based on the group of participants in the referendum "certainly" the proportions of opponents of study, practice and hospital fees would be as much as 81, 84, and 89 percent respectively.
Also most expensive, Tesco increased by almost a fifth
The hypermarkets in the Budaörs trade area have maintained the average price increase of 16% of last year, with the difference that there was no increase in VAT this year.
Articles from Napi Gazdaság
In the Budaörs trade triangle, the price of the usual Christmas basket of the "Napi" increased by 16 percent this year, but price increases of over 1,000 HUF were recorded in all hypermarkets.
After prices in food markets have been "gallopised" last December, inflation has not declined dramatically, compared with the already high, earlier baseline level.
However, it is certainly a deterrent to consumers that what they paid for last year was far below 9 000 HUF, not even for 10,000 HUF, this year.
The price of the "Napi" shopping cart exceeded the magical 10,000 HUF limit by at least 91 HUF in the markets under investigation.
The highest price was 10,573 HUF.
(In 6800 the price was 6,800 HUF.)
The prices for Unicum and live fish remained close to the previous year's level, while the prices for Putenbrustfilets, Nuss and Mohn have increased considerably.
Prices for flour and bread corresponded to the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary, but there were 1 kg of bread wakes for 139 Forint at Auchan.
There was no competitive fall in price for the product under 200 Forint.
Also surprising was the price of a two litre Coca-Cola deposit bottle of less than 200 Forint, so the drink cost only 257 HUF, including the pledge.
Nevertheless, this year in the "Napi" shopping cart comparison also cut off most expensive, and Cora best.
Our calculations have shown that Cora's prices in the "Napi" shopping cart compared to the Christmas prices last year have increased by 15, while Tesco and Auchan have increased by 18 percent each.
The difference between the cheapest shopping cart of the previous year and the most expensive of today's year was 12%, while the increase between the cheapest shopping cart last year and the most expensive of the current year was 21%.
The average price increase was 1.480,00 HUF.
The average price increase in the previous year was 1.206,00 Forint, but the increase in VAT in the prices at last Christmas was noticeable.
It is precisely this process that has affected trade: it seems that the department stores have not been able to make the right decision on the price range to apply to the individual articles, as the price increase had an inevitable effect on consumer behaviour.
(If the dealer does not plan the speed of circulation of a product, it may fall by substantial profits in the price range, which depends on the traffic intensity.)
The price of the "Napi" basket last year was so radical that the most expensive basket exceeded the value of 2006 by 1720 Forint, whereas the price difference in the cheapest basket was only 844 Forint.
This year such extremes were not observed, as the most expensive basket cost 1.630,00 Forint more than in the previous year, and even at the cheapest there was a price increase of 1.284.00 Forint.
Compared with the last two Christmas seasons, there was a catastrophic price increase, and the price of daily consumer goods in the hypermarkets increased by more than 30 percent in less than 20 months.
(This, in turn, does not necessarily confirm the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary: in some basic food, the Statistical Office established a more than 30 per cent price over the period of 12 months.
So in about flour as well as eggs.)
However, if you take a look at the "Napi" shopping cart, this seems almost impossible at the latter, as the price level of the product already expensive in the previous year even in the worst case has increased by barely more than 10 percent.
Obviously, flour suppliers are in a stronger position than egg suppliers - after all, they were able to shift the drastic price increase to the multis.
In the golden trade triangle, the hypermarkets do not complain; good years are constantly reported.
Our experience shows that the majority of customers in the three warehouses no longer look at the prices.
There are all large quantities purchased, sustainable food goes in pallets over the store tables.
Wednesday morning there were endless snakes at the cash register in all three stores in the morning, when suddenly the number of customers exploded.
However, a lower customer frequency is reported by the country, so that many multis complain to opinion researchers that they could not even achieve the planned turnover, not only for food but also for sustainable consumer goods.
Disinfectants are saved in many places
More than a thousand infections were recorded in hospitals, due to improper treatment of antibiotics.
The hygienic conditions in the hospitals, the overstocking of the beds, the overload of the staff - all factors that do not exactly contribute to the control of the infections, according to the senior doctor of the National Epidemiology Center.
In many places, disinfectants are also saved.
In the traumatology department of János Hospital, MRSA infection has recently been diagnosed.
The bacterium resistant to antibiotics was found in a male patient who was hospitalized after a serious accident.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year there was a similar infection here.
The injury of a major car accident was released from the hospital, but a little later the man had to return with an MRSA infection. An important operation has not yet been performed because of the bacterium that is still in the patient’s body.
By 10 December of this year, infections to the National Nosocomialis Surveillance System were reported from hospitals in 1094 by multi-resistant pathogens, according to the senior physician of the National Epidemiology Center, Karolina Böröcz.
So many infections caused by multi-resistant pathogens have certainly been registered in hospitals, but the dark number is probably higher.
About two thirds of the infections (683 cases) were triggered by the MRSA, the Staphylococcus aureus resistant to methicillin oxacillin.
The Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacterium carries about a third of the people in its nose without causing any disease.
SA-related infections (such as cervical inflammation, almond inflammation, inflammation of the skin or wounds) usually react well to antibiotics, they are well curable.
However, if the drugs are dosed too high or used improperly, the well-responding bacteria produce antibiotics-resistant, which spread rapidly in the hospitals under appropriate conditions.
Especially in patients with impaired, or permanently malfunctioning immune system, but also in elderly, or patients with low body weight, these bacteria can cause serious infections, such as wound infection or blood poisoning, i.e. sepsis.
According to the medical director of the János hospital, MRSA infection is nothing special, such incidents belong to the daily hospital.
One should not confuse the infection with the epidemic, Tibor Nyulasi - MRSA only does not exist where it is not sought.
Resistant to Antibiotics
"Such patients are isolated, the nursing staff wears rubber gloves and masks in the care, and we have the antibiotics necessary for the treatment" - said Tibor Nyulasi.
While patients are being examined for MRSA when they are sent to the hospital, infection cannot always be avoided.
Sample withdrawals too rarely
The majority of the infections caused by MRSA in hospitals would be avoidable, but the current prevailing conditions and circumstances would be unfavourable for limiting the emergence or spread of the multi-resistant pathogen, says Karolina Böröcz.
After this infection occurs mainly in hospitals and nursing homes, hospitals should examine the patients who have been delivered and immediately isolate MRSA infected patients.
In Hungarian hospitals, however, microbiological sampling is not so often practiced.
Not least because there are no subsidies for this investigation from the public health insurance fund.
Therefore, most cases would not come to light until the patient has already had a noticeable MRSA infection, according to the medical director of the epidemiology center.
There are strict recommendations from the European Union on the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine, but there are also guidelines for the treatment of certain infections and disease patterns in Hungary.
Antibiotic therapies should be targeted, i.e. microbiological investigations are necessary so that no resistance to the drug can be formed, but this directive of hospitals is not always complied with.
Among the outpatient or basic patients, microbiological sampling is even more rare, says Karolina Böröcz.
It is saved in disinfectants.
Scientific evidence shows that MRSA is most often transmitted by nurses from one patient to another.
That is why handwashing or wearing gloves and masks is of great importance, but there are also significant shortcomings in hospitals in this area.
MRSA is transmitted by droplet infection or contact, but in the domestic hospitals there is not always the possibility to isolate the infected patient.
The rooms are often overcrowded, the beds close to each other, although there should be a distance of at least 1.5 meters between them from an epidemiological point of view.
Unfortunately, as Karolina Böröcz further notes, in the financially less well-off hospitals, it even occurs that in disinfectants is saved, there are few caregivers, many patients - all factors that directly favour the emergence of infections.
Such infections are proven to be far less frequent there, or the further spread of the pathogen can be stopped where these protective measures are observed, says Karolina Böröcz.
Government programme against MRSA
MRSA infections in the control of the health insurance causes enormous costs, so they are fought everywhere.
In England, for example, the prevention of MRSA or its mitigation has been retained in the government programme.
After first signs, the program is successful - as published data show, the trend of MRSA infections in England is declining.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDC) has declared the prevention of the emergence of multi-resistant pathogens (including MRSA) and the prevention of infections in hospitals to be one of its priorities.
Death driver police officer was not drunk
In the case of a fatal car accident caused by the police chief of the XXII District, the official opinion is now available.
The now retired head of police of the XXII District, who killed a pedestrian on Tuesday in a car accident, was neither alcoholic nor drug-influenced, said Attila Morvai, the press spokesman of the Budapest Supreme Prosecutor's Office on Friday after the official opinion was submitted to the case.
The opinion confirmed the results of the first investigation, according to which the chief of police had not consumed alcohol before taking the tax.
The former chief of police bog with his own car in the XXII district entered Kossuth Lajos Straße, crossing a 55-year-old man who crossed the street in an unmarked place.
(According to StVO, however, this is not a milding circumstance - the handlebar has, even if pedestrians do not cross the street at the zebra strip, subordinate.)
The pedestrian has suffered his injuries after being sent to the hospital.
According to police reports, the handlebar suffered a shock, then returned to its functions, and requested retirement.
The Budapest Public Prosecutor's Office has initiated investigations into the incident.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former chief of police had cooperated with the investigators from the outset.
Additional EUR 400 million for infrastructure
Minister of Finance János Veres and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), signed three credit loans in Budapest on Friday totalling EUR 400 million.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) approved a EUR 300 million framework for the financing of transport and environmental projects implemented with grants from the Cohesion Fund. The loan agreement over 100 million has already been signed earlier, the current agreement concerns the use of the EUR 200 million granted.
The sum of EUR 150 million agreed in the loan agreement will also be spent on the budgetary financing of educational projects.
The EIB has approved a total of EUR 300 million for this purpose for Hungary; the use of the remaining EUR 150 million will later be decided as part of the extension of the loan contract.
In the field of innovation, the contracting parties have signed an agreement of EUR 50 million, which will mainly flow into research and development programmes at the University of Debrecen.
Subway line 4 was also discussed at the meeting.
It was agreed that once Hungary has clarified the details of underground financing with the EU, the original contract and possible modifications will be re-examined.
According to János Veres, this would be possible in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed a total of 113 projects worth EUR 8.4 billion in Hungary.
The loan interest rates are EURIBOR-bound, the loan is made available by the EIB with an 8-year delay, commission-free.
Bulgaria, the EU's real estate paradise
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is fabulous - the whole of Europe is looking at the previously rarely mentioned Balkan State.
What, where, and who still buys the EU's cheapest market, but who is rapidly becoming more expensive?
An analysis of the Bulgarian Re/Max Division.
Bulgaria is currently the most sought after patch for real estate purchases in Eastern Europe, with cheap ski apartments and seafront houses.
Between the mountains, the regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are among the most popular; by the sea, Albumena, the "Gold Coast", the "Sun Coast", and the historic towns of Sozopol and Nessebar the racers, however, real estate around Kavarna and Balcik are increasingly in demand.
According to estimates from Re/Max analysts in Bulgaria, the interior of the country sooner or later also attracts investors, such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, and Triavna, and also the very cheap area of Russians records more buyers.
The capital Sofia also offers tempting offers - trade and office space offer highest returns.
Bulgaria is on the best way to become one of the most attractive European golfer paradises, thus attracting tourists in addition to the summer and winter seasons as well in the two other seasons.
Foresight - looking investors are already shopping in a big style, for example around Bansko.
According to analysts, people who buy real estate in Bulgaria are also seeking a change in their lifestyle.
Most buyers are English, but there are also interested people from France, Belgium, Spain, and more and more from Romania.
Investors from Malta and Cyprus are also present, while there are mainly Russian buyers at the Black Sea and in the ski resorts.
There are three groups of foreign buyers, says Georgij Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Those who want to settle down buy either revitalized properties by 50-100.000 euros, or down houses by 5-15,000 euros, which they then renovate themselves.
Good connectivity and accessibility as well as communication opportunities are widely written, but the proximity to a big city, shops and doctors are also crucial for the buyers.
The second category includes those who are looking for a holiday home (Bulgaria was listed among the top ten holiday destinations of the Germans in December).
The third group constitutes business people who invest with the aim of a medium to long-term increase in value.
Real estate in the capital, however, is becoming increasingly expensive, due to the ever-growing demand.
Within the EU, real estate prices are lowest in Bulgaria, but in the last five years there has been an annual price increase of 21 percent.
The price of real estate is far above the increase in salaries.
Fodor and the six Hungarian percentages
As Environment Minister Gábor Fodor announced, the expert meetings will end on Tuesday, and the debate on the international climate regime after 2012 will be continued by the ministers on Wednesday after the official opening.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries advise on Bali's roadmap setting out the emission-reducing measures for the post-2012 period, i.e. after the end of the Kyoto Protocol.
There is currently a heated debate between industrialized and developing countries.
The US has already indicated that they do not want to negotiate concrete figures, but they would be willing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 percent by 2020 compared to 1990.
The other major issue of the conference is whether the developed countries are prepared to support both financially and technologically in addition to reducing emissions.
An agreement on the support of developing countries has also been reached.
The adaptation fund under the Kyoto Protocol is to be managed by a 16-member Council, likely to be managed by the UN Global Environment Facility (GEF), as reflected in the "Piac és Profit".
Hungary's 6 percent
On behalf of Hungary, Minister of the Environment Gábor Fodor supports the EU's efforts to maintain its pioneering role in global climate action and to achieve a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister stated that the EU would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020 (as measured by the 1990 figures), regardless of whether the "after 2012" agreement was achieved successfully, or not. The Union would even be willing to support a 30% reduction, provided that other major industrialized countries in the world, or developing countries, are also prepared to meet their commitments by strength and responsibility.
Gábor Fodor stressed that the objective of the States that joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 was a reduction of only 5.2 percent, whereas the EU and its 15 Member States had already committed to a reduction of 8%.
The objective for Hungary is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6% compared to 1985-87 - a requirement that will be fully met, as can be seen in the Ministry of the Environment's press release.
The commitment is high on Bali - after all, the long-term international climate policy agreement must be completed within two years, otherwise it would certainly not enter into force until after 2012. In this case, the reduction project defined in the Kyoto-defined reduction project would not follow a renewed international emission reduction system, whose importance was also highlighted by the IPCC, the international Nobel Peace Prize Scientific Climate Change Committee of the UN in its recent report.
This would delay emission reduction, and increasing Earth's average temperature by more than 2°C would be inevitable, which according to scientists would lead to extremely serious and irreparable consequences.
British Army recruits on YouTube
British Army units have published recordings of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan to increase popularity on the video portal.
The British Air Force (RAF) first discovered YouTube for itself: Special Units Stationed in Afghanistan have been broadcasting videos on operations conducted against the Taliban since March 2006, reports the BBC.
The shots, which are fixed on helmets, are controlled at Kandahar Air Force Base and then sent to London, where they are placed on the Internet.
Political message inevitable
Soldiers of the Air Force have already contributed 139 such recordings, their "channel" was considered more than 75,000 times.
The British Ministry of Defence was registered under "defenceheadquarters" in spring 2007 to publish videos on Iraqi and Afghan operations, but also the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Commonwealth Office) and the international peacekeeping forces (MNFI) located in Iraq have their own YouTube channels.
Action in Afghanistan
Originally, the Luftwaffe has published the videos with the aim of recruiting soldiers, and as the Ministry of Defence says, the contributions also serve the purpose of informing the population of the real objectives of foreign operations.
This kind of propaganda published is almost free of charge compared to conventional television advertising, according to defense expert Gordon Mackenzie to the BBC, however, these videos always carry a certain amount of political message, as they confirm the existence of the military measures adopted by the government in their own way.
Americans advertise with game
But the army must also fight against amateur shots, which, in addition to the carefully processed, censored recordings, also make it into the net - such as those that show the death of the soldiers: in the somewhat hypocritical, "official" propaganda films, the losses are at most talked about, but the bloody sides of the war are not shown.
By the way, many videos have already been loaded on the platform from the war scenes in Iraq and Afghanistan, but the British recently discovered this "gattung".
The Americans, however, advertise in a slightly different way, namely with the free downloadable shooting game "America's Army", in which the player can slip into the skin of the soldier in the framework of a more or less life-like simulation.
Christmas celebration with Tombola and Pogatsche in the Ministries
Minister of Labour Monika Lamperth is by no means inconvenient: instead of a Christmas celebration, she organizes a work conference in which her employees can finish the year 2007 with coffee and poachers.
Some ministries celebrate with live music, other enchanting Christmas moods with Tombola or incitement into the official hearts.
Party, Christmas mood, concerts and buffet - this is how power celebrates.
The christmas fever has already been registered by the offices.
The largest Christmas celebration of a ministry will be held this year in the defence department, but not the staff of the ministry are expected to do so.
At the "Christmas celebration of the orphans" children are donated by fallen soldiers, at the "Mission celebration" family members are hosted by soldiers currently stationed abroad, but there is also a reception for the press.
The resort provides around 25 million for the celebrations.
Compared to other departments, the National Agency for Development (NFDC) and the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Transport hit the strands.
The 4.32 million Forint expensive Christmas celebration of the Ministry of Economics will be held in the House of the future, approximately 350 of the 600 employees are expected.
The focus of the celebrations is on Christmas, but there will also be live acts and a Tombola ransom.
The National Agency for Development (NFÜ) held its 4.7 million Forint expensive Christmas celebration on Wednesday at the House of the State Justice Council (OIT) with concerts and a feast.
The room rental amounted to 1 million forint, the rest was spent on more than 400 loaded guests.
According to our information, a department of the NFÜ is also invited at another Christmas celebration organized by the Hungarian Economic Development Centre (MAG Zrt) from EU funds.
For the celebration the building of the music theater ("Vígszínház") was rented.
The MAG Zrt has not confirmed this information because we have not reached the responsible.
What's the suit for?
The OIT building was not only open to the guests of the NFÜ, but also to the Ministry of Justice and Police, which held the Lucia Ball there instead of a Christmas celebration on 7 December.
They did not have to pay rent to the OIT for the use of the premises.
About 500 visitors came to the ball.
The celebrations were opened with a speech by the minister, after the dinner there was live music to dance.
On request of [origo] they were told: There was no ball dress or suit obligation at the ball.
The ministries for health, work, and self-administration prepare themselves for puritan celebration.
The Ministry of Health organizes the celebration for the employees in its own four walls for around 400,000 Forint.
Minister of Labour Monika Lamperth officially invites her employees not to a Christmas celebration, but to the conference on the annual sound.
One expects about 180 guests, who - according to the press department - are only served with coffee and poachsche, so the celebration goes out with 350,000 forint.
Self-government minister Gordon Bajnai and his colleagues will just start up in the ministry's auditorium.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) organizes a Christmas celebration in its own Festsaal, to which 436 employees are expected.
The expenditures were measured at 2,500 Forint per capita - for this money there is a buffet reception with subsequent start-up.
Since the beginning of the term of office of János Veres, the PM employees celebrate this way every year.
However, there will not be a proper party vote - not only because of the official speech of the minister but also because the celebration was scheduled for the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture invites you to a new year's reception on 20 January, and the ministry's Christmas celebration falls out this time.
The one hundred guests are invited to the Vajdahunyad Castle in the city park ("Városliget") and according to the information of the resort the expenses are with 1,000 Forint per guest.
As the press department reports, it will be a very easy stand to which only foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary will be invited.
The receptions held each year traditionally begin with a brief address from the minister and sound with restraining stains.
As the corresponding press agencies report on [origo] inquiry, there will be neither a Christmas celebration at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs nor at the Ministry of Education.
The press department of the Ministry of the Environment could not provide any information on the cost of the Christmas celebration.
In any case, more than 400 guests were invited to the celebration, which is held at the Kunstgewerbemuseum.
More and more forces are mobilising for giant strike
The League of Trade Unions and the Hungarian Trade Union Federation will set up on Friday its Coordination Committee for the strike of indefinite duration starting on Monday.
On Saturday a large-scale protest assembly will be held, on Monday - on the day of the referendum to the Health Insurance Act - work will begin.
It is expected that strike-related, significant traffic obstacles will occur, as rail transport will be almost completely discontinued, and Budapest public transport companies (BKV) will also strike by 1 p.m.
Details of the strike on Monday will be jointly announced on Friday afternoon by the League Trade Unions and the Trade Union Federation.
A LIGA - MOSZ Strike Committee is also being set up, which is responsible for coordinating the actions on Monday.
On Saturday, a large-scale protest assembly will be held, and from Monday on, all the organisations that joined the strike will lay down the work for an indefinite period unless agreement is reached with the government.
In other words, the end of the strike on the day of Parliament's vote on the Health Insurance Act was not defined.
Should the National Council not adopt the Health Insurance Act, trade unions will immediately take back the call for strike.
However, if the law is adopted, the strike committees will meet to discuss further action.
Due to the agenda of the National Council on Monday, it is even imaginable that it will not come to the vote on the Health Insurance Act until the later evening hours, or even at midnight.
The strikes starting on Monday will have to expect significant traffic obstacles: the railways will lay down their work for an indefinite period of time, in the morning the majority of public transport and more than half of the Volán companies will stand still.
At the same time, there will be many motorway locks in a direction.
The call for strike has been followed by numerous trade unions and civil organizations - the list of participants is constantly updated on the League website.
Some organizations announced strikes at an indefinite time, others are planning a fixed-term settlement.
Until Thursday afternoon, there was still no agreement on sufficient services between the Hungarian railway MÁV and the Free Trade Union of the VDSZSZ railways, although more and more people are on the way around Christmas holidays.
According to previous reports, the BKV will be stretched from operating start to 1 p.m. at Budapest Airport between 7 a.m. and 9 p.m., the LIGA Power and Heat Energy Trade Unions will lay down the work for four hours, and the teachers' union, i.e. the Democratic Teachers' Union, has called for 2 and 2-8 hours of strikes.
The Hungarian Association of Physicians covers an alternative nationally at various times, the EDDSZ, the trade union trade union of health and social workers, a suborganisation of the SzEF, the forum for trade union cooperation, holds a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four points demanded by the league is that the government take back the draft health insurance reform and submit a new concept for social discourse.
The second claim concerns the gradual introduction of the new pension calculation model, which will be due from the next year onwards.
Claim number three says that the eligible professional groups are already allowed access to the early retirement system before 2010.
The fourth point is that the VDSZSZ, which is part of the league trade unions, has not accepted the offer submitted by the Ministry of Transport concerning the secondary lines and is now calling for a new approach.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard Increases State Risk
According to the Risk Analysis Division of Political Capital, the activities of the Hungarian Guard, founded in August with the support of the "Better Hungary Movement", have increased the risk of Hungary and the region in several ways.
Among other things, the "risk warning report" of the Institute states that, in connection with the activities of the Hungarian Guard, the highest political risk is the "enhancement of the existing ethnic tensions between the Gypsy and non-Gypsy populations in Hungary, which could even lead to violent ethnic conflicts in the short term".
The main reason for this is the strategy of the Hungarian Guard, which is probably aimed at provoking such a dispute, says the Research Institute.
As reported, this is seen as a failure on the part of the political leaders: "Persons of public life have left the discussion of the Roma question to representatives of radical political groups who have now built their political strategy on the Roma-Hungary contradiction".
It is believed that this would aggravate the problem, make reasonable dialogue impossible, promote extremities and increase the likelihood of violent conflicts.
The research institute also believes that the activities of the Hungarian Guard, not least thanks to the enormous attention of the domestic and foreign media, "had significantly damaged the image of Hungary abroad, especially in terms of confidence in stability and democratic maturity".
We remember: since autumn 2006 the reorganisation of radical and extreme right-wing groups in Hungary has been constantly on the rise, so that since summer 2007 several organizations called "national self-defense association" have been founded.
"These groups are commonplace that they define themselves as civil organizations, while openly boasting of preparing their members for - sometimes armed - defence tasks (catastrophe protection, national defence, order-keeping), calling on the improbability of the police, the army, the army of the state itself," it said.
And then again: all of this is done in accordance with the method of trying to disguise different political and party-drugs based on the political and party-drugs of the population as a bourgeois initiative.
The emphasis on the civil character and form of the union is not merely to avoid legal obstacles that might arise in the course of the registration to court - it is at the same time a political strategy.
As the analysis shows, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are also a risk-enhancing factor for relations with neighbouring countries.
"In recent months, the Hungarian Guard has been cited as a potential source of danger in several neighbouring countries, according to some ultra-nationalist politicians of certain neighbouring countries, in the emergence of the Hungarian Guard, the confirmation of its own anti-Hungary policy.
All of this has an impact on the political stability of the region" - it was said.
From the point of view of the Research Institute, the establishment of the Hungarian Guard is not a single phenomenon in Central and Eastern Europe, so the political risk for the whole region has increased.
As reported, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are comparable to those of the Bulgarian National Guard, which was announced in August 2007 by the right-wing extreme Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
In the background of the formation of the Bulgarian Guard, the Roma mass outrages took place in a district of Sofia (Krasna Poljana).
The BNU took the incidents as the reason for the establishment of the National Guard, with the argument that the aim of the organisation of "national protection" was.
In their opinion, over the past 17 years, a real "gypsy terror" in Bulgaria has been felt, but the state remained indifferent and indifferent - according to Political Capital.
Furthermore, the initiative would have started a heated debate in the Bulgarian public.
As has been said, the increased risk of ethnic conflict is also demonstrated by the fact that some Bulgarian Roma organisations have announced to set up their own guard for resistance purposes.
Since the activities of the Hungarian Guard have so far shown many similarities with those of the Bulgarian National Guard, it is not to be excluded that Hungarian Roma also react to the threats with the organisation of their own protection, according to the Political Capital risk warning report.
Attila Juhász, Research Director at Political Capital, said at the request of the news agency: Risk analysis is one of the activities of the Research Institute.
Annual risk analysis reports would be published, and if risk-changing trends are identified, public opinion will be informed as in the case of the issue of the risk-warning report.
Holidays are not everywhere holidays
In Hungary holidays are regulated by law, so that the practice of re-disposing the working days around the holidays has now established itself, but the coming year gives us less such days.
Also in the EU and in America, something else is understood as "holiday".
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes between state holidays and non-working days.
Working days are mostly church holidays, or are related to significant historical events.
For example, we also celebrate New Year: Both the last day of the old and the first day of the new year are work-free days - the latter alone can rest with the New Year's celebrations.
All year round we have a total of fourteen holidays.
The state holidays are March 15th, which commemorates the 1848 Revolution, and October 23rd, the anniversary of the 1956 Revolution.
On August 20th, the founding of the state, celebrated on May 1st, on November 1st and 2nd, we commemorate our dead.
In addition, there are two holidays each at Easter, Pentecost, and Christmas.
Since our public, national or religious holidays rarely fall on a weekend, the practice of "workday shift" has proven itself in cases where we would only work one day before or after the holiday.
The price of extended weekends, however, is that we have to work very well on Saturdays before, or go to school.
When this day, which falls before or after the holiday, is finally to be completed, the Minister of Labour has been in a separate regulation for many years.
The legislation applies equally to all employers and employees, to public employees and civil servants of the public service.
Only companies and establishments in which the operation is continued without interruption, including during the holidays, are excluded.
Today, the working order is only somewhat confused by the holidays at the end of the year: from 24 December, life in this country remains formal, since most of the days between Christmas and New Year's Eve take time compensation, or the holiday that has been specifically withdrawn.
Next year more holidays will fall into the middle of the week, or to the end of the week, so that there will be fewer re-dispositions during the working days than this year.
The calendar is first put "on the head" around the day of work, so that people can stay at home for four days at the same time.
Saturday, April 26 will be a working day so that Friday, May 2 may be a day of rest.
The second re-disposition is related to the holiday on October 23rd: on Saturday, October 18th, you will have to finish Friday, October 24th in advance.
The end of the year, however, will remain in the sign of the holidays, after everything will be left from 24 December, even if New Year's Eve falls on a Wednesday.
Six dissuasive little things to offend workmates
Emails that we forget to send, voice messages that we never receive - harmless lies that we no longer notice: they bring "color" into everyday life at work.
The question is whether to get used to these small inconveniences, or to the challenge better and try to avoid them misunderstanding, consciously for other annoying situations.
Tips.
"Sorry, I forgot to point you out that someone from the marketing department called" - says a colleague.
That they missed a meeting?
At best, one regrets it and tries to make it up again by perhaps calling at the marketing department and remorsefully confessing that one had forgotten to direct the message (this is the less common method).
Most of the time, the matter is settled with an excuse.
Before you get caught up in embarrassing excuses, think about what you can do to make your colleagues truly unpleasant moments and try to avoid these situations consciously.
Borrow something you don't own?
There's hardly anything more annoying than grabbing a document, office accessories, or the phone, but it's not there.
Yesterday, the lifting machine was still on the desk - it's gone this morning?
Or is the lost pen discovered on a colleague's desk?
Without any question, you should not borrow anything from your colleagues, because they are rightly offended when they find that something has gone away.
So, no envelopes or post-it are in the pocket from the office, because it could hit you yourself: no one there anymore, if you really need it.
Are you talking about colleagues' private life?
There is no effective means of stopping a trade that has already been put into the world.
Who's with who?
Where and why?
You should not tie the information (or suspicions) about the private life of your colleagues to everyone's nose if possible!
And if someone opens up and betrays his inner secret, we should not abuse this confidence!
The best thing to do is to keep silent as a grave, instead of directing those who are not present, even if others know about the problems of the colleague.
Reported sick for no reason?
If you call in the office to report yourself ill under the agonizing headache, because you just feel uncomfortable, or just want to rest, you should be aware of one thing: Your own work, unscrupulous work, projects with fixed dates now have to do the colleagues instead of yourself.
So don't play bad with your colleagues!
If you already know the day before that you won't get to the office the next day, or something could come in between why you have to stay at home, you should report it in time so that neither the colleagues nor the boss are unexpectedly confronted with the absence.
Total, Chickens, Telephones
You've just been deepened in your work, but is suddenly disturbed by the loud gecko of your colleagues?
Unwanted to hear a phone call you shouldn't have heard?
It is not worth noting colleagues with summaries, singing, loud conversations (which are carried over their heads), tramples, constant smearing or nagging.
All of this can be very disturbing, even if they are not in depth in a task (writing, planning, organizing).
Are the others always to blame?
If a project is not completed in time, you have forgotten to send an important letter or important messages, you should not look for the fault of your own forgetfulness with others!
If possible, don't talk about the chaos in the office or the loud colleagues!
It is best to admit his mistakes, and apologise if others have been affected!
The question of how to make up for the mistake, or how to make up for it, is only too appropriate!
In the office - a feeling at home?
Training Shoe and Sleep: Comfortable for home, but has not lost anything in the office!
Not even then one should dress so army if it would actually allow the workplace!
Don't get too sloppy - you should respect both your colleagues, as well as yourself, so that you dress accordingly in the office - if you wish, also pretty and elegant!
Want to make it right for all - or how to be uninteresting for others
Stop and go traffic, the car in the middle of the morning traffic jam.
From the radio sounds a strange melody: The sound of a violin, paired with electronic effects.
I'm turning the volume higher.
The pace changes, the bass comes to the previous sounds, and as a real sound jewel a female choir.
It is the song "Wings of Love" by Zagar, which sounds at mr2.
For a long time, the local music scene has not just spoiled us with qualitative electropop.
But now you even see the traffic jam differently when you hear Zagar's new album.
The appearance of Yonderboi, so many new and exciting productions from the native digital underground scene slowly contribute to a change in the overall picture, and even if the garage rock with its guitar quilt is "in" again, the native electropop proves: there are new ones under the sun.
Baláz's Zságer started in Pécs, even in the band Yonderboi, before he - perhaps because a inn does not tolerate two peppers - began to walk his own way.
The breakthrough with his project (Zagar) and his music, which melts elements from jazz, electronic, and pop, he did not manage until he was approached with the request to compose the soundtrack into a film (e.g.
Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image
The formation, which had initially appeared in smaller clubs, became known to the wider audience only when the magazine "wan2" was the first album from 2002 among the top 50 native albums and Zagar, along with Yonderboi, was the only trendsetter capable of the West.
No doubt Zagar and his band were "trendy", but they didn't care if they liked to wear this brand.
The band responded as it should: With a new, even better album.
The new album, titled "Cannot Walk Fly Instead", could open up new ways to them, but the title expresses the desire for continuity with the Pécser years.
The expression comes from the time that Baláz Zságer was still on the move with another band.
The airy, flying allusion would also be fine, but besides the essential character of the music the louder guitar, the influences of the Rock'n'Roll - according to the spirit of time and trends.
With these songs, the singer György Ligeti, who lives in England and works with the band "The Puzzle", presented himself at the premiere in Millenáris.
A song from the album even made it to the radio hit - the mr2 Petőfi, who has been sending pop music since the very latest from early to late, has gradually set the earworm with the song "Wings of Love", which was recorded with the help of six native singers ("Underground Divas").
So it's all right (?).
The hvg.hu asked Baláz Zságer.
hvg.hu: This new hit raises the question: To what extent is your music reserved for a certain layer?
Baláz's Zságer: The term "low music" does not mean much to me.
In my opinion, there are two boxes in pop music, not mainstream and underground, or alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
Even the so-called alternative or underground music can be silky and inescapable, but it can also be produced only for the sale that makes it commercial music.
A good pop number can also come from an honest motive.
The listener's willingness to be recorded also works in accordance with this principle, independently of languages and national boundaries.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference in the openness of Hungarian and foreign audiences to your music?
B. Zs.: Abroad, especially west of us, pop music has a greater tradition.
There are not only teenagers or twos on concerts, but also the older audience.
They follow the trends in pop music that happen around them much more attentively because they also consider them to be part of the contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the audience play in your work?
Is it important who, where, how many hear your music?
B. Zs.: Of course it is a good feeling to see that more and more are coming to our concerts.
But we never composed for the market.
With us the music does not arise to serve a purpose, but for a certain reason.
The role of the audience is usually felt in the concerts, where there is already a mutual interaction, but in turn there are only in the incomprehensible changes of the moment.
Nevertheless, I noticed one thing: if you want to do it all right, you are no longer interesting.
hvg.hu: How far would you like to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He is on his way as a soloist and has built up his career in the West.
B. Zs.: We don't really go his way, sometimes quite apart from trying to interpret this into our music over and over again.
We see ourselves rather as a team player who rely on the musical presence of the other and let them unfold.
In the beginning, of course, comparisons between our work and that of Yonderboi were inevitable, since several of us came from his band and took a different path.
hvg.hu: In the charts of mr2 Petőfi "Wings of Love" is the first place.
Many have only heard the name Zagar in connection with this number.
Was the opening deliberately staged with a slightly more popular style towards a wider audience?
B. Zs.: We had no plans to write a hit, which should then hold as a train horse for the album.
This song is about more.
It was intended as a finale of the album, with which we wanted to resolve the sound orgy and the slightly more difficult topics.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why exactly she, what was the guiding principle?
B. Zs.: The basic idea was to make a gospel-like choir.
Then came the idea of putting together the choir of talented soloists of the local music scene.
Thus the six-member choir - that is, Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikő Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh - was created, which we then baptized paternal "Underground Divas".
hvg.hu: Did you want the song as well, or did the girls co-design it?
B. Zs.: The song has been in the instrumental version for some time, but when the material for the album was finished, we thought that this song still needs something.
The chord sequence has formally demanded a singing voice.
I sang the melody on the same night, later they learned the girls.
It all came practically immediately and startlingly spontaneous.
I can remember, I was pretty electrified at the time, but it's also needed the "divas".
With my voice alone, the song would never have become so powerful.
hvg.hu: Both on the record and at the concert, one had the impression that the girls were in the background.
There is no solo part (except for the short solo by Judy Jay), they have no own role, sing together perfectly and are not louder than the music, so their singing is not only accompanied by the music.
They also stood on the stage behind.
Is it intention?
B.Zs.: The fact that they were standing behind was so because of purely technical problems.
However, we deliberately did not want to give them solo roles.
In the number it is also about forgetting your ego a little, forgetting who came from and where to go, let's just let us lift up these particular wings, the wings of love.
I would like others to feel this euphoric state that we have felt when the song came into existence.
hvg.hu: What was the most elaborate song?
B. Zs.: In musical creative work there was actually no one at all, there were more difficult tasks when mixing.
For example, at "Dorian Gray's Dilemma", where I play on a concert piano, or at "Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls", where the groove would not work any longer, but gradually everything joined together, as with a puzzle.
hvg.hu: Which one is your favorite song from the new album?
B. Zs.: This changes continuously with the concerts and also now, where I "let go" the album.
Currently it is "Prophet Is A Fool", "Escape From The Earth" and the song "Never The Same".
Fraud brokers risked billions because of inferiority
Groundless Frauder
His former employee Jerome Kervel of the French banking giant Société Générale, who owns the local Komerční banka.
It came by almost five billion euros because of it.
It seems, however, that Kervoel was only a big player who wanted to do it to his colleagues, and certainly was not capable of doing so.
In contrast to all major banking houses, he recognized the crisis in the American mortgage market in good time.
"He is more mentally weak," was heard from the mouth of his superiors, who showed him at the police.
However, as the Kervil's statements, published by the French media, for example the daily Le Monde, showed, he was a person who had achieved profits of 1.6 billion euros at the end of last year's business.
Crisis Not Only in America
"All I wanted was to make money for my bank," he claims in his statement.
In summer, he was able to earn half a billion euros in the American crisis.
He had already discovered the opportunity to do so at the beginning of the year.
In February, there were already some first news that so-called sub-prime mortgages, such as low-income customers or those who had previously had payment problems, would be in trouble.
However, this crisis should not affect the whole economy.
Kerveld did not believe it and kept it right.
At the end of the year, he had raised his profit to 1.6 billion euros.
"Just when I had earned the first half billion, I didn't know how to explain it," admits Kervel and continues, saying he definitely didn't keep anything for himself.
Throughout the interrogation, he admits that he has faked documents so that they don't get to him.
He even managed to lead his bosses behind the light, even though the Eurex exchange was gradually interested in his business.
Risk benefit
Did he fear flying up?
I don't think so.
"I thought she was satisfied with the simple fact that I earned 1.6 billion for the bank."
How did he take the courage to risk so much?
He had to work out his position gradually.
He joined the Société Générale in 2000, immediately after finishing his studies at the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was about 51000 dollars.
After two years he was already assistant to a broker and in 2005 he became self-employed broker with an annual salary of 90000 dollars.
Nevertheless, he knew he would never earn as much as others.
"Just during my first conversation in 2005, I knew that I was being observed.
Because of my training and also because of my professional and personal development," Kerveld told the investigators.
But soon after his entry the first great success came.
With the shares of the Alliance, he earned a lot by placing half a billion euros on the price losses of this title in the London bombings.
And that was the trigger -- now he wanted more.
As long as you win, let's leave you
"That's like a snowball," he told the police officer.
But the bosses supposedly knew everything, or suspected it.
"As long as I made money, they closed their eyes."
But then at the beginning of this year came the big blow.
One day he lost a billion euros.
A weekend in mid-January, he wanted to compensate.
When he came to work on Monday, he was already no longer a staff member of the bank.
And a few days later, the bank announced that it had lost five billion euros because of it.
And how did they get to him?
He was suspicious of a vacation.
"I only took four days from the previous year.
A real estate agent who doesn't take a vacation is one who doesn't want to be looked into the cards," Kervard concluded.
Czech Republic has the chance to reach 365 billion
Czech ministers and representatives of the European Commission signed a total of nine development programmes yesterday, enabling the Czech Republic to reach 14 billion euros (about 365 billion crowns) in the coming years.
This is about half the sum that the Czech Republic can receive from Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
About 125 billion crowns come from seven regional development programmes.
Czech companies will be able to receive about 100 billion crowns from the "Company and Innovation" programme.
Most money, about 150 billion, will flow into traffic expansion.
The Transport Programme is the largest development programme and covers up to 22 percent of the funds that the Czech Republic can receive from the Fund.
This money will increase according to the budget of the State Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will have over 90.8 billion next year.
The "Company and Innovation" programme is intended to help entrepreneurs and companies gain money from innovative businesses.
The aim is to attract finance for the introduction of new technologies, enterprise research, but also for the introduction of more effective organisational methods.
In the previous EU-fund money acquisition, the Czech Republic among the new candidate countries is one of the least successful.
Nicaraguan court confirms twenty-year imprisonment for ex-presidents
On Thursday, an appeal court in Nicaragua confirmed the twenty-year imprisonment for former President Arnold Alemán, to whom he had been sentenced in 2003 for financial fraud of 100 million dollars (nearly 1.8 billion crowns).
Later, however, he was released from prison and lived under house arrest on his Hasienda at the Nigerian metropolis.
According to the news agency AP, whether the former head of state (1997 to 2002) is back behind this Central American state is unclear.
According to the chairman of the Supreme Court, Ileana Pérez, it will now depend on the prison officials whether to let Alemán take his sentence at home or whether he has to go to prison.
A court four years ago confirmed that Alemán had regularly moved money from the government to foreign companies in Panama.
These companies were fictitious and the accounts actually belonged to their relatives and closest followers.
Some of this money ended up in a fund that Alemán had set up to finance his 2001 election campaign.
Budget is through
Yeah, it's done.
The government budget is approved.
What is special about this budget?
It is the first budget that this government has designed and which was adopted by the coalition majority without the support of the opposition.
The current year was approved with the support of the ČSSD (social democrats) because Minister Sobotka (of this party) had presented him, and the ČSSD could not allow himself to reject him.
Unlike the lively debate before the vote on the motion for a resolution against the government's distrust, nothing dramatic happened this time.
The House of Deputies approved this traditionally little-considered, yet most significant, law in peace.
That's kind of paradoxical.
All governance begins and ends with the individual chapters and posts of the household, whether you like it or not.
The budget is an essential part of politics, but is covered up by the power struggle of the government and the opposition.
This is a more grateful subject for the media, and therefore they pay more attention to it.
A dispute among politicians is much more interesting to the public than sober figures.
The state budgets suffered from three weaknesses in the past Social Democratic Governments, which the 2008 budget cannot eliminate at once:
The first is the high proportion of expenditure that is mandatory by law, which is not only pensions, but also social expenditure, which the "silence" coalition of ČSSD and KSČM (Communists) decided last year before the elections.
The second is the deficitary budgetary policy as a result of the first weak point.
The third restriction is the deficits of public finances, i.e. the budget deficits of the municipalities.
However, the greatest risk is not the government budget deficit.
This budget is public and somehow under control.
A real time bomb, however, is the budget deficit of the municipalities.
Many mayors, in addition to tax, tax and bank credit revenues, issued additional sources of investment, often inconceivably issued bonds in excess of their city halls.
In recent years, they have been able to pay off these debts by the mass sale of shares in the energy and other supply networks that they had received on the government's privatisation train.
Now this source is already depleted.
To the extent that we adhere only to official and verifiable facts, we note that:
our economy, like the rest of the world, has been going through a growth phase for a few years now, whose ČSSD is famous without failure.
This was a unique opportunity for their governments to correct public finances.
Instead, these governments owe the state even more.
Other countries, apart from a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have been far more reasonable than our Republic.
This is a huge indifference, which is mainly due to the former governments.
We are among the countries which, on a global scale, are at least at risk of poverty.
That is why there is no need for massive social programmes which, unfortunately, have been blown up to a huge extent in recent years.
Even if it has succeeded in removing part of the absurd populist expenditure that was adopted this year before the elections, it is clear that if in the next few days there will not be a shift in the retirement age and a pension reform, then virtually any policy in that country will end, and whoever is in power will remain nothing but pure.
It is only slightly exaggerated to say that then from ruling politicians become officials who mechanically divide most of the tax revenue between pensions and social expenditure.
That is why this year's budget cannot be a revolution, but can only stop normal spending by means of compulsory expenditure.
The deficit of 70 billion crowns foreseen for 2008 would be superfluous if previous governments had not spent over the last ten years what was going on.
If we do not want to see it really come to be purely administrative officials from ruling politicians, then we must be patient and this not too strong coalition government, which is aware that the state can only spend as much as it can on taxes and fees in order to want peace in the preparation of further reform laws.
Only these allow for the gradual enforcement of a balanced government budget.

Banks Want to Cope With Crisis
The US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the central banks of Great Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight together against the crisis in the financial markets.
More than 100 billion dollars will be spent on the monetary markets by auctions.
At these auctions the banks auction interest rates at which they are willing to borrow each other's money.
For example, the American Fed sends 40 billion dollars on auction, and 24 more makes it easy for the European and Swiss central banks.
It is the first time, following the attacks of September 11, that the central banks of each country agree on such a coordinated approach to counter-defence mitigation of the consequences of a financial crisis.
"This step aims to eliminate the biggest difficulties of the economy, i.e. the growing lack of freely available capital that the banks can grant," wrote in a report for his customers Bernard Baumohl from the consulting firm Economic Outlook Group.
"The coordinated action of central banks has reduced the likelihood of a recession in the US from 65% to about 50%," Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion because of untreated loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts expect more billions of losses.
"The central banks must have been really afraid of what can happen when they decided to do so," said the chief economist of ABN Amro, Kieran Davies.
"It looks like the situation is really bad," he continued.
The central banks are concerned that if the banks themselves have difficult access to bonds, loans for their customers will also become more expensive.
This would reduce consumption and plunge the American economy into recession, possibly with an impact on economic growth around the world.
The central banks have decided after they failed to lower the so-called LIBOR, the London interbank interest rate, which is used in the loan of money between banks.
This means that the banks were constantly afraid of borrowing each other's money, although the central banks of the USA, Canada and Great Britain had lowered their interest rates several times during the autumn.
"This will have the same effect as another reduction in interest rates," said Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting of the agency Reuters.
Some analysts believe that this step by central banks contributes to the warming up of the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem, namely the case of the real estate market in the USA.
Klaus: Ecologist debates are unbelievable
Global climate change is said to be most damaging to developing countries.
President Václav Klaus said again on the issue of global warming.
The criticism now referred to the UN's final international conference on climate change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book "A Blue, Not a Green Planet", he stated that the debates of the ecologists were unbelievable.
According to Klaus, not only is the structure of the conference unacceptable, which constitutes a strange mix of government representatives and those of non-governmental organizations, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric it accompanies and reality.
"The debate there is unstructured, it is a word fireworks that is only a substitute for a real solution to current problems," said Klaus.
In presenting his book, the Czech president stressed that his subject matter was very important to him, and that he was therefore committed to doing so.
He also expressed his satisfaction that his book appeared in German translation, because "I often encounter cartoons of my views."
Now, therefore, interested parties could read his attitude unscathed.
Klaus recalled that he was not a climatelogist, but he felt he had sufficient conditions to write such a book.
Finally, he is academic, able to understand and assess professional treatises, has experience with statistics and is also more economical.
The main statement of the book was that the climate was constantly changing and that its changes were therefore normal, that there was no consensus among scientists on global warming that the consequences of the current changes were not too large and serious and therefore were no threat, and that efforts to influence the development of the climate were superfluous, ineffective and unacceptable.
Moreover, as someone who has experience with totalitarian systems, he considers it unacceptable to impose other unproven views, he sees this as a dangerous restriction of freedom.
On questions raised by those present, he repeatedly stated that he was not against "a reasonable environmental protection, but against militant eco-activists who did not take into account the relationship between effort and yield."
About the same topic Klaus had already discussed in the Hayek Institute two months ago in Vienna.
600000 people failed to exchange their license
600000 drivers missed the deadline to exchange their old driving licence, the validity of which expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day on which to apply for an exchange so that the authorities can issue a new driving licence by the end of the year.
However, the Ministry does not fear that hundreds of thousands of drivers will go to the streets after the New Year without a valid driving licence.
According to the authorities, mainly those who do not want to drive have not exchanged their licence.
While small places report a sharp decline in interest in the exchange of furskin, the offices of the capital are overburdened with applications, and interest in exchange grew this week.
The city administration processes around 2000 customers every day.
You have to stand for about half an hour.
In Prague, about 140000 drivers have not yet exchanged their license.
The exhibition takes 20 days for a new driver's license.
But it is possible to apply for the exhibition with a shortened period of five days.
In this case, however, the driver must pay 500 crowns.
Motorists who do not make the required change by the end of the year and leave without a valid driving licence will be subject to a fine from January onwards.
The offender pays a maximum of 2000 crowns.
However, the police can also use it with a warning when the infringement occurs.
In the event of a violation, the penalty may rise to 2500 crowns.
According to previous information, a punishment may also be imposed on those of the community who do not at all drive.
He could, it was said, threaten a punishment of even 30,000 crowns.
The ministry has already called on the offices to be mild and to impose a maximum penalty of 1000 crowns.
According to the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka, but no one threatens a thousand crowns of punishment.
The driving licence is a document in which everyone can decide whether to own it or not.
It is not a personal ID card that everyone, and that is a valid one, must have.
People who don't want to drive anymore should issue their license.
It is sufficient to take him to the relevant municipal office or to send him there by e-mail.
At the end of the year, driving licences issued between 1964 and 1993.
However, drivers must gradually exchange other types of driving licences.
People with driver's licenses from 1994 to 2000 have three more years for the exchange.
The validity of driving licences issued between 2001 and 2004 expires in December 2013.
According to Hankelka, this is about 2.6 million additional driving licences.
Court lowers penalties for detectives allyed with Berdych
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík, who are accused of having made common cause with the band of David Berdych, were given 13 and 10 years imprisonment respectively.
This was decided in a judgment of the Prague Supreme Court, which reduced its sentence by one and two years respectively.
Originally, the detectives of the "Office for the Fight Against Organized Crime" threatened 14 and 12 years respectively.
There is no appeal against today's judgment, only revision of the Supreme Court is possible.
Berdych himself is also charged in this case, but first of all the first-instance judgment is before him.
In other processes, however, he had already received a total of 16 years of punishment.
He can't be sentenced to any more.
In January, a district court found 19 persons guilty mainly because of participation in robbery, and today the Oberlandesgericht negotiated the appeal of 16 of them.
Most accused people disputed the charges from the outset on the grounds that it was a constructed case.
According to the Central Bohemian District Court, police members in consultation with, among other things, Berdych Criminals provided information from sources of the police, covered various robberys and helped members of the gang to escape prosecution.
The bands left Opava and Koňařík 30 percent of the prey.
The indictment concerns crimes committed by the gangs from 1999 to 2001.
In particular for robbery, whose victims often suffered serious injuries, but also for the presumption of office and illegal possession of weapons.
In house searches, the police discovered illegal guns, steel core ammunition, a laser target telescope, and a machine gun.
According to the charge, the gang has enriched itself by many millions of crowns as a result of their robbery.
Except for nearly 20 men in this case, Berdych courts and a number of others were legally held guilty for further robbery.
Other men from Berdych's circle have to be responsible for another trial, other cases have not yet been brought to court.
Tomáš Půta and Maroš Šulej, who are in prison in Ireland and are waiting for the final decision on their extradition for prosecution in the Czech Republic, have been missed.
Children exchanged - bill: 12 million
For the exchange of children in a delivery clinic, the lawyer of the injured parents, Igor Veleba, wants to demand 12 million crowns of compensation plus court fees from the hospital in Třebíč.
For each of the mothers three million, for each of the fathers two million and for each of the children one million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200000 for each parent couple.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ondřej Dostál, therefore does not accept Velebas' proposal at all.
"We reject such a proposal, it is a lot too high," said Dostál after today's negotiation.
"In order to be able to give us an opinion on this counter-proposal, we need the opinion that the opposite side has been prepared.
We will see if it has any meaning at all.
But we believe that this should be together for all in the hundreds of thousands," said Dostál.
According to him, the amount should move between 100,000 and 200000 crowns for each of the four parents.
In the beginning, the family from Jablośov wanted a million crowns for every month that she had not raised her biological daughter.
For Veleba, the basis for compensation negotiations was an opinion prepared for him by the University Hospital in Prague Motol.
The parents of the children, according to experts from psychology and psychiatry, suffered psychological damage and stress symptoms in different strengths and depths.
The men better betrayed the stress situation, even if they saw accusations that they could have prevented the confusion of the newborns.
The women, in turn, cope with the aftereffects of the experienced trauma worse, as well as with what is now happening, Veleba summarized the contents.
Veronika and Nikola exchanged nurses at the delivery clinic in Třebíč on 9 December last year.
Last week the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the Čermáks in Přibyslavice, and Veronika to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanováov.
At the end of October, the district captain of Vysočina (Böhmisch-Mährische Höhe) handed over 100,000 crowns to each family as a replacement for expenses incurred by the mistake of the Třebíč hospital under the district.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are legally insured for liability.
In case of doubt, they must reach out to a reserve fund, only exceptionally can they apply for assistance from the institution.
Up to now, the courts have allocated relatively low amounts of damages to those affected, the amounts were determined by tables and moved in the range of hundreds of thousands, exceptionally millions.
Polívka came around his kingdom Walachei
Bolek Polívka lost the fight for the brand "Kingdom of Walachei".
According to the judge at the District Court in Ostrava, he was the first to use the name "Walachischer König", but the project had built up a team around Tomáš Harabiš in collaboration with the actor in many years of work.
Polívka did not participate in the trial today.
According to his lawyer, the case is probably not over and his client will probably appeal.
"The issue is that Mr. Harabiš and his team want to participate in the popularity of Bolek Polívka's parasitic," said Polívka's lawyer after the trial.
In the words "Walachian Kingdom" everyone imagined this actor and comedian.
The same opinion is also Harabiš.
"We have almost ten years of work behind us.
Money raising and concepts of activities," he said.
According to him, the occasion is a fight for money.
"After years, they noticed that the project was successful and that they could have some of it.
They want to gain parasitic in our work," he continued.
Legal business
According to the court, Polívka used the name "Walachian King" for the first time in one of his television broadcasts.
In 1993, the actor Radoslav Brzobohatý crowned him.
But at that time this was not with the intention of establishing a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš came up with the idea of spending Walachian passports.
A business and an entrepreneurial activity emerged out of a originally fun action, to which Harabiš then joined the founding of the company "Walachische Kingdom".
In 1997, Polívka agreed to use his name and signature in the passports and even offered her owners discounts when visiting his farm and his theatre performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge today also argued that Harabiš only used the mere idea that Polívka had made public on the "Manege" show for his entrepreneurial intentions.
"The popularity of Polívkas has certainly helped the project of the Welsh Kingdom," said the judge.
She added, however, that the soul of the project was Harabiš and his team, who had devoted themselves intensively to him.
The cooperation of today's disputed parties lasted until 2000, when Harabiš organized the official crowning for Polívka in Vsetín.
Since then, however, the disputes between Polívka and Harabiš have begun to culminate, which culminated in the suspension of "King Boleslav's I. until the day of St. Nimmerlein".
The leadership role then claimed Harabiš's Jarmila Šuláková as Queen Mother.
In 2002 Polívka filed an action against Harabiš and his company, which the court rejected today.
Clearness in the dispute could bring about the competition for the throne and half a princess prepared by Harabiš.
A new king was to come out of it.
He did not want to betray details and an appointment.
"We don't want to rush.
It should be something like the King's Move in the Wales.
The king should be elected for a certain time.
Mr Polívka can also register quietly," Harabiš added.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: Advantages disappear
In fact, I was never a special fan of Peugeot 206.
Its driving characteristics were not worth much, the quality of the gear circuit, the steering and also the processing could be described as rather below average.
But now his successor, the Peugeot 207, is on the market, and that is much better.
The combination with the name SW is still a bit further, and I only remain to review my opinion.
When I had tested the classic Hatchback of 207, for example, I had to complain about too little head freedom on the back seats.
These complaints are no longer there, because the body of the combination is designed in such a way that not even two-meter men will suffer.
Continue fast
I'm just going through the interior so I don't repeat myself too much.
This is quite a successful design, where I have objections only because of the small middle tunnel.
I would welcome a little more design, where the car otherwise makes such an elegant impression.
The seats are comfortable, and past are the times when we may complain about too short seats or headrests.
The sidehold has also improved significantly compared to the 206.
As far as the space offer is concerned, you can also feel the enlarged dimensions of the body.
In the combination, the previously mentioned lack of head freedom has also been eliminated.
Cases in the trunk
The main thing about this car, however, is the cargo compartment.
I have to label it (also because of the folding back window) as very easy to read and save space.
The hollows are equipped with straps that represent an ideal compromise.
They do not disturb, can be torn apart and hold even heavier objects.
But let's talk about the loading volume.
According to the table in the basic equipment, it is 428 litres, which is a rather average value compared to competition.
However, not in comparison with the Czech best-selling vehicle of this class, the Škoda Fabia Combi.
When we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the Mladá Boleslav product, we note that the Peugeot remains by clearly noticeable 52 litres.
For a vacation abroad or when a stroller is invited, this value is already critical.
But in order to highlight the positives, I still have to mention the very flat loading space or the very low loading edge after the folding of the back seats.
120 hp in four rows
Our test car was equipped with a four-cylinder petrol engine with a cylinder capacity of 1.6 litres and an output of 88 kWp.
And honestly, so should a 1600-cubic engine that drives a family hatchback.
He is quiet, has a low consumption and pulls away well.
If I compare him with his counterpart at Škoda, which sometimes acts as if his exhaust were blocked with a rag, then I can only be enthusiastic about him.
The price list speaks volumes
The price of this car is not exactly popular.
But we must remember that we have tested a well-equipped car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with the 1400 gasoline engine of 329900 crowns is still approaching.
With our engine it costs from 410900 crowns, which is already quite a lot.
The equipment Premium of the test car beats again with 80000 crowns in addition to beech.
However, we had head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic windshield wiper trigger, electric window lifters rear and...
The car costs a total of 531900 crowns.
That's a lot, but once you figure out the extra equipment of a Fabia together and you'll arrive at a very similar sum.
So just the decision to choose which brand you want to choose.
Integration of Slovak students into British schools is not successful
In British schools, the number of children from Eastern Europe is increasing, which causes local fears about the further development of local education.
The integration of Eastern Europeans has so far encountered a number of obstacles.
British schools even detect cases where disputes between immigrants and the children of the original inhabitants increase in violence.
The problem with the integration of children from Eastern Europe into British schools illustrates the case of North Kent, where the conflicts between locals and Slovak immigrants are gradually increasing.
Disputes, shocks and assaults among students have spread to the relationships between parents.
The situation has developed so far that the police in Chatham arrested a Slovak woman who had beaten a ten-year-old boy with an iron rod.
The accused defended himself by the fact that the boy insulted her with racist insults.
The police also had to intervene on a Slovak immigrant after an attack by two minor girls.
The girls had supposedly made racist remarks to the man and had thrown stones at him.
"When we went home, a boy climbed on a bus house and spit on us.
When I told him to stop, he threw apples and pears at us and then exposed his buttocks," wrote another unpleasant incident in the newspaper The Times, a mother of Slovakian students.
Complaints come from both sides.
One of the locals even called the struggle with the immigrants from Eastern Europe a struggle for survival.
The cases cited show that the mood between locals and immigrants in British schools is becoming increasingly tense.
In the UK, 70000 Slovaks have been reported who came here looking for work.
Thus, some 30,000 Slovak students attend British schools.
Cuba - the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors it is really an island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your holiday, that will be fulfilled if you select the right thing.
Golden and white beaches, high waves or a sea that is quiet like a pond.
Palm trees and All Inclusive with waiters offering pizza, ice cream and enchanting cocktails on the beach.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean you will find this to an overwhelming extent.
But only on one island you will find much more, and this island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Great Antilles.
At the time of the Spanish, Cuba was their bastion for the conquest of America.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place ever seen by a human eye.
Havana was once a warehouse or transit camp of treasures that had robbed the Spanish in America and then transported to Europe.
And then came the American epoch.
Hotel Nacional was built at the end of the 20th century.
It was built by one of the chiefs of American Mafia, Lucky Luciano, because everything that was considered a crime in the USA (especially during the prophecy) was gladly seen and supported in Cuba - drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were:

In Havana high-rises grew, over the wide boulevards drove cars that were among the cult symbols of the fifties of the past century.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojímar he had his yacht lying.
On the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio, stars of the show business and politicians from all over America left their signatures.
And today?
On the walls of the Bodeguita of Havana you can also leave your autograph.
At the bar at the Hotel Nacional you can mix cocktails as desired.
And the cult cars of the fifties are still traveling around Havana today, because the once imported schigulis and fiats have already fallen apart in the salty and damp air.
May Havana, especially its oldest part, have come down heavily, nowhere can you find in the vicinity as many wonderful colonial sights as here.
Other places are being cleaned out, for example Trinidad.
With a view to tourism bringing much needed money, there was a green light for this development.
In the last fifteen years, new hotels have not only been created in Havana, but also in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holguín and also on small islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba offers another Marotte that is unique in the world and attracts especially railway lovers.
The sugar cane from remote plantations brought steam and the same driven narrow lanes to the sugar factories.
Their fleet has not been renewed for decades, and so you can see neat and fully functioning locomotives, whose peers have long been in the museum elsewhere.
Excursion objectives
The most important places do not miss the majority of the visitors to Cuba.
So you don't have to write in detail about Varadero or Havana.
It is only to be mentioned that there is a museum in Hemingways, already mentioned, whose visit should not be missed by the one who likes this writer.
The Viñales Valley in the west of the island is one of the most picturesque corners of Cuba.
The lush vegetation grows on lime floor.
The mogotas, calcareous hills and cliffs, rise steeply from the valley floor, in their hollows accumulated fertile soil, through which also weathered rocky areas are covered by dense vegetation.
This valley is where perhaps the best Cuban tobacco is grown.
In its final form, you can meet him if you visit one of Havana's cigar factories.
It may also seem interesting to some that the Chilean episode of the television series "Major Zeman" was filmed there.

An ancient city, founded shortly after the Spanish colonized the island.
The trade of slaves and sugar brought her fame and wealth.
The wealth was embodied in the beautiful beauty of the small town.
The Spanish colonial architecture, strongly influenced by the later French settlers, has hardly changed for four hundred years.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the Escambray Mountains, is such a remote place that there was still no road there in the fifties of the last century that the area would have connected with the rest of the country.
This isolation contributed to its disregard.
Nothing was built there, but therefore nothing was torn down, everyone was glad that he had a roof over his head.
If you have more than one afternoon time for Trinidad, it is worth looking at interesting places in the area, such as the Playa Ancón beach or the "Tal of the sugar factories".
In the evening one should go to the Casa de la Música, which lives after the darkness and where the music does not remain silent until the morning.

This small town in the east of Cuba is considered by some to be the most beautiful of the island.
Surely this view is also influenced by the way there.
Both roads, which lead from Guantánamo there, have to overcome high and disintegrated mountains and pass through a landscape that is hardly touched by human intervention.
This eastern outpost of Cuba included UNESCO in its world heritage directory thanks to its pristine nature.
There is the best chocolate produced, in the church one shows the cross of Columbus (in fact it was created about a hundred years after the rides of Columbus), and from the hill where the former castle, the current Hotel El Castillo, stands, are several table mountains, of which El Yunque is the most famous.
About the coffee, the rum, the cigars, the Sierra Maestra Mountains, the pig bay and the island of Isla de Pinos, about the Tropicana Cabaret, the sanctuary of the Cuban patron Caridad del Cobre, about the Santeria, an African religion to which the descendants of slaves profess themselves, about all that could be written about many pages.
But, as they say, look better with your own eyes.
Allys in Afghanistan are passive, claims Americans.
According to the United States, too few soldiers and the lack of necessary equipment affect the course of the mission in Afghanistan.
NATO should, according to Minister of Defence Robert Gates, draft a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan did not take place according to its ideas, and the representatives of the countries that have stationed units in the south of the country were agreed in Edinburgh in Scotland.
In addition to growing opposition from the Taliban, the eight participating States are also discussing further coordination plans among the allies.
While the United States, through its defence minister Robert Gates, called for more activity on NATO units, Britain sees priority in strengthening the authority of the Afghan government and in intensifying development aid.
"In Afghanistan, forward development is noticeable, but military power can only be part of the solution.
Another part is to enable residents to start their own economic and security development," says British defence minister Des Browne of the BBC.
Ninety percent
The activity of the Afghan insurgents has reached the highest level for five years, according to the American army.
The number of violence has risen by 27 percent compared to the previous year, in the southern province of Helmand by even 60 percent.
The NATO countries have stationed around 40,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, about a quarter of them in the southern territory.
According to the United States, however, the allies have reached an absolute limit as regards the organization and equipment of the units.
In concrete terms, they call for more helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan units.
"We will have to think seriously about the concrete goals for the next time and how we can achieve them," said Gates.
Similarly today, the Secretary-General of NATO, Jaap de Hoop, spoke.
"I am not pleased with what we have available in Afghanistan for land and air.
We have about ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment we need, and that's too little," said De Hoop of the agency Reuters, concluding three-day talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
In recent months, there has also been a dispute among the participating countries as to whether all allies in Afghanistan are doing their best.
Germany, for example, was criticized for its passivity.
"The Germans are relatively numerous in Afghanistan.
But they are stationed in areas where there is only a minimum of violence and the battle requirements for them are not as high as for us in the southern and eastern part of the country," said Gates.
The British boulevard newspaper "Sun" described the German soldiers as lazy fur this week.
"Afghanese nonstuer degenerates: The Germans make games while our boys fight," wrote the "Sun" in a post that was supplemented by photos of German soldiers playing the table tennis.
The German photo paper went to counter-attack and printed a picture of a British unit in a rugby contest in southern Afghanistan.
Government debt will accelerate to a trillion in 2009
Each Czech has a government debt of 84000 kroner.
The total debt rose to 842.7 billion crowns by the end of September.
The government had planned to indebted itself with 159.2 billion kons this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion thanks to the improved development of government budgetary policy.
The government debt of the Czech Republic rose to 842.7 billion crowns by the end of September.
Thus, within the first nine months of this year, they increased by 40.2 billion.
Since June, however, they have dropped by 13.4 billion.
The Ministry of Finance thus confirmed its information on government debt from the beginning of October.
Each Czech has a debt of 84000 crowns.
Over the past year, the state has been indebted by more than 111 billion crowns.
"Until now it seems that, thanks to the lower deficit for the coming year, we will probably cross the border of a trillion crowns only in 2009.
Next year, the debt should move between 900 billion and a trillion crowns," said David Marek, a Patria Finance analyst, the iHNed.cz server.
Similarly, Vladimír Pikora, an analyst of Next Finance, sees it: "We could come to exceed a trillion in the course of 2009.
When exactly, depends on the next budget we do not yet know.
If it were to show that the situation on the political stage is changing, and politicians should be willing to save more, this could take up to 2010.
But I don't expect such a change," he said.
Debt growth
The government debt comes from the debts of the government and comes mainly from the accumulation of government deficits.
The government debt is financed by treasury orders, government bonds, direct bonds or, for example, by bonds from the European Investment Bank.
This year, domestic government debt has increased to 719.4 billion crowns.
The government's foreign debt now rose by 1.7 billion crowns to 123.3 billion.
The so-called marketable sovereign debt reached 803.3 billion crowns at the end of September and has fallen by 13.7 billion since June.
The average maturity of sovereign debt rose to 6.5 years.
"Over the year, total debt rose by 13 percent from the first quarter to the third quarter, which is really much in view of how well the economy is doing.
It is interesting that the growth is particularly evident in debt securities, where growth is 20 percent.
It is bad that debt is rising, but on the other hand, this shows that you can do something before pension reform comes," Pikora commented on the data.
Better Than Expected
The financing strategy and the management of public debt for 2007 show that the government had planned to receive 159.2 billion crowns this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion crowns thanks to the improved development of government budget policy.
This amount is mainly due to the government deficit, which will obviously reach 76 billion crowns this year instead of the 91.3 billion estimated.
Furthermore, it is a maximum planned funding for the consolidation agency of 13.3 billion kroner, a ten-billion reserve for the payment of pensions, the financing of government bonds for 43 billion and the bonds for the European Investment Bank amounting to 1.8 billion.
For giving a name to a teddy bear, she was presented today to a court in Khartoum.
According to her lawyer, the British teacher who had been charged in Sudan for insulting Islam was sentenced to 15 days in prison by a court in Khartoum on Thursday evening and then expelled.
The British woman was accused of allowing six to seven-year-old students to give a teddy bear the name Mahomet, although any representation of the Islamic prophet is prohibited.
She deserved to be whipped.
After parents of students complained several times to the Sudanese Ministry of Culture, the 54-year-old primary school teacher who worked at the Unity High School of Khartoum was picked up at home on Sunday and charged with insulting Islam according to Article 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code.
In fact, this matter began in September when the teacher asked her six to seven-year-old students to choose a name for the class teddy.
The children suggest eight names, including Hassan, Abdullah, and Muhammad, reports school principal Robert Boules.
Finally, when the class votes, 20 out of 23 children choose Muhammad as favorite first names.
Certainly, Muhammad is the name of the Islamic prophet, but above all a very common first name in Sudan.
Afterwards the children have created a book for the class, with the photo of the bear on it and the caption My name is Muhammad.
The bear itself did not bear a sign with this name, but the problem is quite simple that the representation of the Islamic prophet is considered an insult to Islam.
One of the Muslim colleagues from Gillian Gibbons, who taught at the same school in Sudan, said that he knew her well, and she would never have done anything to get too close to a religious belief, I only regret that she asked the children to vote for a name, in his opinion this is just an innocent mistake.
An opinion shared by many students of the teacher who describe it as very attentive to their students and as a person who never talks about religion in class.
Consider that the first name Muhammad is also the second most common name in Britain, for which there are 14 different spellings in English.
This first name, often chosen by Muslim families, is considered a kind of worship to the Prophet (he is often given to the firstborn of a family).
But what do the rules say about the use of this first name?
Can you give him a toy, for example?
This is, of course, a question of interpretation.
On Wednesday there was no agreement at the last negotiating meeting in Vienna on the future status of the province.
At the end of the failure
The Serbs and Albanians from Kosovo ended a sixth and final discussion session in Baden, Austria on Wednesday morning, without being able to overcome their controversy over the future status of the separatist province.
It is regrettable that the parties could not reach an agreement on the status , said European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger at a press conference in Vienna.
Emphasizing that peace in the region is at stake, his American counterpart Frank Wilsner Belgrade and Pristina called for the continuation of their commitments to maintain peace and continued the talks beyond the end of the negotiations.
No violence is expected in the immediate future, but we are at the beginning of a very difficult time, he added, and suggested that there are quite clear tensions.
End of conciliation on 10 December
The brokers of the Troika, who unite the European Union, the USA and Russia, will meet for the last time on Monday in Serbia and Kosovo.
The future of the province inhabited by Albanian speakers could become clearer if Ischinger, Wilsner and the Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko submitted their report to the UN Security Council by 10 December.
The talks of Baden, close to Vienna, formed the sixth and last negotiation session since the Troika received the order from the UN for a new mediation last August.
Americans and Europeans expect their mediation order to end on December 10.
The Russians, who had already blocked Kosovo's independence at the Security Council, are insisting on continuing negotiations beyond this end date.
Russia was and remains advocate of a negotiated solution, a friendly solution, said Botsane-Kartchenko.
One-sided Declaration of Independence?
After Kosovo has been under the administration of the UN for eight years, Western countries consider independence under EU supervision to be the only solution with the future.
Pristina is willing to announce these unilaterally if the Security Council does not decide in their favor.
Belgrade insists on greater autonomy
Unfortunately, no agreement could be reached, announced the President of Kosovo's autonomous authority, Fatmir Sejdiu, at the hotel in Baden, where since Monday these negotiations have been held the last chance.
Hashim Thaci, former leader of the Kosovan rebellion and future Prime Minister of the province shared his regret.
However, he added that the plan proposed by Belgrade was part of the autonomy of a past that led to murders and deportations.
Domino effect
Serbian President Boris Tradic, for his part, felt that a compromise should always be sought and warned the Albanian majority from Kosovo of the consequences of a unilateral declaration of independence of the province.
Belgrade believes that it particularly fears a "domestic effect" in a region that is still so weakened by the wars of independence in the 1990s.
For Serbia, this does not mean that a compromise would be impossible, he said.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that any decision be made only in the Security Council, where its Russian allies have a right to veto.
The Parliament of Kosovo will have the last word.
Only one decision from the Security Council is acceptable to Serbia, explained Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
These negotiations took two years.
They must end up as they started: in the Security Council.
To the journalists, Fatmir Sejdiu replied that the Kosovo Parliament would have the last word on the status , and added that any unilateral declaration of independence would expire on the part of the Albanian-speaking population in agreement with the Western countries.
Bush elicits an agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
At the opening of the international peace conference, which was held on Tuesday under his leadership in Annapolis, Maryland, President Bush announced that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint declaration.
He further stated that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to start negotiations immediately to find a definitive settlement of the 60-year-old disputes between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised that he would do anything to help them conclude a peace agreement before the end of 2008.
In the meantime, Palestinians must destroy the terrorist infrastructures and Israel must stop its colonization work, explains Bush, reminding the two parties of their commitments to the timetable for peace, which they had agreed to in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian authorities under Abba’s last attempt to reach a peace treaty that would clarify all open issues without exception, and including the central issues.
This designation includes the three serious problems that the disputes between Israelis and Palestinians are mainly concerned with: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of the Arab refugees who were expelled from their homeland in the present state of Israel in the course of the 1948 conflict.
According to the American President, Abbas took the floor and insisted that the forthcoming negotiations be conducted comprehensively and thoroughly and provide a regulation for all points, including Jerusalem, the refugees, the borders, the colonies, water and security.
In turn, when Olmert took the floor, he pledged that the forthcoming ceasefire negotiations would be conducted directly and without interruption and that he would try to end them before the end of 2008.
Bush has set the deadline for the implementation of its vision of two states , a Palestinian and an Israeli co-existence by the end of 2008.
Saudi Arabia has revealed that Bush has given it an assurance in this sense by Bush before deciding to attend the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis represents a great success for Washington, has launched a plan adopted by all Arab countries that offers Israel peace, in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the war of 1967, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis is a crossroads in the history of the Middle East, especially because it attacks on the roots of the conflict and its central aspects, says the Saudi-Arab prince in his interview with the Saudi-funded Arabic daily newspaper.
According to the prosecutor, the police are not responsible
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As always with this type of local news, official versions and rumors are opposed.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first results of the investigations of the National Disciplinary Authority of the Police (IGPN), on Sunday, shortly after 5 p.m., a police car drove on the Rue Louise-Michel towards Villiers-le-Bel.
He had no use, but was on strike, and drove at 40-50 km/h, without blue light, explained a spokesman of the police.
A green motorbike of the brand Kawasaki, without approval, thus not released for public road transport (see below), came, controlled by two young people without helmet, hit at very high speed.
It rammed the left side of the police car after it had disregarded its passage from the right, a police officer continued.
The alcohol control carried out at the vehicle passengers is very negative.
The condition of the car (proliferated wings, split windshield, torn down bumpers) testifies to the severity of the impact.
Very quickly, already yesterday morning, the prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérèse de Givry, announced that she had entrusted the IGPN with an investigation on the "facts of the involuntary murder of persons and the lack of assistance to persons in danger", in agreement with the main district of Val-d`Oise's public security.
In the afternoon, on the occasion of a press conference, the prosecutor stated that she excluded the IGPN from being responsible for the police at this stage.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses of the accident heard on Sunday evening confirmed the version of the police, namely that this small motorcycle came to their left relatively quickly.
Yesterday, a sort of rivet, certainly caused by the friction of the footrests on the ground, showed that the two vehicles had been hacked together until the police managed to brake.
The vehicles have been confiscated and will be subject to technical review.
The bodies of the two victims were observed yesterday.

Yesterday, in Villiers-le-Bel, a rumor quickly made the round, so the police would have left the accident site very quickly, without helping the two young people.
Although the IGPN remains very cautious, it would also exclude this matter from any serious error.
According to a police source , this is a difficult aspect of investigations which require further investigations and which must be carried out very carefully .
Libération met an eyewitness of these few moments shortly after the accident.
From one of his windows, he had a direct view of the scene.
We immediately went out with my cousin, the nurse in the hospital, to try to revive her again, tells this witness.
There was nothing to do.
Then he saw a completely disturbed police officer limping.
Two more tried to revive one of the young people, the fourth phoned.
In view of the tension that had quickly arisen around the events and, as it seems, because of the certainty that the people present had about the unexpected situation of the young people, the police were taken in the car by colleagues who had arrived at the accident site.
Still according to this testimony, the rescue officers arrived about twenty minutes after the police left.
You have also used heart massages, but in vain.
I'm not going to let it be claimed that the police didn't help the young people.
First aid was provided to these young people.
The fire department came right away.
Everything was done to try to save her , in turn stressed the prosecutor.
In Pakistan the tension is rising
On Monday, the Pakistani police beat down the first demonstrations, since General Musharraf had proclaimed the emergency two days earlier.
According to witnesses, in the city of Lahore in the east of the country, about 2,000 lawyers who demonstrated measures taken against the i emergency were injured by the tear gas grenades that the forces used there.
Those then threw stones to hurt the police.
At least 350 lawyers were temporarily arrested.
Similar scenarios existed in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police attacked and injured lawyers.
Several would have been temporarily arrested.
In Islamabad, the lawyers of the Supreme Court's lawyer have called for a general strike and announced demonstrations as a result of a wave of about 500 arrests of oppositionists, defenders of human rights and lawyers during the weekend.
Monday morning, the streets leading to the Supreme Court had been blocked to prevent the assembly.
Further demonstrations had been held in Multan (Middle) and in Peshawar (Nordic).
On Monday, the lawyer's movement received the support of the religious parties united in the powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance, whose president called on the population to send flowers and wastes to the judges who had spoken against the emergency, who had taken an oath before Musharraf.
Musharraf's promise is no longer valid
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly affected by the special matter, which was announced on Saturday evening.
In the following days, he had to take a position on the legality of President Musharraf's reelection in a direct election on 6 October.
The President of the Court of Justice, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was dismissed and replaced.
All that we represent is illegal, anti-constitutional and contrary to the decisions of the Supreme Court, the magistrate of the newspaper The News stated.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to issue the command of the army and become a civil president no longer applies since the invocation of the emergency, declared on Monday by the Deputy Minister of Information Tariq Azem.
He was expected to give his military uniform by November 15, the date on which his first term as president ended.
The Deputy Minister for Information has also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
In addition, the Pakistani government demented the persistent rumors in the country, according to which President Musharraf had been assigned a residence by his deputy army leader.
More than a third of pregnancies are still not planned
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%), as well as poorly planned or unforeseen births.
Even today, 40 years after the adoption of the Neuwirth Act, which allowed contraception in France, one of three pregnancies (36%) is not planned, as a study of the National Institute for Demographic Studies (Ined) shows.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%), as well as poorly planned or unforeseen births.
The Ined estimates that the various methods of contraception such as the pill or the spiral still have a failure rate of 5-6%.
According to the Institute, which notes that the percentage of pills used between 20 and 40 years of age that use the pill has increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today, the liberalisation of contraception has nevertheless enabled better control of fertility.
In any case, eight out of ten births are carefully planned these days.
With one in five couples even calculated exactly on the month, and, if possible, in spring, the season in which it seems most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repair at the space station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and his comrades from the crew of the International Space Station (ISS) will need more than seven hours in space to perform the spectacular repair of a defective solar collector essential for the continuation of scientific work at the station.
A bold exit, which, due to its duration, the removal of habitable modules, the speed with which it was organized, and the tools crafted by the astronauts to perform the repair, has reached several records.
The problem occurred on Wednesday when the astronauts had unloaded the Harmony module from space travel Discovery, a large cylindrical part that should soon be taken up by European and Japanese scientific laboratories.
This module is a kind of landing bridge for the module lab.
But you have to be able to supply them with power.
The second task of the crew was to implement a 17.5 tonne module for electricity generation via solar panels, which were already on the ISS, in order to bring it into its final position.
After she had moved it, the crew took part in the restructuring of the solar panels of the module, with a span of 76 meters.
And it happened that one of the collectors, which can be folded like accordions, was damaged by a clamped cable on a length of about one meter
The restructuring was stopped in order not to damage the collector any more.
The astronauts who originally left the space travel Discovery for a control course and then were to repair another solar collector whose rotation system was defective, were forced to devote themselves to the damaged collector.
And Scott Parazynski was selected to walk around at the end of the 30-metre long remote-controlled arm of the space travel that had been attached to the station to perform the repair.
He is one of NASA's best spacewalkers.
Large, durable, very clever, he has a well developed upper body and long arms.
So the 46-year-old learned doctor was selected to operate on the injured solar collector.
After he had carefully assessed the damage, he cut through the faulty cable and fixed some kind of rail on the damaged site.
He was supported by a second Spacewalker who stayed near the lock, and, inside, by the other astronauts, among them Peggy Whitson, commander of the crew.
The tool he used, a mini-hockey hit, wrapped with insulator to prevent an electric blow on the solar panels that produce several hundred volts, had invented and crafted the astronauts on board the station.
When the action was finished, Scott Parazynski waited until the collector was completely folded before he counted his tools and returned to the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts enjoyed half a day of relaxation before today seven astronauts returned to space travel Discovery in order to probably return to Earth on Wednesday.
The title EADS sanctioned on the stock exchange
After the A400M Group has announced that it will have to spend between EUR 1.2 and 1.4 billion to counter A400M residues, the EADS stock currently shows a significant decline on the Paris Stock Exchange.
EADS currently loses 4% to 21.96 euros on the Paris Stock Exchange.
The Group was forced to review its business forecasts for 2007, referring once again to the residues caused by the slow development of the A400M engine, which delay the flight of the aircraft.
The costs announced in October to offset the delay in the delivery of their military transport aircraft amount to between EUR 1.2 and 1.4 billion, of which more than one billion for Airbus, announced the parent company of the European manufacturer EADS.
Due to these costs, EADS will be forced to announce new operating performance targets (EBIT) for 2007 in the presentation of its quarterly results next Thursday, he added without further details.
The Group also states that the assessment of the new costs is related to the six-month residue.
As a reminder, the EADS’s business performance fell from 86% in 2006, mainly due to the costs associated with the delay of another programme, that of the very large carrier aircraft A380.
The Group originally planned a first delivery of the A400M to the French Army for October 2009.
The choice of status quo
On Sunday it will not be exciting when counting the urns: the mass of the Russians will choose President Putin's party, United Russia.
After a very locked election campaign, she confirms her quest for stability, even for authoritarianism.
Three days before the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin sends a message sent to the voters on public channels, which has already been recorded, but whose content is kept secret.
He does this in his capacity as top candidate for the United Russia, the Pro-Creeding Party, for which an overwhelming victory is announced.
Yesterday, the President did not allow anything to be seen when he received the foreign ambassadors, and was pleased to deliver a new attack point against the West powers accused of interfering - his favorite theme during the election campaign.
We know the prize of a true democracy and hope for honest elections, extremely transparent and open, elections without fraud, he added.
From the opposition's point of view, they turned away.
She's extortioning an election campaign that's stained by oppression.
The Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says that there would never have been such dirty elections, not even in the time of Eltsin.
After the suppression of the demonstrations last weekend, former chess world champion Garry Kasparovder had been sentenced to five days in prison for illegal demonstrations, according to his lawyer, continue to ban the visit.
The Russians have preserved the mentality of Homo Sovieticus
After these parliamentary elections, there are two very important questions:
Who will succeed Putin as President?
The paper announced yesterday the date of the first election of the presidential elections, 2 March 2008; the candidates have until 23 December time to make themselves known.
Since he was elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot stand for a third consecutive mandate.
And now no successor can be found.
What role will Putin play after March?
Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image
President of the majority of Parliament and the all-powerful United Russia Party, which will elect the Government and the President?
Whatever it will be, in the parliamentary elections or in the presidential elections, the previous power will triumph.
This is tradition.
The Russians have preserved the mentality of the Homo Soviet, they are not master of their fate, says sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the Independent Center Levada.
The historian Nikolai Kosossov from the State University of St Petersburg goes even further: bourgeois society has developed very slowly in this country, which was christianized five centuries after Europe; the famous community spirit has delayed the development of individuality.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, Putin once again attached himself to the model of a paternalist state, which was totally accepted by the population, all the more so, since this new paternalism did not follow terror, but rather a certain economic prosperity, says Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians renounce the personal responsibility they have shown briefly after the disintegration of the USSR.
What do you think about?
This phenomenon affects all social classes, including the business world.
And the administrative elite understands to hold the status quo: 65 governors (of 85 Russian regional presidents) lead the local electoral lists of the United Russia.
The new freedoms coming from the West are often equivalent to chaos, as in the 1990s.
The general public prefers stability.
In this sense, the Russians will not vote in favour of the extremist parties either.
Conclusion of Tamara Tcherednitchenko, a 54-year-old professor: What do you think about for a long time?
Those who are in power are not so bad as to replace them?
A heavy reminder
After more than 60 years of confidential treatment, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which document the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are now freely accessible.
The 47 million documents of the archive, which are located in Bad Arolsen on a total length of 27 km, have so far not been understood, except with a humanitarian intention, i.e. individually and by name, that is, on the request of a former victim or his family.
In May 2006, the eleven States entrusted with their administration – including Germany, France, Israel and the USA – agreed to make them accessible to researchers and historians.
After the ratification process of this decision has been completed, the opening has been valid since yesterday.
Secret Information
The access of historians to Bad Arolsen will enable researchers to carry out investigations, especially about the deportations of prisoners, the inmates of concentration camps and the health status of forced workers, explains Reto Meisteren, head of these archives, which are managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (CICR).
Until recently, several countries, including Germany, were opposed to making these name-related documents available to the public, due to the delicate nature of certain information.
For example, the alleged homosexuality or mental disability of some deportation victims.
The prisoners' lists of the concentration camps or the warrants issued by the Gestapo had been gathered after the war for a practical reason: to find civilians who had been deported or subjected to forced labour and possibly to provide them with evidence of their arrest in order to pave the way for their compensation.
Today more than 300 permanent employees in Bad Arolsen handle tens of thousands of personal requests.
Nevertheless, part of the scientific community shows only a limited interest in access to Bad Arolsen.
There must be nothing fundamentally new in these documents, explained by Pr. Wolfgang Benz, Head of the Research Center for Anti-Semitism at the Technical University of Berlin in 2006.
The EU and India want a free trade agreement in 2008.
At present, trade between India and Europe is already reaching 60 billion euros a year.
The EU is India's most important trading partner and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
European Trade Minister Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath, stated that the European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008.
EU Foreign Ministers gave the European Commission a green light last April to open negotiations with a view to signing free trade agreements (ALE) with India, South Korea and the Association of South-East Asian Nations (Asean).
The EU is India's first trading partner and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but according to the European Commission figures, India is only the EU's ninth trading partner.
A free trade pact will bring the two economic areas tremendously forward and India would improve its access to a market of 450 million wealthy Europeans, said Peter Mandelson.
Europe is the first or second market for the ten most frequently exported products from India, the European Commissioner continued. Asian and European giants exchange goods worth EUR 47 billion each year and services worth EUR 10 billion, Daniéle Smadja, President of the European Commission's delegation in New Delhi, declared this week, and regrets that mutual trade has not yet exhausted its potential. The EU and India are meeting on Friday for their eighth diplomatic meeting in New Delhi, where Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and President of the European Commission José Manuel Durao Barroso will be present.

The Bank of England takes note of the concern and offers 10 billion pounds for five weeks
On Thursday, the Bank of England expressed concern at reducing the current recurring concern about credit conditions and announced an offer of ten billion pounds with a basic interest rate of 5.75% for five weeks, an offer with an unusual maturity.
In order to mitigate the fears that the financial market conditions will be particularly harsh at the end of the year and to give banks greater certainty as to the way in which they are to organize their liquidity positions at that time , the Bank intends to offer a significant part of its savings during the maintenance phase beginning on 6 December in the form of an open market operation for five weeks , it states in a communication .
The Bank further states that on 6 December at 12.15 GMT, 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be circulated at the property tax rate and only until 10 January.
This seems to be the first time that the BoE is in circulation in an open-market operation for five weeks.
This usually happens for a week.
In its communication, the BoE adds that it is ready to take further measures to obtain the interest rates of the interbank loans with its basic interest rate from day to day.
The interbank interest rate varies from one day to another on Wednesday at 5,829%.
The three-month interest rate has risen to 6.6%, slightly higher since September 18.
Since the beginning of the financial crisis in summer, the sums brought into circulation by the Bank of England have been coupled with fines that had prevented banks from using them.
According to some rumors, reinforced by the evolution of the pound price in contrast to the euro, many preferred to sign for the sums brought into circulation by the European Central Bank at more favourable interest rates and with safer discretion.
UMP and NC refuse to review the PS's proposals on purchasing power
On Thursday, the groups UMP and Nouveau Centre refused to discuss the articles of the socialist bill on purchasing power, which corresponds to a rejection of the text.
The text produced by a socialist niche (meeting on the initiative of a parliamentary group) indicated about ten measures adopted on Wednesday by the National Committee of PS, of which the majority were 50% for the employment allowance, the reintroduction of the TIP fleet, a transport check or a limitation of rents.
After UMP and NC had voted against the examination of the articles (180 votes to 115), the session was closed after the main discussion, which led to some violent exchanges of words between majority and opposition, several hours before Nicolas Sarkozy's TV contribution on the purchasing power.
The leader of the PS's MP Jean Marc Ayrault announced that his group would present the whole of its proposals as an amendment to the bill for the correction of finances, which had been examined by the Assemblee last week.
A New Festival Is Born
As a result of numerous rumors about the creation of a new music festival in Philadelphia by C3 Presents, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with Festival Republic of British producer Melvin Benn.
It is an honor for our company to work with a person who, no more and no less, has served as a model for the current festival movement in America, Charlie Jones of C3 announced on Bilboard.com.
C3 organizes the Lollapalooza Festival in Chicago and Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for camping holidays.
The festival will probably take place from 8-10 August on a 500 Acre private farm about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
The director of Festival Republic Melvin Benn, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the most renowned festivals in the world.
In 1989 he took over the management of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts around 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio, and then, in 2006, Festival Republic created the Latitude Festival at Henham Park in Suffolk.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn has also taken care of production as co-owners, licensing concessions and organizational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Charlie Jones of C3, who describes Glastonbury as the most inspiring event he has ever been at, says that his company and that of Melvin Benn work in parallel to each other to offer the area a European-style festival event.
We have chosen Philadelphia as a market and are working with the Fairmount Park Commission to create a festival in the city centre of Philadelphia, says Charlie Jones.
We held negotiations with the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic about this project.
Unfortunately, we have remained in political debates with regard to the current administration, continues Charlie Jones.
"Happyly we were able to discuss with Melvin Benn and we are preparing a great festival in an extraordinary place that will ultimately benefit the population."
C3 Presents has brought the Lollapalooza Festival back to life in the 2005 Grand Park Chicago, after it has become part of the festival's world together with the Austin City Limits Music Festival in 2002.
The two events were able to reach $9.8 million and $11.8 million in gross tax days in 2007.
These two festivals take place in an urban environment.
"The European model of Melvin Benn is a rural festival, whereas ours are more likely to take place on the urban green spaces," says Charlie Jones.
"The aim is to combine these two concepts in one way or another, in order at the same time to convey the impression of a rural festival on the European and one urban in the American way."
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The community of Vineland, including the mayor, takes the burden of this event with pleasure," says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to disclose the terms of the agreement, but he confirms that "they are sufficiently interesting to invest in such an event and to record a festival that hopefully will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says that the recording capacity of the festival is "very large", corresponding to the 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says the invitations have been sent to the groups, but nothing could be confirmed when they were printed.
"Vineland will offer tasteful rock, but the music will be very diverse, hoping to attract all kinds of spectators," says Charlie Jones.
His partners from C3, who received the Top Independent Promoter Award of the last Bollboard Touring Award, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal meets the Terminator.
It is not easy to get the main platform for Hollywood movies to Montreal if no less than the Terminator opposes.
These lock tests belong to the delegate's tasks.
A political "hiical mandate" because the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, condemns the Runaway Productions.
Is it difficult to negotiate with the "Governator"?
"You have to be careful, because it's the industry that decides where it's going.
If she finds that the conditions in Montreal are favourable, she will go there.
Our role is to offer those you think are the best," he says.
Run to the festivals.
For Denis Turcotte, however, the top priority at the moment is the promotion of the cinema there.
The hunt for the Oscars has begun.
At all the festival on the west coast, although that of Sundance, that of Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, it will be about presenting the films from Quebec, evaluating them and ensuring that the producers give interviews.
The dark age had a successful performance at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
He will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake hands with the Devil is on the poster in Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
This month Quebec also presented four short films and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest.
Is the stock exchange nearing an end-year rally? Disunity with the experts due to the US mortgage crisis
The investors are already rubbing their hands with just under five weeks up to the financial statements on the stock exchange in view of the upcoming final year rally.
However, experts cannot make safe forecasts in this regard.
Banif believes that purely statistically speaking, the month of December on the stock exchange normally goes hand in hand with a positive market development
Nevertheless, it is not advisable to draw up short-term forecasts and only on the basis of statistics. Especially if tensions to be taken seriously determine the current market situation
Although other experts do not approve such a strong rise in the price of the past weeks of the year, they nevertheless note that the exchange rate is determined by the liquidity of the market and the market participants given. These invest mainly in pension funds due to the lack of secure equity funds, which is heavily affected by the up-to-date trend towards income-rich assets.
As a result, in the opinion of these experts, the stock market will be more likely to have a more lateral price trend influenced by market fluctuations, especially because we cannot estimate the extents of the possible fall in the interest rate of the U.S. notes bank, an uncertainty mainly due to the rise in crude oil prices and the risk of the rise in inflation rates.
Javier Barrio, chairman of the sales department at BPI in Spain, agrees that it is a time to announce an upcoming market rally.
The chances are not very good, assures the expert.
The Spanish stock index Ibex has already lost a value of 4% since its highest mark on November 8, of 15,945,7 points.
But not all experts share the same negative opinion.
According to Juan Solana, Analyst at Intermoney, the Ibex 35 could successfully complete the year with almost 16,000 points as a result of the restructuring of the investment funds and the traditional grant of the pension fund every year at this time.
Nevertheless, the expert emphasises that things could develop slightly differently this year; especially due to the final year rally that took place in the second week of December, and consequently directly after the day of the bridge to the day of the Constitution.
According to the analyst, price fluctuations would not affect market trends.
According to Federico Olucha, Analyst at Bank Inversis, the previous market situation assessments are at an almost technical level, which could lead to a short-term deviation from the index values, which depended on the consequences of the US mortgage market crisis.
The analyst trusts that these are positive.
When selecting the values to drive the Ibex to new maximums, the analysts agree.
Solana of Intermoney suggests that this year's great values are on the line.
The expert would count the two big banks and some real estate companies as the electricity sector will be too expensive at the given time.
In the meantime, Federico Olucha of Bank Inversis assures that the increases in connection with the banking and industrial sector will be associated.
If the Rally actually occurs, the real estate companies will benefit from it.
The ACS has been on catch-up in recent months and we hope that other real estate companies such as Ferrovial and FCC will follow the same path, says the expert.
With regard to the increased consumption behaviour during Christmas days, the market situation will be determined in the last half of the year.
On the other hand, the expert believes that the technologies will also achieve positive sales results, even if they are only small in the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, December only showed two declining course trends.
When the technology bubble burst at the end of 2003, the stock market led to its crisis and at the same time initiated the last real final year rally.
This year, in which Ibex 35 picked up 28.17 percentage points, December showed an increase of 6.68%.
Whether 2008 will be the fifth year in a row (the Ibex has been rising by 8.36% since January) and can also show an end-year rally will show up.
Popular will have opened its 200 credit institutions from Mondays to Fridays 12 hours a day.
Popular has decided to modernise much of its branches.
A total of 200 of them are located in Spain's strongest economic regions.
For the institute operating under the brand name Popular Max, these branches mean a big milestone.
But also for the rest of the Spanish institutions, as Popular is the first banking group, the leap dares to extend the opening hours of its branches by 20.30 p.m. on Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 20.30 p.m.
The BBVA banking group, which has also repeatedly announced the extension of its opening hours in the branches, has not yet reached a definitive decision.
The Bank's current negotiations with the trade unions seem to be aimed at an agreement that will close 75% of all branches on Saturdays and open them on a weekday afternoon, but not for customers.
Whether other banks join the new initiative that adapts to business opening times will depend on the experience of the popular bank.
And this is also the intention to pursue the popular with their project.
The aim is to extend the opening hours of those branches which, due to their location, can capture the purchasing clientship of independent, small and medium-sized enterprises, but also those of large department stores.
The Bank would like to open the new 200 branches over the next 18 months, since these are not new, but changed opening hours.
For this purpose, the bank will remodel the premises of those branches that are already in business zones and at the same time align them to the individual customer profile of the different zones.
The expansion of the opening hours is linked to a new room design of the branches, which is characterized by a more recent, colorful design.
The competent bank representative Ángel Rivera assures that the restructuring did not require any major investment, but was accompanied by an increased staffing position, since a branch now needed no more six, but eight or nine employees.
The branches, which will be equipped with additional premises for SMEs, will not sell financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tested his concept at nine branches in Madrid.
And the experiences were positive, according to Ángel Rivero.
The offices of the streets Bravo Murillo, O ́Donell and Gran Vía have been selected for what appears to have been a wise decision.
Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image
And another 60 who operate under the name of Mundocredit. These are specialized in immigrants and also have extended opening hours, even on Sundays and holidays.
In these stores of PopularMax the model of BBVA is not used, since most of them will instead offer a wide range of non-service services for sale.
We don't want to compete for our customers, explains Rivero.
With Telefonica, they have reached a preliminary agreement to sell mobile phones with the help of external bank staff.
The Spanish private channel Telecinco doubles its stock exchange value for the first time and thus overtakes its rival Antena 3.
We did it.
With this sentence, the managing director of Telecinco, Paolo Vasile, announced his satisfaction at the closing of the stock exchange. The channel he managed had increased his value by two times his rival Antena 3.
One aspect, however, dampened his joy: that's exactly what was hurt to me; not that we had a higher growth, but that we had lower losses, he noted.
He stressed that despite the weak market, they did not fall too deeply.
Telecinco ended the day yesterday with an increase of 2.54%.
This profit reduces its previous losses to 15.66%.
According to Bloomberg, the company value now reaches EUR 4.488.88 million, with Mediaset controlling the main share of capital (52%) and Vocento only participating at 13%.
The rival Antena 3 lost 1.52 percentage points yesterday and has been reporting a total loss of 40.5% since January so that its market value amounts to 2.193.46 million to half.
In contrast, the market value of other listed communications companies increases; in the case of Sogecable to 3.571 million, in Prisa (editor of the magazine Cinco Días) to 2.518.53 million and in Vocento to 1.779 million.
The comparison with Antena 3 can be derived from the fact that these are two similar companies, says Vasile.
The question of the extent to which we can actually operate in exchange technology, at what price and how we can make it lucrative at customer level is still uncertain.
A week ago, Telecinco announced his intention to rise to the first TV station this year with more than 1000 million gross profits from advertising revenue, which was guaranteed by Guiseppe Tringali, the managing director of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the advertising company of the group.
If the project were to be implemented, the station would increase its advertising income by 3.6% compared to the 965.4 million from the previous year.
In the case of Antena 3, net sales increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the stock exchange (up to 734.4 million), while net revenue from the television business could only increase by 0.7% (630.4 million ).
The main factor for Telecinco’s better stock exchange performance is seen by the analysts in the high payout ratio, which the company has been able to show until now: In 2006, the company led by Alejandro Echevarría caused a 100% dividend distribution.
Vasile assures, however, that after buying 33% of the shares of Endemol, with Mediaset as a parent company, the ratio may still vary, even if it is too early for an official announcement.
We are obliged to pay at least 50% of the shares to the official compromise, even if we have been significantly more and more so far.
I hope that we will be able to satisfy our shareholders this year, whose share values we have already increased by buying 33% of the Endemol shares.
According to the analysts, the market is currently experiencing certain trends in losses.
Lehmann Brothers recently reduced his profit calculation at Telecinco by 4% this year and 7% in 2009.
This is due to the reduction in the expected growth rate, which will fall from 10.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% in 2009 to 5.1% in 2009.
This has also decreased the expected profit calculation of Antena 3 for 2008 by 4.5% and for 2009 by 7.5%.

JPMorgan: recommends to reset expectations in both cases in view of similar threats (saturated market and worse economic climate)
The Congress agrees with the MIFID Directive, which entered into force on 1 November.
In parallel with the parliamentary drafting which ended its meeting today with the Senate Congress decision on the additional/amendments to the project, the government published the provisions resulting from the new law with the intention of allowing the entry into force of both regulations by the end of the year.
The representatives of the various companies unanimously praised the efforts of Congress and Senate delegates who in their negotiations and votes had pursued the aim of establishing the best possible regulation ensuring the security of investors and regulating individual business activities in order to ensure a generally efficient market activity.
In addition to modernising the financial markets, MIFID, which redefines the securities service regulation, pursues an improvement in investor protection, an increase in the control entitlement of the Spanish Securities Commission (CNMV) and the promotion of cooperation between the various control authorities of the European Union.
The new Directive allows specialised companies as well as natural or legal persons to provide financial advice and also contributes to the establishment of new financial services companies (ESIS), the consulting companies that are associated with investment firms and investment firms of securities.
It also extends the number of systems for the execution of financial transactions so that the regulated circulation markets are added to the multilateral systems of securities business and the systems for the internationalisation of trading contracts, which would ultimately compete with the current economic operators.
The law requires investment firms to report the focus of their business profile, confrontation and the forms of dealing with risks on the market and to register all projects carried out in order to facilitate the CNMV's control task.
The Congress Economic Commission subsequently provided for further changes, with the decision that the titled debt securities must now be considered as complex financial resources for the investor due to their high level of risk, as a result of the US mortgage and banking crisis. (US mortgage crisis)
In addition, the entry into force of the Directive on the legal limitation of the fields of work of qualified economists was used; 30 years after 1977, the regulation was adopted which restricted the fields of work reserved for economists.
The Senate, for its part, set out new positions in the financial sector, such as that of the economic mediator who works on foreign account, does not require authorisation by CNMV and can offer its services for commercialization of products and for customer acquisition to several investment companies at the same time.
The harmonised consumer price index (CPI) rose by five tenths in November and is now 4.1%.
The indicator used by Eurostat to assess the inflation rate within the European Union provides the average price trend in Spain in November.
Its publication is in line with the principles of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB), which seek to compare the location and quality of US products by publishing the data.
The forecast for the indicator can be prepared in advance by using the same approach as the harmonised consumer price index, but at the same time using several other statistical modelling methods to estimate the information that does not exist at the time of the calculation.
However, the Spanish Statistical Office (INE) recommended that the pre-determined indicator should only serve as a benchmark and therefore not be in line with the final result announced on 14 December.
The consumer price index (CPI) will continue to remain at a relatively high level
According to the Deputy Head of Government and the Minister for Economic and Financial Affairs Pedro Solbes, the increase in the CPI in November was a temporary development and at the same time ensured that the price index would remain at a relatively high level in the coming months.
Nevertheless , in the halls of the Congress building , Solbes noted that even if the current number is not good , the inflation gap between Spain and the other members of the Monetary Union has remained more or less the same in recent years .
Moreover, he explained that there were fewer surprises in November than in the previous month, in which the government did not expect such a high increase.
We expected a value of around 4% , the Minister of Economics and Finance announced in view of the forecast published today .
Virgin calculates North Rock revenues of over 42 billion euros over the next three years
Northern Rock's assets fell by more than half after the bank had asked for an emergency loan in mid-September of last year, due to crisis, and it now amounts to only 12,000 million pounds (this corresponds to 16.800 million euros).
At that time, the assets of the Bank amounted to a record 25,000 million pounds, a sum which has fallen significantly within two and a half months due to the loss of customer confidence, and despite the government's 100% guarantee that the money will continue to fall by the end of the crisis.
The Virgin Company, which would continue the group after the acquisition under the Virgin Money brand name, will have to contribute about a quarter of the UK banks' income, which will be made up of the investments over the next three years, to acquire exactly the 18 billion pounds needed to achieve its 30 billion target.
The group of multimillionaire Richard Branson, who is known for his striking advertising campaigns in the United Kingdom, intends to make 50,000 million pounds (equivalent to about 70 million euros) flow into advertising and marketing campaigns annually to achieve its goal.
This week, Northern Rock named the Virgin Group, in which three more companies are involved, as its preferred bidder to lead it out of insolvency.
The Mayor of Totana arrested for suspected participation in urban corruption
This morning, the Spanish police arrested the current mayor of the town of Totano (Partido Popular) belonging to the town of Murcia, because of the urgent suspicion of involvement in urban corruption that was discovered this week.
In addition, one of the secretaries of the municipal council and the head of the municipal police were arrested.
José Martínez Andreo represented last May the office of Juan Morales, currently a member of the Partido Popular and at the time chairman of the municipal council of Totana, and, according to information provided by the broadcasting station Cadena SER, could be the original wirewright of the plot.
Officials continue to search the business documents of the municipality and the Ministry of Urban Planning and do not exclude further arrests in the coming hours.
In addition, Juan Morales' lawyer was accused of the main suspect in the case of urban corruption discovered at the beginning of this week.
According to information provided by the Cadena SE, the lawyer of the popular, and consequently privileged MP Juan Morales was arrested in leaving his client's residence due to important taxing documents to be associated with the plot.
In addition, other sources of information report on the alleged morale order payments to a Galician construction company, which provided for the conclusion of a urban contract which decided to build a 200-hectare site.
Eight people are currently in detention.
Bono agrees to accept the candidate for the PSOE in Toledo and, in the event of an election victory, in Congress.
Former Minister of Defence José Bono has accepted the offer of the President-in-Office and Secretary-General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, who will lead the list of PSOE candidates at the upcoming general elections in Toledo and, in the event of a election of the Socialists, will take over the office of Congress President.
Thus, José Blanco, the organization secretary of the PSOE, and Bono announced at the press conference after today a meeting with Zapatero took place in the headquarters of the party.
In the view of the Head of Government, the offer to the former Minister is justified, as it is important in politics to be able to count on the best and Bono is among the best.
In addition, in the event of a victory for the socialists in the coming elections, the Mancha-born politician would seem to be running the congress for the party.
Bono would replace Manuel Martín as Congress President, who announced last November 15th that he would no longer take part in the next general elections, finish his career in public policy and instead work for climate protection in the university area.
The former minister had to admit that since his resignation two years ago, the government president had been constantly pressing for his return to political events.
He also pointed out that, as in the appointment of the Vice-President for Economic Affairs, the party would not want to hold back citizens who would take over the post of president of the Congress in the event of an election victory, and described this as an act of transparency.
If he should actually take over the office, he hopes to turn the chamber into a house of respect and not an insult or a barn, in order to make it appear more and more similar to the citizens.
Unfortunately, from time to time one gets the impression that the only place in which one cannot speak quietly and calmly in Madrid is Congress; so the government president in the Senate was once interrupted up to 26 times.
At the same time, he praised the current President Manuel Martín and his good work and suggested that he would not seem to have taken over the office, otherwise his political opponents would call this arrogance.
Climate propaganda
Since the climate debate involves a harsh criticism of both the skeptics of climate change and those who put social and political debate in the foreground, the movement as a whole must have strong cohesion.
In particular, it is a leader of the movement who, as in the case of President Zapatero, considers the fight against climate change to be more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and even proposes to conclude a new treaty with the planet.
However, this proposal puts him in a state of crisis with regard to his government's action or non-trade, which has made a decisive contribution to Spain's being at the top of the EU's countries which have least complied with the requirements of the Kyoto Protocol.
Who are the ones responsible for failing to meet the requirements, which sectors are due to this, and why has his government, which had proposed the contract with the planet, not stopped this development.
In addition, it is now forced to present to the Spanish citizens the measures it intends to take to combat climate change without compromising.
Which companies will be affected by the behaviour of the citizens, which individual and collective austerity measures will have to be carried out and which economic consequences will result.
More specifically, whoever has to sacrifice himself and pay for the salvation of the planet.
However, there will and will not be any such explanations in the future.
It's because it's about sacrificing and paying.
Because the measures that can be taken against climate change are unpopular.
They are expensive, uncomfortable and threatening for the accounts of companies and citizens.
Even the petrol cent proposed by the PSOE, Zapatero appeared so dangerous in terms of election strategy that he was forced to withdraw the proposal.
Accordingly, it is now necessary to save the planet with nothing, with pure propaganda and empty sayings without any real consequences.
With impressive statements, commissions, committees, protocols and new offices.
With his contracts with the planet, the otherwise appropriate politician for election campaigns does not have to speak, or accuse, or demand, but instead follow the demanding edition to decorate the meetings and to inspire others with his gentleness and kindness.
This can only happen if the contract does not deviate from its purely virtual nature and therefore does not indicate that the bike will become the only means of movement in the future, or we can only refresh ourselves with one subject.
The mayor and police chief of Totana due to alleged involvement in urban corruption.
The Guardia Civil has arrested the mayor of the town of Totana, which belongs to Murcia, the popular politician José Martínez Andreo. In addition, the local chief of police, the secretary of the mayor's office and a hotel businessman for the suspected suspicion of urban violations were arrested, it was said today from investigation circles.
The city council was arrested at his residence, from where he was taken to the municipal office and in whose premises he was located until the present time, surrounded by numerous agents who had also arrived at the municipal administration and the municipal construction management Suelo Industrial y Vivienda.
The three arrests were linked to the searches already held in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid last Monday, where it was found that more than 2 million hectares of unexploited land for urban projects should be remodelled under the direction of the Galician construction company Nuaria, which should be built on the property 4000 homes after the local administration had sent them illegal commissions during the last legislative period.
In addition, two other persons were not directly arrested, but were subject to an investigation, which was initiated and carried out by the first court of Totonas.
The first six arresters were presented to the judge today.
According to investigation circles, the former mayor of Totana and current independent PP delegate Juan Morales is also determined.
His ex-wife, owner of a real estate company registered in Totana, as well as his current friend residing in Murcia, are also suspected.
The chairman and owner of the Nuaria group, the Vigo-derived lawyer and entrepreneur Manuel N.A., was arrested in the locality of Nigrán (Pontevedra), as well as the managing director of Suelo de Inmonuar Pablo José M.G., whose company is supposed to have served as a subgroup of Nuaria and to have received the lubrication money.
The investigations are carried out by the Municipal Authority against urban crime, under the supervision of the Central Unit of the Guardia Civil, whose representatives carried out eleven further searches in addition to the arrests, most of them in companies directly related to the arrests in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
At that time, only one person was arrested in Totana: the owner of a regionally known poultry farming industry, which is said to have been a middleman.
The Nuaria building group was commissioned to build the largest residential complex of the village belonging to Murcia, which should include more than 5000 apartments, a golf course and two spa hotels.
The company acquired over 2.2 million square kilometres of land in Totana, which was to be converted. The aim was to implement a construction project that would increase the population of the municipality to 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria group includes other companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which promote the sale of real estate; Conyase, which operates in Vigo the parking spaces of the streets Coruña, Venezuela and Plaza Fernando el Católico; Hogartel, whose activity is limited to the direct marketing sector and Preconiza, specializing in the promotion, sale and installation of building elements.

Our Finnish correspondent explains the comment published yesterday in the most important Finnish newspaper, Helsingin Sanomat, (Finland, by the way, is at the top of the PISA study), which refers to the comment published in the same newspaper on 18 November; by chance, on that day, whose issue contained the criticism of the book Blackburns.
The content of philosophy has become the subject of public debate after the tragedy surrounding the school of Jokela.
Responsible for the cruel murders is a graduate who quoted the works of Platon and Nietzsche in his news.
In an interview of the newspaper Helsingin Sanomat, the chairman of the Education Council for Philosophy, Pekka Elo, called on teachers to take a more critical position on Plato and suggested that Platos be removed from the lower-level teaching plans for philosophy in Gymnasia.

A colleague informs about the inclusion of illegal Internet downloads in the Criminal Code:
A. Downloading a song would be a violation of the law that would be affected by six months of imprisonment.
However, if you rob a music business with a value of 400 euros again, this is only considered to be a simple violation (Article 623.1).
B. If you rob the business up to a value of 1000 euros, then the theft is classified as a criminal offence, but the penalty is less than in a download (Article 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and give it back forty hours later, the penalty is still lower than with a download (Article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a beating than to a music data exchange.
To participate in a rebellious dispute involves a prison sentence of three to 12 months (Article 154 of the Criminal Code), while the data exchange results in a six-month withdrawal from liberty for up to two years
(Article 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. According to Article 184.2 of the Criminal Code, sexual harassment at the workplace is considered less bad than downloading a DVD movie from the Internet.
F. The trade in copyright-protected films, whose authorization by the authors has not taken place, is subject to a higher penalty than the distribution of pornographic film material to minors (Article 186).
Well, if my colleague were to be right, then someone would have made a pretty good deal of his demands.

My family doctor handed me one of his long, strange research articles entitled Money leads to activation of certain areas of the brain, especially when the others get more of it.
So the feelings resulting from the monthly salary are dependent on the salary of colleagues.
The study was compiled by a tomographic-magnetic reference analysis at the University of Bonn, and the results were published in the latest edition of the Science journal.
According to Bernd Webers, author of the study and director of the Bonner Brain Research Center Life&Brain, the activation was strongest if the participant gave correct answers and his partner failed.
The researchers could see that brain activities were always very moderate when both participants were correct with their response and therefore got the same salary; but if one of them received double, there was also a stronger brain activity.
I am not quite sure whether it really takes so much scientific effort to achieve such a result.
The solicitor from the Balkans
For eight years, Carla del Ponte has been brutally searching for the criminals of the Balkan Wars. Its seat is in the prosecutor’s office of the former Yugoslavian Criminal Court, based in La Haya.
Their mandate will expire at the end of the year, and Carla will leave their office with a crying and laughing eye, as the main leaders of the massacre of Srebrenica - in which eight thousand Bosnian Muslims were killed - are the ex-general Ratko Mladic and former Serbian leader Radovan Karadzic.
Their names are listed by the Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach, who has not yet started his documentary film La Liste de Carla (2006); a film that, at the pace of a political thriller, pursues the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York in her attempt to trace the escape criminals and put pressure on the respective governments to tighten up their networks.
Which insurance is best for me?
The car insurance, which covers a possible case of damage caused by the driver, includes a high cost burden, the amount of which is again dependent on various factors, including age, gender, date of the creation of the driving licence, family status, type of car to be insured and its use, etc.
Owning a car is just the beginning.
Because it is even more difficult to find the right vehicle insurance than the right vehicle model.
First of all, you have to be clear about what we are dealing with here.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and an insurance company.
This agreement shall be recorded in writing by means of an insurance contract that determines that the company receives the agreed insurance premium and is in return obliged to present the corresponding amount of compensation in the event of a claim.
The insurance premium is the price of an insurance composed of several factors, including age, gender, date of production of the driving licence, family status, type of vehicle to be insured or its use.
Insurance undertakings shall determine their prices according to the statistics so that higher contributions are due in the event of a higher risk of accident.
For this reason, both over 25-year-olds and women need to make fewer contributions, as statistics show that these groups have a lower accident rate thanks to their caution.
The same applies to married persons, since, according to the statistical values and thus also according to the companies, these tend to be less accidents than single persons.
The benefits attached to the vehicle affect the frequency of driving and thus the probability of an accident.
The more frequent the use, the more likely the damage.
In setting up the premium, insurance must take into account a number of points.
For this reason, the driver also needs to study the situation thoroughly in order to select exactly the car insurance that best suits his personal needs.
We are now listing the most important points that should be considered when choosing insurance, in order not only to make a performance choice but also to make a price-oriented choice.
The under 25-year-olds face numerous obstacles when choosing low-cost insurance, such as low driving practice and the young driver's license.
Even if it would be best for the ideal insurance protection to take out a full insurance, there are still cheaper alternatives.
The careful drivers can choose a full-scale cashier with self-interest, so that the benefits of a full-scale insurance are covered but offered at a low price.
This kind of contract involves that the customer must pay part of the amount caused by the damage himself.
The amount is determined before the conclusion of the contract and on the basis of the amount of the insurance premium, which is higher the sum to be paid , says Luis Noguera, Spain's prime representative at First Europa, an online insurance intermediary.
Another option is the extended insurance, which assures customers against external accident damage, but not against the damage caused by their own car.
Furthermore, this type of insurance would cover theft, fire and vehicle loss.
Here's a advice.
If you are under 25 years of age, it is in your hand to reduce insurance costs; your credit increases by trying to drive carefully and avoid accidents.
A credit is a reduction in the basic rate of the corresponding insurance company.
On the contrary, a penalty includes an increase in the said tariff.
The amount of credits and penalty payments depends on society and its income.
If the company has a profitable year behind it, it may allow itself to increase the bonus payments, explains Noguera.
As soon as the 25-year-old mark is exceeded, it is easier for drivers to conclude a contract. The reason for this is the fact that increasing driving practice reduces the accident rate.
It is therefore most useful to opt for a full insurance insurance with self-interest.
Usually, young people cannot benefit from their previous experience, both in the event of an accident and at the time of driving, explains the Spanish leader of the European company, and adds that the majority of accidents occur in the second practical year after the beginner's fear has been removed.
Nevertheless, it is more advisable for a married customer who does not have children to take out full cash insurance; of course only if it allows the financial situation of the person concerned.
The insurers consider married couples with children to be customers with the lowest accident rate, and consequently their contribution payments are low.
In this case, full cash insurance with a self participation (with an amount of 300 euros) would be the best option. In case you have received a high credit, an extended insurance is recommended, which will only be used for the third year of the vehicle.
They drive more relaxed overall and have a greater purchasing power that allows them to make a higher contribution, says Luis Noguera.
For pensioners, it is appropriate to take out a full insurance with a self-employed contribution (with an amount of EUR 150) or an extended insurance which only applies to a sufficiently high credit.
Finally, you have to note that car insurance is something very important, not only because it protects the driver from possible accident damage, but also because it entails high costs that require a thorough selection that corresponds to our personal situation.
Celtic Glasgow hopes for the eighth final in Milan
FC Milan and Celtic Glasgow will fight for the point on the next Tuesday in San Siro that they are missing in order to reach their respective goals before the end of the Champions League pre-round. The Italians need the point to reach the top of their group, while they decide on their participation in the Scottish.
The Italian team already has five points and have already confirmed their participation in the fifth round with a final in Portugal, while the Celtic Glasgow with nine points needs another point to make sure that the FC Shakhtar with six points does not catch up with the Befica Lisbon with four points.
The two games of Group D will take place one week before the end of the sixth round of the game, since the Milan FC will have to compete at the FIFA World Cup in Japan, where he will fight for the first time to enter the final on the 13th in the semi-final, which will take place on the 16th.
For example, this group will be finished ahead of everyone else, and the decision-making at the Guiseppe Meazza Stadium will be the all-expected result, even if both teams will try to win, because the Italians will not want to speculate at home, the Celtic Glasgow knows that in the event of a victory, they would have a better starting position in the eighth finale.
Gordon Strachan’s team could even win a defeat in a loop of the Shakhtar FC in order to qualify. Nevertheless, he shouldn’t rely too much on such circumstances, because on nine points the Ukrainians are allowed to participate; they had lost (2-1) last week in Glasgow, but were able to win (2-0).
Thus, the Milanese will try to miss the Scottishs the evening. They hope again to reach the eighth finale of the remodelled Champions League for the second time in a row, after they were defeated in the previous season in exactly the same round by a goal of Kaka in the post-playing period (1-0) and by a zero to zero Undecided on the game.
While the FC Shakhtar is waiting for the victory of the Rossoneri, the team will have to focus on their own game, since both the achievement of the eighth final and their membership in the UEFA depend on their victory and defeat of Celtic Glasgow.
In spite of its lower table position and without the prospect of continuing to participate in the largest European championship, the Benfica Lisbon could win third place and thus participate in UEFA.
20,000 people visit the first Spice Girls Tour concert in Vancouver.
The Spice Girls gave the start of their first tour after the band was dissolved in 2000, in the sight of 20,000 spectators in Vancouver.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) y 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) explained shortly before their concert at the GM Place de Vancouver Stadium that the mood was excellent in the reunited band.
Around 20,000 people were able to experience the concert in the sold out stadium where a video of the band's history, which had provided furore at the end of the 1990s, was shown.
The reunification and the world tour overlap with the release of a new album, which includes their biggest hits and two more new songs, headlines and voodoo, and which appears in Spain under the label of EMI.
The five members of the Spice Girls wore gold bracelets on stage that the husband of Posh Spice, the English football player David Beckham, had previously given them.
The athlete was among the fans in the audience who glowed the GM Palace, although his spouse Victoria's nerves had forbidden him in the previous days.
During the preparations for the Show, Victoria Beckham announced that the British star had never seen our wardrobe once, and that's why I'm already very excited about what he'll think of the performance.
Sporty Spice , whose resignation from the group in 1998 due to internal disagreements two years later the disbandment of the group, expressed her nervousness two hours before the concert at a press meeting.
I was shocked.
I was nervous, but I saw that the attitude of the world public had changed, that the feelings of the Spice Girls had changed.
And that's why I didn't think so; so I'm glad to have made this decision, Chisholm said about the separation of the band she had made nine years ago.
The singer also made it known that the disputes had been resolved and that they all enjoyed themselves again.
Nevertheless, many things have changed since the Spice Girls' last concerted appearance in 1998.
First of all, the group arrived in a special machine from Virgin Airlines in Vancouver, according to the TV station CTV.
Upon arriving at the airport, the band was welcomed by an army of nanny girls.
The five have seven children together.
After the concert in Vancouver, the band will perform next in California, San José (December 4th) and Los Angeles (December 5th and 7th).
In Madrid they will enter the stage on December 23rd.
New fears about natural gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine
A new price dispute is floating between Ukraine and Russia, which increases the risk of Russian exports being affected by fuel to Western Europe.
Most of the Russian gas exports to the European Union (EU) are directed by Ukraine and any dispute between the two nations is closely monitored.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow increases the price it has to pay for natural gas, it will charge higher transit charges from Russia.
An earlier conflict between the two countries last year reduced deliveries to the EU countries.
The recent conflict between Kiev and Moscow occurs at a time when the Ukrainian government and the Russian state gas monopoly Gazprom are trying to reach an agreement on how much Ukraine has to pay for Russian natural gas in 2008.
According to Gazprom, Ukraine has to be more calculated as the Group has agreed to pay up to 50% in addition for natural gas from neighbouring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say that this could mean that Ukraine has to pay 40% more for Gazprom imports.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit states in discussions," said the Minister of Economic Affairs of Ukraine Anatoli Kinakh of the news agency Reuters.
"The changing prices of natural gas should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments regarding the amount of transit charges [to Western Europe] via Ukraine."
In the last major natural gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev in January 2006, Gazprom reduced deliveries to Ukraine.
This resulted in a case of exports to Western Europe, which dramatically boosted prices.
Russian gas represents a quarter of the European Union's supply.
Russia has the world's largest gas reserves, but much of it remains underdeveloped.
The result is that Gazprom complements its own supplies with gas from Turkmenistan and other Central Asian former Soviet nations.

The Scottish State Health Service must improve the controls of the pre-punishment registers for workers from outside Europe, said a member of the control body.
The recommendation of chief financial controller Robert Black came after a foreign doctor in Scotland was brought in connection with the attack on Glasgow Airport in June.
Black also expressed concerns that the Scottish state health service has no precise idea of the number of its foreign employees.
But his report pointed out that other important checks were carried out correctly on a sample of five health authorities.
The main financial controller examined personnel recruited outside the countries of the European Economic Area following the attack at Glasgow Airport.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after a field car was driven through the doors of the main airport terminal.
He was one of three doctors who appeared in a video transmission in October and was charged with the alleged car bomb attack in Great Britain.
It is expected that the State Health Service will carry out checks prior to the appointment of foreign employees to ensure that they have the necessary qualifications, experience and authorization to work in the UK.
Although health authorities use Disclosure Scotland to review pre-punitive records, the Agency does not have the power to obtain such information outside the UK.
The main auditor's report now states, in addition to other recommendations, that the Executive Board should take up guidelines from the Penal Register Extract, which helps employers to check in different countries.
"Although we have found evidence of these checks in some personnel documents, they have not been routinely carried out." the report noted.
Black said that the Scottish health authorities would follow their investigation guidelines to a high degree before recruitment, but added: "Our report shows areas in which the system can be improved to ensure that accurate information on the number of foreign health care workers is available."
BMA Scotland Chairman Dr. Peter Terry said it was "extremely unlikely" that investigations in the run-up to the appointment of potential NHS employees would identify people who could commit future terrorist attacks.
"The report states that the NHS Scotland's current pre-selection tests are working well and it is not clear what added value the recommendations will deliver," he said.
The Scottish health authorities say that they currently have 1,161 foreign employees, the majority of them doctors and nurses.
However, the financial controller warned that the number was likely to be higher, also because the board had problems identifying those employees who had left for an indefinite period of time.
The investigation continued that established control procedures by NHS authorities in Ayrshire, Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian were largely complied with.
These include passport, work permit, and qualification checks.
the Scottish Government is currently reviewing its policies and guidelines for pre-employment checks for foreign personnel in the NHS.
The Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said, "It was my concern to carry out this work in the face of the terrorist attack at Glasgow Airport."
It added that the Scottish Government, in conjunction with the health authorities, would take into account the recommendations of the report and ensure that the best practices in updated guidelines regarding control investigations would be reflected in the run-up to the appointment of all employees - including those from abroad - whose publication is planned next month.
Joy Division Dominates Film Award Award
Control, the film biography about the late Joy Division singer Ian Curtis has received five prizes at the British Independent Film Festival, among others for the best film.
Prizes were also awarded to lead actor Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse before being cast for the role of Curtis, director Anton Corbijn, and side actor Toby Kebbell.
Dame Judi Dench was awarded the best lead actress for the Thriller Notes on a Scandal.
And Bond actor Daniel Craig won the Variety Prize for getting the British film into the world public.
The prizes were presented at a ceremony in the London Roundhouse.
Control follows Curtis' rise to fame with Joy Division until his suicide in 1980 at 23 years of age.
The black and white film - on whose soundtrack The Killers, David Bowie and New Order are to be found - was shot for just £3 million.
Nevertheless, he has presented two prizes to Dutch photographer Corbijn, the best known so far for the iconic cover of the U2 album Joshua Tree, as the best director and the best director.
Rock music was the focus of another award winner at the ceremony - when Julian Temple's film about the Clash singer Joe Strummer got the prize for the best documentary.
The award for the best performer went to Viggo Mortensen for his role as driver of a Russian mafia in David Cronenberg's London-playing Thriller Easter Promises.
Ray Winstone, who is in the reputation of playing hard guys, has picked up the Richard Harris Prize for his outstanding contribution to the British film.
The 50-year-old, whose films include Scum, Nil by Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming the Indiana Jones continuation The Kingdom of the Chrystal Skull.
Winstone said he was proud to receive the prize, which was named in honor of the Camelot and Harry Potter Stars Harris, who died in 2002.
"It was people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney who opened doors for people like me," he said.
"I was lucky to meet Richard Harris a few times.
He's my type of person, a great actor of his time, I'm really honored."
The independent film awards, known as Bifas, are selected by a group of filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
The Bifa supporters and sponsors include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
208 arrested in Saudi Arabia for a terrorist plot
Saudi Arabia revealed yesterday that it had arrested 208 militants for belonging to cells who had planned an imminent attack on an oil plant as well as on spiritual and security forces.
The state television of the world's largest oil exporter said that one of the cells would have planned to smuggle rockets.
Sympathizers of Al-Qaida have launched a campaign against the monarchy, which has been an ally of the United States since 2003, following the invasion into Iraq.
A cell of eight militants, led by a foreign citizen, planned an attack on an oil plant in the eastern province, according to the TV report.
Saudi Arabia has formed a 35.000 man strong fast intervention force to protect plants after a failed Al Quaida attack on the world's largest oil processing plant in Abqaiq in 2006.
The report, with reference to an internal ministerial declaration, says that 18 of the prisoners were part of a cell led by a "missile expert" who emigrated illegally to the country.
He reports that the militants had planned to smuggle eight projectiles into the kingdom.
According to the report, another 22 of the prisoners were planning to kill spiritual and security forces.
The government has warned clergymen to do more to stop Saudis who are striving to join forces with Al Qaida militias who want to fight the Allied forces and the US-supported Shiite Muslim government, which the Hardliners under the Sunni Saudis consider heretical.
Al Qaida militias consider many of the clergy in Saudi Arabia to be in cooperation with the authorities in support of the politics of the royal family that dominates the government.
The militias, accompanied by calls from Osama bin Laden, the leader of Al Qaida, born in Saudi Arabia, to target the pro-Western Saudi government, have excluded foreign residential areas, government buildings and energy sector facilities.
"This was a very great effort of the security forces over the last... five months," said a spokesman of the Ministry of Interior to state television.
The arrests also concerned a "media cell" of 16 from Medina, which aimed at promoting "takfiri thinking" - the ideology of the radical Sunni Muslims who support violence against Muslims who are branded as unbelievers and apostates.
Among the prisoners were also 32 people accused of providing financial support to the militias.
The climate on Venus could reveal a view of the future of the earth
The Venus was perhaps once a pleasant place to live, scientists said yesterday.
Data from a European spaceship on a orbit show that the planet is even more like an averted twin of the earth than was previously known.
Venus is the closest planetary neighbor on Earth.
The two worlds have about the same size and have similar planetary orbits, but the Venus of the Sun is a little closer.
Billions of years ago, scientists believe that Venus had ruled on conditions that would have been very similar to those on earth and could even have been habitable today.
But because of the unrestrained carbon dioxide greenhouse effect, the erosion of the atmosphere by sun exposure and a slower rotation rate, Venus took a completely different development course.
Today, the planet is deprived of water and has a surface temperature that is hot enough to melt lead and is devastated by hurricane-strong winds and lightning storms.
The findings of the Venus Express space probe of the European Space Agency, which examined the plants for a year, provide a sobering look at how the Earth could develop in the face of catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor of the Department of Physics at Oxford University, one of the head of Venus Express Mission, said, "It becomes clear why the climate on Venus is so different from that of the Earth, while the planets are otherwise quite similar."
"Our new data enable us to construct a scenario in which Venus started billions of years ago like Earth, possibly with a habitable environment."
"Enriched uranium" confiscated by the police
A kilo of radioactive material, reportedly enriched uranium, was confiscated yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police spokesperson said that three people were arrested and that the material was being checked.
He did not confirm whether it was enriched uranium, but said it could have been sold for $1 million (480,000).
Everything's still open.
Mitt Romey said he did not consider it worthy of a presidential candidate to be questioned by a snowman.
Nevertheless, the Republican candidate for the presidency finally agreed to put a debate on YouTube, record questions on video in the normal voters and submit them to the candidate.
None of the questions raised on Wednesday evening, November 28, were as ridiculous as the Snowman, who questioned democrats about global warming in the YouTube debate of the other party.
But the questions, and the answers, exactly reflected this time the state of the Republican party that will start the elections next year.
It is not known just like the producers of CNN who supported the debate with the selected YouTube Clips to be shown to the upcoming candidates.
However, in the first half hour of the debate, which was the longest devoted to a particular subject, immigration was the focus.
The topic is one of the most powerful topics for Republicans.
The CNN asked a group of indecisive voters to use a dial when they heard things they liked: The TV station noticed tips of approval when the candidates spoke strictly over the borders.
The sharpest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, the national pioneer, and Romney, who pushed forward in the decisive surveys in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani tried to shake off the reputation that he had been yielding to illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked Romney in whom he accused the former governor of Massachusetts of recruiting illegal immigrants for work at his home.
The two of them were particularly violent as a questioner asked if one of the candidates would support an "amnesty" (the illegal would give a regular status and the possibility of citizenship).
Insignificant candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a California Congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, managed to follow this topic.
Neither of the two men has any serious chances of nomination, but both stay in the race, perhaps because they're sooner and harder than others on the immigration spauke.
At least in the area of immigration, the candidates generally share the same views: sharper boundaries, intolerance to illegal migrants.
This theme, together with fears about toxic toys from China or other concerns about the rest of the world, helps Republicans to forget or minimize the differences between liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate was clearly problematic when other issues were raised.
Mr Giuliani was asked why he had supported arms restrictions in the past.
John McCain and Romney discussed whether simulated drowning should be considered torture.
One of the questioners asked if the candidates believe every word of the Bible.
This led Giulian to take the view that although the Bible is his preferred book, he may not literally believe the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another questioner asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - now contrary to all expectations in the first place in a recent survey in Iowa thanks to his long-standing Christian conservativeism - said that the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When he was urged whether Jesus would support them, he laughed at them and said that Jesus was too intelligent to apply for a political office.
The race remains exceptionally open.
Huckabee's rise in Iowa coincides with Ron Paul's recent donations and his applause storms in the debate of Wednesday.
These two were shot out of nowhere because the two wings of the party so far could not agree on one of the more famous and traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate united the party from the beginning and convincingly with a victorious message about the size of America and a twinkler to both wings of the party.
This time the party is split and the result is far from clear.
Labour Party Pain
Gordon Brown has discovered another pit to fall in; his way out of this remains the same.
For British scandals this is not particularly slippery.
No title seems to have been sold, no politician paid Parisian hotel bills, no extramarital toes have been sucked.
But the discovery that a wealthy businessman has veiled donations for the British ruling Labour Party over more than $650,000 ($1.3 million) under the name of other people for four years, and that the party has failed to report this, is something that the contested Gordon Brown would have done well.
When two months ago the Prime Minister had withdrawn the demand for an election, in a stupid way insulting the intelligence of the British by claiming that opinion polls had not influenced this decision, there was hope that he would offer a robust, efficient government.
Instead, as Vince Cable, the increasingly sharp representative of the Liberal Democrats, expressed it, the once feared Brown has developed from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The incompetent rescue of Northern Rock, a bank hit, showed regulatory weakness and poor judgment under fire.
Poorly thought-out proposals to amend tax laws have brought business associations against the government.
The tax authorities' loss of personal data of 25 million people showed unimaginable administrative messeries.
A trio of retired generals launched an insurrection in the upper house out of protest against reductions in military expenditure: to be a minister of the armed forces, they claimed to be a part-time job.
Now there are the diverse donations of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, Labour’s Secretary General (and her former Head of Fulfillment) has already resigned.
None of this means that Brown leaves irrevocably.
Nevertheless, governments can reach a turning point after which they feel it is impossible to rule.
Neither do people like nor trust politicians, but they usually hold back their scepticism when a new force takes office.
Once it is clear that it is unlikely that a prime minister will improve the situation, and he does not even need to be there for long, this delay is over: the public service is beginning to leak; the cabinet ministers are beginning to chat; the press is looking for bad news; and the government is going to be defensive and aimless.
In a way, Brown's position is particularly difficult because, unlike other political leaders, he cannot claim to be a new broom.
As much as he'd like to deny Tony Blair, he was his chief lieutenant.
The problems with Northern Rock and tax jurisdiction documents, for example, are related to decisions made by Brown as Chancellor of the Ministry of Finance.
And even if he wasn't directly involved in Blair's miscarriage - as in the long "money for nobility" investigation of political party funding - voters might assume he was.
Nevertheless, Brown's situation is not as bad as she looks.
The sins are not as terrible as the conservatives describe them.
Like Mr. Bean, no one died or was completely dizzy.
And the antidote, painful as it may be, is what Brown's natural Stalinist tendencies have always promised: a reliable, solid and slightly brutal government.
A good example is the new grievances about political donations.
The Garboesque of Abraham, who compares his donations with his nonprofit gifts, he does not wish for public recognition of his goodwill.
That may be the case, but he was not allowed to decide.
The laws against anonymity for large political contributors are clear and exist for a clear reason: the public has a right to know who can buy access to those who rule the country.
Watt, who says he would have known about Abraham's agreement, but not that she is illegal, will naturally have to ask some questions; just like Jon Mendlesohn, Labour's main financial driver, who was told about the strange donations in October.
However, Brown is not involved so far: there is nothing to indicate that he knew about these confusions, although most of the payments were made after his takeover in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has done half of the work.
He quickly condemned the violation of the laws by his party, but he watered down this determination by grasping a known instrument, an investigative committee on the subject - to complete the measure, by a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, "the lessons to be drawn from" are not very complicated.
If the law has been broken, it's a matter for the police.
Apart from that, there are other things that Mr Brown has to do, how to find a permanent chairman of the Independent Committee on Standards in Public Life, which has been unoccupied for six months, and to move forward with a comprehensive reform of political party funding.
This would require the hardlines of the Labour to cooperate with the Conservatives and possibly give up the special financial relationship with the trade unions - bitter pills for a party partner like Mr Brown.
But he should be aware of some partial facts.
The conservatives now have a clear leadership in opinion polls; it has two years to win back voters; and the only way it can achieve a victory is through undisputed justice and sound competence.
Card sharks
Is the credit crisis affecting America's credit card market?
When blood is in the water, it's only natural for back fins to whirl around excitedly.
Now that America's real estate market is ill, predators have the country's credit card market in sight.
Goldman Sachs analysts expect credit card losses to reach 99 billion dollars if the risk of infection spreads from underfinanced loans to other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases in both the payouts and the bridging rates, which measure the proportion of loans that are not recoverable or late for more than 30 days.
The HSBC announced last month that it had taken a $1.4 billion fee collection from its American consumer funding, partly due to the weakness of credit card holders.
Still, it's too early to panic.
Losses and bridles are still low.
According to Moody, the third quarter stocking rate of 3.89% was almost a full percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration in the rates can partly be explained by technical factors.
A change in the US Private Insolvency Laws in 2005 resulted in an abrupt case of bankruptcy applications, which in turn represent a large part of the credit card losses; the number of applications (and thus bridging fees) would again increase whether the general conditions for borrowers worsen or not.
Industry also reports on solid payment rates that show how much of their debts consumers pay each month
and confidence in credit card-based securities is quite strong, despite the downturn in other corners of structured financing.
Dennis Moroney of the TowerGroup, a research company, expects that the expenditure for 2007 will ultimately be 25% higher than last year.
Direct infection channels between the real estate credit crisis and the credit card market are sure to exist: it is more likely that consumers take in credit card debts, now that home loans dry out.
However, the card issuers look at the money flow rather than capital values, so falling house prices do not necessarily trigger a change in the creditworthiness of the borrower.
You can even be of benefit to the card issuer.
Incentives for consumers to continue paying mortgage rates will fall if real estate is less value than the value of the loan; as a result, card debt will become more important among repayment priorities.
Card issuers can also react much faster and more flexible than lenders to the more stormy conditions by changing interest rates or credit limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risk of a rapid re-evaluation of assets.
"We will not wake up one day and reassess the loans completely," says Gary Perlin, Capital One's main financial reference.
Even if a sudden undercover crisis in the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of a sustainable downturn are much more real.
If lower domestic prices and a reduction in credit are pushing America into recession, industry will undoubtedly face a worse future.
Keep looking for these shark fins.
British bankers confess guilty in the Enron case
Three British bankers, who were to be brought to justice for their role in the fraudulent system with the former head of financial services of Enron, Andrew Fastow, turned their requests into guilty on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew had originally pleaded for seven cases of fraud using telecommunication means for the alleged conspiracy with Fastow in a secret financial fraud in 2000 to enrich themselves at the expense of their employer.
The procedure had been initiated on January.
But during a hearing in court before U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Junior, everyone pleaded guilty in case of fraud using telecommunications.
The three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, a unit of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, became known in the UK during two-year extradition proceedings.
In the United States, her case is a loose end to an investigation that was started after Enron's collapse in 2001.
The accusations made against them in 2002 reminded Fastov that he was the aim of an investigation by the government in connection with the Enron decline.
The charge against the bankers - called the "NatWest Three" - claims that they came to Houston in 2000 to cover a fraudulent plot with Fastow and his former top adviser Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of a partnership of Enron, controlled by Fastow, who was the architect of countless fraudulent Enron machinations, which helped to tear the company into the concurrence.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank had estimated the value of its participation in the subsidiary to be zero, but the three British men knew that it actually had significant value.
A Kopper-controlled company acquired the bank's shares in the subsidiary for $1 million.
The bankers paid Kopper $250,000 for a stake in this company.
According to the indictment, Fastov falsely represented Enron that the energy company would pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its shares in the subsidiary.
But actually the $20 million went to the British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankers received $7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper, and others sold about 12.3 million, according to the charges.
In January 2004, Fastow declared guilty in two counts of conspiracy for his role in the Enrons Pleite.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is serving a 6-year prison sentence in the Federal Prison of Louisiana.
Kopper has a sentence of three years and a month in a Texarkana facility.
Each of the three men was free on the basis of a $1 million deposit, which made it necessary for them to live in the United States in expectation of court proceedings.
Enron, once the nation's seventh largest company, crumbled in bankruptcy in December 2001, after years of accounting tricks could no longer cover up the billions of debt or make debilitating businesses appear profitable.
The collapse destroyed thousands of jobs, more than 60 billion market value and more than two billion dollars pension plans.
The Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former CEO Jeffrey Skilling were sentenced last year for their roles in connection with the Enron collapse.
Skiling takes a penalty of more than 24 years.
Lay's conjugations for conspiracy, fraud and other charges were annulled after he died last year for heart disease.
Not all the way down in Moscow
The price of an aircraft of the Gulfstream G550 brand, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and enough reach to fly nonstop from Moscow to Los Angeles, is at least 54 million dollars.
But that's a change for some of the rich Russians.
"It can accommodate up to 18 passengers," said Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
"But none of you ask for so many seats because it's for a private family or a corporate president."
Firer was at the Gulfstream stand last Friday at the Millionairessexhibition, a four-day orgy of showcasing consumption organised in a nested exhibition center on the outskirts of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury suppliers had built exhibition stands, hoping to attract new Russians to money, from mahogany-coated yachts to diamond-covered car grills that would be appropriate for 50 cents.
Firer carefully visited a shiny orange Porsche at the next booth.
"This is a nice car, but it's a change compared to us," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest private aircraft market."
Heated by an oil boom, the Russian capital seems to be flooded with money like Dallas in its heydays.
"We went through the same phase in the 1890s when some Americans came to enormous wealth and went to Europe in crowds, where they were considered materialistic," said Marshall Goldman, a scientist at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
Like the Saudi Arab superflyers of the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians emerge as the world's most visible liberal issuers.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their share in the gold rush.
Elsewhere in Moscow this week, a conference of the luxury industry Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, president of LVMH, attracted to exchange ideas on how to sell high-priced goods in markets like Russia.
(The conference is organized by The International Herald Tribune, which belongs to the New York Times Company.)
Russia has 53 billionaires, which have a total of 282 billion dollars, according to the Forbes list of the richest people.
In addition, 103,000 Russian millionaires belong to the second class, worth 670 billion dollars in total, according to a study on the development of private assets in the former Soviet Union, written by economic experts from the Centre for Economic and Financial Research, an expert body here.
(The World Bank says that in 2005 15.8 percent of Russians lived under the minimum standard of living.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow - that's why we're all here," said Nicole Marais, a sales and marketing representative of David Morris, a London jeweller.
She had visited the fair for the first time together with the Russian dealer of the brand, the Soho Jewelry Group.
"The women are all exemplaryly cared for and the men are all worth a fortune."
As they pass through the halls on Sunday night in evening clothing, two real estate agents, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, call themselves and their clients millionaires.
"I looked at the cars and I tried to decide between the Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche," said Ms. Yumatova, who delivered the designer clothing she was wearing, like a red carpet veteran with Joan Rivers.
The trade fair seemed to focus primarily on the new empires, the type of brand-conscious Russian buyers who would be willing to stand in a storage space for several hours to visit a crowded warehouse that in no way placed Cadillac Escalades, pocket knives from platinum, Mövenpick ice cream, customized billiard tables, apartments in Dubai and Gund Teddy bears side by side.
The public was able to buy tickets for 30 Euros (44.57 Dollars).
"The Russians are interested in learning which brand is the most expensive and best," said Mr. Gijrath, who was patriotically sitting at a fair stand of Dutch porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft in front of a wall-sized imitation of a Rembrandt image of hand-painted blue mosaic stones.
"Of course, Russians are more interested in climbers."
Indeed, the dealers here say that the Russians with old money (10 to 15 years old according to Russian standards) have already moved from large-scale logos to the type of sober brands with limited quantities that would not be marketed on a trade show.
Nevertheless, several thousand people, whether millionaires, ambassadors of millionaires, or simply tourists, pushed through the halls every day.
And some of them bought.
On the first night of the show last Thursday, Roman Ershov, the general manager of King Koil beds here said he had sold two 70,000 dollars mattress sets made of silk, cashmere and cotton, with sewn gold threads.
Also on the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, a sales manager for A1 Moto, told a company that high-end cars equipped with high-end alarm systems that his company had sold the gruesome orange Porsche to a Russian millionaire for 170,000 dollars.
By Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, the president of L.A. Connection, a company that adapts luxury cars to customer needs said he had sold three car cooler grills for a Rolls-Royce Phantom, the interconnected chain bracelets, for 55,000 dollars each.
He showed a reporter a car tire that was developed for a Russian casino owner, with spokes that he had covered with colored Swarovski crystals, so it looked like a Rouletterad.
The cost: $22,000 for a four-place.
"The Russian millionaire, the ostrich leather wheels or a picture of his wife's face from cubic zirconium, will not necessarily ride on these wheels," said Mr Karapetian.
"He will keep it in his 30- or 40-car garage."
Although many of its Russian customers are rich, Mr Karapetian said that the phrase "Russian millionaires" would not express much exclusivity at the moment, given the increase in local property prices.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, they are probably already millionaire, at least on paper, if not cash," he said.
"There are more of them than you believe."
Those who were not millionaires could at least pretend to be rich in a stand operated by Alliance Continental, a Russian asset management company.
The company had set up four red telephone cells according to British model, which were stuffed with mountains of false millions of dollars.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing director, said his employees had printed out 500,000 false banknotes for the millionaire fair.
Passersby stopped to throw the piles of money around, mobile phone photos, while leaning back in the middle of the spare wealth, being cut by friends, or just to put a few million in.
"See, in Moscow everyone can feel like a millionaire," said Mr. Karryev.
Sustained operation suspected of death in New Jersey
It was the day before the harvest Thanksgiving festival when Ronald Livingston saw through the large glass window of Just a Little Healthier Restaurant here and observed an ambulance on the white Cape Cod holding two doors further down on West Scott Avenue.
Soon there was a police car there.
And then there was another one.
"Then I saw the boxing car of the medical body viewer," said Livingston, a restaurant supervisor on Wednesday.
"That was the point when I knew someone had died."
The authorities learned that the dead woman was Olga Arroyo, 41, an assistant to the director of the Newark Police Department.
Now the investigators are trying to determine if she died because of a trial carried out by an unauthorized cosmetic surgeon who did not identify the police and who worked at the house on West Scott Avenue 212.
The authorities have not yet found out what caused Ms. Arroyo's death, and are hopeful that toxicological investigations, whose results could not be available for weeks, will help to clarify a mysterious death that has sent a grief through the leader of the Newark Police.
Ms. Arroyo has been an assistant to the police director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice has been known to many in the department.
"She was loyal, hard-working and persistent," said Mr McCarthy about Mrs Arroyo in a telephonic interview on Wednesday.
"She was my Pitbull.
She protected me."
McCarthy said that Ms. Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer working for the alcohol control committee, leaving two sons, 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, a spokesman for Union County's prosecutor, Theodore J. Romankow, said that investigators would try to determine whether Arroyo died as a result of an unauthorised, surgical treatment.
"This is one of the possibilities," said Mrs. Walsh.
"It's an ongoing investigation."
The authorities said they had arrived at the house at about 3 p.m. in November.
And they found Mrs. Arroyo on a sofa.
She was declared dead on the spot.
More than a week has passed and the authorities have reported little about their investigation or about the owner of the house, which is listed as Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh didn't want to say if Mrs Castro was questioned by the authorities.
The researchers try to see if part of the house has been used as a medical practice.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door to Ms. Castro's house, where a withered rose shrub stands in the narrow front garden and a Dalmatian is ringing behind the house.
A blue barrel labeled "Ethyl Vanillin" - used as a substitute for vanilla in food and perfumes - sat in the parking lot next to a door leading into the basement.
Two mountain bikes hung from hooks on one side.
McCarthy said that when he first arrived in Newark after 25 years with the New York Police Department, Ms. Arroyo was invaluable and helped him find himself in the provincial and hard political culture in his new city.
"She said, 'You must pay attention to this or that'," he said.
"She was always here when I arrived and she was always here when I left.
It was embarrassing."
Hopes that the central bank will lower interest rates will lead to an increase in world stock markets
The shares jumped yesterday on both sides of the Atlantic, after market hopes that the Central Bank will try to calm down the credit markets by further reducing interest rates, were reinforced by relevant comments from the Vice-President of the US Central Bank.
The stock markets increased in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kahn, number two of Ben Bernanke, the Chairman of the Central Bank, said that politics must react "flexibly and pragmatically" to the continuing pressure on financial markets.
In a clear effort to calm down threatening markets, given signs of rising credit tensions, Kohn said that the recent turbulences had "partly reversed some of the improvements in market functions from late September and October".
If the increased turbulence persists, it would increase the possibility of further strengthening the financial conditions for consumers and businesses, he said.
The comments were taken by investors as a signal that the central bank is willing to intervene and to stabilise the credit conditions with new capital injections into the US markets and possible further interest-rate reductions.
The statements also helped to calm Wall Street, given further bad news from the US economy, now that sales of US real estate reached a new record low in October.
The consequences of the financial turmoil were underlined by Bear Stearns, the Investment Bank, that it would eliminate 650 jobs, or 4 percent of its global employees, in a cost-reduction measure to compensate for serious losses from their lost bets in the US mortgage credit sector.
It is expected that only 20 of these posts will disappear in London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Index jumped by 331 points, or 2.55 percent to close at 13,289.40, while the broader S&P 500 index increased by 2.65 percent.
In London the FTSE 100 index increased by 165,5 points, or 2.7 percent to close at 6,306.2, adding more than 39 billion pounds to the value of British standard values.
Germany's index Dax rose by 2.6 percent and France's CAC40 increased by 2.3 percent.
Previously, the re-emerge of credit pressure on the markets had been underlined after strong demand for an auction of three-month guarantee funds from the European Central Bank granted to the European Commercial Banks was granted at a significant 4.7 percent, the highest rate since April 2001.
The pressure to follow the Bank of England, the US Central Bank and the European Central Bank and to inject further capital into the money markets in London increased when credit tensions were seen to rise the three-month "Libor" rates for loaning between UK banks by 6.59 percent to their highest since late September, after a continuous increase since November 21.
England faced with decision on the statements of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here are two dilemmas, each of them almost as difficult as the other.
Who is to beat the number 6 for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, not less relevant in a broader context than the first test against Sri Lanka, who should make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the president of the election, is here on call at least under this special title, to help the head coach Peter Moores and captain Michael Vaughan decide, and because the table of High Morries, the English managing director, gradually fills itself with applications for national electors, if not for those in part-time.
Whoever does not get the sixth position will be unhappy, but life is often unfair and sport is undoubtedly it.
It is never easy to nail exactly what enables a person to reach the top of his profession, while someone else never goes beyond the lowest rank, sometimes because of lack of happiness rather than ability.
It is not only in the cricket where the selection is difficult, where judgments are needed, which are always subjective at the end.
Is it the right time to get up for Bopara?
Is it fair to Shah when he does?
The same may also be asked in another area whether, for example, John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both intelligent young managers should be promoted with good degrees that know the business well.
Who can say what the right class for a cricket player is unless he is given the opportunity to swim or fall.
Of course, figures have a major influence on decisions, but opportunities do.
Within a team, a cricket player has to catch the captain's eye at the right time if he can take a swipe and a beater has to get regular chances on the order if he wants to make an impression as a one-day cricket player.
Catching the eyes of the pickups is more complicated.
There were many who were better in the last season than, for example, James Anderson, who seems to be playing in the first test, even if Stephen Harmison explains himself to be healthy and how the wind is pinting into the nets.
Anderson took 32 first-class Wickets with 33 runs each to earn a position in this tour.
Chris Tremlett only took 29 with the same modest average, but both had their highlights and hoped for even more.
Whether Shah or Bopara is playing at the Asgiriya stage can only be a question of viewpoint.
The choice could decide on the careers of both men, or it might make little difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every test and was successful in the first, with five Wickets and 40 useful runs, but it was Paul Collingwood, at that time still struggling to solidify himself, who made the breakthrough into an important test cricket player and who, although he scored a double hundred against Australia in Australia, may still be underestimated.
It is likely that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, will follow their conservative instincts and abstinence for Shah's greater experience of Bopara's youthful enthusiasm after a further discussion during today's network session at the Asgiriya Stadium.
There are arguments for both.
For Shah, his sparkling and valuable 88 test debut innings in Bombay, 43 first-class hundreds and only six from Bopara, who is seven years younger at the age of 22, and an excellent balance against turned bullets.
But Shah made only ten runs in his two innings in May against West Indies in the test in Lord, his home arena as a player from Middlesex, and this, plus his immediate rejection of the electorate as Vaughan, was healthy in order to take back his position for the next game, seems to have taken the swing out of his beat, which was still evident in Uncategorized.
In contrast, the all-rounder of Essex has partial joy in life.
He is not impressed by anything on a cricket square and his attitude away from it was brought to the point when he had recently missed a four-wheeled vehicle in an exhibition for England's sponsor Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and probably a shock, but the first thing he did was to take out his vodafone (of course also sponsored) and call his teammate Alastair Cook, who had seen this from a distance, and to say with enthusiasm, "Have you seen this?".
Bopara is a much better field player, he cones his average pace with some effect here on the playing fields, which seems to fit him and beats with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing to choose the right time another.
Maybe that's the actual art of selection.
I tend to give Bopara his chance now, which does not mean that Shah may not stand there well if, as Ceylon's tea set suggests, he is the one who will play here this weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and to fight Al-Quaida
The first bus loads of Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, with a stream of displaced persons whose funds or visas have expired, and others who hoped that the city would return to normality.
Some had even come back to fight the rebels they had driven out of their homes.
At the Mansour Bus Station, before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in an official government convoy of a dozen buses, the terminal was operational with refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned in private transportation.
"I decided to go to Syria after killing many doctors in Baghdad," said Sabah Al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
"I came back today because of what I saw on television and what I read in the newspaper about what happened in Baghdad and how it would be safe now."
They say that the Mahdi army has stopped killing people," he said, regarding the Shiite militias of the militant cleric Moqtada Al-Sadr, who has ordered his forces to reset at this time.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shiite teacher from the predominantly Sunni part of Amariyah, returned with his two children because he could not renew his Syrian visa and because the regime did not allow Iraqis to work.
His Shiite neighbors in Amariyah called him to tell him that a local militia, supported by the United States, helped drive Al-Qaida out of their bastion in the west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the new arrivals from Jordan was the leader of a Sunni and Shiite tribe who had been driven out of his house in Sleikh in the north of Baghdad by an attack with hand grenades after calling his fellow citizens to fight Al-Qaida.
He had come back to fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they started an anti-Al-Qaida militia in Sleikh and that they needed my support and those of my boys.
That's why I returned today," said Sabah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many told that they had been attracted by the increasing peace of mind in the capital since the U.S. force increase and the growth of local "groups of affected citizens" who were armed and in cooperation with the American military defend their districts.
But more spoke of having been forced home by visa problems and far-reaching funds in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, a 51-year-old three-year-old father, expressed the general suspicion among the exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shiite Prime Minister who had requested Syrian government to impose visa restrictions on refugees to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people have probably fled from the sectarian death squadrons in the country.
"We went well until al-Maliki visited Syria and the government forced the Iraqis to stop giving visas to force them to return to Iraq," said the Sunni pensioner.
"I can't trust a government that supports the criminals who burned down my house after I left."
Part of the reason for the decline in violence is that Sunni were distributed from Shiite residential areas and vice versa, resulting in the creation of many places where tensions have declined.
There are fears that a sudden inflow of refugees will arouse sectarian tensions and conflicts.
Small Saarland, good education
The smallest federal state is the leader in vocational training and even shines with the international orientation of its universities.
Only in one field of education are the Saarland countries expressing the same deficit as the rest of the country.
"I declared yesterday for the 50th time to a non-Saharan country that we are not French" - this slogan puts the smallest federal state itself ironically on his 50th birthday.
France and Luxembourg play a major role in the education system of the Saarland, which ranks fifth in the education monitor of the Institute of the German Economy Cologne (IW).
From tradition, universities cooperate closely with neighbouring countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
To date, students can complete their studies here with a double or even triple diploma.
Accordingly, the proportion of foreign students with 15.6 percent is high.
But the country children also bring the Saarland to the universities in an above-average number - many of them without a degree in the gymnasium.
"In Saarland, the vocational education system is used," says Axel Plünnecke, education expert at the IW.
More than one-fifth of young people acquire their degree in a vocational school, which means that the Saarland is more than seven percentage points higher than the federal average.
The combination of vocational and academic training has also been greatly expanded.
According to the population, dual courses are the second best in Germany.
Despite practical training and increasing demand, however, the number of engineering graduates has fallen by one third in recent years.
That is why the Saarland Ministry of Education has now committed the universities to a marketing campaign for engineering subjects.
"In the general education schools, after the first Pisa study, we started a number of reforms," says a spokeswoman from the Ministry of Education.
For example, the government introduced national comparative tests.
So that the children start learning earlier the last Kita year is free of charge - a model that has now also been copied by other federal states.
Whether the student's performance will improve in a sustainable way will only show future comparative studies.
At Pisa 2003, the proportion of risk students decreased from 29 percent to 20 percent.
Overall, however, the Saarland did not rise as strongly as other federal states.
The Bavaria are better counted.
And to the blackout of the Saarland countries, foreign language skills at Pisa are not measured - in this area you could otherwise point out.
Because the language of the neighbours is mandatory to Gymnasium - even if the Saarland countries are not French.
Chávez puts the clocks around
In Venezuela, the clocks are ticking differently than in the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chávez reverses the timepieces in the South American country by half an hour.
In Spain, Chávez is now a joke figure.
According to a new law, according to Venezuela’s Official Journal, the clocks are set to the world’s time minus four and a half hours.
This gives the South American state a time zone that is not available in any other country in the world.
The U.S. enemy Chávez founded his decision on, among other things, the fact that the United States of the world had imposed a total of hours on time zones.
In addition, on Wednesday (local time) Chávez announced the termination of relations with neighboring Colombia because of a hostage affair.
The left-wing nationalist said that as long as the conservative Alvaro Uribe president of Colombia remained, he would have no relations with the head of state or with the Colombian government.
"I can't do this on my own because of my dignity," said Chávez, who is driving a constitutional reform on which the citizens of the oil country must vote in a referendum on Sunday.
With the reform, he would significantly increase his power in the country.
The result of the dispute was the decision by Uribes to withdraw Chávez from the mandate to negotiate with Marxist rebels in Colombia, which concerned the release of hostages.
Uribe had spit Venezuela with his decision "in face", Chávez had criticized on Sunday.
Chávez is also in Spain.
A new mobile phone ring in the country provides for Furore: "Por qué no te callas" (Why don't you shut up) is the sentence that more than half a million people have downloaded from the Internet.
Spain's King Juan Carlos, who at the recent Ibero-American Summit was upset by the constant calls of the left-wing populist, had crossed his mouth.
Germans Threaten 2007 Wohnminus
Despite the strong economic situation, German workers are forecast to lose real wages this year.
Experts called a whole bunch of reasons for their pessimistic prognosis.
According to a calculation by the Hans-Böckler Foundation, employees could actually expect less on the salary account in 2007 than in the previous year.
"This is due to the modest wage development, the increase in VAT and the price shift in food and energy," said Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomics and Economic Research of the "Image" newspaper.
New burdens could also be placed on workers in the case of unemployment insurance.
Minister of Finance Peer Steinbrück said the "New Osnabrücker Zeitung" that the planned reduction of unemployment insurance to 3.3 percent at the turn of the year was correct and reasonable in the current situation.
However, the Federal Labour Agency should not be embarrassed to ask the federal government for loans or grants, the SPD politician was quoted.
On Tuesday it was announced that the price explosion in food and mineral oil products drove inflation to the highest level for 13 years.
Prices rose by 3.0 percent a year.
Venus is the heavenly twin of the earth
The Venus, despite its hostile atmosphere, is more similar to that of the Earth: The European spacecraft "Venus Express" has discovered lightnings in the atmosphere and wind whirls on the Poles, as they occur on Earth in winter.
For almost three decades, scientists have suspected that it is flashing on Venus.
Now the European "Venus Express" probe has provided the evidence - it detects electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere: The lightnings on Venus shoot at an altitude of about 56 kilometers from cloud to cloud, reports Christopher Russel of the University of California in Los Angeles in the science magazine "Nature".
According to the famous Ursuppen theory, lightnings have created life on earth: thunderstorms are said to have stimulated reactions in the ocean that led to the formation of amino acids, the building blocks of life.
Not so on Venus: "If there ever been life there, it must have been in very early history," explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
Today, there is hardly anything alive on the surface of Venus: the atmosphere is about a hundred times closer than on Earth, sometimes temperatures of 500 degrees.
"The Venus may be the devil's twin of the earth, but it's a twin," said Russel.
Why the Venus, which is so similar to the Earth in mass and size, has taken such a completely different development, is the basic question of the Esa mission.
The launch of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was a milestone for Venus research, since since the early 1990s no longer had a probe specifically designed to explore this planet.
According to the researchers, the latest research results presented in several "Nature" articles not only highlight the uniqueness of Venus within the solar system.
"They also show that the similarities of our neighboring planet with the Earth are greater than initially assumed," the Esa says.
In addition to the already known whirlwind at the North Pole, the researchers found a cloud strudel at the South Pole, which rotates much faster.
The phenomenon reminds of air currents in the earthly winter hemisphere, writes a research team around Giuseppe Piccioni from the Italian Istituto di Astrophysicala Spaziale e Fisica Cosmoica.
The second-inner planet of the solar system has almost the same mass as the Earth and is almost as large with a diameter of 12,100 kilometres.
The planet, also known as the morning or evening star, orbits the sun in almost 225 days.
But he turns much slower around himself: a Venus Day lasts 243 earth days.
Although the Venus hardly remembers the Earth with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar, scientists assume that both planets have been created under very similar conditions.
On both of them gathered water, which remained on the earth in oceans, but on which Venus was lost to space.
And while carbon dioxide is fixed on Earth in carbonate rocks, it makes up the majority of the atmosphere on Venus.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama
Federal President Köhler calls for an end to the party dispute for the reception of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellor's Office.
Indirectly he criticized the SPD for her attacks on the Chancellor after the meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler is concerned about the prestige of Germany and has called for the great coalition to end the dispute over the reception of the Dalai Lama.
"We should not present a divided nation to the outside world on this issue," Köhlerhler told the Handelsblatt.
At the same time, Köhler signalled understanding for the reception of the Dalai Lama by Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
"Human rights have universal validity for me, even if I have respect for the diversity of cultures," said Köhler.
Everyone knows that Germany has to maintain sensitive balances in foreign policy, the Federal President emphasized, but he took protection from the accusation of a new China policy.
"The Chancellor has not distanced herself from the traditional one-China policy.
That's also what China knows," said Köhler.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) had indirectly shown disheartenedness over the reception of the Dalai Lama and had therefore been attacked from a number of the Union.
Among other things, Steinmeier complained about the Union's "window policy" in foreign policy.
After the reception of the Dalai Lamas in the Chancellor's Office, there was intense irritation in the German-Chinese relationship.
For example, the Chinese leadership not only invited the German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD) but also frozen the so-called strategic dialogue of the foreign ministers of both countries, according to the SPIEGEL.
China's head of government Wen Jiabao has now asked Chancellor Angela Merkel to admit that the Dalai Lamas was being received as a mistake.
China rejects it when European politicians officially receive the religious leader of the Tibetans, Wen Jiabao reaffirmed the Chinese position.
The actions and words of Dalai Lamas showed that he tried to separate Tibet and the other Tibetan region, which also includes other present-day provinces, from China.
Scäuble warns against scratches like in France
Street battles with the police, shots, burning cars: Wolfgang Schäuble warns against scratches as in France.
Everything had to be done so that social dissatisfaction in Germany did not discharge itself into violence on the street, the Federal Minister of the Interior demanded.
Barricades burned, randiers shot the police with shotguns: After the heavy youth crayons in France, Federal Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears a similar development in Germany.
"We must make sure that social explosives are not built up and discharged into violence.
We have to take this seriously," he said the "New Press" that appeared in Hanover.
Not every young person can cope with the rapid change in social reality.
Federal Government, countries and municipalities have already worked hard to solve problems, said Schäuble.
This is not just about the integration of migrants.
"From the integration summit to the Islam Conference, the first successes have already been achieved."
However, it is too early to be warned.
At the same time, Schäuble pointed out that there were no urban and sociological problems in German suburbs as in France.
In northern suburbs of Paris, youths had delivered heavy street battles with the police in recent nights.
Cars and public buildings also burned in Toulouse.
However, the president of the Turkish community in Germany, Kenan Kolat, called for greater integration efforts from the Federal Government.
In view of the crayons in France, Kolat warned of "imitative effects".
The situation in Germany is not as critical as in France.
But there is still a need for action.
Kolat pointed out that the unemployment rate among young people under 25 years of age was above average.
More training places must be provided in particular.
Kolat stressed: "We need to give the young people a perspective."
However, the president of the Turkish community added that in Germany more than in France "social control takes place in the families".
Many young people with migration backgrounds also did not want to destroy what their parents built here.
Kolat warned, "But we still have to watch out."
It is necessary to give young people the opportunity to participate in work and training quickly.
Meanwhile, it remained largely quiet at night in the Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bel.
Hundreds of police were in operation, a helicopter flown over the area with spotlights.
The competent authorities reported three arrests as well as a few burning garbage dumpers and cars.
Since the day before, a bid of around 1000 security forces has been causing peace.
The police will go through as long as it is necessary, announces Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie after a visit to the suburb.
At night on Tuesday, around 80 police officers had been injured at crayons in Villiers-le-Bel.
In the following eight months, the riots overcame Toulouse.
The crayons were inflamed by a traffic accident that killed two young people on Sunday.
According to the prosecutor's initial findings, the police are not responsible for the death of young people.
In the kingdom of Angela Cloud
The chancellor's remote appearance documents that the coalition is at the end - and that nothing more can be expected of her.
Which country does this Chancellor actually live in?
After their bleak appearance in the general debate of the Bundestag, which was voracious and inhaled, it must be said: not here - not in the country that would have to be ruled by it at last.
Angela Merkel rejected the allegation that she was too focused on foreign policy with an arrogant superlative sentence.
That was provincial, she said, and showed that she didn't want to understand what the critics were about.
In the Bundestag, it has documented for all how much their accusations apply.
There was neither a concrete interest nor a sense of feeling for the problems in the country.
Instead, Angela Wolke presented herself: a retired politician who flees to foreign policy and remains in danger even there.
For example, climate protection: it praises itself unabated for the decisions of Heiligendamm, but does not say how the climate targets are to be achieved in this country.
On the whole, self-blessing - so much immodestness would the CDU-chefin have failed two years ago.
Now she clings to the floscles that the upsurge is coming to people.
So she damages her image as a pragmatist who solves problems rather than beautifying the world.
But in the realm of Angela Cloud, internal political problems are a phenomenon.
Child poverty and the worries of the low earners?
She's got some side effects left.
It is significant how often she promises herself when it comes to the child supplement.
Three runs need Merkel to get a half straight sentence out.
It stumbles like on foreign terrain when it becomes concrete.

In the YouTube debate of the Republican presidential candidates, the two favourites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney deliver a tough exchange - and now have to fear an outside candidate.
The tension of the candidates is already at the first topic.
He has turned New York into a "place of refuge for illegal immigrants", and Mitt Romney accuses his counterpart Rudy Giuliani.
In turn, he counters with serious accusations: "I would say his own house was an illegal port," said Giuliani and accused the former governor of Massachusetts of having employed private immigrants without papers.
The candidates blow to the attack: because the Republican base still has no clear favourites, the eight presidential candidates use the debate on CNN above all to discredit their opponents.
The self-contained 30-second videos that Internet users have sent in via YouTube are hardly more than a keyword.
"With this kind of isolationism we have allowed Hitler to come to power," John McCain accuses his opponent Ron Paul, who is the only one in the round demanding an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney is also strongly read by the Vietnamese veterans when he refuses to condemn the so-called "waterboarding", an interrogation method in which drowning is simulated, as torture.
However, that the important topics of the campaign are now beyond Iraq's war and torture debates, the reactions of the Hall public in St. Petersburg in Florida show.
Whenever conservative values are extolled and future tax increases are rejected, applause burns up in the auditorium.
This shows once again where the weaknesses of the two favourites lie.
"I was wrong at the time," explains Romney, snarling and making excuses before base and television audience that he was still one of the abortion advocates in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, comes to the fore when he is asked for a literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf reigns for the first time in civilians
One day after his resignation as army chief, Pakistani powerman Musharraf was sworn as president.
This ended eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf was sworn on Thursday for another five-year term of office.
Pakistani television broadcast live the ceremony in the Presidential Palace of the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf swore to respect the constitution and act for the benefit of the nation.
On Wednesday, he had given his position as army chief to his trusted friend Ashfaq Kiyani and thus bowed to international pressure, in particular from the USA.
Eight years after his seizure of power in an unblooded military coup, the former general now reigns for the first time as civil head of state.
With his resignation as Chief Commander of the Armed Forces, Musharraf had met a core demand of the opposition and the West.
Another central requirement is an end to the state of emergency imposed on Musharraf on 3 November.
Soon after his oath, Musharraf, according to Advocate General Malik Muhammad Qayyyum, will abolish the state of emergency and thus fulfil another demand of the West.
The Supreme Court of the country, which Musharraf had occupied with him after the imposition of the derogation in early November, had in the past week rejected all objections to the controversial reelection of the head of state on 6 October.
In the meantime, five soldiers were killed in the northern tribal region of North Waziristan in an attack on a military convoy and four more were injured.
According to an army spokesman, the bomb exploded on a road near the Afghanistan border.
The fathers of the herbrock return
Germany's supergroup of the Seventies is playing again: the three band members of Harmonia once again set up their consoles at a concert in Berlin.
To the Revival a recording from her great time "Live 1974" appears.
They were already much more famous abroad.
The dreamed sensation then occurs in the shape of three men sitting on the evening table.
Everyone has his box in front of him, his cables and, above all, his buttons.
Dieter Moebius crowns in the flowery white shirt with 63 years in the middle.
Links flanked by Michael Rother, 57 years young and owned by laptop and guitar.
On the right, from the auditorium, Hans-Joachim Rodelius, 73, focuses on the console.
Everyone contributes sounds, sometimes even a beat.
And sometimes it accidentally fits into a conventional piece of music.
That does not seem to disturb the gentlemen themselves.
That the band is playing Harmonia again has caused some excitement among herb rock lovers.
While one may reveal here: Targeted questions showed that although the name was perplexed by the collective pop memory, it was not so sustainable to miss this band painfully for 32 years.
But why should the German not also celebrate his living legends from the 1970s?
Especially what is misleading Krautrock in England and America has always been more true than in their own country.
When the music industry awarded the Echo Prize for Life's Work to the survivors of the Cologne group Can in 2003, it was seen in questioning German pop faces in the hall.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers also thanked the bands La Düsseldorf and Neu! in the Laudatio, the surprise knew no limits.
At concerts, Michael Rother later stared at the Red Hot Chili Peppers on stage like an old buddy.
The problem of ignorance at home and the evangelization in the stranger is the one thing.
The memory is already overburdened with harmony, because the trio existed only two years and at that time also developed a much less effective force than was subsequently assigned to them by others.
Moebius and Rodelius had previously performed under the promising name Cluster with the artist Conrad Schnitzler.
At first, they played in the basement under the Berlin Schaubühne.
After that in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons for a record label maintained by the church.
Rother had just helped out at Kraftwerk and then performed a reputation as a guitarist with Neu!, the perhaps most radical German group at the time.
However, around 1973 Rother followed the cluster musicians into exile after Forst in Weserbergland.
There, in the Old Weserhof, a 16th-century ruin, they lived as city-fleet communities.
Less ideological than in the commune of I, where Rodelius was still allowed to tease as a nanny.
Rather in pointed artist's presence.
It is said that there was also a waste of the song club Harmonia Ottenstein and a name for the art.
Some of them held on to harmonia.
The first album was called "Music of Harmonia" and the following "De Luxe".
For so calm and modest the music sounded, the band suffered material hardship.
The collection of rice not only served to find itself.
The now released CD "Live 1974" was recorded at a concert in Griessem, in front of a nearly 50-member record setting, as someone thinks to be imagining.
From Rother came the desire to force and occasionally practice harmony.
An immoral demand for Rodelius and Moebius.
The band declared their separation in 1975.
Rother landed in the Esoteric-Spherical and secured his existence with albums like "Flaming Hearts".
Cluster was revived in the eighties and has been more successful since then than harmony has ever been.
The Griessemer live album is due to Herbert Grönemeyer.
Its record company Greenland has set itself the goal of maintaining the Krautrock as its own German contribution to living music.
New! has already been excavated like Rodelius Solowerk.
The physical resurrection of Harmonia takes place in the Berlin Haus der Kulturen der Welt.
Publicly subsidized, as part of the festival Woldtronics.
Julian Cope is there, the British, Altpunk and author of the manual "Krautrock Sampler".
There's also the love parade inventor Dr. Motte.
So that the whole range of influences of the herb rock would be encircled on the subsequent pop music.
Harmonia fills the empty space of the supergroup.
Brian Eno's sentence floats with the most special sounds in the hall: "The only true music, you belong to the future."
There are pictures that show the producers with harmony in the farmhouse.
Legendary formation serves projections of other black and white photographs of wired devices.
Before that, the three veterans are again concerned with improvisation.
No longer by sticking microphones to the organ and drums to unheard-of sounds to the instruments via self-made effects devices.
Today electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three in the Technically Deepened Tüftler.
The choir of the house doesn't change that either.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, sound clouds are hoisted and erased and sung in a beautiful place with emphase "Aaaaaaaah!".
Krautrock was always a very English term.
It was never rock.
The roots were sought less in the blues than in the music universities (can), technologies (power plant) or on the run from artistic and social social social (cluster).
Whoever calls here "'68!" is not quite wrong, and harmonia cannot be taken out of it now.
The most obvious thing is carefully considered on stage.
Where does music start and when does it stop?
This can rob you of nerves or give you fleeting moments of great happiness.
Richard Gere is just not cynical enough
With "The Hunting Party" and "Mordic Peace", two films again deal with the Balkan War.
But both do not convince.
Either the concepts rely too much on action and ball or they are too touchy.
Richard Gere can't help in "The Hunting Party" either.
The good news first: While the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, but only there, in the dark hinterland of the Bosnia war, the actor Richard Gere has now been found again.
We had recently lost sight of the most beautiful man of the 1980s, because too many friendly and uninteresting roles in well-being films for women and too many press conferences on Buddhism have driven one's desire for attention.
Now Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument to look at "The Hunting Party - If the hunter becomes hunted" (Why do movie titles have to be as long and swirling as Lokführer fare agreements today?) perhaps.
He provides a wonderfully eye-catching picture: basically, his war reporter Simon Hunt is what could have been out of glee if the fate and the film industry were not so gracious: a man who has been behind his very best times for a long time, but who has preserved himself as a ruinous monument of his downfall still considerable remains of the former charm.
But despite this trump, "The Hunting Party" together with the German production "Morderian Peace", which also starts this week, only continues the endless series of failed Balkan war films.
The film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who rescue a Serb from cosovar hedge-guards, one of whom falls in love with them immediately.
Although it is welcome that not even the Serbs are presented here as the sole root of all evils, the television film loses all too quickly in baller and action.
It remains a kind of "alarm for Cobra 11" without highway but for that with war.
On the other hand, "The Hunting Party" can be easily explored, why there has never been a really good Balkan war film.
The story of three U.S. war reporters who open up to track down the Serbian chief war criminal "the fox" could have become a new "Apocalypse Now" at another time with another director and screenwriter (both in personnel union Richard Shepard).
Because the stories are like a questionable one: Both times small teams go to the forest to accomplish something that the military can't do and both times it will be a journey into madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is that Simon Hunt is not simply allowed to be the descending cynic who is introduced to us in the beginning.
No, the script also has to join him in a romantic affair with a later murdered Muslim Bosnian.
Finally, "The Hunting Party" goes down the brook when the reporters in the last five minutes in the time-lapse process succeeds in what NATO, CIA and all the world's head money hunters have failed in five years: catch the war criminals and let the Muslim Bosnians take revenge.
This is so bad that the International Court of Justice in The Hague wants to be called upon for crimes against the Kinologik.
The film has a deep human concern.
He wants to condemn the fact that Karadzic and Mladic are still running freely, and he suspects the Americans and the French (they are supposed to be in agreement) not to carry out the persecution too intensively because of secret political agreements.
But the good mean and evil are sometimes so similar that a famous Brecht poem comes to mind.
It says about the wooden mask of an Asian demon on the work table of the poet: "I am compassionate to see the swollen foreheads, indicating how strenuous it is to be evil."
Movies like "The Hunting Party" have exactly such swelling heads, but they suggest how strenuous it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the genre of Balkan war film.
Recently, this newspaper reported that all of the Iraq films were Hollywood's big flops.
You can add: There has never been a good South Africa film.
Almost always the case: if a star is floating on the world's crisis herds or minefields, something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, "Beyond all borders" with Angelina Jolie or "Blutdiamanten" with Leonardo DiCaprio comes out.
Perhaps all the conflicts are just too close in time.
After all, decades had to pass before Hollywood could make a good film about the Holocaust with "Schindler's List".
Some films will still be ready - the now classic Vietnam works "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jacket" have not been celebrated unanimously as masterpieces at the time.
But perhaps today we know where each mass murder comes home in real time on two screens, even too much about the world's conflicts.
And that robs the scriptwriters of the carelessness it needs to tell good stories.
"Being or not being" or "The Great Dictator" have finally become so good because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not yet know how badly the Nazi regime really ruled.
Maybe you don't want to be good if you want to make good movies.
Perhaps you have to have the sarcastically distant artist's view of the Romance Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about parallels between his historical novel "Lemprière's dictionary" and the Balkan War, he replied: "This is only because some things never change.
Big cities will always be terribly dangerous, people will always be murdered in a horrific way, and war will always prevail in Yugoslavia."
Beust reaps criticism for Olympic cancellation
The withdrawal of the mayor from Hamburg's application for Olympic Summer Games has met with severe criticism in politics and business.
Many want to continue to fight for the games on the water.
But Beust urges realism to assess the chances.
Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, Chief Executive Officer of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, called a renunciation on Wednesday as "not good for the business location".
No other project has recently developed as much motivation in the city as the Olympic idea.
"Without this goal, the sport policy momentum could not be maintained to the same extent."
Schmidt-Trenz urged the Senate not to bury the project, but to find a new long-term approach to it, which "is based on a changed time cycle".
Mayor Ole of Beust remained unrealistic on Wednesday on previous statements, according to which the Olympic ambitions of Hamburg were at least unrealistic until 2028.
"Not Hamburg decides on an Olympic application, but the German Olympic Sports Federation," said Beust WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the decision of the Sportbund to apply for the 2018 Winter Games in Munich, expected for the beginning of December.
"This preference means for us that we will not have a realistic opportunity in the period we have previously remembered by 2028."
Nevertheless, the dream was not dreamed of for all time, said Beust.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) regretted the statements of Beusts.
This gives the impression that Hamburg will not apply for the Olympic Games in the next 25 years.
"It is too early to grow a chance by burying the plans already at that time," said HSB President Günter Ploß on Wednesday.
A renunciation of the application is also contrary to the statement of the Head of Senate on the occasion of a reception to the General Assembly of the German University Sports Association.
There, Beust described Hamburg's application for the 2015 Universiade as "not a replacement" for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The university sports association had not nominated Hamburg as a candidate city until last week.
The SPD citizenship group accused the Senate of not having used valuable time for housing in Hamburg.
"The development of the Kleine Grasbrook has been delayed by the Senate for years because he has placed on the map of the Olympia and excluded the construction of the apartment," said the SPD members Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD for the Kleine Grasbrook had always called for an integrated planning for Olympia and a later use of housing, the CDU had unilaterally put on the "event factor".
The application for the 2012 Summer Olympics had triggered a great enthusiasm in Hamburg at the time.
Hamburg, however, had failed Leipzig.
They're not Warhol's boxes.
Those who combine the terms Sweden and wooden box think of Ikea, but not Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
Currently, in Sweden, wooden boxes cast dark shadows on Warhol's work directory.
Most of the ninety-four Brillo boxes of the "Type Stockholm" are forgerys.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" some months ago raised doubts about the authenticity of Andy Warhol's Brillo boxes of 1968, internal research in the Moderna Museet in Stockholm is now coming to a sobering conclusion: The six "Brillo-Boxes", which the former museum director Pontus Hultén gave the Moderna Museet 1995 as a gift, are copies - and probably also the majority of the approximately one hundred further broillo boxes of the "Type Stockholm" that are in circulation on the international art market.
The history is nested, a confusing chain of artistic and curatorial productions.
In 1964, Warhol created his first "Brillo Boxes", painted wooden boxes, based on the red-blue-white design of the cardboard cartons of the soap powder "Brillo".
An exhibition of his works at the Moderna Museet 1968 - with Warhol's consent - exhibited hundreds of broillo boxes made of cardboard: these were (for cost reasons) not from Warhol, but were delivered directly from the Brillo cardboard factory.
It was not works of art, it was examples of them, merely pieces of exhibition.
At the same time, Warhol probably granted permission in 1968 to produce a few Brillo wooden boxes in Sweden, which were not exhibited in the Moderna Museet.
Contemporary witnesses now speak of around fifteen boxes, which at the time have rightly entered art and auction history as authorized original Andy-Warhol-Brillo boxes with the name "Type Stockholm".
Some of them have reached more than 100,000 dollars at auctions.
The problem now is that the legendary museum director Pontus Hultén later mistakenly claimed that it was produced and exhibited around a hundred wooden boxes in Sweden in 1968, which Warhol then left to him.
In fact, Hultén's 105 boxes were only produced in Malmö in 1990 for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
At that time Warhol had been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, Chief Conservator at the Moderna Museet, has also examined the six museum's own Brillo boxes, three of which were produced in Stockholm in 1968: their press boards were first founded and sanded, and then white oil paint was applied with a brush.
The structure of the 1990 copies, on the other hand, reveals that the paint was applied directly to the pressboard with a painting roll without primer - in addition, it is not oil but acrylic paint.
"These boxes were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol's Brillo Boxes," says the director of Moderna Museet, Lars Nittve: "If the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' in New York does not come to a different conclusion, the Moderna Museet will classify the six boxes in its collection as copies/exhibition material."
As early as July, the Authentication Board announced that it would follow the "severe accusations" that are being made in the matter of soap powder boxes.
Since then, however, there has been an inexorable silence.
Rebelling soldiers in Manila give up
In the Philippines, rebels abandoned soldiers who had squandered in a hotel in Manila and demanded the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
He could not blame bloodshed, said the leader Antonio Trillanes, who accused the president of corruption and election fraud, reporters at the hotel.
Government faithful soldiers had previously stormed the hotel under the use of tear gas.
The two dozen soldiers had been in the building for hours.
About half of them were in court on Thursday due to a failed coup attempt in 2003 - among them Trillanes.
He used the trial to suddenly end up with around 30 sympathizers.
The military police, who were supposed to guard him, were apparently overrun to him and joined his mutiny.
They invaded the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Loyal government troops locked the district around the prestigious hotel.
The President convened an urgent meeting of the Security Cabinet.
National Security Advisor Norberto Gonzales condemned the actions of the soldiers.
"People have enough," said Trillanes.
"We call on people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, who had previously ordered the Elite Unit of Scout Rangers, said that other army units wanted to join the march shortly.
Government critics had called for major demonstrations against the President on Friday.
Their government has been overestimated by corruption accusations for months.
Manila's financial district was already the main scene of the attempted mutiny of some 200 military members against Arroyo in 2003.
The insurrection failed after almost 24 hours in the refusal of the army to join.
Since 1986, there have been at least seven attempts against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
United Internet becomes a major shareholder at Versatel
United Internet has secured a share of more than 20 percent of Versatel's telecommunications company.
The average price per share is 14.46 euros, as reported by the company on Wednesday evening.
One now holds 20.05 percent of the share capital.
A takeover had previously been speculated.
Keep the option open to increase the share of satel.
With this step you want to advance the consolidation of the German DSL market, United Internet announced.
Prior to that, presumptuouss had already occurred on Wednesday about a start after Berenberg Bank increased its stake in the Düsseldorf network operator by another 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
The money house considered the shares to be only a third party, it was called the financial market.
The day before, United Internet had already participated with almost 10 percent of the mobile company Drillisch.
As part of a capital increase, Drillisch has placed 17.4 million new shares worth 106.4 million euros.
5.15 million shares of which United Internet has bought for 31.4 million euros.
In addition, companies have started discussions on marketing cooperation for DSL and mobile products.
"We strengthen our partnership," said a United Internet speaker.
The two companies founded the MSP joint venture to take over the competitors Freenet.
For the time being, the two companies want to satisfy themselves with a good ten percent share of Freenet and make no use of their right to take over another 18.49 percent of Freenet, said United Internet on Thursday.
However, the two companies remained open to all options, in particular to further increase participation in Freenet AG.
Discussions between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership had ended in mid-November.
The long-term poker around Freenet, which has only been difficult to understand for months, is part of the consolidation of the German telecoms market.
Freenet had 2.9 million mobile phone contract customers and 1.27 million DSL and complete connection customers at the end of the third quarter.
The holding of United Internet and Drillisch held directly 6.01 percent of the freenet shares.
It has now been agreed that Drillisch will bring in another four percent.
The right to buy 18.49 percent of the investment company Vatas had already been agreed in August.
