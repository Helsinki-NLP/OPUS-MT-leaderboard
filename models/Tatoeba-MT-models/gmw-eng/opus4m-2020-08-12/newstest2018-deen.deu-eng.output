Munich 1856: Four maps that change your view of the city
A misguided institution where young people are supposed to meet today.
A tomb chapel, where the S-Bahn tunnel is now dug.
Small gardeners operate the former land of farmers.
The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories.
It's annoying when maps are not up to date.
This is what everyone knows, who had to get excited before, because the Auto-Navi instead of a bypass road showed a green meadow.
The historical maps of the digital Bayern atlas, an offer from the Geoportal Bayern of the state government, are anything but current - but especially very informative.
Especially when compared with current online maps.
Then it becomes clear how cities and communities in the distribution area of Munich Mercury have changed since the 19th century.
The digital Bayern atlas is a flick carpet that is not recognized as such.
More detailed maps, so-called Urposition sheets, have been included in the large overview map for cities and municipalities.
According to the Bayerische Sammlungsverwaltung, these were created between 1810 and 1864 and result in the first survey of Bavaria.
Your client: Napoleon.
The French army leader has occupied Bavaria with Austria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War.
Napoleon wished for an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographic recording of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.
Even though the French troops finally withdrew with the peace of Lunéville on February 9, 1801: it was today's neighbors who created the idea of a comprehensive Bayern map.
Elector Max IV. Joseph continued to drive the project, founded the "Topographic Bureau" - and thus the Bavarian Surveying Administration.
The original position sheet for Munich dates back to 1856 and can be found on the website of the Bayerische Landesbibliothek.
The comparison of the former/today is most impressive by the example of the state capital.
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.
An example of this is a subsendant that appears in the map of 1856 still relatively isolated.
Sendling was incorporated 21 years after the map was created, i.e. in 1877, as Munich district.
Today, Untersendling is located in the middle of the city.
The Untersendlings houses concentrate around 1856 along today's Plinganserstraße, which was only named in 1878 after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the uprising of Bavarian farmers against Austria in 1705.
Where the Westpark is today, one sees nothing but fields - at first glance: When zooming in, a small map with dozens of lines and numbers appears: handwritten numbered pieces of corridors from the so-called "purchasing" from which the property tax was derived.
Small plots no longer occupy farmers there - but small gardeners of the "Land in Sun" plant.
A large green area is located north of Untersendling.
The Theresienwiese, since 1810 the site of the Oktoberfest, was indeed still a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete desert.
On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.
In the site of today's Au-Haidhausen district, one can read not only the street name "at Gasteig" or the hill "Auf der Luften" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt".
Yes, here at Auerfeldstraße, people were once locked up with misconceptions.
In 1858/59 the Munich Kreis-Irrenanstalt "Auf der Auer Luften" was founded.
From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden led the institution - that psychiatrist, which is associated with the death of King Ludwig II.
"He was progressive for his time and ended, for example, the chain of the so-called fools.
In addition, he has prohibited the staff from using violence against the inmates," says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen Museum, who has been working on the institution for an exhibition.
For 280 patients there had been room for the first time, and later 500 places were extended.
At some point, this capacity was not enough anymore - the reason for the construction of the Kreisirrenanstalt in Haar 1905.
Since 2006 there has been the Isar-Amper-Klinikum München-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatrics.
In the area of the former Auer Anstalt young people now meet in the Munich Salesianum.
The Order acquired the complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with training establishments.
To the west lies the football field of the TSV Munich East, east residential houses from the 1980s.
In 2015 the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" was built - in architectural support of the construction of the siren plant, which had been destroyed during World War II during bombings.
The Marienplatz was listed in 1856 as "Main Square", the Kaufingerstraße was called "Kaufinger Gasse".
The Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.
The Allied bombs tore many holes into the city centre in December 1944.
A big one remained to this day - at the Marienhof.
The English Institute, small business houses and a tomb chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Marienhof, where these days the preparatory work and on 5 April 2017 the Spatensticht for the second S-Bahn-Stammbahn take place.
With the slider you can compare the old Munich map with the skyscraper of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.
Citizens' Rights Group publishes Travel Warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Promotion of Colored People has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Missouri due to the discriminatory politics and racist attacks of the state.
"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri, which is to enter into force by 28 August 2017, calls on African-American travellers, visitors and Missourins to pay particular attention and exercise extreme caution when travelling through the State, since a number of questionable racial incidents have occurred throughout the state lately and are noted here," the Group's opinion states.
A recently passed law by Missouri that makes it harder for people to gain discrimination, as well as the law enforcement authorities of the state that are disproportionately targeting minorities, prompted the group to issue the travel warning, said NAACP.
"You have violations of civil rights that happen to people.
They are stopped because of their skin color, they are beaten together or killed," said the president of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.
"We hear complaints at such a frequency that we have not yet heard."
It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the USA.
The group cited incidents such as racist crimes against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had lost gas during the trip through the state and was arrested by the Missouri police without being accused of a crime.
The Council also points out a recent report by the office of the Missouri State Attorney General’s Office showing that black drivers are 75 percent more frequently held in the state than whites.
"The recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and employees of what might happen in Missouri," said Chapel.
"People have to be ready to bring deposit money or let relatives know they're traveling through the state."
Missouri reported 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime report programme, which classified the state with regard to the number of such injuries to the 16th rank of the country.
Travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law, which would make it more difficult to sue an enterprise for housing or employment discrimination.
Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after states had passed immigration laws requiring local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for immigration violations, which, according to the ACLU, will contribute to further racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but lately interest groups have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the US.
Weed fence project is elementary
The Fischerbacher Weidezaun project is a success project and will continue next year.
The CDU members Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac have taken a picture on site.
At the Rechtgrabenhof of the Schwendmann family, representatives of the Fischerbacher CDU-Ortsverband met together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two delegates.
Markus Schwendemann first gave insights into his farm, where he manages 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, provides 40 dairy cows and as many young animals as he does and houses holiday guests in five apartments.
For him, the "black forest milk" is the alternativeless marketing route for the milk of his cows, says Schwendmann.
On the table of the holiday guests comes only regional.
Since he is also BLHV chairman of Fischerbach, he called the pasture fence project "elementary important".
I cannot profit from such steep areas.
The grassland area ensures a lot of work, much has to be done with the motor sense.
"We have to fight with the conditions here and with the topography," emphasized Schwendemann.
In 2003 he took over the parental business and manages it without chemical plant protection and fertiliser, even if he does not run a organic plant.
For Mayor Thomas Schneider it was clear: "The municipality has recognized the importance of the pasture fence project and is happy about the Leader funding."
At the cost of between 3000 and 4000 euros per hectare, farmers would have to be supported.
It is hoped that for a long time, the forestation of the areas could be pulled out.
"The biggest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how they continue their business," stressed the mayor.
Farmers are often criticized for their support
A total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced through the fence funding in 2013.
The opening area is thus 40 hectares, which must not be farmed up to at least 2023.
Of the total cost of 71 500 euros, half was funded via Leader, and a quarter was carried by the municipality of Fischerbach.
Thus the farmers remained 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of pasture fence.
"The great advantage is the durability of the fences," explained Schwendemann.
Kordula Kovac stressed: "You're doing a really good job, without farmers and country women, you can't do it."
For Peter Weiß, too, it was clear that "the best food is produced here".
The Landschaftspflege (LPR) Baden-Württemberg enables the government to promote pasture fences.
The aim is to keep the Black Forest open.
The existence of a funding scheme designated by the LPR is a prerequisite.
Furthermore, the fenced area must not be towed (hanging over 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by the afforestation.
For the Fischerbacher Weidezaunprojekt 2018, the application of eight participants with 24 plots is currently underway, who want to build almost 16 kilometres of fence.
The open space corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112,000 euros.
Is nothing sacred anymore?
Now the White House of Trump is taking the Statue of Liberty
The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.
The Americans appreciate this as well as any other - therefore the carefully staged fall of Saddam Husseins on the Firdos square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he was doing when he took a symbolic axe in a heated dispute with Jim Acosta of CNN on the President's proposals to drastically restrict legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty.
To remain fair, Miller did not attack the statue itself.
A hordes of boat owners and Liberty imitators would have lynched him if he had.
But he attacked their meaning, and in particular the meaning that was attributed to them, when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus was added to his base in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument.
When Miller Acosta insulted: "I don't want to go into a complete thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.
The poem you refer to, which was later added and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty."
Miller is really right, but as he himself put it, it's not really about history.
It is about the contemporary resonance to the uproaring words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state invites not only any old immigrants but the poorest of the poor: "Your tired, your poor, / your oppressed masses who long to breathe freely, / the miserable waste of your rich coasts."
There was never a time when the "wretched waste" could be seen better on our screens.
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people in Trump's USA are not welcome.
This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural debate: it is indeed a conflict about the meaning of America.
Lazarus - and her friends who were committed to putting their words at the base after their death - knew very well that they were performing a high-political act.
The sculpture should show the links between French and American Republicanism by representing the female embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classical imagery.
Lazarus changed this meaning: In her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.
And she gives herself a very different name: Mother of the exiles.
The link between the poem and the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, people from the right wing wanted to change this a long time ago.
The great Scream Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty does not invite anyone, but rather is an early neoconservative that brings the American flame into the night world: "Lady Liberty is moving forward.
It is supposed to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch should not light the way to the United States."
It's quite unusual that Limbaugh came across something here.
The meaning of the statue is quite a question of the point of view.
The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see it as it was seen by the exhausted, miserable, but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on decks of ships.
It is really about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they need to hear.
And, of course, that's not the perspective Miller and Trump would ever want to recognize.
Their torch shall not light up the way, but shall kindle the hatred, which is their only source of power.
World Championship 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK team
Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Schotts were part of the UK team
The UK performance director, Neil Black, says that the 16-member Scottish quota "will make a massive contribution to the team" in the World Championships framework.
A record number of Scottish athletes were selected for London 2017, which starts on Friday.
Black believes that "in Scotland something special has to be developed" and that the United Kingdom's athletics have to learn something from it.
"We welcome it, and we try to understand it, and we will continue until we find out," said Black.
"I'm talking to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they've done.
The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.
British athletics: It has something to do with what they have done.
And also with the guy at the street corner.
Whatever the combination of circumstances, it is absolutely brilliant."
Several of the Scottish athletes are medal candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track, while Eiligh Doyle was elected team captain by the team.
"Eilidh is quite modest.
Your Captain's speech was incredible," says Black.
"A number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and very motivated.
The passion and the real feeling that Elidh brought in naturally were great."
The Commonwealth Silver Medal winner, who will compete at the 400m-hazards in her fifth World Championships, says that it is "unbelievable" that 16 Scotlands are in the British team.
Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Championships was seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015.
The mid-ranger Muir leads on this road and has set five British and two European records last year.
It will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m races.
Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 metres, is another shot to watch after a great season, which included the victory of the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers her first world championships when the only other shot on the team was Lee McConnell.
The team captain says that she is "enormly proud" of the fact that many of her countrymen are not only part of the team, but in some cases will also be involved in the medals and the finals.
"The special thing about being a team captain is that she was elected by the other members of the team, so it was a great honor anyway, but knowing that my team colleagues voted for me and elected me makes it something very special for me," she added.
"Obviously, I am very proud of all the Scottish who belong to the team.
It only shows how far we have come.
And they're here as established athletes, athletes who want to climb pods.
As far as my speech as Captain is concerned?
Yeah, I think she went well.
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation because we have a home world championship.
So it is really important to put on this home home and to benefit from being back at the Olympic Stadium.
I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it'll just be such a great atmosphere out there."
Block critics via Facebook: Don't apply for a public office if you can't tolerate heating voters
The father of our country knew something about bad press.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long for the newspapers to beat him because of everything, from domestic politics to his political principles.
He scoffed at the criticism, sure.
But he didn't silence his critics.
For in 1783 Washington said, "Free speech can be taken away - and, stupid and silent, we are led to the slaughter like sheep."
That takes me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work to be more like Washington.
Hogan's employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their views on his official Facebook page.
And the American Civil Liberties Union sued him for that early this week.
The governor's staff released the complaint as frivolous, and the online comment was full of a counter-reaction with "Well, and?" .
"It's just Facebook," said many people.
But it's important.
And it's especially important when it's a guy like Hogan.
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is surprisingly popular.
He has the second highest consent of the 50 governors of the nation.
Hogan's not a reactionary heat head.
He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict compliance with the principles.
He was also very clever in using Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and to make his hairless head debut on his side after chemotherapy.
Therefore, the blocking of persons who come to the side of the governor - which is a public forum called official and of employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's spokesman Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moderation.
But it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful people who swing the whip online.
The post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And these are only real people who speak with their chosen leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a priest, no trolls.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful, and not proficient.
The priest quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan’s Catholic faith.
Lawyers Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hateful, but she asked for hate crimes.
"I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other news," she wrote in the comment section of the news broadcast "The Post".
"I do not appreciate this idea, either, when a number of people comment on the same subject, they are disregarded by some as a so-called collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens."
What the governor's employees called a "concentrated spam attack" would probably be called "intervention".
The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than in earlier times if one had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials or arrest and silence demonstrators.
But that's exactly what's happening digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticized for blaming Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is sued by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed.
One of the first milestones on this issue was in Virginia last week.
The Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County violated the First Amendment, according to US District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banished a voters from her Facebook page.
And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.
That shouldn't be so hard.
At the time of Washington, the time of affordable Porto had a similar effect to the Internet.
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous pens responded to his leadership.
And even then Washington had anonymous trolls.
The people who used pseudonyms such as "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius" wrote all the letters to newspapers that made Washington's decisions.
petitions that criticized his position on the Treaty of Amity, trade and shipping with Great Britain overwhelmed his office, according to the historical documents collected by the online papers of the George Washington Project.
But he didn't silence her.
Freedom of speech, disagreement and discourse are the basis of our nation.
And true guidance means accepting that.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comfort in the Renaissance Club
The former European No. 1 Ronan Rafferty will hope for home comfort in the next three days, as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian will host the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
The Northern Ireland, which led left in the Archerfield last year to the final round before losing Paul Eales, is connected to the new venue and acts as tournament ambassador on behalf of the club founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
"I have seen how the Renaissance club was built, and we see how it reaches its fame with this event," said Rafferty.
"Players will see this course from its best side, it is in a great condition.
Jerry did a great job when he set up this place.
He is an ardent advocate of this game and is proud of his performance here.
This is a great window for this course."
The Englishman Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time, although in his 32 years of career he won both on the European Tour and on the European Challenge Tour.
"This really feels special," said the Southport-based player.
"I couldn't defend the Extremadura Open because it was removed from the program the year after I won it.
Coming back to this part of the world is magical.
It's a wonderful place to play golf.
The memories from last year come back, and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon to win here last year.
It was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate."
Gary Orr, who came to the European Senior Tour earlier this year after his 50th birthday, returns to action on home floor.
This event will be his first Scottish appearance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"It always means a little more when you play at home," said Orr, the man from Helensburgh.
"You want to make it good, but you also feel this extra pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again, and I played a solid golf.
I'm glad to see how it went."
With the trio on the field, the former masters champions Ian Woosnam and the senior major champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty are.
Orr and the former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six Scotlands on the field, the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Admission is free, the parking costs £5 per car with one passenger and £10 per car with two or more inmates.

Less lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking
Over the past two decades, fewer and fewer people have died of lung cancer due to passive smoking.
Scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) come to this conclusion in a study.
"According to our estimates, 167 lung cancer deaths per year are due to passive smoking," said study director Heiko Becher.
As a comparison, he drew up his own study on this subject in 1994.
At that time, there were still 400 lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking per year in Germany.
The new investigation is published in the International Journal of Public Health.
House connections prove to be very complex
The construction works on Villinger Straße are in full swing and "are somewhat in time", says Fred Heinze, head of the Bauhof.
In the area of house connections, the situation is more complicated than suspected, as there is a lot of hiding in the underground, which is not mentioned in the plans.
The traffic, which is constantly hampering the construction work, poses a major problem for the Stuē building team.
"The ignorance of drivers in front of red traffic lights and lock-off belts is already enormous," says Heinze.
The road was blocked and only the line buses were entitled to pass through.
Angelo Caruso, Marvin Kostorz and Tim Kostorz from Stuē have been working on the bridge for weeks.
"The hot days have been quite strenuous.
But fortunately we were supplied with cool mineral water by our friend Fritz Matt," says Marvin Kostorz.
Poverty and Death in the Indonesian Goldland
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use a stove.
She even rarely uses a pot.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of the Panai government in the troubled Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually puts a sweet potato - locally called "note" - directly into the fireplace.
After half an hour, the coaled tuber is taken and swallowed up with frivolous, unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture - where she also carries out her daily work, e.g. washing clothes with cloudy water from the nearby swamp.
A bucket in a homeless room serves as a latrine.
No fields were assigned to her as the youngest of her husband's four wives.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: most villagers are unemployed, and many drink heavy, and there are soldiers here.
"No one dares to walk around the village after 5 p.m.," she says.
It is a rare insight into daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony, which was taken up in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia, when only 1,026 elders were to vote in front of the crew by a public hand survey.
An existing movement that fought for independence against Dutch rule quickly turned against the Government of Jakarta, which maintains control of the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers from it.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, with the independent part of Papua New Guinea covering the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is as remote as it is ed. The trip includes a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital Jayapura to Nabire and then a 5-hour morning drive by car.
There is no public transport.
The city with about 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, and of corrugated roofs converted into various yellow brown tones by rust.
Very few Indonesians have made their trip here, let alone journalists and virtually no foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuan worshiped a god named Uga Tamee.
There were other changes.
"We were not used to wearing these clothes," says Degei, pointing to her lively, hand-woven turban, her dark shirt and her bright skirt.
"Before, we had only leaves on our bodies."
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst infant mortality and literacy rates in Asia.
But it's also Indonesia's goldland.
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, Grasberg, owned by Freeport McMoran from Phoenix, is only 60 miles from Panai, a highland province of New Jersey with 153,000 inhabitants.
In 2015, alone, Freeport reduced the value of 3.1 billion US dollars of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua has wood resources worth estimated at $78 billion.
These riches, however, are a source of misery for the Papua, ensuring that Indonesia's powerful military preserves an suffocating presence.
A 2005 survey in the New York Times reported that Freeport paid nearly $20 million to local military personnel and units between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 to a single officer.
Papuan demands for greater autonomy threaten these golden goose and are treated mercilessly.
According to activists, more than 500,000 Papua have been killed and thousands have been raped, tortured and detained by the Indonesian military since 1969.
Mass killings in Papua's tribal highlands in the 1970s were a genocide according to the Asia Human Rights Commission.
In the region alone, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful demonstrators last year.
"We will lose everything," says a 2016 report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane, in which reports on atrocities of the previous year are included, such as illegal executions and torture - rape and electric beatings are particularly popular according to another report - and the brutal precipitation of peaceful demonstrations.
"It is difficult to count the number of victims as incidents happen every week," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The screws have increased as Papua's resources bring an inflow of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The population of 3.5 million people in the province is 83% Christian, but demographic development is changing, as Muslim economic migrants come from the populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese warning canteens sell fried chicken and gado gado, a mixed vegetables served with peanut sauce.
Local people are fighting to keep up with this.
"The migrants have started selling chickens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local Papua," explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old Panai native who moved to the provincial capital of Jayapura to work.
"It has cost the native Papuan - the Mama-Mama [the women] of Papuan - their market."
Indonesian President Yoko Widodo, known in the mouth as Yokowi, promised to address the inequalities and violations in Papua during his 2014 election campaign.
The former carpenter secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua, including Panai, on the way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta.
But in Papua little has changed, and today the locals feel deceived.
"Our hearts are broken because we voted for Yokowi in 2014, with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored," you say.
In fact, Panai suffered a low point only two months after Yokowi's inauguration in October.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children were outside singing Christmas songs in front of a campfire in Enarotali, when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle.
The scared kids told them to turn on their headlights.
One of the soldiers took hold of their tone and later came back with four soldiers, according to the local pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers who had drunk hunted and beat the group with their rifle butts, said victims and witnesses.
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children.
A child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so badly that he fell into the coma.
A few hours later, the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and things escalated the next day.
About 1,000 young Papuan men, women and children gathered on a football field in front of the local police station and the military command centre to demand justice.
They performed ceremonial hunting bows and performed the Waita dance - in the circle and a bird song imitating - of Papua's Mee Pago tribe.
Some demonstrators began to tossing stones at police and military stations.
When the mood was heated, a command was sent to the soldiers via an internal radio: "If the masses resist more than three times, they shoot them dead," says an official document from TIME, which was not released to the local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of the Kego Koto quarter of Enarotali, saw the threatening danger and called for peace and urged the crowd to return home.
No one was listening in the mood.
"When I turned around, I was suddenly shot in my left wrist," he said TIME on the porch of his colorfully painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who fired, but says the bullet came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered here.
"It was overcrowded, many shots were fired," he adds.
The local man Alfius Youw was hit three times, according to his cousin, who was the witness of the shootings.
"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure it was him," said Yohanes, who, like many Indonesians, bears only one name, the TIME in a gloomy mood.
"I saw he was dead... I kissed him."
The chief inspector of the Papua Police, Yotje Mende, told reporters that his officers wanted to "safe" their station only because they were attacked.
"We have to defend ourselves if people threaten to kill us," said the spokesperson of the Papua Police, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo, in 2015.
"It's about life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young demonstrators were killed and many more injured.
The news about the killings came 'filtered' to Jakarta the following day.
Three weeks in Jayapura, Yokowi gave a passionate speech in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and vowed to address the historical abuses in Papua.
"I want this case to be resolved immediately, so that it will not happen again in the future," he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he set up an extra-judicial mechanism to resolve historical human rights violations.
But the excuses began almost immediately.
"Most injuries occurred a long time ago.
Some were in the 90s and early 2000s.
The point is that we have committed ourselves to dealing with these violations, but there are processes that must go through," he said.
Then Wiranto withdrew when he spoke to TIME in Jakarta on June 5th and said he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, "everything is regulated by law," he said.
Wiranto, who accused the UN of "crime against humanity", who claimed more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor's bloody independence vote in 1999, said that 11 cases of human rights violations had already been resolved in Papua, including the Panai incident.
Families of the Panii victims accepted such claims with fierce disbelief.
"I have been interviewed four times in the last three years, but there has been no progress," says Yohanes.
"I'm tired."
He says he still lives in fear years later.
"I'm afraid," he says.
"I'm afraid of being arrested by the military, I'm afraid to be shot."
His brother Yacobus repeated his view that people in Panai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He says he was beaten by the military after he helped bury four of the victims.
"After I buried the bodies, the military was looking for me," he says.
The shootings didn't stop.
On Tuesday the Indonesian police shot at villagers in Panai's neighborhood Deiyai.
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company who refused to bring a unconscious man to the hospital, one person died and 17 others were injured, including children.
The man, the 24-year-old Ravian Douw, who was drowned when he was fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
Insidious villagers protested in front of the company's office.
The police said the villagers threw stones at officers who responded by firing warning shots.
But locals say that the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) started shooting at the crowd and killed one.
"We were so panicked, we are afraid there will be revenge," says 29-year-old Domingo Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were quickly delivered here, according to the TIME.
"I hid myself in my house for two days."
The Deiyai Parliament called for the officers involved to be held accountable and for the police's mobile brigade to be withdrawn from the area.
Paniai has always been an unrest for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development strengthens the dissatisfaction of the tribal members Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal who live in the green highlands of Papua.
Many joined the "Free Papuan Movement" (OPM), the rebel army, which claims to defend the rights of Papua by incitement to sporadic attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders come from Panai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, thousands of people in Paniai have been arrested and arbitrarily arrested in recent years, under the pretext of "ensure national sovereignty".
Some never show up again.
Among the people in Papua, Panai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place".
Poverty strengthens discontent.
The little rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
Bread is just as out of reach.
People here grow everything they eat: especially note and fruit and leafy vegetables.
Agriculture is the task of women who can process four or five fields of sweet potatoes each.
They keep most of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten pieces of note cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities have grown between the native Papua and the new migrants who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new flight routes to Nabire Airport.
The few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better-trained and wealthier migrants.
Papua rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to run their own businesses competitively.
"The young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there are no jobs or money here," says John Gobai, the chairman of the tribal council of Panai.
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua.
Furthermore, restrictions on reporting remain tense international media.
At the beginning of the year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported for lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua, although they were given rare permission to film.
According to Phelim Kine, the Deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch, the promises of Yokowi's election campaign to remove the restrictions of reporting in order to promote transparency and development were not realized.
"There are new dangers for foreign journalists who are trying to report Indonesia's troubled eastern provinces of Papua and Western Papua: visa refusal and a black list," he said in a statement.
Lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely limited to the immediate neighbours of Papua.
In March, six Pacific states - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the "various and widespread injuries" in Papua including the Panai shooting.
The same countries have historically supported the OPM.
The speaker of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Arrmanatha Nasir rejected the group's accusations and said to journalists in Jakarta: "In Indonesia, a democratic system is still in place, and there is free media, so it is difficult to cover up the evidence of human rights cases."
People on the ground want more foreign governments to take note of this.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, headed by human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on 4 May, locals broke their silence and pressed him "We want freedom", according to a source that also participated in the meeting, but would like to remain anonymous.
Indonesia will have another presidential election in 2019, but Papua will say that they will probably not vote for Yokowi again.
"Jokowi is a human being who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Panai shots," says Gobai, chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Yokowi to know that the Panii people, apart from living under the constant threat of a predatory military, are in poor education and health services.
Gobai says that the Panai people, like other Papuans, regard their voice for Yokowi as a "debt" he has to repay.
"They don't need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite the threats and intimidation, families of the Panii fire victims carried out a last symbolic act of defiance: the body of a victim was buried on a site just opposite the police and the military station.
They know that justice may never come to them, but at least they do not let those responsible forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed," says Yacobus with a lowered head.
"What else can we do?"
Fire capture the 'Torch' skyscraper of Dubai for the second time
A fire found its way through one of the tallest residential towers in Dubai on Friday and forced hundreds of residents to flee from the 337-metre-high 79-story building.
It is the second fire that sweeps through the high-rise in just two years, which is by chance called the Torch Tower.
The building was evacuated, injuries were not reported, and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame.
"We slept and we got up at the fire alarm and the screaming of the people.
We ran down the stairs, and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor," said Reuters, a resident who gave his name to George.
Dubai's civil protection authorities said that the units of fire fighting around 4.00 local time (00.00 GMT) burned the fire and cooled the building.
The government said it was working on providing accommodation for those affected.
The incident can revive questions about the safety of materials used in outdoors from high-rise buildings around the world.
An investigation by the management of the Torch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that the majority of the damage came from the disguise, the exterior panel for decoration or insulation.
In the UK, the police said they believe that the system of plates for insulation and disguise on the London Grenfell Tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire that killed about 80 people.
No Davis Cup Reform: Next Best-of-five
The President of the International Tennis Association (ITF) has passed through with his large Davis Cup coup at the General Assembly.
At the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City, the revolutionary proposal for this sport to play Davis Cup singles only on two winnings was not supported by the necessary two-thirds majority.
Although often very long, but very much appreciated for this reason, the five set classics are thus preserved by the traditional competition.
63.54 percent of the member countries voted in favour of the reform, so the goal of ITF President David Haggerty was barely missed.
"We respect this decision, but are disappointed that our memberships have not adopted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and Fed Cup.
We need a change in order to secure the long-term future of these iconic and historical competitions," said Haggerty.
It will continue to work to improve the applications.
After many objections, not even the vote had come before the proposal to hold the finale in a neutral place.
New from 2018 are only comparatively smaller details: In the following year, the finalists in the Davis Cup and Fed Cup will have the host right in the first round.
In order to reduce the costs for the organizers, training places etc. will be easier and players will have to complete less official media appointments before the Davis Cup.
More than 1 out of 5 US travelers bring prohibited items into the plane, finds out a survey
A survey of air passengers revealed that more than 20 percent deliberately or unconsciously banned items smuggled past the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration, including at least 6 percent who entered the aircraft while carrying accidentally banned knives or other items with blades.
Less than 1 percent claimed that they had discovered late that they were traveling mistakenly with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
The survey of more than 1,000 people - carried out by a jet charter service, Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - also noted that younger travellers are rather disregarding the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted that they were knowingly trying to fly with something prohibited by the TSA, 19.7 percent were millennials, compared with less than 15 percent who were members of the generation X.
The most common items that were deliberately thrown past TSA agents were food and liquids.
More than 3 percent admitted to knowingly carrying items with blades through safety control, while 2.2 percent of female respondents and 3.7 percent of male respondents also confirmed that they had deliberately brought banned drugs into the plane.
The company said that it had questioned travellers across the country to find out how many accidentally smuggled goods had been brought through airport security and how many would have deliberately done so.
It is no surprise that the people most likely to carry smuggling goods - knowingly or unknowingly - through the safety, were those who were most likely to fly.
However, the company points out that the TSA Directives are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People are often unsure of what liquids they can take with them or how much of them.
It is no surprise, therefore, that the largest quantity of the objects seized by the TSA are prohibited liquids.
For a while, the people thought that the TSA could view books as smuggling.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
Elon Musk doesn't care: Tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel order
Electric thousand sassass Elon Musk likes to indicate with the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla "Model 3".
He has so far denied that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation.
In addition to the always triumphant figures for sales increases and even more huge sales targets, Tesla-Chef Elon Musk has for the first time revealed a different, less glamorous figure in the announcement of the latest quarterly balance sheet: the cancellations of the new mass market model 3.
Musk had often advertised over the past few months with more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car, whose delivery is just beginning.
Now Musk admits: Of the 518,000 pre-orders, 63,000 have already been withdrawn.
Critics have repeatedly pointed out that these are only non-binding reservations.
In case of a cancellation, Tesla will fully repay the 1000 Euro (in the US 1000 US Dollars and in the UK 1000 Pounds) "Booking Deposit".
Currently there are 455,000 such non-binding reservations, Musk admitted to a telephone conference with analysts.
However, the Tesla boss does not believe that the cancellation of around 12 percent of all orders could become a problem.
His argument: The challenge of ambitious growth targets is not demand but production.
Last year, Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.
In 2018 - all models combined - it will be 500,000, 2020 a million.
The demand for this is obviously there.
According to Musk, there are currently 1800 reservations per day.
If you order a "model 3" today, you can expect extradition at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla manages to drive its brand new production lines, which have never been tested in practice, without larger larger larger ones with maximum capacity.
Many experts doubt that this is possible.
If, however, there are more delays, the non-binding nature of the reservations could become a problem for Tesla.
Because then the company cannot prevent dissatisfied customers from running away in groups.
EPA Chief Pruitt withdraws to reduce emissions due to the delay in the rules of Obama era
One day after being sued by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Authority, took back his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era in order to reduce emissions of Smog-induced air pollutants.
Pruitt presented the change when his agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of state environmental authorities than previous administrations.
He did not mention the action brought against his previous post in a federal appeal court.
It is a deadline which expired on 1 October for States to comply with the 2015 standards for ground-based ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay compliance by one year to give his authority more time, study the plan, and avoid "interfering in local decisions or hindering economic growth".
Pruitt, who was the prosecutor of Oklahoma before his appointment by President Donald Trump, was for a long time a reliable opponent of stricter environmental legislation.
Since his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly failed to block or delay regulations which the chemical industry and the fossil fuel industry oppose.
The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the latest legal setback for the Pruitts regulatory rollback agenda.
Last month, a federal court of appeal in Washington decided that the EPO administrator had exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of Obama administration that required oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement published on Wednesday evening, Pruitt proposed that his turnaround to ozone standards would simply strengthen the EPO's willingness to cooperate with the States through the complex process of timely compliance with the new standards.
"In previous administrations, the EPO often failed to comply with the deadlines for implementation and then waited to be charged by activist groups and others, and in an agreement set the deadline for implementation," said Pruitt, who sued the EPO more than a dozen times in his previous job.
"We do not believe in regulation through judicial proceedings, and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take seriously the law and authority that we have."
Nevertheless, the EPO's opinion stated that at some point Pruitt would use his "authorities to delay and all other powers legally available" to ensure that the rules are "based on a sound policy and the best available information".
The Republicans in Congress are pressing for a more comprehensive recast of the ozone rules.
A draft law approved last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been put to the vote in the Senate.
New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that had sued the EPO this week, said that the group intended to maintain legal pressure.
"The conversion of the EPO - according to our complaints - is an important gain for the health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the more than 115 million Americans directly affected by the Smog that flows into their communities," said Schneiderman.
New York joined California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and the District of Columbia.
Ground ozone arises when pollutants from cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight.
The emerging Smog can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups of people and contribute to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Representatives of public health care and environmentalists rejoiced at Pruitt's surprising change of course.
"It is disturbing how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step from the person responsible for protecting the air we inhale," said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to fight against the ideological crusade of the Trump government to offer ourselves to environmental polluters and their particular interests."
Tumlingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius Church
750 years St. Hilarius Church: On the occasion of the anniversary of the Mountain Church, a serenade will be invited to the old cemetery area in Tumlingen on Sunday, 16 July, at 4.30 p.m.
Whether it's idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historic St. Hilarius complex is a popular place to stay.
Visitors to the sixth benefit serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.
The friends and supporters of Tumlingens have made the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village their concern.
Walter Martini emphasizes: "It is a unique village.
In 1267, the St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in the Württemberg Book of Letters: Count Hermann von Sulz sold "the mountain with the parish church in Tumlingen and the Vogtei on it" to Magister Eberhard von Horb and to his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silber.
According to the text of the document, in addition to the former parish church, there was also a royal court on the top of the Tumlinger mountain, to which the church or the right of patronship belonged and not vice versa.
So people lived there.
As the description of Freudenstadt in 1858 shows, next to the Lower Village and the Upper Village, which are still recognizable today in the village of Tumlingen, was the "mountain" of the third, the village center of the village.
Old maps from the time around 1600 underpin these historical conditions.
The patronate law was created from the early Middle Ages church law.
A lord who built a church, equipped it and occupied it with a priest, remained the owner of this church and was able to inherit this own church.
This involved the right to use a priest or to propose a new priest to the bishop.
There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.
The larger of the two bursts at Christmas 1673.
The newly purchased bell then sounded for the first time in 1692, but had to be delivered later in the Second World War in 1942.
In the 30-year war (1616-1648) the windows were struck and the bell ropes were stolen.
The roof was leaky.
In 1796, French troops camped near the church.
They broke out the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.
The remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.
Until 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.
In 1823, the cemetery was extended and the Hilarius church was demolished.
Only the church tower was left standing.
On the New Year's night of 1834, a storm split the church tower and half collapsed.
To prevent an accident, the tower was broken down.
Only the tower dwarf that still exists today was preserved as a witness of the 750-year-old church history.
Today, Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem care for the Hilarius plant as successor to Dieter Dockhorn.
On Sunday, 16 July, the friends and supporters of Tumlingen invite the sixth serenade to the old cemetery to the St. Hilariu chapel.
It is designed by the Combo of the Kepler-Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with words by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.
Local leader Hartmut Romann speaks the final word.
The programme starts at 4.30 p.m.
Entry is starting at 3.30 p.m.
To the end of the Serenade there is an umtrunk in front of the cemetery.
"Enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with the wide view over meadows to the forest," the organizers highlight the fantastic view.
The Serenade takes place only in dry weather.
The organizers hope for many supporters to preserve the historic St. Hilarius plant, which is important for tummings and hearing aid.
The friends and sponsors of Tumlingen feel particularly committed to home care, as Serenade organizer Walter Martini confirms.
Association wants to check approval of wind turbines
"Boisheim resists itself" sees no legal requirement for the construction and has therefore turned to the Landrat.
The association "Boisheim Wehrt" has asked Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheimer Nette.
It was illegal.
The association argues that at the time of approval on December 30, 2016, no wind turbines could have been approved in the Boisheimer Nette, since at the time of the date in Viersen there was only a wind power concentration zone at the city border to Schwalmtal.
Within this concentration zone, the construction and operation of wind turbines are in principle possible, but at the same time the concentration zone prevents wind energy from being used for the rest of the urban area.
Its zones are intended to prevent "spardling" of the landscape.
Although the city of Viersen had decided a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette a few days earlier by changing the land use plan, the district government had not approved Düsseldorf because of a formal error.
"Because of the lack of a planning requirement, the approval notice issued is still illegal and therefore also withdrawn," said Christoph Erkens, chairman of "Boisheim resists".
Current state of affairs: Before the summer break, the City Council decided once again the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette; approval of the district government is still pending.
Recognise: "This means that the granting of an authorisation for the construction of wind turbines is not planned".
The circle confirms receipt of the call.
"The corresponding letters have been received from the district of Viersen since last week," said one speaker.
The circle takes them to re-examine the matter.
However, they are not likely to cause the procedure to be stopped.
In view of the ongoing proceedings at the administrative court, the district did not want to express its opinion on Thursday on the argument of the association "Boisheim Wehrt" (Boisheim Wehrt).
The NEW Re, a subsidiary of the NEW, plans to build four 200 meter high wind turbines on an area on the Boisheimer Nette.
Last year, the company, in which the city of Viersen is indirectly involved, had already signed lease contracts with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of land.
With the construction of the four wind turbines, the electricity needs of around 11,400 households can be covered - this corresponds to about one fifth of the electricity requirements of all four-senated households.
The NEW Re wants to invest around 20 million euros.
Last summer, Viersen's City Council gave green light to the purchase of three wind turbines in the Linnich wind farm near Aachen and a participation in a wind turbine in Übach-Palenberg in Heinsberg County.
Car and tractor crack together: woman dies in terrible accident
A terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning around 10 a.m. on the L 333 between Niederwallmenach and Bogel (Rhein-Lahn-Kreis).
A woman was killed.
Two more people were slightly injured.
The Landesstraße remained closed for more than hours.
According to police information, a 17-year-old young woman from Bornich drove the L 333 in the direction of Bogel with her 53-year-old mother as a companion.
City and dealer planning "home shopping" weekend
Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region are expected to discover the shopping opportunities in the city centre in September.
The commercial club and the city administration want to take advantage of the weekend on September 8th and 9th to lure the inhabitants to the city centre for shopping.
As the chairman of the Commercial Association, Christian König, announced, the "home-shopping" weekend should raise customers' awareness of what offers their own city offers away from the usual supermarket goods.
A market with regional suppliers is therefore planned, similar to the weekly market.
In addition, local companies are to present themselves with their training places.
In addition, the shops of the city centre are supposed to invite you to the "midnight shopping".
The action is not only aimed at residents of the city and the closer region.
In preparation, advertising spots are on the radio, an Internet video and printed bags that point to the action weekend, says Christian König.
City administration and commercial association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
With this, the commercial association and the city go into another stage of the "Attractive Downtown" project.
These include new offers such as the first "Active Day" for the fountain festival and open Sunday, discussions with all trade operators and hosts to move them to active participation.
Also attractive offers for Saturday and the renunciation of parking fees on this day are part of the concept.
In addition, customer potentials are to be re-opened or re-exploited.
This includes spa guests and tourists.
But also many locals would have lost sight of the city center while shopping.
In the end, everyone would have to contribute to revitalizing the city centre - up to landlords, businesses throughout the city and clubs.
It applied with a network to overcome the lethargy that had partly widened, King had said in spring.
Birgit Streich, Head of the IHK Center in Mühlhausen, announced that five cities will participate for the first time on the nationally third "home shopping" day.
In addition to Bad Langensalza, these are Weimar, Sömmerda, Heiligenstadt and Bleicherode.
The day should "advertise for the appreciation of local trade and emphasize its importance for the common good of our cities more strongly", says Streich.
The action under the leadership of the IHK and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his direct environment himself with his purchasing behaviour.
Two dead and several injured after explosion at US school
During construction work there was a gas explosion in the school building.
New people were injured.
In a gas explosion in the U.S. city of Minneapolis, two people were killed and nine others injured, some of them heavy.
According to the fire department, on Wednesday (local time) there was still a injured person in critical condition.
A man died when a part of a school building collapsed at the explosion.
A first missing person was later also buried dead.
The dead were the employees of the school.
As an accident, the authorities suspected work on a gas pipeline.
At the time of the holiday few people stayed in the building of the Minnehaha Academy.
Trump put pressure on Mexico for payment of the border wall after sluggish transcripts of phone calls
Transcripts of phone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by Washington Post.
On January 27th, Trump, in a phone call with Mexican president Enrique Pena Nieto, urged him to stop publicly saying that he would not pay for a planned border wall.
The U.S. President insulted him for publicly condemning the wall. According to reports he said to him, "You can't tell the press."
Trump launched his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the United States and swore to have Mexico pay for the project.
Transcripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published and revealed a tense exchange.
Mr. Trump said Mr. Turnbull said that a trade for the US refugees who emigrated to Australia was "difficult", "mush" and "dum" and that the existence of the trade mediated by the Obama government would make him look like a "deep" after he proposed a ban on the resettlement of refugees to the US.
Mr. Trump ended the call after he said to Mr. Turnbull, "This is the most unpleasant call for the whole day."
Moores Ford-Masser: Activists restore racist lynchact as a call for justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury drove through a group of spectators in rural Monroe, Georgia, and ran to the Ford Bridge of Moore.
Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, could reach the bridge, a group of white men came out with guns to block its way.
The leader of the mob - a middle-aged man in a needlestrip suit - took a long train at his cigar and looked at the windshield.
Inside, the inmates floated in fear.
"We want this n---r Roger!" the man roared.
"Get him out of the car!"
Screaming the silence when a young black man was torn from the passenger seat.
Fortunately, this terrible scene played on July 22 is just a replica.
But when a loop was thrown around the neck of "Roger", almost everyone in the audience threw out very real sighs.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have returned to Moore's Ford Bridge to imitate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom as well as George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lynched by Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
No one has ever been charged with the murders.
"It is really inconceivable that in all these years no one was arrested - although we see them in our communities, although we know who they are," said Tyrone Brooks, who helps in organizing the replication.
"It's a dirt spot on a story, but it's a burden on our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old former congressman of the state of Georgia and a long-standing civil rights activist.
For him the imitation serves as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual reminder to the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.
"We want law enforcement, we want to end, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we have to get justice," he said.
"We cannot achieve healing and reconciliation until we receive justice."
A court doctor puts a towel over the body of one of the victims of the Moore-Ford-Lyn on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI acts received by NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected in the lynching process.
But no one has ever been charged.
Although the suspects have remained free for decades, civil rights activists say that the double motivation for the Lynch actions throughout the city has always been known: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a decision of the Supreme Court enabled black citizens in Georgia to vote for the first time in the summer election campaign.
About the same time as the election, according to the FBI, the black farmer Roger Malcom struck down a white landlord, Barnett Hester, during a fight - supposedly because of a woman.
Brooks said that the rumor in town was that Hester slept with Malcom's wife Dorothy and that the baby she was wearing did not come from her husband.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid 600 dollars to release Malcom from prison, says the FBI.
He was accompanied by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
But when they got away from the prison and approached Moore's Ford Bridge, a lynch mob surrounded the car.
"As it turns out, it was Harrison who prepared and arranged the murders," concludes an FBI report.
"It is also obvious that there was a plot between the state and local prosecution, which was not only involved in the murders, removed evidence and covered up the identity of witnesses."
Brooks makes it even more precise.
"It was an Electoral Rights massacre," he said.
"They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community: "If you register and if you vote, then this will happen to you."
For almost a decade Cassandra Greene led the annual replica of the Moore Ford Bridge Lynch murder.
Their representation is vivid, gripping and is founded in a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe no longer exists in America.
It's hard to watch and even more difficult to look away, but Greene said that's the point.
"We don't want to talk about the lynch, because then we are confronted with its uglyness in all of us," she said.
"But I can't establish a relationship with you if you don't want to listen to me or don't want to hear what I've been through."
The samples for this year's production began in June, and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen whites and the rest of blacks - pushed themselves into a room and listened when Greene started a well-played overview of the piece.
Wade Marbaugh is Greene's co-director here.
He's played the role of Chief Clan member for years, but he said the role would never be easier.
"I feel dirty because I'm not like that," Marbaugh said.
"But I think it's very important to keep this story alive because we don't want to return at these times."
On the other side of the room, the actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who played Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, tried their lines.
The piece starts with Malcom, who screams at Hester and oppresses him, angry that he slept with his wife Dorothy.
"I said, n--he, get away from my property!"
Rascona answers the fire.
There's a break.
And then everyone (at least all black actors) breaks out in laughter.
Greene laughs loudest.

He's alarmed and confused.
Was I too hard?
"No," said Greene, still tickling.
"I just don't think white people said a--he."
"But", one of the other black actors called white.
"You just have to meet the hard "R."
And that's when the energy in space shifts, a feeling of companionship replaces the discomfort.
Everyone is busy getting this right, not only because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four killed people.
The scene starts again.
This time, when Rascona says the N word, he says it sharply and emphatically.
Absolutely no one laughs.
This repetition ends violently and quickly.
There are screams, shots, and then silence.
A woman dressed in a mourning dress stands over the bodies of the actor and performs Billie Holidays' mourning praise speech "Strang Fruit".
Your voice breaks with every second word.
About a hundred meters behind it, a group of about four dozen spectators wipe out of their eyes sweat and tears.
The audience is almost evenly divided between black and white.
A couple arrived from Ithaca, New York, to see the performance, many just came down the road.
Every eight hours they have experienced Georgia's pressing moisture when Brooks leads them on a pilgrimage to the tombs of the Malcoms and Dorseys.
Until this point, the murders have remained an anecdote, but now, when you stand on the same land where the Lynch murders took place, the air feels spooky.
When the last notes of the song end, Greene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the body name.
Children squat on their heads, register the fake blood and the silent bodies and whisper to each other.
"You're not really dead," a little boy mutters as if he wanted to remember it.
After a few minutes Greene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it's over.
The actors throw the lynch rope away and wipe away their tears.
Bradshaw embraces Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the clan member.
Nick Rascona embraces two of his players and then breaks down crying in her arms, and the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks through with him.
"It's okay," whispers one of the women.
"We know that this is not in your heart.
You did this for a reason."
Later, the audience joins the actors for dinner.
At a table, a white couple from Atlanta chatted about the imitation with a black couple they just met.
Denise Duplinski fought to find words that left the feeling behind.
"It's hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... come from people who look like you and who do it because they look like you," she said.
"What this really does to me makes me believe that the lynch is still going on," she added, "now it's just called police shooting."
In the same room Tyrone Brook's court holds at his table, he eats and reminds of the civil rights.
He said he had already started planning the performance next year.
"The imitation is inspiring in a way, because it describes the horror of what we have endured, but it is also a moment of learning," he said.
"It's like if we don't learn anything from it, then it can happen again.
Whoever does not study his own story, who does not know his own story, is condemned to repeat it."
"Götterdämmerung" reconciled the Wagnerians in Bayreuth
In the fourth part of Richard Wagner's monumental work, director Frank Castorf also relies on a colorful, frivolous production in front of gigantic, six-storey scenes.
The turntable (designed by Aleksandar Denic) is an optional street corner, including the Wall Rest and Donerbude in Berlin, a "plaste and elaste" logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange.
In front of it is an open Mercedes-Oldtimer, in which the Rhine daughters pose as rock girls, or alternatively an Isetta.
Stacked oil barrels are reminiscent of Castorf's leitmotiv - money, power and greed - which runs through his "ring" production.
The three daughters of the Rhine - sung by Stephanie Houtzeel, Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - harmony wonderfully as already in the "Rheingold".
Kess seduces them Siegfried (Stefan Vinke), tears a body into the trunk in Hollywood manner and gives the Krawallo clique.
Stephen Milling sings the beautiful dirty hagen that surrounds the aura of a heavyweight boxer.
Brutal the scene when he beats Siegfried.
Later Gunther (Markus Oak) must also believe in it.
The audience thanks the ensemble with strong applause.
Stormy celebrations of Foster, Milling, Vinke and conductor Janowski, who modestly bows his hands to the Merkel-Route.
There is great applause for the Festival Orchestra, which shows itself on stage for the first time - in the face of the great heat again in an army of leisure clothing.
The appearance of Frank Castorf and his directing team was eagerly expected.
If in 2013 he still had to perform a valid pipe concert, there was great joy five years later, in which the single "buh" call went down.
Festival chief Katharina Wagner must have enjoyed it.
"You notice that the audience has grown together with the "ring" in a way," she said shortly before the performance of the dpa.
Not only has the audience made a form of peace with Castorf, but it has also grown an understanding of its point of view.
I draw a positive summary.
Max Quantity works as a volunteer
They work in several places in their year of volunteering.
Where everywhere?
Quantity: Usually in Steinfurt in the furniture exchange, once a week I help here in Greven in the furniture bridge.
And I've been working at school all day.
How are your experiences with it?
Quantity: It's a beautiful, wide spectrum that I see here.
I'm dealing with different people, with young people, with refugees, with young adults.
You've been 26 years now, so you're a late-called volunteer.
How's that coming?
Quantity: I have graduated.
And then a structural engineering study, let's say, successfully cancelled.
I realized for myself that it's the wrong thing for me and I want to do something else, work with people.
And then I wondered, what are you doing?
Make a social year, there's an insight, there's a way to see how it really is on the spot, in the focus maybe.
And was it?
Quantity: I have collected great impressions.
I will start my studies in social affairs in the winter semester.
I'm going to study dual, probably at the Herne Youth Office, I'm going to take a social worker training and study in Hamm at the University of Applied Sciences.
Is it not unusual to have several different places of employment during volunteering?
Quantity: Yes, it's very variable.
It always depends on where you make your FSJ.
You can do it from old age to youth work - in all possible facets of social work.
It was very varied with me.
I was also partly in the OGS, so in the afternoon care.
For me, it was exactly the right thing that irritated me.
I could recognize my own strengths and see how it really works.
Unlike in civil engineering?
Quantity: Of course, this isn't about calculating statics.
You always have other people who have a completely different story behind you.
Whether a refugee or a youth who has been taken out of the family, you always have to go into it individually.
Very interesting.
And you didn't have any fear of touch?
Quantity: I'm not the guy for that.
It's an area that gives you a lot.
A lot of love, a lot of kindness.
There are also negative moments, but that's how life is.
Pearson reduces further 3,000 jobs and shortens the dividend to revive the business
The British education group Pearson said on Friday that it would reduce further 3,000 jobs and cut its intermediates by 72 percent, as another restructuring programme was launched to overcome the pressure the company faced.
The job breakdown, which Director-General John Fallon announced mainly for the end of 2018 and early 2019, is in addition to his previous restructuring, in which 4,000 jobs were lost.
In May, in a third cost reduction programme, Pearson announced a cost reduction plan of another 300 million pounds (394 million US dollars) to revive a business that was hit by the rapid step towards digital learning.
The company, which had sold its stake in Penguin Random House to its partner Bertelsmann last month, said that the outlook for the financial year was unchanged after it had achieved an increase of 1% to £2.05 billion in the first half of the year.
Convoi attack of Kabul: NATO soldier killed in suicide
A suicide fighter attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital Kabul, killed a NATO soldier, and wounded several others, officials say.
Five soldiers and one interpreter had been injured, and told NATO a statement.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians died during the Qarabagh district incident.
The bombing is the last act of violence that took place in Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Herat.
On Monday, a suicide fighter killed two people near the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul.
A NATO opinion states that the explosion happened on Thursday evening when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by a "improvised bombardment" carried by persons."
The statement states that all injured persons are in a stable state and are treated in the U.S. Military Hospital at Bagram Airfield.
Correspondents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh is a major concern for NATO troops in the nearby Bagram.
According to the United Nations, there were at least 1,662 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, of which about 20 % were in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shiite district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they had carried out this attack.
On May 31st, a massive bombing in the center of the city killed more than 150 people with the country's most deadly militant attack, since the US-led troops forced the Taliban out of power in 2001.
The violence underlines the precarious security situation in Afghanistan, as US President Donald Trump considers increasing the number of U.S. troops supporting the military and police in the country.
Correspondents say that the suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government, its policies and, in particular, in the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
EPO reverses decision to delay the Smog rule after action
The U.S. Environmental Protection Authority has repealed a decision to delay a regulation of the Obama government requiring states to limit Smog-polluting emissions, which took place one day after 15 states sued the Agency for the step.
Late on Wednesday, the EPO announced its decision to advance the so-called "Ozone Provisions 2015" and said that it indicated the Agency's obligation to cooperate with states.
"We believe in the dialogue with and that we are responding to our state partners," said EPA CEO Scott Pruitt in a statement.
Pruitt announced in June the intention of the EPO to delay the ozone requirements - which are to be measured in part of the country's pollutant emissions to determine where cuts have to be made to meet stricter air quality standards - by one year until October 2018.
A group of 15 mostly democratic states, along with the District of Colombia, filed a complaint on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal.
The government of President Donald Trump has tried to reverse a wide range of environmental constraints imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda to stimulate economic growth, according to Trump.
However, efforts have triggered the setback of the Democrats and nature groups that are concerned about the impact of greater emissions on public health.
The EPO website says that inhaling air containing ozone can "reduce lung function and enhance respiratory symptoms", such as asthma.
Council of the Community
In the end, the decision was clear: in the event of two votes against, the municipal council of Fluorn-Winzeln decides to set up a Community area in the future senior housing facility.
Before the discussion there is an important information: The purchase contract for the still missing property was signed, reports Mayor Bernhard Tjaden.
Although it will still take time for the area belonging to the parish to be owned by the church community so far, there is now no longer any obstacle to planning for the project to be voted by a private investor.
There is a debate on this in relation to a Community area.
One of the two investors still in the boat offered to meet the community.
On the ground floor it would provide a living area - about 55 square meters - and a adjacent terrace with at least 70 square meters of space for a special price.
The administration and the majority of the municipal council are in favour of not providing such a community space as a meeting place only for the inhabitants of senior-righteous living, but openly into the community.
As an example, the word of the "trickcafé" made the round.
The decision, which was taken by the provision of funds for the current budget as early as last autumn, will be taken by means of funding.
The construction is located in the rehabilitation area.
The establishment of a Community area, reports Tjaden, would be eligible with 60 percent of 30 percent.
The proposal for a decision provides for an indication to the investor that in this respect it does not want to throw any bumps between his legs, the finding that both saddles - which are based on the construction of the environment - and pult roof are possible, which reduces the height of the grapes and makes the construction economic.
Needless, not only does Wilfried Sohmer mean this addition.
If it helps, he'll pass the body unanimously.
It is not that easy for the Community to do so.
Daniela Ruf refers to the many buildings with which one does not get so far ahead, but is now leaning out of the window at the common room, she says, "I'm hard on it."
Yvonne Staiger is absolutely in favour of the Community area - but absolutely against municipal participation.
It sees behind it a hidden subsidy to already wealthy or even foreign investors.
This is not the case, because with the acquisition of the area one does not grant a grant, but rather gets a real counter-value, if there is any doubt, that is the counter-word.
Three proponents are in favour of the request to split the proposal accordingly.
Thus, in the case of two votes against, it remains the original programme that Stefan Haller summarizes: "If we take the decision in this way, we will take a huge step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure".
Collision by car: Radler is tossed on the road
When crossing the street, an 82-year-old cyclist was captured by a car on Wednesday in Garath and seriously injured.
As the police told us, the 82-year-old Langenfelder had been on his way by bicycle on the road of the Black Road from the direction of Hilden at 12.20 p.m.
The senior wanted to cross the road at the height of the road Am Buchholzer Busch.
A car driver in the same direction gave him priority.
When the Langenfelder drove on the road, however, he apparently did not pay attention to the counter-trafficking.
He got together with a car that ran a 66-year-old Hildeness.
The man was thrown on the street.
He suffered serious injuries and was taken to a hospital with a racquet truck.
FC Bayern München has to renounce David Alaba and Thiago in the Supercup against Borussia Dortmund
The Supercup takes place without him: David Alaba has to let the game suck against Dortmund.
FC Bayern travels to Dortmund with personnel care for the first mandatory game of the new season.
Seven pros are missing the title defender in the Supercup against the cup winner.
Before the Supercup on Saturday (20.30 am/ZDF and Eurosport), the staffing at the German football record champion Bayern München is will grow ever bigger at the cup winner Borussia Dortmund.
Trainer Carlo Ancelotti must also refrain from David Alaba in duel with the BVB.
This was confirmed by the Italians on Friday.
In addition, the Munichs Manuel Neuer, James, Thiago, Jerome Boateng, Arjen Robben and Juan Bernat are missing.
Ancelotti has been responsible for the five defeats in the past six test games and has made the physical state and the lack of balance in his team's game.
"We know we're not in the best physical constitution," said Ancelotti, adding: "The most important point is the balance in the team.
She wasn't good at last."
The 58-year-old, however, believes in an increase in performance in the first official game of the season.
"Football is also tactics, strategy, personality and motivation.
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities.
The team is ready.
We want to play intelligently," said Ancelotti, who expects a "hard, intense game".
The duel of the two German football weights attracts the fans.
The game is sold out with 81,360 spectators, the German Football League (DFL) announced on Friday.
Walking in the resin from star to star
In the resin, the first "star path" is to be created throughout the country.
The association St. Andreasberg plans this.
There is a planetary path in Göttingen - since 2003.
A "star path" met the information needs of many resin visitors, it was said.
It combines nature, science, movement and sporting performance.
The members want to set up tables along the planned route and then inform about stars and constellations.
In a first phase until 2018, the association plans "well-reached installations in five to six locations" in the upper resin.
In question would be St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, Hohegeiß and Sieber.
The information on the tables is to be supplemented via the Internet.
Therefore, good mobile network reception plays a role in the location selection.
Accessibility is also a criterion.
Later, the path of the star train will be extended by train.
"On the path of the stars, the viewers learn a lot of interesting things, for example about the physics of the individual stars," the association explained.
In addition, they learned why stars have different colors or why one star shines stronger than another, although it lies much further away.
It also mediates the constellation in which a selected star is located and when it is best to see.
The association has been operating the highest observatory in northern Germany since 2014 in the Bergstädtchen St. Andreasberg.
The Harz National Park is one of the six darkest regions in Germany, according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation.
Often from there, the Milky Way and even the Andromeda galaxy can be seen clearly with the naked eye.
Since 2003 there has been something similar in the Uni-City at the initiative of the funding association Planetarium Göttingen, the planetary path.
Starting in front of Gebhard's hotel in the Goetheallee, which forms the interior of our solar system, the planetary path leads up to the Hainberg and the Observatory, as well as an "additional" location in Diemarden (congregation equals) with the planet Sedna.
The stems with the individual planets - including the Pluto at the end of the dwarf planet - are exactly set at the distance and scale of one to two billion.
The earth thus shrinks to a ball of 6.5 diameter diameter, while the exactly 75 meters away sun measures at least 70 centimeters.
The entire distance of the planet's path is about four kilometers.
While the light takes about eight hours from sun to pluto, pedestrians need a good hour to the stele with Pluto.
So pedestrians are faster than the light in space.
The march to the next fix star would take half a year.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomaenko meet for the first time, discuss a possible showdown
Vasyl Lomackko and Mikey Garcia, who should be on a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing battle in the near future below 147 pounds, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms in ESPN offices in Los Angeles, until Garcia, the unbeatable World Boxing Council Lightweight Champion, went down the hall to welcome Lomackko, the World Boxing Organisation Super-Federweight Champion.
After Garcia's victory by unanimous decision on the former four-division world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday on showtime, both fighters are members of the top five pounds-for-pound list.
Garcia stretched out his right hand and said, "How are you, champion?
I wish you luck."
Lomackko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday evening at 7 pm at ESPN.
When the couple posing for photos, Lomackko manager Egi's climates noticed that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the "perfect magnitude".
"I am a former spring weight," said Garcia.
"I went up for Broner [at 140 pounds], but I'm not that big.
I'm small for 140.
I want to get down on lightweight.
And he has to move on lightweight [135 pounds] and then we fight.
That's what the fans want.
Let's give them that."
Lomackko agreed.
"Boxing needs this fight."
Climates asked if it should be on Pay-per-view, part of a strategy that Lomackko must fight with a 135-pound debut this year to agree a date next summer with Garcia (37-0, 30 Knockouts) which also has an interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell after their lightweight title fight in the forum on September 23.
"This fight could take place in Pay-per-view mode, because all fans asked for it," said Garcia and later expressed himself openly to fight in the network that offers the best financial package.
We're the best.
No other names can generate this kind of attention.
Whenever they're ready ... "
Garcia said he valued Lomackko as "a huge fighter," and he might participate in his Saturday fight.
But Lomackko stopped with the generous praise for Garcia and said that he thought the three-fight champion from Riverside looked very slow, I'm sorry Mikey ... you wanted the co-off."
Garcia said the focus was to show impact strength, then boxing.
They both said they could feel the momentum built up for their own struggle.
"This is the fight that needs to be carried out.
No other fight creates so much attention and enthusiasm.
I'm more than happy to work on it," said Garcia.
Lomackko said, "I've been waiting for the top fighters, and that's Mikey.
It will be a great fight."
Four injured by tyre seater
In the event of an accident on the A7, four people were partially injured on Thursday afternoon.
According to first information, the driver of a Opel Zafira lost control of his vehicle about 4.30 p.m. shortly before the connection point Marketbreit probably after a tyre driver.
The car sluggished right into the bush, where it crossed over and then lay on the roof in the green strip.
The four inmates - two adults and two children - were partially injured in the accident.
During the first service of the injured by the rescue service, the A7 was blocked to the north for about an hour, then the traffic on the left lane could be passed at the accident site.
Fortunas Hoffmann: "Three chain works better"
After 2:2, Andre Hoffmann hopes to start the season against Braunschweig that the optimization of the defense formation will bring points in Aue.
Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the first season, with the result, if not the two counter-gates had not been against Braunschweig at the 2:2.
"These were two counter-gates too much, and we have to be even better careful in Aue," says the defender of Fortuna Düsseldorf.
In the Erzgebirge the three chain is also to be further optimized.
And a gate after a free shot, the fortunes don't want to catch themselves either.
"For the future, it will be so that no one will stand next to Michael (Rensing)."
Hoffmann is convinced that even after the experience in the preparation of the three chain, his team is better off than with the four chain.
"I still don't know how we'll act in Aue," says his coach Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure of his business, "because we have players in the trio chain in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann who can build well," said Hoffmann.
"The prerequisite is, but that we harmonise even better and that we don't afford so many play errors in building up."
Of course Hoffmann goes to Aue to win the game.
"But whether you can talk about a failed start after a decision is taken, you don't know.
The performance could be quite okay," said Hoffmann.
"But if we can stand there on Sunday with four points and focus on the cup, we will certainly be able to talk about a proper start of the season."
His coach didn't want to know about that.
"I only judge the start of the season after six to eight days of play," said Friedhelm Funkel, who does not want to speak of an advantage to Aue, just because the play of Saxony in Heidenheim had to be ended prematurely because of a storm.
"Now they can almost start the season with a home game," said Funkel and Hoffmann, believing that the players from Aue might even be a little bit fresher, as they wouldn't have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against an uphill favorite in the bones.
"But they don't know so 100% where they are now," says the interior defender of the Fortuna.
Although guests from the Rhineland go as a light favorite on Sunday to the meeting in the finally (almost) finished stadium of Aue.
"The fact that we sweep them away, just because we have the claim to get under the first six, is stupid," says Funkel, whose balance in just one defeat against au from nine games is quite positive.
"There is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga that you have to beat from the beginning," explains Fortuna's chief coach.
"To make such a statement would be arrogant and arrogant."
And so Funkel doesn't want to experience his players on Sunday.
New results of the Swedish asylum age evaluation tests published
The recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden, which have undergone a new method of medical assessment of their age, show that more than 80 percent of those tested are over 18 years of age, but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish Forensic Medicine Authority (Rättsmedicinalverket) started conducting the tests last year.
They should make the assessment of age more precise during the asylum procedure after the Swedish Migration Authority (Migration Verket) was criticized for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were underage.
To date, Migration Verket has sent 6,880 cases to be tested and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from the period from mid-March to 31 July 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were evaluated as 18 or older, while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was "possibly 18 years of age or older".
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person "may be under 18 years old".
The tests shall be carried out only in cases where the age of the person is called into question.
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results have been consistent in recent months.
"We don't see a big difference in the statistics of the past few months, the figures are quite constant," he said in The Local magazine.
The high proportion of cases in which the person has been assessed as over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the applicant has lied about his age.
In May the Agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 cases that "propose that the person under investigation was 18 years old or older".
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 published results, she found that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that she was going to be 18 years old this year.
The method of medical age assessment, in which X-rays are taken of wisdom teeth and MRI recordings of knee joints, which are then analyzed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticized in some areas.
A skeptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose work covers the assessment of the biological maturity of humans to see if they passed through puberty sooner or later than usual.
"I had reason to think about it, and I don't think the type of measurement should be used.
To assess biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't say it for sure, we shouldn't pretend we could," he said the Metro newspaper.
However, Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, you can say that the risk of a child being inaccurate as an adult is low.
The greatest risk lies in the fact that the person is just under 18, in which case this is about 10 percent."
Full in the plan
Work on the three bridges of Landstraße 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is progressing well.
On Wednesday, a seven-tonne concrete part was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance to Lauterbach.
"We're very good at the time, it's going great," says Reinhold Leicht, construction manager at the Department of Roads and Transport in the government president Freiburg.
In April the work started at the same time on all three bridges in need of renovation between Schramberg and Lauterbach.
The end of the building is scheduled for October and it is easy to ensure that the timetable is respected.
The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads over the Trombach.
It is a arched bridge made of concrete, which is decorated with red coloured sandstone and has a total length of 4,80 meters.
It was built in 1900.
Like the two other bridges, it has now come to years.
In order to ensure stability and road safety, the three structures are now being thoroughly renovated.
The two other bridges cross the Lauterbach.
They are made of red sandstone.
Both were built in 1939 and are 12 and 10.60 meters long.
The bridge at the entrance to the town of Lauterbach has now received on Wednesday morning on the north side a 1.30 m wide and seven tons heavy so-called bridge cap.
This is a edge attachment, which is also used as an operating route.
On Friday, the southern part of the bridge will be equipped with a 2.20-metre bridge cap.
Then the pedestrian path is supposed to run.
The special thing about this is that it is finished parts, a patent of the Schramberger company Dizwo.
The other two bridges are already equipped with patented bridge caps.
Special fingertips have required the installation of lines through the construction in Lauterbach.
Because there is also a fiber optic cable that many companies are connected to.
The residents were informed of the project in advance of the work by hand-held papers.
In addition, fish and crabs had to be fished at first.
For the bridges between the Bauhof building and the consignee in the direction of Schramberg, the traffic is regulated by a traffic light.
For the construction work on the bridge at Lauterbacher local entrance, the street in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels "Tannenhof" and "Seven Linden" is fully blocked.
The cost of the three bridge renovations is 700 000 euros.
It is financed by the country.
AfD in Gerolstein: Colorful protest at German potato salad
It is not so common for parties to pull a cord, but when it comes to the alternative for Germany (AfD), it comes together, which is otherwise difficult to put under a hat.
The parties represented in the Kreistag Volcano Eifel (CDU, SPD, Greens, FDP, FWG, Left) belong to a broad alliance that shows peaceful flag on that day, because the AfD invites Rondell in the Gerolsteiner Stadthalle to join the poster "big election campaign".
And well-known names will start - like Alice Weidel, who together with Alexander Gauland will be the top duo for the Bundestag election on 24 September, and Deputy Federal President Beatrix von Storch.
But those who are on site hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the AfD students, but to demonstrate them.
The motto "The Eifel remains colorful".
Originally the city picnic was planned under the motto "All at a table" on the well square, but now takes place in the parking lot below the Rondell - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the AfD event in the Stadthalle.
It's a colorful picture that's coming up.
And what Christa Karoli, chairman of the Forums A world and one of the leading organizers, is really happy: "Toll how many people have come together here."
There is music and plenty of food, including a "Urdeutsche potato salad that the AfD could eat without problems," says the woman who brought him.
The police have ordered many officials to go to Gerolstein, which shows presence especially at the station, which is only a few meters away from the venues.
How did the AfD actually get to Gerolstein?
Mario Hompes of the AfD Volcano Eifel reports that he had made an effort for such an event and got the award.
The 45-year-old from Gönnendorf had initially asked for a question in Daun, but got a rejection there because there is not enough parking because of the already built Laurentiuskirms.
So now the Rondel, Hompes is happy that "we can have such a nice event here".
In view of the event on the Rondell forecourt, he says: "This is the good right of the people, mainly, it remains peaceful".
This is also the case: around 8 pm, a band will provide entertainment on the Rondell forecourt, in the Stadthalle several speakers, including the Rhineland-Palatinate AfD chairman Uwe Junge.
In the hall are about 200 listeners waiting for the top candidate for the Bundestag election, Alice Weidel, and Deputy Federal President Beatrix von Storch to give her speeches.
The police presence is unchanged, but so far the officials had a quiet evening.
A little more than an hour takes the AfD event, the guests on the front court have a longer breath, but there is also a short time after 21:00 cleaning up.
The police can retreat - no special incidents.
Trombone meets Trumpet
Rehearsing the Wolfacher tromboneist Frederic Belli is available in the series Haslacher Klosterkonzerte tomorrow, Sunday, at 8 p.m. in the Klosterkirche.
Together with the Bulgarian trumpeter Miroslav Petkov he gives a concert under the motto "Black Sea meets Black Forest", or "Balkanfolklore" meets a classic German training with roots in brass music.
Both soloists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have solo positions in top European orchestras.
Petkov is solo trumpeter at the renowned Concertgebouw Orchestra Amsterdam and Frederic Belli is solo trombone player of the SWR Symphony Orchestra.
Both combine the desire not only to cross the boundaries on their instruments, but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres.
Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like a new dress in both of them, Daniel Schnyder's "World Music" unites with Bulgarian folklore, and in the piece "Exchange Suite" by the jazz prize winner Nils Wogram, classical music, jazz and the free play mix into a fascinating overall work of art.
This core piece of the programme was first performed this spring with enormous success in Freiburg.
The renowned composer Nils Wogram wrote it specifically for the two musicians and more: The Haslach monastery church with its special acoustics is deliberately included in the concert.
Kristen Stewart talks about her bisexuality
"Some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives.
But I want to try everything out," Kristen Stewart said openly about her bisexuality.
"When I bite in grilled cheese, I think, 'Oh, that was cool, what's next?'."
The Hollywood star's most well-known relationship was with her "Twilight" colleague Robert Pattinson, who eventually separated bitterly.
Despite all this, the brunette actress assures the "Harper's Bazaar" magazine: "I was seriously in love with everyone I dated.
Or do you think I played it?"
After her separation, Kristen admitted that she was bisexual: "I've always lived dualism and believed it seriously.
So it has never confused or hindered me.
I just never liked to be taken seriously."
Especially among them she suffered, according to "Bang Showbiz", but in school when she preferred to dress like a bub: "Not all girls are typical girls.
That really hurt me.
When I was eleven, the kids told me I'd look like a bub.
I felt really attacked, scared and ashamed.
Now I look back and think: 'Girl, be proud of you!'."
Especially to the public, she doesn't like to explain her love life: "People expect you to behave in a certain way and this is annoying to me.
And maybe some call me ungrateful, but I don't like to have to justify myself to the public."
The Governor of West Virginia announces that he is changing the party
The democratic governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced on Thursday evening at a rally with President Trump that he would change the party.
Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have removed themselves from me," said Governor Justice.
"Today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of thought ... today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia, I can't help you anymore if I'm a democratic governor."
The rally broke out in joy.
"Tomorrow I will change my registration with the Republicans," added Justice.
"As a coach, I would say it's time to play another game."
Mr. Trump previously promised a big announcement to the West Virginia Rally.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia with 42 points, and Justice did not approve of the democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, which is the only billionaire in the state according to Forbes, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states and inherited coal from his father.
He's worth about $1.59 billion.
In the meantime, the Republican National Committee issued a statement on Thursday evening, saying: "The change of party of Governor Justice is another blow for a Democratic party that would hinder us rather than work to make our country great again."
"With only 15 governorates and control of the least legislative bodies in history, the announcement of Governor Justice is only the last rejection of a party that is without leadership from top to bottom and is unable to find a positive, agreed message," said RNC chairman Ronna McDaniel in a statement to the CBS News.
Coe praises "honorly" Russian excuse for doping scandal
On Thursday, Sebastian Coe, the world's leader of athletics, praised what he described as an obvious excuse from Russia for a doping scandal, but repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be taken back into the sport.
During the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World Championships, Russia's athletics leader Dmitry Shylakhtin said that his country's banishment was correct and that he was determined to fight the doping.
He said he'd be sorry for "all the athletes who took away gold and silver medals in competitions".
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted in favour of maintaining the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report from the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) had found evidence of state-funded doping in Russia.
"I thought it was a very open answer today, a very honest presentation," IAAF President Coe told the reporters.
"The entire Council and Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognized within itself that it has experienced some quite hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is remodelled."
Coe said he was also "enjoyed" that Russia accepted the criteria for its reintroduction.
"I think it was a very constructive day, and I think progress has been made, but the Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to re-establish Russia," Coe said.
"We must do everything in the next few months to normalize this situation.
The guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the corrupt system," he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes will compete as neutral players at the World Championships, which will begin on Friday in London, following the strict IAAF criteria.
The head of the IAAF Task Force, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia still needs to meet some of the criteria for re-establishment.
Drug tests are still insufficient and banned trainers are still working freely, he said to reporters in London after a lecture at the IAAF Council.
Obituary for soldiers crashing in Mali
At a mourning celebration in Fritzlar, North Hesse, some 1,000 people thought of the two soldiers killed in a helicopter crash in Mali.
The ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security arrangements.
On the unexplained cause of the crash, Minister of Defense Ursula said nothing about the Leyen (CDU).
But she called the two killed pilots "Konner of her profession".
"We bow down to this highest sacrifice that they have made on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany," she explained.
The 33-year-old Major and the 47-year-old Chief of Staff from North Hesse had died on Wednesday a week ago in Western African Mali.
Their coffins were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a guard of the Bundeswehr in the Fritzlar Cathedral of St. Peter.
At first, only the members of the church took their leave at noon.
After that, the funeral began in the circle of the family, close friends, by representatives of the Bundeswehr and politics.
Among these were Hessen's Prime Minister Volker Bouffier (CDU) and the General Inspector of the Bundeswehr Volker Wieker.
Mourning guests laid roses, relatives stood arm in arms on the coffins.
In front of the church, Fritzlars and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a screen.
Minister of Defense of the Leyen described the killed soldiers as "highly decorated" and experienced in operation.
The Chief of Staff had built up the flight operation of the Tiger fighter in Fritzlar and had been one of the first six trained tiger pilots of his regiment.
Volker Bauersachs, commander of the regiment, among whom the soldiers belong, also said: "If this crew could not turn away the crash, then no one would have been able to do it."
No doubt about the UN mission in Mali did not show any doubt about the Leyen: the deployment was dangerous.
But it is also of great importance "for a country from which we are separated only by two states," she said.
After the funeral, the coffins were brought out of the cathedral.
When and where they are buried, the Bundeswehr gave no information.
Prince Henrik doesn't want a grave next to his wife
The husband of the Danish Queen Margrethe (77), Prince Henrik (83), does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death.
That was announced by the Royal House on Thursday.
Traditionally, the Danish royal couple are buried in the cathedral church of Roskilde.
The sculptor Bjørn Nørgaard has already made a sarcophagus for the two.
The Queen agreed to her husband's decision, it continued in the communication.
Where Prince Henrik is buried, be still unclear.
But he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland.
Prince Henrik had never made a feast out that he was not happy with his title.
After the ascent of his wife Margrethe in 1972, he would have liked to become king.
In 2016, he retired and also took the title "Prinzmahl".
Since Henrik had not been given the title and function he wanted in Denmark, he did not view himself as equivalent to his wife - even after death, Lene Balleby, the chief spokesperson of the Danish royal house.
Where the last resting place of the 83-year-old will finally be, it is still unclear.
However, he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland, but in Denmark.
He likes the country he's been working for over the last 50 years.
Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, the son of a French nobleman, had met Margrethe in London in 1965.
He worked on the Thames in the French Embassy.
While his later wife always flew the sympathy expressions of the people, Prince Henrik had a heavy stand in his almost 50-year-old rule among the Danes.
In an autobiography Henrik said about the first years in Denmark: "Just a few months after I arrived, everything I did was criticized.
My Danish was waving, I preferred wine instead of beer, silk stockings instead of knitting socks, citroën instead of Volvo, tennis instead of football.
Even for the Gauloises that I smoked instead of Virginia tabak and who in this country had the reputation to be the brand of socio-critical intellectuals, I could not hope for forbearance.
I was different.
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not ashamed.
That was two mistakes!"
Prime Minister Weil wants a rapid reelection
CDU and FDP before possible majority in Lower Saxony
Lower Saxony's Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) is after the loss of the red-green government majority for a rapid re-election of the state parliament, but he does not want to resign.
Because on Friday the House was in favour of the resolution of Parliament.
Previously, the surprising resignation of a Green MP from their parliamental group in Lower Saxony had plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a severe crisis.
Five months before the official election date, the red-green coalition in Hanover lost its scarce one-voice majority in Parliament to the opposition from CDU and FDP.
Ms. Twesten, who had been elected to the election in 2018, founded her step in her constituency in Rotenburg (Wumme).
"I see my political future in the CDU," she explained on Friday in Hanover.
CDU Head of Group Björn Thümler recommends that his group include them.
In this way, CDU and FDP have 69 seats together in the Lower Saxony Landtag, SPD and Green 68 seats.
So far, the ratio has been reversed.
The new Landtag will be elected regularly on 14 January next year.
Thümler said that the red-green state government now had to decide whether it could continue to rule without a majority in this situation.
Stephan Weil, however, considers it essential that the parliament decides its own resolution as quickly as possible.
The CDU Group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday.
The Constitution also provides for the possibility of the country's day withdrawing trust from the Prime Minister and electing a successor.
"Our constitution offers several options.
These possibilities need to be checked in a legally clean manner," said Thümler.
"All questions will be discussed in peace, if they are legally properly tested."
Thümler called Twesten's step "but something curious".
The politician herself stressed: "I am not a traitor.
I feel very good."
She was named a follower of Black-Green.
The Greens asked the apostates to return their country mandate.
"Of course, we assume that she will immediately return her landtag mandate, which she has received over the green list of countries," the state presidents Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Korner told us.
The Group President of the Greens Anja Piel said, "We regret the decision of Elke Twesten. "
It has deliberately decided not to hold a debate in the Group.
"Even in the light of the fact that there were no differences in content, we cannot understand this step."
SPD Chancellor Martin Schulz condemns the transfer of the Lower Saxony Green Deputies Elke Twesten to the CDU as a betrayal.
"The behaviour of former Green Members in Lower Saxony is not only betrayal of voters, but also betrayal of red-greens," wrote the Federal Head of the Social Democrats on Facebook on Friday.
He supports the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) to quickly re-elect the state parliament.
The exit of Twestens costs the majority in Lower Saxony.
The politician put "in her wounded vanity and frustration her personal interests before the welfare of the country," criticised SPD Secretary General Hubertus Heil.
"It is a scandal that the CDU in Lower Saxony participates in this dirty intrigue game and tries to beat political capital from it."
Lower Saxony's head of the CDU Group Björn Thümler is recommending his Member to include Elke Twesten in the CDU.
The head of the SPD in the Bundestag, Thomas Oppermann, accused Twesten of falsifying the results of the 2013 state election with personal career thinking.
The CDU was at the time strongest force before the SPD, but SPD and Greens had a thin majority of one voice in the country day.
Minister of Agriculture in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from poisons, Mr Schmidt?
Germany is discussing contaminated eggs.
How could the scandal happen?
How can consumers protect themselves?
Minister for Agriculture Christian Schmidt (CSU) is in the interview with the editorial network Deutschland (RND).
Mr Schmidt, how can consumers protect themselves from poisoned eggs?
I can only encourage all consumers to look closely at the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamp imprint.
On the consumer protection portal www.Lebensmittelwarnung.de, the federal states set up the latest information on the affected egg batches.
Eggs affected should be destroyed or returned.
Even if, after all we know at present, a health hazard is practically excluded.
Is Aldi now taking over the best possible crisis response - all the eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the reconnaissancer is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture?
Food monitoring is the responsibility of the federal states.
Nevertheless, my house has turned up immediately and has been in close exchange with the authorities of the countries since the German occupation became known.
All information and risk assessment are available to consumers.
Trade, like manufacturers, has to ensure that the products sold are transportable and safe from health.
If eggs exceed the maximum residue level of 0,005mg/kg, they are not transportable.
However, unladen eggs can be sold and consumed.
This time, it's not the farms that are to blame.
Are production plants and consumers in the same boat?
According to current knowledge, production establishments are not directly in debt.
Rather, they have to expect economic damage due to alleged illegal practices of service companies.
As always, there are too few controls in the event of serious.
Is there only a lack of staff or a lack of consistent competence?
It was the official checks that revealed the process.
However, the truth is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be ruled out by 100 percent.
That is why a consistent disclosure of such events and the handing over to prosecutors in cases where criminal offences may occur are crucial.
I have already made it quite clear on several occasions that I expect the responsible authorities to be fully informed.
Is regular alarm in food scandals really necessary?
Consumers have the right to obtain only safe and transportable food.
When an unauthorised insecticide is used in the food industry, consumers are rightly outraged.
By means of the armored means, manufacturers, traders and consumers have come into a situation that is absolutely not necessary.
In principle, it must be clear that the illegal use of the insecticide Fipronil in the farming of food-supply animals is not acceptable and must be terminated immediately.
This requires consistent and high-pressure work at all levels.
I expect from all competent authorities that the facts will be quickly and seamlessly clarified.
How the financial rules of football affect Neymar's move to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unhindered spending of European football clubs will not disrupt Neymar's world record transfer from the Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris Saint Germain.
Some consequences will still come for Paris Saint-Germain of UEFA, because the leading organization that has monitored the European game has the power to ban teams of access to the prestigious Champions League tournament.
Financial Fair Play rules launched by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG must at some point prove that Neymar's transfer was financed without any significant losses.
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to buy out the Brazilian from its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to several ten million dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.
PSG can certainly make the money easy to sign Neymar and bring him to a galaxy of other stars, given the funding of the team by Qatar's energy-rich family of rulers.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on the acquisition of players, but they have to counter-tax with legitimate sources of revenue that enable them to break-even point in their football-related business.
FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA President in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs that had incurred huge debts in their quest for success effectively cheated and risked ruining themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, FFP moved from the concentration on the debt of the clubs to the monitoring of its losses.
The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used in 2003 in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - should become a harder matter.
During the current three-year FFP investment period, which runs until 2018, clubs can assume losses of 30 million euros.
And although Platini fell into disrepute by the Presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor, Alexander Ceferin, continues to work to deter excessive spending.
"Certainly FFP is not dead and we will strengthen the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for FFP at UEFA, to The Associated Press last week.
Although the PSG has paid Neymar’s buy-out clause in a flat-rate amount, it can distribute the amount for accounting over the duration of its contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract so that the replacement amount for the next five years can be shown in the annual financial statements amounting to EUR 44.4 million.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 met with the most severe sanctions, along with Abu Dhabi, owned by Manchester City.
The PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (at that time 82 million dollars), which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the team members for the 2014/15 Champions League remain limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players.
UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to outdo its financial supervision by bloating its revenue by companies associated with the owners of a club.
While a catarian company could sponsor PSG if the value of sponsoring exceeded the standard market rates, UEFA would not make this a legitimate income.
That's exactly what happened in 2014, when UEFA decided that the value of sponsoring the PSA was bloated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.
It has been reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come to Qatar on payments from the World Cup Organization Committee in 2022.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 have disputed that Neymar will become World Cup ambassadors and that such a maneuver could easily be found out for the UEFA regulatory authorities.
The previous sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more alert to any attempt to circumvent the rules.
UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG about Neymar's transfer, said on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation.
They spoke to The Associated Press under the condition of anonymity, as they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.
The latest published reports show that with a turnover of 542.4 million euros, PSG 2015/16 has achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros.
The accounts for the last financial year are still to be published.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to be a blessing for sponsoring deals, merchandise and jersey sales.
The association expects sales to increase by at least 30 percent after signing.
The Spanish league was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players going, and she tried to prevent Neymar's departure by claiming that PSG would violate the FFP.
"It is a clear case of "financial doping" with the club and the state," said the president of La Liga, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar's ultimate ownership of PSG.
Arsenal Manager Arsene Wenger, whose association is owned by an American sports tycoon, shares La Liga's reservations against a state that finances a club.
"It is the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football over the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"Once a country has a club, everything is possible.
It will be very difficult to respect the financial fairplay because you can go different ways or have different interests if a country has such a big player to represent a country."
Swiss is looking for a new Shoggi supplier
In recent years, chocolate Frey has produced on-board chocolate for Swiss.
Now sweet cooperation is about to come to an end: the airline is re-denomination of the order.
On request of the news agency sda, Swiss spokesman Meike Fuhlrott confirmed a corresponding report by the newspaper "Nordwestschweiz" of Friday.
According to current planning, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.
The products would be reviewed every two to three years and subject to quality control.
"We are very satisfied with the current supplier of chocolate Frey," said the speaker.
Around 17 million small red and white shogni tablets packed 14 grams a year distribute the flight attendants to the passengers before landing.
Swiss did not want to provide any information on the costs.
Industry insiders estimate the order volume according to "Nordwest Schweiz" to CHF 1.5 to 2 million - the Migros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of around one billion francs.
But the advertising effect is all more important: for a schoggi manufacturer it is a prestigious order.
The Swiss does not want to betray how many candidates there are in the new tender.
However, only Swiss manufacturers are eligible.
According to the newspaper report, Chocolat Frey aims to renew the contract beyond the spring of 2018.
For the sda, the largest Swiss chocolate producer was not available for an opinion.
Chocolate boards have been distributing Swiss on board their flights since 2006.
Before the Swiss concluded a contract with the Migros daughter, Barry Callebaut had supplied the chocolate tablets in cooperation with Hug.
The opportunity to place the logo was introduced by Swiss two and a half years ago with the start of the collaboration with Chocolate Frey.
The airline cooperates with different Swiss chocolate producers.
On long-distance flights, the customers of the First Class are spoiled with treats by the Confiserie Sprüngli, in the Business Class nächen passengers Schoggi by Lindt and in the Economy Class Schoggi by Chocolat Frey.
Swiss Schoggi from Chocolat Frey is also distributed on the short line, both in business and economy class.
athletics - Discus-Olympiager Robert Harting achieves World Cup finals
The three-time world champion will fight for a medal on Saturday in the final.
His brother Christoph, Olympic winner of 2016, had failed in the national World Cup excretion and could only watch the discus competition from the gallery.
Also with the first attempt, Polish champion Piotr Malachowski, who threw 65,13 meters wide, qualified for the final fight.
Nostalgie goes into the niche in "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective"
This repetition of history is nostalgic at the same time because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80s, for the 90s-Grunge era (when the thinkers David Wain and Michael Showalter turned the sketch comedy "The State" for MTV), and for themselves - that is, for 2001, before their stars, such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd, went on to bigger things.
As a cultural artifact, it is equally a parody and an embodiment of our Facebook-enabled era of permanent memories.
But as a franchise, it feels like time is running out.
"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not only because of his absurd humor (it contained an original story for a talking can of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).
Stiffing to the core of the gag - the middle-aged actors play horny children who will grow up - they still made it impossible to win the last part of the joke.
"Ten Years Later", with his adults playing now adults, is less emotionally rooted and his parody goes more according to the casting cannon principle, including a reef on the Stalker films of the 90s like "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle" ("The Hand That Swings the Cradle").
At one point, a character roams through an Apple Powerbook, some inline skates and "a number of other things from 1991".
Many of the central stories are the same.
The lovable Coop (Mr. Showalter), now novelist, has still not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) has still not lost his virginity.
And there is another crazy and evil plot that Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter) is involved in, which is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a well-successed impression by Michael Ian Black).
As always, the excursions are the best part of the franchise.
It's especially fun to see the eternally young Mr. Rudd, the Matt Dillon's lower lipbeard of "Singles", whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy now feels like an old cracker.
It's the moments of random insanity that could inflame this franchise like a kind of repeating "Seven Up!" series until it reaches what I'm going to take as his logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later", whose last scene the band will show how it'll visit the film premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer".
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon is now reminiscent of another kind of nostalgia: the revival of the Cold War of "The Americans", the film "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW" with its East-Besides-West Ringfight iconography.
The comedy with Rhys Thomas, created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka as director, states that it is a TV series found: a Romanian drama of the 1980s with the two police officers as friends, two officers from Bucharest who fight for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism-Leninism.
The main roles - a hard-lined Gregor and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, whose dialogues are synchronized in English by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a brilliant idea.
But it's not much more than an idea.
There are some beautiful gags to watch (the police spend the time watching chess on television, as Americans might do with football).
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - ensures a decent game 'Find the Voice Out'.
But "Comrade Detective" is so committed to the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer wearing a Reagan mask is involved - that it often plays like a single one.
With six long episodes, it is moving away, and the comedy is not fast enough or frequent enough.
"Comrade Detective", which was edited to a lesser length, could better deliver his agitprop satire, as Gregor and Iosef visit the American embassy again and again, whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who devour a bunch of Hamburgers.
The message for the imagined communist audience is that Western culture can make everything a feed for a situation.
The fictional Romanian creators were not wrong: we even do it with our own recent history and with their own.
Battle against drug mafia in the country
The police hit the Italian Mafia in Baden-Württemberg.
On Wednesday morning, numerous objects were searched in the Schwarzwald-Baar-Kreis, Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, as reported by Konstanz on Friday.
15 defendants between the ages of 25 and 77 were arrested and already issued arrest warrants against them.
The officials also ensured greater quantities of marijuana and cocaine, firearms and several hundred thousand euros.
Two persons were arrested in the case of parallel raids in Italy.
There were German arrest warrants against the two suspects of Italy.
The two are therefore probably shipped to Germany.
Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the action.
A total of over 300 police officers were in service.
Members of the Mafia are accused of organized drug crime, serious violence, attempted murder, robbery and extortion.
Since summer 2016, the Public Prosecutor's Office has determined Konstanz against organized drug trafficking in southern Germany.
Between the prosecutors in Constance and Palermo there was a lively exchange and the investigators of Kripo Rottweil had close to daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.
Therefore, on Wednesday morning, the large deployment was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo.
In particular, Italian nationals were closely related to the Italian mafia.
An incident on May 27th in Hüfingen, where several shots were fired into a restaurant early in the morning, is also expected to go to the account of the gangs.
Way complains big gaps in the foreign register
"Data from citizens who should not appear here": According to a report, the Ausländer register in Germany has significant shortcomings.
This leads to some serious errors in asylum procedures.
According to a media report, the Federal Government Commissioner for Refugee Management, Frank-Jürgen Weise, has highlighted major gaps in the foreign central register.
In the case of asylum procedures and deportations, deficiencies in the data registered there could lead to "partial serious misconceptions", cautioned in an analysis carried out by the "German German newspaper".
According to the register, ten million people with foreign nationality are included, including some 5.7 million from non-EU countries.
The data are therefore managed by some 600 foreign authorities in Germany.
Because the data had not been sufficiently maintained, the data quality in parts had not been good.
In individual cases, data from 1921 have been found, "by people who are no longer alive, or by citizens who have become German citizens and who are no longer supposed to appear in the register".
"Flawful data inputs can significantly slow down return processes," the report states.
Moreover, EU citizens who did not have to leave were included in the statistics on persons subject to departure.
However, such false allocations "led to a distorted debate on how to deal with those who are leaving the country", according to the analysis.
Meanwhile, the Federal Government has apparently started to return to Italy with under 16-year-olds when they have arrived from there.
This is reflected in an internal paper from the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), reports the "New Osnabrücker Zeitung".
According to the paper, the BAMF "reruns to Italy on families with children - except infants and infants - since 1 June 2017".
Since the end of 2014, this has been virtually impossible, according to the newspaper, referring to the difficult situation on the ground.
Under the Dublin Agreement, refugees of the EU state are responsible for reaching them first.
If a migrant travels to another EU country, that State can return him to the country of entry.
For reasons of reasons, the Office now writes: "In the meantime, the reception capacity for families with minor children in Italy has increased significantly".
Italy had provided guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families.
Even the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) considers these commitments to be sufficient.
Other EU countries would also return refugees under the Dublin Agreement.
The internal spokesperson of the Left Group in the Bundestag, Ulla Jelpke, criticised this decision: "Families with children are threatened by the deficiencies in the Italian asylum system and the threat of child welfare."
Second best result achieved
A total of 220 liters of blood from persons living in Oberreichbach already provided the blood donation service for other people.
At least by the twelve citizens who were awarded on Fridays.
First of all, Jürgen Greule, who now shared 50 liters of blood with his 100 donations.
Traditionally, at the meeting of the municipal council, the community honors the multiple willingness to donate blood.
"It's awesome how our bodies are set up for this and we still pay the donors respect for their blood for strangers, which is still unprofitable," stressed Mayor Karlheinz Kistner.
"One single donation helps several people," explained the German Red Cross (DRK), Holger Maisenbacher, who explained that the canned products are being decomposed into their components.
Three people could benefit from a blood donation.
At the same time, Maisenbacher reported on the actions being carried out in Oberreichenbach in spring.
"This year, with 114 donors, we achieved the second best result," said the DRK circle preparedness manager.
Obviously, the change to the theater had led to higher attendance figures a few years ago.
Before that, Thomas Bockstadt, Susanne Reichle, Sandra Schöck, Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer were among the multiple donors and were awarded for 50 blood donations each.
Half as many book Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger, while Tamara Pfrommer, Petra Schleeh, Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Vetter paid ten times per 500 millilitres of their juice.
The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and the weakening of inflation dampen speculations over an increase.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain "pays" when it maintained interest rates on family incomes in the middle of increasing pressure.
The Bank's monetary committee (MPC) policy-makers voted by 6 to 2 in favour of keeping interest rates at 0.25%, with fewer members seeking to increase this month, as weak economic growth has weakened support for an increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7% and for 2018 to 1.6% and warned that the pressure on household income would continue, with inflation expected to rise to just under 3% in autumn.
But it signalled that in the coming years interest increases would become necessary to stem the inflation fueled by Brexit and said that credit costs might have to rise more than expected on the financial markets.
Members also voted to withdraw part of the Mammut economic package, which was issued a year after Brexit.
It will take time for the financing plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks as of next February, although it has been said that it is now expected to make 15 billion pounds more available under this system - with 115 billion pounds sterling.
Minutes after the decision on the interest rate, the Bank said: "In the central forecast of the MPC, gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak in the short term, as the pressure on real household income continues to burden consumption."
At interest rates, she repeated that "a certain streamlining of monetary policy" would be necessary to cool inflation and a "something greater" scale than the markets expect.
Markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and a further increase in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that increases would be "step-by-step" and "limited".
The bank's downward-corrected growth forecasts for this and next year are compared to the 1.9% and 1.7% forecast in May.
It maintained its growth forecast to 1.8% in 2018.
The pound fell after these news against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5% to $1.31 and fell by 0.4% to €1.11.
The decision does not change after the recent disappointing growth rates have slowed the rise in expectations of an increase in interest rates and GDP has risen from 0.2% in the second quarter of the previous three months to 0.3%.
Growth is expected to be 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will recover slightly towards the end of the year after the Bank.
The recent inflation report provided little enthusiasm for households that are affected by rising inflation and small wage increases, as the aggravation first gets worse before it improves.
She added that monetary policy cannot "prevent" the loss of income in the coming years, but she added that wages will recover "clearly" at the end of her three-year forecast.
The economy is also strengthened by the rising demand for UK goods, which is due to the weak pound, which will offset some of the lower consumption expenditure.
The decision comes one year after the reduction in interest rates to 0.25% last August following the shocking EU vote which caused the reduction of the pound.
The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years for this to fully achieve the prices and the economy.
Prior to the Bank’s last judgment on interest rates, the call for an interest rate increase had increased as inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policy makers demanding an increase of 0.5% in July.
Inflation fell from 2.9% in June to 2.6% in June, although the Bank said it was expected to do so and will attract it again in the coming months.
The Bank said that the excess in relation to its 2% target was "full" due to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "In view of the recent decline in swap rates, the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again, as the creditors are looking for business and want to end the year in a positive way.
The market looks particularly good for those who run out of existing deals and complete the new mortgages, and many with free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular."
NHS (National Health Service) is to prescribe controversial HIV drugs 10,000 people
Patients will receive access to "transformative" HIV prevention treatment from September after a fight at the High Court against the funding of the drug in the NHS.
NHS England announced that a pre-exhibition prophylaxis (PREP) taken before sexual intercourse, which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by about 86 percent, is now supplied by the health service through a first three-year study for an estimated 10,000 people.
He agreed to finance the trial after the appeal court confirmed last year a ruling of the Supreme Court that the NHS had the power to pay for the PrEP despite the claim that the local authorities should finance it.
The chess train announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS UK leader Simon Stevens as "important new intervention", while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described this as "the decisive moment".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to enable people to register, and other clinics will follow in October before they will be introduced throughout England in April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PREP) is a consequence of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in people at risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before sexual intercourse means that just enough medication is present in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection.
Such medications can be taken every day or two hours before sexual intercourse.
Those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexuals and people with HIV-positive partners who have not been successfully treated.
In clinics, appropriate participants who agree to the study, including men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment are identified.
People living in England who are registered with a family doctor may also register for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic.
The program will be £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to supply the drugs this week after an international competitive procurement.
The study aims to assess the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence on how it is used, received and implemented on a large scale.
Stevens said: "This great new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in the more than three decades of continuing progress in dealing with one of mankind's greatest health challenges."
Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National AIDS Trust), said, "This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, when targeted at needy and endangered people, offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic.
From September on, people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is really controlled individually and is not subject to negotiation with a partner, which will lead to the improvement of many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement."
Ian Green, CEO of Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "The priority must now be that the study is carried out quickly across the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left behind.
Now that the PrEP test medicine has been acquired, we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV-infected people."
Sharon Hodgson, Shadow Health Minister, said: "The beginning of the PreEP process is welcome and overdue after months of delays and slow implementation by the government.
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life-changing infection.
This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP.
Now it is important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible throughout the country to protect people who are infected with HIV and that it will help us get a step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society.'
Living the big life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this little Earls Court apartment into a generous home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, reduced in 2014 from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment.
It is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags.
"Before that, I lived in a much larger room with my ex in Knightsbridge," says Joanne.
"I was looking for something comparable to my price.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and she had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and made an offer that day."
Since the first visit the 1,000 square foot large apartment has been completely overtaken.
Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Joanne storage room and an intermediate floor to make optimal use of the generous ceiling height.
"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.
That was my requirement," she says.
To this end, she commissioned the architecture and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12.5 foot high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development, but also a place to live for Joanne.
The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms above each other, so the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate floor where one could stand.
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the prelude.
"The steelworks are quite complicated," he explains.
"We had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked over each other without having to bend.
It was not just a question of building a simple platform, but of putting on the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below."
This arrangement allowed Erfan to place two rooms in full height above each other - with a lot of additional drama.
For the intermediate floor, a classic copper light window by Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area.
Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.
At both ends a short corridor is mirrored to make it work longer.
In the kitchen the reflection feels like a window into another room.
At the entrance, mirrored units offer space for all hoops and glasses of Joanne.
By perceiving a more glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used.
Foldable kitchens are nothing new.
The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.
"A bit of engineering went in there," explains Erfan of the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF door.
"It's counterweighted, so when you move the door up, it slides very easily."
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne was able to gain additional 16 m2, an additional bedroom and an improved layout.
"At the end of the day, you will sell the property - or as your property is estimated," says Erfan.
"In a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the size of the ground."
Here they have managed to enlarge the floor area while using high-quality materials that provide the space with its luxurious advantage.
"The materials are the things you touch and therefore help create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan.
"You don't fall in love with the electrical sockets in the walls.
These are important, but they don't play with your heart."
It shows that an apartment can turn into something quite amazing by means of a good design and an increased number of square meters from something standard to something.
In fact, like Joanne, you might decide not to leave.
Brothers fight for a $500 million real estate empire
Two brothers, four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, find themselves in a conflict over one of Victoria’s biggest real estate empires worth over 500 million dollars.
The former director of the 'Carlton Football Club' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, only three doors away from his younger brother Paul. He has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business assets should be divided.
Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014, but a sharp discussion about the separation takes place in the Supreme Court.
Together with her mother Anna, the brothers owned 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, accumulated since the family bought a shop on Smith Street, Collingwood, in 1973.
There the Westco Jeans family founded and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores.
It was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars.
This money was invested in real estate, and De Lutis' portfolio now includes offices in the city center, Brunswick and Sorrento development areas, Gold Coast and Mt Buller apartments, as well as suburban shopping centers.
According to an agreement with her late father, Colin - described by Paul as "the main operator and the dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - has about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul has about a third.
A court act states that this means that Colin owns property worth 316 million dollars and Paul worth 176 million dollars.
The division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.
"The divisions proposed by Colin left him with what I thought was the best objects," he wrote in a first affidavit in 2015.
The first hearing of the Supreme Court took place last Friday after several failed conciliations.
Now the brothers are also fighting for control of the existing business - of which Colin, as Paul claims, excluded him.
Colin argues that this is not true, but accuses Paul of incompetently managing some possessions.
In an early affidavit filed by Colin, he says he hopes to resolve the dispute.
"My Italian heritage dictates that the family is the most important priority," he wrote.
The costs increase in the case, with hundreds of pages with affidavits, emails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and law firms held by both sides.
Ms. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated dairy bars and delicacy shops from the late 1950s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They used the security to buy the Collingwood property where Colin opened the family's first denim shop.
Colin says that he started Westco there when he was "in my last years high school when Paul was still a small child (about 10 years old).
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to hand over their property to their sons.
"Luigi often told me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis Group, whereby Colin claims that Mark was paid 10 million dollars when he left the company and Luke 26 million dollars.
Both Luke and Mark, Paul says "become bitter about the conditions of their financial separation."
Colin held back very much, although he was a former AFL board member and after a 2015 biography by Eddie McGuire, the best friend of the TV star.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.
Only Colin replied by texting to say "I really can't say much" because the case is in front of the courts.
"It's very, very sad that my brother Paul decided to sue me and drag our family name through the courts," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote to the court that he had tried to meet his brother's demands.
"Our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end up in our current dispute," he said, adding that he "always hopes for a solution."
On Friday this hope seemed to be over.
"Our matter will be resolved by the courts in the near future," wrote Colin.
Trump's new Chief of Staff plans to restrict the President's media abstinence.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.
If so, he'll be the first.
Politico reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to limit the flow of information to President Trump, including news media reports, in the hope of keeping the boss on a more uniform course.
Here's a piece by reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When John F. Kelly, the new chief of staff of the White House, met with executives on his first working day, he represented a major problem in President Donald Trump's White House, which he wanted to repair: bad information that got into the President's hands.
Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he received good information."
Kelly's diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.
President Trump's relationship with television goes back decades - and now that he's in the White House, his television advertising is still strong.
"If candidate Trump was annoyed about unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received a fair report from posts that were to be convinced," former election counsellor Sam Nunberg told Politico in February.
Politicalos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keeping Trump's Twitter habit under control, according to six former election officers, is to ensure that his personal media use includes a steady praise price."
Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit was ever "under control" is ridiculous.
Maybe these campaign officials know something we don't know about others - that Trump's Tweets would have contained even more ignition without their interventions.
We'll probably never know anything about the tweets Trump didn't send.
If his employees have already managed to keep him away from anger a few times, then their efforts have been worthwhile.
But no one has consistently prevented Trump from causing controversy.
Part of the problem is that people in a White House, composed of competing parties, are constantly trying to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that may promote their views of the world.
Politico - all concerned with this story - reported in May on the preference of consultants to provide the president with dubious information for strategic reasons.
This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
"Current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react to negative press cuts like a volcano, especially those with damaging leaks, and that he is hard at finding out where they came from.
That's exactly what happened at the end of February when someone maliciously gave the President a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, who accused Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being "the source behind a pile of leaks" in the White House.
Although Johnson was permanently banished from Twitter because of shock or that he did not offer any concrete evidence or that he had expressed false accusations in the past and revoked them.
Trump read the article and began to question employees about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that the then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary General of the White House, Rob Porter, "trying to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork that Trump receives".
How did that work out?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later.
Perhaps he will prove himself as a more effective manager as a Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his consultants are still striving for influence.
These unchangeable factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Most-seeked criminals get mail from Europol
Since the address is unknown, the help of the population is requested and hoped for.
The police all over Europe are sending (virtual) postcards this summer to dangerous criminals on the run.
Since the addresses of the serious criminals sought are naturally unknown, clues from the population are hoped for and requested.
Europol reported on Friday the action that follows the "EU Most Wanted" adventure calendar of winter.
Experiences have shown that many refugees are hiding in holiday destinations, it was said by Europol.
21 postcards were compiled for seeking criminals from 21 EU countries.
Since 2016, the website www.eumostwanted has been viewed more than 2.5 million times.
36 of the online petitions have been arrested so far, at least eleven of which have been made available on the website following the publication.
Travelers negotiate a trench and return to the 'Millionary Series'
Some of the most wealthy homeowners of the West Midlands are standing again with some determined travelers on the foot of war who have negotiated a tomb drawn by the community to claim a field in front of their mansions.
The travelers have parked their 20 caravans on a field outside a wealthy street of Solihull, called the "Millionary Series".
They brought with them horses, babies and an army of transporters after they were only thrown out in May, but were not deterred by a grave excavated by the Council to prevent their invasions.
The tactful group found a gap in the defenses and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained unhindered to find a way.
Angry residents have urged the Council of Solihull to say that "it is useless to deal with the problem".
An anonymous resident said, "They moved there on Monday night after they were sent on by Bentley Heath, where they threw stones at the passersby.
The Council must be forced into action by shame, as it was useless in dealing with the problem.
The travelers were there in May, were moved on and are now back.
More arrived last night, probably even more today."
She added: "The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by giving long teachings to protect its parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I'm not happy to continue paying my municipal tax if the Council can't even stop it."
A resident who didn't want to be mentioned said, "It's ridiculous, we just saw the last round of these travellers just to be plundered by another round.
The numbers have increased this time and one has even seen a horse in the park area."
A spokesperson from the Solihull Council said: "We are aware of an unauthorized camp in the country beyond Streetsbrook Road and are working with the Solihulls Police. We take the necessary legal steps so that they can continue as soon as possible.
In order to support our collection of evidence, it is very important that as many residents as possible report anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.
This helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must examine when we present our case."
From Birkenhof becomes Waldhotel Luise
The former Hotel Birkenhof will be the Waldhotel Luise.
The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadts is currently being renovated and will be reopened on March 1st next year.
That's good news for the city.
Because with the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by the then Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH on 13 April 2014, about 30,000 overnight stays per year were lost and also revenue from the tourist tax.
In the autumn of 2014, in view of the dramatic increase in the number of refugees who came to the district, the hotel building was offered to the Landratsamt as a collective accommodation, causing controversial discussions.
The city prevented asylum seekers from being accommodated by the establishment of a plan to secure the area as a hotel location.
The decision was not undisputed in the municipal council at the time.
But especially Freudenstadt's mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious interests at the house at that time.
He should be right.
The group Luisenhotels with Managing Director Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three-star Plus category under the name Waldhotelhotel Luise.
The group has four houses with the Joyful City object.
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.
Your name is Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotelhotel Luise.
The former Hotel Birkenhof has been in front of the entrance for some time now, and when you enter the house, it becomes clear what extensive renovation work is being done.
The floors were torn out, some ceilings were mined, some old baths were removed from the rooms.
The entire hotel building is a single construction site.
There's still a lot to do until March.
"It's actually a nice hotel," Thomas Scherer says in conversation with our newspaper.
Everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style.
The rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area is remodelled, new windows are installed.
Everything should become "beautiful" later, as Thomas Scherer expresses himself.
"We want to make a jewel out of it."
Swimming pool, wellness area and a meeting room are provided.
You don't want to position yourself at the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad, but already on an elevated downtown level, Scherer emphasizes.
The Waldhotel Luise with its about 60 rooms wants to stand wide, Scherer further explains.
Both individual holidaymakers, groups or businessmen should feel comfortable in the hotel.
He has already had talks with OB Julian Osswald and tourism director Michael Krause, says Scherer.
The city's ideas were similar to those of the hotel group.
"We're on the same line."
Thomas Scherer does not want to determine exactly the level of investment.
Less than a million euros, he reckons.
The outdoor systems are also brought to the fore, which is already clearly visible.
A large terrace will be created in an inner courtyard, which will be accessible from the restaurant that is public.
Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freudenstadt is a good market".
Russia-Affaire: US Special Agents employ Grand Jury
In Russia's affair with US President Donald Trump, special investigator Robert Mueller is said to have used a so-called Grand Jury after a report.
The committee had taken up the work in recent weeks, wrote the "Wall Street Journal" calling on familiar people.
The newspaper considered the step to be a sign that Mueller had expanded and intensified his investigations.
The station CNN reported that there were already first invitations from the panel in connection with a meeting between Trump's eldest son and a Russian lawyer.
US secret services have long accused the Kremlin of specifically interfering in the 2016 presidential election campaign.
Mueller investigates whether there was agreement between Trump's campaign team and Moscow.
The focus of the investigations is on several men who acted as the Republican's adviser in the election campaign.
Mueller reportedly also viewed more and more Trump's private and business environment.
The "Washington Post" wrote a few weeks ago that the special investigator Trump had personally put into focus and examined the accusation that the president might have hindered justice in the course of the affair.
Grand Jury's main task is to examine current evidence in possible criminal cases and decide whether to file charges.
Grand Jurys are therefore also called indictment chambers.
They are usually turned on when these are major and controversial cases.
The procedure always takes place behind closed doors.
The panel may also be activated by the Public Prosecutor's Office to invite persons to the hearing under oath.
According to the station CNN, invitations have already been issued that revolve around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.
Those involved in the meeting were asked to make a statement, the report said.
They should also provide documents.
In addition to Trump Jr., Trump's advisor and son-in-law Jared Kushner and his then Chief of Election Paul Manafort were at the meeting.
Legal experts said on Thursday evening in the U.S. TV that the deployment shows that Mueller does not let himself be intimidated in his work and that, if necessary, he wants to act quickly.
However, it should not necessarily be said that the Grand Jury will be turned on in the end to decide on the charges.
Nevertheless, the establishment of the panel is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for concern for President Trump.
In the midst of the new revelations, the president used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to present the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents.
"Russia's history is a complete invention," Trump said.
The theme gives democrats a way to "feel good because they have nothing else they can talk about".
In an opinion, his special adviser Ty Cobb said that he knew nothing about setting up a Grand Jury.
But he also used to work in secret, he stressed.
The White House endorses any measures that have accelerated the work of the Special Enquiry in a "fair" way.
Former FBI chief James Comey said three times that the president is not being determined.
There was no reason to believe that something had changed, it continued in the statement.
Mueller was only used after Trump camey fired.
Because of this noise, accusations against Trump had become loud that he wanted to hinder justice.
Comey announced in June before a Senate Committee that Trump had asked him to stop investigations against the then national security adviser Michael Flynn.
The President is under great pressure because of the investigation.
According to the presentation of US media, the White House collected material against the special investigator and his employees.
This triggered speculation about whether Trump Mueller wanted to release.
Unlike an independent special mediator of Congress, such as in the Watergate affair around later retired President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired by the Ministry of Justice at the insistence of the President.
However, several senators from both parties want to prevent such a step.
Two groups of Republican and democratic senators presented draft laws on Thursday, according to which the special investigator could not be released as easily.
Antarctica: Giant iceberg is driving in Antarctica
In the West Antarctic, a gigantic iceberg has been dissolved from the Schelfeis by the nearly sevenfold size of Berlin.
This was announced by the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.
The colossal, over a trillion tons heavy and 5800 square kilometers large, is now driving north and will probably take two or three years until it is melted.
With 175 kilometers in length and a width of up to 50 kilometers, it is one of the largest ice giants that researchers have registered over the past three decades.
A danger to humans does not come from him.
According to researchers, the extent to which climate change has played a role in breaking down the iceberg is unclear.
Overall, however, there has been a series of unusual collapses of ice smelting in the region for about 30 years, writes the US Research Center for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) in a factual background.
According to many researchers, this could be related to global warming.
The colossus that was now broken was a part of the Larsen-C shell.
Shellfish swims on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.
As a result, it grows ever further into the sea and breaks down regularly.
The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula.
To the north of this shell, the balance of waxes and breakdowns was disturbed a few years ago.
A complete shellfish has fallen apart there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.
It is worth noting that the Larsen-C shell is also in danger, because the front edge has never withdrawn as far as it is at present.
In addition, the ice plate is under tension and disintegrated if a piece breaks off at a key point.
The melting of Schelfeis and Eisberg does not increase the sea level, as they swim on the water and dissipate ice as much water as it results after the melting itself.
However, the loss of the crag leads the glaciers directly to the sea and can flow off much faster than before.
This could possibly increase sea levels, but only to a small extent, writes the British research project on Antarctica's observation (Midas).
According to AWI data, the Larsen-C shellfish is the fourth largest shellfish in Antarctica, with almost 50 000 square kilometres.
At the crossing from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters.
There it breaks off regularly.
"Although it is a natural event and we are not aware of any direct connection to climate change, the ice shield is now coming into a more dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary of the British Swansea University.
"This is the widest withdrawal since the beginning of the records," he also confirmed.
Among scientists, it is controversial whether the Larsen-C-Schelfeis will grow again or go down in the long term and possibly collapse, said his colleague Adrian Luckman, adding: "Our models say it will be less stable."
But this development will last for decades.
Although these researchers do not trace the demolition of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, in recent decades there have been a great many icesheds in the Antarctic Peninsula.
This long tip of Antarctica extends towards South America.
According to the British Antarctic Survey research programme, the ice area of the Antarctic Peninsula has decreased by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s.
The rise in temperature has contributed to the decline.
In the past 50 years, the Antarctic peninsula has warmed by about three degrees, counting among the areas where the temperature is the fastest.
CDU wants house rate for staff
Because it is becoming increasingly difficult to fill jobs, the CDU calls for retirement from the employers' association in order to become more attractive.
Only shortly before the summer break did the circuit day gain 41 new jobs in the administration.
More than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in Mettmann.
Now another 17 trainees have their first working day behind them.
The schools in the circle are apparently very much sought after.
Around 620 applications were registered for the places to be awarded this year.
Nevertheless, the circle still lacks staff to cope with the increased requirements and tasks.
At present, there are still 50 unoccupied jobs at the Mettmann County.
Doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration are sought.
The CDU now wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG in the district day and face up to the shortage of skilled workers in the administration.
At the request of the parties, the management is to "form a concept for recruitment and personnel development".
The aim is not only to meet short-term needs for skilled workers but also to counter the shortage of candidates in the future.
The overall approach should focus on the inside and outside, show concrete measures for cross-border beginners and include a training offensive, call for CDU, FDP and UWG.
That sounds like a good approach.
Because the circle has to do with personnel problems that were not known in the past.
Other cities recruit good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.
The talk is about a real "competition of public employers".
In addition, there is a high number of employees who leave the service due to illness or old age.
It is therefore high time to act, so that no more jobs remain unoccupied.
But Klaus-Dieter Völker, Head of Group of the CDU, goes beyond the joint request with his party.
He recently caused a shady surprise in the district day when he publicly questioned the personnel cost cover and surprised the other parties.
Peoples want to review all the possibilities that allow for retirement from the local employers' association.
"If we do not reach a satisfactory solution here in the short term, the district administration with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the county cities - should seek a house tariff," says peoples.
In this way, the CDU is trying to pay employees and officials better than the collective regulation actually provides for the public service.
The salaries are currently exactly prescribed, increases or more money are only available if you switch to a higher level, which is oriented towards career years.
But the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years.
Only a few weeks ago, new rooms had to be set up in which employees took care of the provisions of the new prostitute protection law.
Not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers, Landrat Thomas Hendele and Regional Director Martin Richter have a problem: they have too few staff.
Italy is intensifying the tone of NGOs-migrant rescue boats
Italy has warned NGOs using lifeboats for migrants in the Mediterranean that they must not continue if they do not comply with new rules for their operations.
"If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue to work," said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa.
Minnitis Warning came a day after the Italian authorities seized a boat from the German aid organization 'Youth Rescuet' because their team had effectively cooperated with human dealers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.
The aid organisation, which has only been in operation for a year, refused to comment on detailed accusations made by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us, the salvation of human life is and remains our top priority. So we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," said the organization in a statement on social media.
"We can only judge any accusations that are currently being made after we have collected all the information and can assess the situation."
The Italian authorities had monitored the boat of 'Youth Rescuet', the Iuventa, since October.
It is suspected that his crew will take on board shell migrants who will be delivered to them directly from traffickers, and that the smugglers will be able to leave so that the ships can be used again.
At least one such meeting was said to have taken place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the file of the prosecutor, whose content was published by Italian media.
The crew is suspected of overcoming the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not any other motives.
Under the Code of Conduct, boats such as the Iuventa must have, above all, an Italian police officer on board who monitors their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to adhere to the code: Save the Children, MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary but acceptable, as they would not entail "essential changes or disabilities" of their rescue actions.
Among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel Prize winner organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Minniti has said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue measures has fallen sharply in recent weeks, indicating that efforts to strengthen the Libyan Coast Guard and to cooperate with the local mayors have been bearing fruit.
"In the last few days, we have started to see light at the end of the tunnel," said the Minister.
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
Rises and Trials
Neun Weilermer Biker, the "Berliner Exterior Posten" and two guest riders met in Wachenheim in the Nordpfalz to enjoy trials and sights for four days.
Three friendly guides were available for this.
The accommodation in the Wachenheimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.
The Burg- und Weinfest of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.
The first tour led to the Michael chapel above Deidesheim at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards.
There followed viewpoints, partly on towers, from which one could see far over the Palatinate forest and the upstream plains.
In between, there were always longer increases for which long trials were rewarded.
On the second day we went to Bad Dürkheim to Saline and Volksfest Wurstmarkt.
Once again, the vantage point was at the vantage point, connected by "flowy" trials and moderate climbs.
In the last two days, there were again many altimeters.
Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and refuges brought welcome breaks.
In Bad Dürkheim, the bikers in the outdoor inhalatory inhaled a healing brine.
Neustadt was also controlled.
After 173 kilometers and almost 4,500 metres of altitude, the group had met the Palatinate Forest from its best side - sporty and cultural.
Console instead of lawn - Bundesliga is equipped for e-sport
Are the sports stars sitting in front of computer consoles in the future, instead of sweating through the wind and weather over the stadium grass?
The fact is: E-sport has long become a serious industry, a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gagens included.
This has also been recognised by the first Bundesliga associations that are increasingly engaged in this field.
The VfL Wolfsburg started in 2015, later the FC Schalke 04 and finally the VfB Stuttgart, who founded an e-sport department in mid-July and signed two pros for the FIFA 17 computer game.
"We hope to inspire very new young target groups for the VfB," says Managing Director Jochen Röttgermann.
He's sure, "that there are still several clubs on this train."
The next weekend, the FIFA World Football Association in London will organise the first "Interactive Club World Cup", in which the players of different clubs compete against each other.
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain and PSV Eindhoven have qualified.
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in the e-sport.
The ex-trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players.
"The real football has to deal in particular with the 14-30-year-olds, that the young people are still going to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old.
And: The clubs tried to conquer all kinds of markets, especially the Asian ones.
With prominent e-sporters under contract, you could be on-line on these markets more often than just once a year to send the Bundesliga team to Asia.
What exactly is it about?
Computer games such as "League Of Legends", "Dota 2, "Counterstrike" or the football simulation FIFA are challenged at the competition level.
For a long time, as in normal sports, leagues have established themselves in which the professionals compete against each other.
And at the 2022 Asia Games, E-sport is already part of the official program.
But is it a real sport at all?
For many, the idea must be used to.
Ingo Froböse has also dealt with the question for a long time.
For the professor at the German Sport University in Cologne, e-sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that can also be found in classic sports - for example, increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.
It also needs cognitive skills, technical and tactical understanding and rapid response.
Professional gamers should not only train at the console, but also train their bodies and take care of the diet.
"The fit player is a good player."
Froböse also sees problems: "Doping is becoming more and more a topic".
Controls were difficult to carry out in online games, and the scene lacked the structures of classical sports.
The scientist emphasizes the high integrative effect of the e-sport.
Players are on the move internationally, which is like a large global family, there are no intercultural barriers.
A study by Deloitte and the Association of Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts rapid growth to the e-sport.
In 2016, 50 million euros were implemented in Germany, mainly through advertising, sponsoring and large tournaments.
In three years' time, turnover is expected to be 130 million.
This is little against the nearly 2.4 billion euros of the football league.
However, the E-sport "is no longer far from the other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey," the Deloitte consultants write.
Many countries are already on the international stage.
Big markets are Asia and the USA, where ex basketball players Shaquille O`Neal and baseball star Alex Rodriguez participate in the US team NRG eSports.

There is also a lot to be done in Europe.
In a Norwegian school, e-sport had been introduced as a teaching subject, says Froböse.
According to Dutt, football leagues in the Netherlands and France are now obliged to set up an e-sport department.
"In the European comparison, Germany is lagging behind," explains VfB board member Röttgermann.
Only to fall into nostalgia, and to explain the old times, is not enough today.
The aim is to preserve the tradition of the association, but at the same time to align the company with the modern market.
"We live in a digitalized world," Dutt says.
"You can't hold on to the fact that only football has everything the way it has always been."
Poison egg ade - The egg alternatives for cooking and baking
In the meantime, almost all the federal states have been affected by the scandal of toxic eggs.
Aldi Süd and Aldi Nord have responded and have taken all the eggs out of the sale throughout Germany.
Only eggs that do not have fipronil are to be taken into the shelves.
Michelle Carter condemns for the texts that make Conrad Roy commit suicide.
A Massachusetts woman was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend by texts and calls to suicide.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of her sentence behind bars and five years have been put on trial.
Carter was sentenced in June for negligent killing by Conrad Roy, who took his life on 13 July 2014.
Roy's father said at the hearing on Thursday, "My family is inconsolable.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was allowed to remain free until his appointment.
She had been confronted with a maximum penalty of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr. Roy suffered from a mental illness.
Dressed in red pants and a creamy blouse, Carter stood with tears in her eyes, with folded hands and eyes pointing downward when she was sentenced.
"Her actions killed Conrad Roy," said the prosecutor to the court.
"She ended his life to make her own better.
She didn't take on any responsibility," she said.
"She didn't repent."
But Carter's lawyer said it's a "worse circumstance" she totally regrets.
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz said that he had not found out that her "age or maturity or even her mental illness has a significant impact on her actions".
A prosecutor read a statement by Roy's mother, Lynn Roy, saying that there is "no day in which I do not grieve the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything. I try to be there for his sisters, despite all my pain that we will carry with us for eternity," it says.
Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, said that she was "tended" by the realization that she would never take part in her brother's wedding or be an aunt for his children.
"No longer to have this only person with whom I have been together every day since I was born is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life," she said.
The case seems to set a legal precedent, since there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.
The case attracted national attention after Carter's text messages revealed that she had encouraged him to end his life.
"Get up, jump from a building, get yourself first, I don't know, there are many ways," she said in several news she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family.
In the moments before his suicide, she wrote: "You must do it, Conrad" and "All you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy."
Judge Moniz said Carter was looking for attention through Roy's death and ordered her to benefit from the case through any press.
The case has shared the legal opinion.
Among the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was sentenced to murder for her British roommate in Italy in 2007 before she was acquitted two years ago.
Ms. Knox, 30 years old, published a comment in the Los Angeles Times: "Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not prison."
Joshua Kimmich: Learning from the new mini-lam of FC Bayern
The fact that Joshua Kimmich was allowed to run for the Audi Cup as a captain is not a coincidence.
FC Bayern trusts the Confed Cup winner a big season - extra motivation does not harm.
Something else was there in his place in the cabin, Joshua Kimmich saw that immediately, even though the extra garment was very, very small.
But since no Philipp Lahm and no Manuel Newer were to be seen on the second day of the Audi Cup, far and wide, he made the tie to his arm.
"The coach didn't announce it," said the Confed Cup winner afterwards, after his first engagement as Bayern captain.
Well, the stand could have been better than the 0:2 against the SSC Naples.
But the sign of the coach could also help Kimmich.
Not the eight-year-old Arturo Vidal had been chosen as the leader of youth players, debuters and just out of vacation professionals, but rather he.
Sugar is best distributed to those to whom you trust a lot that you want to keep in touch.
So those who have been chosen to enter the legacy of lameness can only use a small extra motivation well.
Kimmich confirmed: "This is what you want as a player: take responsibility".
On Wednesday, the 22-year-old flashed over the field as a mini-lam.
Back right, that's his position, the white tie on her arm did her rest.
And even in this initial formation, Kimmich acted like the one who can best take the rowing in his hand.
He gave instructions, tried to guide the unincorporated force.
He had the look for the whole while many others were busy with themselves.
Vidal overplaying his lack of fitness (nothing); Renato Sanche's putting on devils come out of the performance of the Asian journey (not to mention only conditionally); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle with not to notice negatively in their first appearance in the Bayern jersey.
After all, it worked very well.
Süle ran alongside Kimmich, Rudy before the defense, both acting sovereignly.
The well-occupied Napoli storm was often difficult, and Süle also tried to build up a few times.
His colleague Rudy admitted that the result was "not the way we hoped".
But he also showed a good performance during the debut.
Game shift, tempo change: "For this style I was also brought."
How unusual this Bayern world is for the new additions was seen following the game.
Rudy, for example, did not give one or two in the catacombs, but determined six or seven interviews.
Kimmich said goodbye to a few cracky statements in the back of his new fellow players.
There he heard of Süle an interesting sentence: "What goes on here, I have already noticed.
At Bavaria you just have to win every game".
After all, he doesn't have to teach the new one anymore.
Alaba Motivating Public Health Women
David Alaba believes in the success of our public health women
Austria's best-known football player just before the game via Twitter has reported himself and wished the public ladies all the best.
The Bayern-Legionary is essentially clubmate of ÖFB captain Schnaderbeck and fevert with our ladies.
The tweet of the Austrian football player of the year and champion league winners should be a special motivation syringe.
The famous Bayern dusel might well need our ladies.
Company satisfied with Rhineland-Palatinate Minister: Economy praises Wissings Tempo
It was often irreconcilable, the relationship between the country and the regional economy, when Eveline Lemke (Green) was still an economic minister of Rhineland-Palatinate.
This is evident after more than a year when the new Minister of Economic Affairs Volker Wissing (FDP) is in office.
Chambers and companies from the region speak of a change in economic policy on TV demand - and at the same time blame the old minister.
Frank Natus, Chairman of the Association of Trier companies (VTU), says: "Wissing takes up the wishes of the economy that Lemke has all blocked."
The biggest turnaround is seen by Natus in infrastructure policy: the gap between Kelberg and Adenau between motorway 1 is now at the top of the country's priority list.
This year, the Ministry is still hoping for a plan determination procedure, until 2021, the construction law is to stand.
A role in the country's plans is also played by the West bypass of Trier, which is in the urgent need of the Federal Road Plan.
The aim is to put the route into operation in December 2020, says Minister-General Cornelia Holtmann.
Natus sees it as a signpost to support regional but internationally competing companies.
The Chamber of Industry and Commerce (IHK) Trier, as suggested by Wissing, is seeking a Rhineland-Palatinate label for wine to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine exports that have been dropping for ten years.
Wissing also has an open ear for people who want to start their own company, praises the IHK.
The Chamber of Crafts Trier sees an additional incentive for young trainees in the new Master Bonus, says Managing Director Matthias Schwalbach.
A premium of 1000 euros is foreseen for the existing master's degree and 2500 euros if graduates become self-employed within ten years of the master's training.
But the homework list for the country remains long.
In the planned road construction, facts can be created quickly, while the country lacks the necessary personnel, says Jan Glockauer, Chief Executive Officer of the IHK Trier.
Of 56 new engineers who want to recruit Wissing at the country's business mobility, only 29 jobs have been employed.
The IHK calls for more orders to external offices.
To this end, CDU Group Vice Christian Baldauf refers to calculations by the Court of Auditors that the country invests in 2017 and 2018 more than EUR 20 million less in the receipt of national roads than proposed.
Frank Natus also expects a concept of the country to address the shortage of skilled workers in the region.
It is also sobering to see the extent of broadband expansion in the country.
In 2016, regional companies assessed the network supply in an IHK survey only with the grade 3.4.
They complain about staggering Internet connections and interruptions.
Former Minister of Economic Affairs Eveline Lemke, on the other hand, is currently out of politics and is still on the Supervisory Board of the wind power company Pro Wind.
The Green Group left Lemke in April to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe - where after four months she already cleared up the field because of disagreements.
Audi is supposed to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter-reaction
One day before the announcement of Audi, BMW said it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW Chairman said that the company believes that "there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions", and thus referred to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is located - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the undertakings as a recall.
European car manufacturers have strongly promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules on carbon dioxide emissions.
But the nitrogen oxides that emit diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The costs for car manufacturers to install equipment to neutralise the exhaust gases emitted by diesel vehicles are also increasing, which makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
The German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of indicting the powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem.
The companies are trying to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen that could regulate the use of so-called power-off devices to comply with the requirements when a car has been tested but goes back under normal driving conditions.
In the United States, several Volkswagen employees have been charged, others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be brought to justice in the United States.
At the beginning of this year, Audi was involved in German criminal investigations in Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to circumvent emissions regulations in Europe, and a request focused on the United States was extended.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could be difficult for Volkswagen: The luxury car manufacturer contributes disproportionately to the profit of Volkswagen.
This message has the raft on Saturday on the Isar
The city wants to protect the Isar.
In order for the Isar visitors to participate, a raft passes through Munich on tomorrow Saturday, which has a special message.
If it draws to the Isar again on Saturday, a large raft will be seen there between Flaucher and Reichenbachbrücke.
And that's not a normal raft, with Isar tourists.
But the building department wants to clarify.
On the raft you can see a large info-transparent.
It shows a garbage mountain.
The launch of a public campaign to appeal to the Isar visitors.
With the motto "True Love is..." the understanding of the Isar is to sharpen as a protective wild river.
Last summer the raft crossed the Isar and this year there are other actions and measures to achieve a considerate and environmentally conscious behaviour.
Mordillo's nostrils and laughing against suffering
Mordillo was sometimes one of the most common cartoon drawings, the tubular noses of his figures are his trademark.
At 85, the Argentinean still draws and works on a film.
His message: laughing, "because there is too much suffering in the world".
Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.
In the first years as an artist, he was among other things involved in drawing for congratulation cards - which frustrated him.
"The happiest day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job," he once said.
After stations in Lima, New York and Paris, he succeeded in the breakthrough at the end of the 1960s: with the publication of his cartoons in "Paris Match" and then also in the "Star" and other leading magazines around the world.
Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.
Again and again, the artist of cities was inspired.
Large, round Mordillo figures tumble in drawings with the Slate Tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow.
In the early morning, according to his own information, he still sits at the drawing table today, working almost ten hours a day.
About calendars, puzzles, books for big and small, t-shirts, plush animals and watches, his drowsy figures continue to be widely distributed worldwide.
For six years he has also been working on a cartoon film and a TV series with his figures.
The main character in the film "Crazy Island" is a giraffe - Mordillo's most popular animal in his drawings - that has a thousand feet as an opponent.
For the first time, his figures speak in the 3D film, which will be on the screen in 2019.
"I don't know exactly what they're going to say, it's weird for me," says Mordillo.
The script is not written by him.
That's why he rather relies on the TV series, which, like his original drawings, is produced wordless.
Lavender from Provence Threatened by Climate Change
It has become a symbol of Provence in Southern France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change.
The lavender is declining due to the conditions that are reminiscent of drought and disease-borne insects, which causes great headaches for scientists and farmers who are trying to find solutions.
Eric Chaisse, expert at the CRIEM agricultural research institute in Provence, said: "The lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because in recent years the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change, which has brought much less rain in spring and much more in autumn.
This affects the life of lavender.
There is also a small cicada, a microbacterium that transmits dwarf cicadas, and in very dry weather there are a lot of them."
And there's a lot at stake.
Lavender oil not only attracts holidaymakers, it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: "Instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.
So we have fewer parts with essential oil."
The solutions considered include better water distribution and slowing evaporation from the soil, but also spraying the plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to drought.
The town of Geisa in the Thuringian Rhön celebrates its 1200th anniversary this year.
This Saturday and Sunday is a highlight with a medieval festival.
Kramer, Zünfte, Handels, Vagants or a Landsknecht camp are to be experienced in the city centre on these days.
The murder of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico
The staff of the weekly Riodoke usually meet on Wednesdays to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa through organized crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars.
But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.
They were told that it was important to change their routines.
Two high-ranking journalists discuss what feels safer: They should take their children to the office, which in 2009 were the goal of an attack with grenades, or leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on a board on the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.
You ask the reporters to suggest names for each column - no evidence is necessary, perceptions and abdominal feelings are sufficient.
There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of being on the payroll of the government or cartel, a catalog of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.
There is no rest period of violence, and while the bodies are piled up throughout the country, more and more journalists are in there: at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012. 589 are under federal protection after attacks and threats and until now there have been at least seven deaths in seven states this year.
Among the latter are her editor and her initiator of Riodote, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs.
His lack becomes profound, although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez, showing his middle finger with the word "Justice", hangs on the facade of the Riodote building. Two reporters in the 1930s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panama hat.
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared topics, the trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor's office was established in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists, according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists, it has only initiated two criminal proceedings.
As with most thousands of murders associated with drug trafficking and organised crime each year, journalists are rarely brought to justice.
At Riodoke they still insist on dealing with the violence of Sinaloa, although they are inconsolable and although the terrain is now even more treacherous.
Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security has little benefit, says Ibarra.
"It's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.
"As long as we don't know why, we all distrust."
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoke in the state capital of Culiacan.
He only managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. He was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot at him, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated "Twelfth River".
The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left a woman and two adult children.
Rumors tend to fly freely around Culiacan.
But on Valdez there is virtually nothing but silence.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and the extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa had become one of the bloodiest battlefields in the country, as rival factions are fighting here to fill the vacuum.
It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa someone or several people are shot every day on the street or that the cemetery is full of decorated, two-storey mouse oils for drug kings who are bigger than many houses for the living.
Forget for a minute that there is a state of "rest" if only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug traffic routes to the United States.
Nevertheless, and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, was blamed for not being able to protect his friend.
He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.
First, in February, there was the release of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel groups in the war with Guzman's sons.
This publication may have offended the sons, suspected gang members bought up each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper skioske.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own security after the seizure of another newspaper that had published the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.
He had survived for so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there.
He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003, when he joined with five colleagues to establish Riodoke and sold 50 US dollars.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to operate journalism without encountering the intoxication problem," Bojorquez said.
Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.
Reporters loved to be able to publish hard-moving investigations without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to treat.
Eight years after the founding of Riodote, she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot Prize" for her coverage in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in persecuting Mexican drug history, wherever it went.
He voluntarily admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to live on," he said at the time of the CPJ award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa "is a way of life," he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento TV.
"You have to take over the task that falls to you as a journalist - either that or you play the fools.
I don't want to be asked, "What did you do in the face of so many dead people ... why didn't you say what was going on?"
The Riodoke team misses Valdez, the fun bird who could curse like a harbour worker, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted in his routine.
He would always wear his hat.
He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and sit there at the same table.
Now they ask: Was his love for the routine his ruin?
His death has also forced her to question her own assumptions about how best to do her work and stay alive.
"You don't like it when you deal with their wives, their children, their clean businesses, their secret runways" to move drugs.
"These things were not allowed," Bojorquez said.
The result, even in the best times, is a high level of self-censorship and self-reservation.
Trust his own instincts.
If it smells wrong, stay away from it.
The trouble is, said the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal, that "smells a sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing happened to Javier."
The old rules, as he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa - just as they do in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where there is a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials at home.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where Riodoke's staff met for security training, suddenly no mobile phones were allowed. Days before, it was known that Spyware, sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two policemen sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.
They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoke in a four-storey building in a middle-class quarter of Culiacan.
Half in joke, some of the reporters wondered if these officers were among the 50 percent of the police who the governor himself called unreliable.
It has been months since the reporters went to the mountain landscape, where the drug gangs are de facto under control.
For this week's edition, Riodoke has looked at three main stories.
There was the murder of the brother of former known boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had an exposé to the government expenditure that focused on the governor's hometown.
And there was a group that carried out a kidnapping in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the prosecutor's office.
There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was given when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite place of drug dealers and authorities.
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which dominated almost the entire century all political levels.
Recently, several PRI governors have been accused of high-ranking cases of corruption.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this locality, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped military robbery.
Just a few months earlier, readers had considered the column of Valdez to be the best informed source of kidnapping.
"Before we knew what had happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El Flaco" because of its slim body stature.
"Now all channels of communication with our sources are broken."
Valdez's office has been encircled as a storage room for signs and stickers protesting the murders of journalists, because the employees have become something they themselves would never have expected: activists on behalf of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few signs and went to a demonstration the next morning because of another journalist to the prosecutor's office.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed, in the western state of Michoacan.
A burned body has been discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is his.
Throughout the country, journalists have become louder by writing down "SOS Press" on walkways and buildings in organized protests.
On that day, director Bojorquez is gone in Washington and tries to collect international support for justice in the Valdez case.
At a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa the day after the murder of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying out journalists and killing them because they said the truth.
She has since asked for the government to reunite her because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were "absorbed" by organised crime, government officials involved in it, and an indifferent society.
In his last book "Narco Journalism", he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs, but also on orders from politicians and security forces who were under a blanket with organised crime.
Last year, the media watch group "Articulo 19" allocated more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials.
"In Mexico you die because they want you to shut up," Ramirez said.
Obviously, the murders have a deterrent effect.
Nobody forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
Her body was found along with a note supposedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "Here I am because of my reports."
A computer keyboard and headphones were located next to her separated head.
Some branches have chosen to close down as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the murder of correspondent Miroslava Break in March.
Others continue as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the murder of her director in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez addressed the drug cartel with an editorial on the front page with the title "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their homelands or even fled the country.
It's a painful decision.
It's hard to find work in exile, and they're still watching the streets and looking for dangers.
And sometimes they are hunted as apparently the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered three months after the flight from Veracruz in 2015, along with four women in an apartment in Mexico City.
For those who stay behind and continue to work, it is a daily dance with risky decisions.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that the drug trade scares him.
"Mexico is going to hell, and that's why I became a reporter," he said.
At midnight last Friday, when the last issue was already finished, the editors of Riodoke sat on the sidewalk in front of the office and drank beer when all of a sudden all her phones began to sum up.
A number of shootings with gang rivals and security forces near the seaside resort of Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.
The war continued to escalate as promised by a number of cartel messages in the region.
From the borderstone edge they have published the news on the website of Riodoke on mobile phone.
The title page had to be changed the next day.
Siren crying up nearby - another shooting in the area.
Bojorquez looked at the police who kept the guard to see if they were ready.
If they were afraid at all, they wouldn't show it.
Under the huge portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible to all Sinaloa, Riodoke's employees followed his footsteps.
"How can you even think of closing down," Bojorquez said, "if the same day Javier was murdered, the intern asked me to send her to the street to report."
Dinosaurs used cover to avoid his enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, though a terrifying one.
Researchers have now found out that the first findings of the incredible rhinoceros of a Canadian miner were so well preserved that experts described it as "Mona Lisa the Dinosaur".
It was so well preserved that they could even find that his obscene skin was of reddish brown - and they said she had had something of a "disquiet past".
The report in the journal "Current Biology" described him as "the best preserved armored dinosaur ever found, and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world".
The fossil is a newly discovered species of nodosaurs that lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
His incredibly well-preserved condition has astounded researchers who describe it as "real remarkable"
According to reports in National Geographic, the armored plant eater is the best preserved fossil of its kind.
It was found by Shawn Funk when he dug at the Suncor Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada on March 21, 2011.
He met something that seemed to be missing from the surrounding rock on the square, and decided to look more closely.
The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
They spent the next six years exposing the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) of heavy earth clumps.
After all this hard work, the final result is now ready to be revealed.
"If you only blink a little with your eyes, you could almost believe it slept," said Chief Author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature can be seen.
"It will go into science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs."
Researchers have found that this plant eater, although covered with armor and similar to a changing tank, was likely threatened by meat-eating dinosaurs.
The heavily armored dinosaur used a red and white cover to hide from predatory animals, and used a shielding technique known as countershadowing, which is also used by many modern animals.
This would have allowed it to mix better into its environment and avoid its enemies, say experts, indicating that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million-year-old creature from the Nodosaur family made headlines for the first time in May and can now be seen at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Borealopelta marketmitchelli after museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team who spent more than 7,000 hours discovering it carefully.
The amazing preservation of the specimen made it possible for Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and armors about his body.
They discovered the counter-shadowing, a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom, meaning that the tip of the creature was darker than its underside.
Although the counter-shadowing is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds the size of the animals living today.
It suggests that the dinosaur was hunted by enough pressure from meat-eating dinosaurs that evolution favoured the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival.
But most of the contemporary animals that use counter-shadowing - think of deer, zebras or belts - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey, which signals that this nodosaurs was exposed to a real struggle for survival.
"Strong predator behavior on a massive, heavily armored dinosaur shows how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the Cretaceous Age must have been," said Brown.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was reddish brown.
Scientists continue to examine the animal for clues about its life, including its preserved intestinal contents, to find out what it ate as its last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, got into a river and was driven out into the sea, where he sank on his back to the bottom of the sea.
At that time Alberta was as warm as South Florida today, and rivers and oceans probably spread much further inland than they are today.
"This nodosaurs is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved scaly skin, but is also preserved in three dimensions and retains the original shape of the animal," said Brown.
"The result is that today the animal looks almost the same as in the early Cretaceous.
You don't need to use a lot of imagination to reconstruct it. If you're just looking with your eyes, you might almost believe he's asleep."
The Cretaceous period was a time when huge theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs, standing on two legs, traversed the earth.
Although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his terrifying ancestors.
This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38-foot (11.5 m) long, six-tonne monster.
The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta was sunk in the sea after death and mummified in the mud.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he dug at the Suncor Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada on March 21, 2011.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, and is complete from the snout to the hip.
On average, the creatures were about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
It contained two 20-inch-long tips that ran off his shoulders.
The researchers believe that the armored plant eater was flooded by western Canada until a flooded river flowed into the open sea.
But the underwater funeral of the dinosaur preserved his armor in exquisite detail.
The stoned remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the skin remains still cover hollow tank plates along the dinosaur
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is as rare as a profit in the lottery.
The more I look at it, the more confusing it becomes.
Stoned remains of the skin still cover the hollow tank plates that carry the skull of the animal.
His right forefoot is on his side, his five fingers are spread upward.
I can count the sheds on his sole.
In the thunderstorm: Mass Carambolage on A8: Many injured
Violent accident on Thursday evening on the A8: Almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass carbot situation.
There are numerous injured, kilometre-long traffic jams and Gaffer.
On the Stuttgart-Munich motorway (A8) about 20 people were injured in a mass carambolage on the late Thursday afternoon.
According to the police, around 5 p.m. between the Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen connecting stations (Landkreis Aichach-Friedberg) nearly 30 vehicles were interconnected during a thunderstorm, including probably trucks.
No data were available on the exact number of injured persons at first.
It was minor to moderate injuries, said a police spokesperson.
A great offer of rescue vehicles was at the accident site.
The A8 was completely blocked in the direction of Munich.
In the direction of travel to Munich a ten-kilometre-long setback was formed.
As reported by an AZ reporter, there have also been massive disabilities on the counter-carriage - through numerous Gaffer.
The fire brigade listed the license marks of the vehicle drivers, who now have to expect sensitive punishments.
Shortly after 18:45, a second accident occurred on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dashing.
There was a collision between a car transporter and a car.
A rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site.
Deutsche Bahn: Group tests "Comfort Check-in"
It is a moment that almost everyone has ever experienced: nothing surprising you sit on the train and sleep.
Or one is deeply involved in his work and just has a brilliant thought.
And then: pufff.
Comes the joiner and wakes an unpleasant or tears the passenger out of the workflow.
Ticket control.
But the times of interruptions are soon over.
The Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the unscrupulous ticket control.
You simply confirm by mobile that you take your place and devaluate the ticket.
A test operation is currently running on two routes.
"When the offer arrives, let's expand it.
It is expected to be available on many other long-distance routes in Germany at the beginning of next year," said a railway speaker.
"Comfort Check-in" calls the train the ticket devaluation without a joiner.
However, in order to be able to use them, some conditions must be met: You need a smartphone or a tablet.
And you must have booked an online ticket - what most passengers already do anyway.
It must also be purchased via the train app, the DB Navigator, which is anyway the most convenient way of booking tickets.
And last but not least, you need a seat reservation.
Because the "Comfort Check-in" works like this: You get on the train, call your ticket under "My Tickets".
The test customers then appear a button for electronic devaluation.
On their mobile devices, train attendants receive a message that passenger X is on the train and has taken the booked seat Y.
When the train driver arrives at Y, he knows that there is a passenger with an online ticket that has already been devalued.
So you can go to sleep, continue working, keep quiet.
The "check-in" has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which in turn should use the passengers.
"If you want to travel through our train crew without ticket control, simply check in the DB Navigator yourself.
This enables passengers to make their travel time more personal on the train," says Michael Peterson, marketing director of DB Fernweger.
Second plus: "And our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs."
Those who often drive railways know that, in addition to delays and missed trains, ticket controls are among the biggest troubles.
Because often you do not have all the documents you need to devaluate online tickets, but in any case one of your fellow travellers.
Either the credit card or the identity card is missing or otherwise a document you have to show.
The result is endless discussions between train attendant and passenger, which leads to poor mood in the compartment or large space and delays in controlling your own ticket and takes the creative person at the end of the time to take care of other concerns.
Only a small number of test customers can still use the new service.
And this also on the ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen connections.
Further train numbers on the same route are not yet activated.
How did an activist come to learn the answer to the question, "Whose Streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to her core.
Just one day after she arrived in New York City, she was born in St. Louis on the bed of an Airbnb apartment, which she rented and rolled through Facebook on her phone.
She stumbled over a post from someone in high school.
"The police just killed an 18-year-old child, and it's still on the street," it said.
Confused as nobody else had posted the information on her feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the handle @TeePharoah was constantly retweeted on their timeline.
The rapper from the area of St. Louis was about to tweet live the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old who was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body that was stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours.
"That's wild," Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new to them and their community.
She put off her cell phone to return to Tweets later in the evening about people on the Canfield drive.
There were photos of the police band and people screaming, and of a man who claimed to be Brown's father wearing a sign with the inscription: "Ferguson's police just killed my unarmed son!"
She observed a live feed in which a police officer stood in front of a group of demonstrators with a calling dog.
In another video, she said, another police officer disarmed his gun and shouted, "I'll kill you... animals all."
"That's not usual," Ferrell recalled her statement.
"That's not the kind of murder we used to and we can call typical."
At that moment, I felt shaking.
I was angry and crying."
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 23:00, she picked up her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the next morning the two would go to Ferguson.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in the following three years is the theme of a new documentary, "Whose Streets?", in the cinemas from 11th to 11th.
It is a story of survival and protest, of love and loss, of strength and of resistance, which consists of people living in the community who have filled the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell went to Ferguson with her daughter, who was wearing a flower dress and a matching crown, the two discussed a conversation that she had “on the black experience and the black state” countless times before this morning.
"You remember how I taught you when black people must fight for what they believe in?" she remembered what she said.
"We're going to Ferguson now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right.
I couldn't take her with me," Ferrell later said.
"What has happened today is a highlight of what has happened in the past.
She needs to know and see it and be brought up in it.
It must be well developed, not only activism and organization, but also know the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we must do to become free to free ourselves.
Even if I am lucky to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience blatant racism, she is no different from the next black woman child.
I feel like I'm doing a bad job to keep her away from it."
The first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was located on the South florist Road, a place opposite the police department that became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non-indictment of Officer Darren Wilson.
There Ferrell and her daughter joined a local business owner who had lunch.
They prepared bags and helped pass them on to demonstrators.
Slowly a new kind of activism began to take shape for Ferrell.
"My activism changed completely after 9 August," she said, noting that as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was president of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on eating justice and health inequalities in black communities.
"I had no experience in organizing.
Everything has come."
Weeks later, Ferrell met with Sabah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the film during an evening demonstration.
Folayan said that she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar only wanted to "document" what happened.
A question came to Ferrell's mind: "Do you want to document or try to find a story that you can exploit?"
This skepticism was fed by countless cases of people, often by whites - in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance.
As Folayan recently said in an interview, "We had heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson did not center their voices and we wanted to do it differently."
Folayan had already worked with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the field, who is known for his activism around death contract inmates.
His commitment brought Ferrell closer to the project, together with six other locals the team of "Whose Streets?" followed in the years following Brown's shooting.
"This documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us. We talk," said Davis.
"That was the main thing for me, how these people are represented, because that's how I'll be represented."
The goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - to show that the movement "is not a Messiah guide, but a community that comes together," said Folayan - she proved to be the most open participant in the film.
As a result, documents from "Whose Streets?" show surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life, how she falls in love and marries her wife.
"I felt like naked," said Ferrell, laughing when she saw the finished product for the first time.
"But I understood that there must be a certain vulnerability in this work and in the humanization of black people."
In addition, Ferrell's story repeats the role of black gay women in the wider Black Lives-Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement, who, after the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, have influenced the film "BlacklivesMatter" in social media, identify themselves as gay.
"Black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement as a whole," said Ferrell, "and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fronts.
Black gay women have to carry the main load of everything."
Folayan agreed to notice that "the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women".
However, it insists that "this is not a affirmative type of action", in which Ferrell was selected as the heart of the film because of her identity.
"She was the person that shook up this energy," she said.
"It is no coincidence, although she was at the forefront, because in a life at these intersections as a black, gay woman so much is at stake.
You can feel their energy through the screen."
Meanwhile, the news cameras in Ferguson have long disappeared, but the racial connections between the community and the police continue to exist.
Ferrell is on parole for 21⁄2 years because of the blocking of a highway at a demonstration.
She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area, which she calls her home: "A chaos".
Nevertheless, she clings to a song and feels obliged to this memory since she left Ferguson three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose - except our chains."
From "Dream" to "Größenwanch": TV readers discuss bit gallery
The bit gallery moves people, although it has not yet been built.
But since the first presentation in 2009, the idea of a shopping centre at the south end of the pedestrian zone divides the population into supporters and opponents.
Cold hardly leaves the subject one.
The topic will also be discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg".
While some say to the bit gallery: "That would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be really great" (Nicle Schasten), comes from the other side: "Do not brag man" (Siggi Betzen) or quite simply: "Größenwanch!" (Lars Scholz).
While the supporters are building on the fact that a gallery attracts more customers to the city, which also benefits the rest of the shops, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will then bleed out.
In addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the land on which the Farmers Market Hall is located, where 13 direct marketers offer their products.
This will end with the start of construction work.
The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to the Beda Square with possibility to sit outside.
Simone Zimmer: "For many years we have been buying almost weekly at the Farmers' Market Hall.
Mostly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the country women always very much liked.
We also discovered the butchery for ourselves.
We would wish that even during and above all after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer.
In other cities there is also that.
Especially the Kleinmarkthalle in Frankfurt is interesting."
Gerd Densing: "Whether direct marketers settle in a market hall in the gallery, the rent is up to date.
But it is probably not exactly low on the new project."
Eva Kilic: "Why shopping palaces in Bitburg?
Whether clothing, shoes, drugstores or supermarkets: I find it superfluous.
That's enough in our city.
You can see how many shops here are empty - some for months and years.
But since there is not even a proper weekly market here, it is all the more important that we keep at least the market hall.
After all, the goods offered there are fresh, are mostly offered directly by the producer and are also inexpensive.
As you can see, shops in a shopping center are rented only by larger companies, because the rents there are often not portable for a retailer.
Too bad, there's almost no more specialist shops and what's left of them will probably disappear."
Wolf Fandel: "A shopping centre with a market hall does not fit for me.
And the gallery doesn't fit into Bitburg.
Above all: Where should the Farmers' Market Hall go during the construction period?
The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long run, if the bit gallery actually comes at some point.
Or does the ghost Bit-Gallery manage to sell all the business from Bitburg before?"
George Marquet: "This just won't work.
And no one needs a shopping center that is empty.
In my opinion, it would have been better to promote a real market for farmers instead of this gallery.
But for a farmer's market hall, thanks to the insanity of many - as I think - senseless construction projects in Bitburg are no longer a place.
When the farmer market hall is destroyed, a piece of culture will disappear again."
A matching similarity: Artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning's DNA
In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York there are many faces - white, black and brown, almost insignificantly alike - that hang on cables from the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from cheekdopers and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth Prison, where the former intelligence analyst paid a 35-year sentence after making classified diplomatic reports on WikiLeaks' website public.
The new exhibition, which was opened on August 2, is called A Becoming Resemblance.
It is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline combined her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a trans-wife and groundbreaking dissident, whose conviction was converted by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office.
Dewey-Hagborg, through the algorithmic analysis of the DNA extracted by Manning and created from which 30 portraits were created, how someone could look with these genomic data, has created a sharp, though some intellectual comment not only on the formality of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also on identity.
Manning, who was born Bradley Edward, but has already talked openly since her puberty about the identification as a woman, was sentenced in 2013 for 20 charges, including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft.
Through the prison her image was suppressed, so much so that there was only one photo - a grainy, black and white selfie, in which Manninging was clearly unwell sitting on a driver's seat and wearing a platinum wig - with which she was associated.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg just came from the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.
In it the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigarette stumps and chewing gum by extracting the DNA from the waste to get a picture of what these people might look like.
That was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.
"They conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted some kind of portrait to accompany this article," said Dewey-Hagborg at a press preview of the new exhibition.
And she couldn't visit at that time and she couldn't be photographed, so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned muse became uneven friends of letters, who exchanged several letters over the course of two years.
They even created a comic "Suppressed Images" illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which foresaw a future in which President Chelsea's judgment would be transformed and she could see the exhibition personally.
That Obama would indeed demand Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas only a few days after the book was published was a welcome kind of happy meeting.
There is something deep and strong now at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump is leading a war against informers from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new, tweetable ways to further ignite the rigid divisions he was supposed to fix.
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said that "things happen for a certain reason."
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning called for an end to the "automatic fragmentation, the basis of which was sex, race, sexuality and culture" with its oversized signature (the "i" in her family name is given a heart).
On the opposite wall is their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousand foot of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show by the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotides after the artist's highly developed scientific lexicon) how amazingly similar, at least in biological terms, we are all.
"What people will hopefully take away from it is that our genome does not care about who we are and how openly genetic data are for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose 2007 video work, Spurious Memories, can also be seen.
"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so these are 30 of them."
The last piece in the exhibition, which is stored in a separate room, is a page from the comic novel mentioned above.
She shows Manning how she appears in the hands of the United States' disciplinarians like King-Kong with a hands-free phone.
"If they cool your speech, they won," it says.
"So never shut up."
"It came directly from a letter she wrote to me," said the artist who greeted from Philadelphia.
"I still get geese skin when I talk about it."
Manning has not yet personally seen the exhibition - as it was predicted in the comic book - but if she should do it, then in the middle of the room she will be welcomed by the masks, by her own genomic simulations, which gather together like hordes of protesters.
This was also targeted, like everything in the exhibition, up to the size (5 "2, Manning's stature), in which their genetic haplogroups were written with pencil.
"In the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," said Dewey-Hagborg of the portraits.
"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement formed with Chelsea, like the movement that was also behind her liberation."
Professor of the University of Northwestern and an employee of Oxford University for killing sought
A national human hunt is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee of Oxford University who is being sought as a suspect after a man was stabbed in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with fatal injuries.
On Monday, for Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) arrest warrants were issued for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, as the files of the Cook County court show.
The documents say that Cornell Duranleau, 26, died after several stitches.
A community warning system published by the Chicago Police Department states that the body was discovered on July 27.
Officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body.
Cornell-Duranleau was still declared dead at the place of the event, and detectives were investigating the stings as murder, while the police were actively looking for the two suspects, officials said.
Since 2007, Lathem has been an extraordinary professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University.
Alan K. Cubbage, Vice President of University Relations, said in an e-mail statement that Lathem was now on leave and excluded from entering the campus of Northwestern University.
"This is now a criminal matter investigated by the competent authorities, and Northwestern University cooperates in this investigation," said Cubbage.
Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University.
A spokesperson from the University and Somerville College said in an e-mail statement that "we are in contact with the police in Great Britain and are ready to help the US investigating authorities in any way possible."
The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted him to stand up.
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department, Anthony Guglielmi, said he urged the suspects to present themselves to the authorities.
"The police have an idea of their whereabouts, and our efforts to localize them are intensifying," said Guglielmi.
Guglielmi said that local, regional and national authorities are helping to find the suspects.
Guglielmi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Place building who had just received a mysterious tip that said something had happened in apartment 1008.
The police described the scene as very cruel.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident had taken place on 27 July.
It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," said Guglielmi.
Grand Plaza's management team published a statement to the residents: "The police are currently working on the timeline and the victim's background and are exploring a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident."
"We will complete the WADA Roadmap in the near future" - the Russian Vice Prime Minister Mutko
Russian Vice Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it would not take long for the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) to be implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti-doping agency (RUSADA).
"At a certain stage of meeting the timetable criteria, RUSADA has been given the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).
The WADA Roadmap was updated in this respect," said Mutko on Thursday.
The PM commented on the second part of the WADA roadmap for compliance with the code, which describes the criteria for the re-establishment of RUSADA and was recently published on the organisation's website.
According to Mutko, he does not contain anything that could cause Russia to be concerned.
"Everything has been announced, everything will be implemented.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the WADA in the near future," he added.
However, one of the criteria set out in the list notes that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the investigation approved by the WADA by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren on alleged state-funded dopings in Russian sport.
Regarding the matter, Mutko said: "We carry out the investigation as our anti-doping system has made a mistake.
All measures have been implemented.
But there were no government programs, and we won't admit something that doesn't exist."
Mutko's words were consistent with those of Vitaly Smirnov, head of the independent Russian anti-doping commission.
In conversation with the Russian sales office RSport at the beginning of the day, Smirnov added problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organisations, but then added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one intends to accept this report unconditionally," added Smirnov.
In November 2015, RUSADA was excluded from carrying out doping controls in Russia in the course of the doping scandal of WADA.
However, she was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping (UKAD).
After a visit by the Headquarters of the Organization in Moscow in July, WADA General Director Olivier Niggli stated that RUSADA is moving "in the right direction" to be re-established.
Aldi doesn't sell eggs anymore
This was reported to the business groups.
It is a purely precautionary measure that no health impact can be assumed further, said the Communication.
From now on, only eggs should be delivered to Aldi, which have been shown to have been tested negatively for fipronil-containing anti-lubricating agents.
Thus, Aldi wants to create clarity and transparency among its customers.
The startups that will help your company not to become the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure the happiness of your e-commerce start-up with your employees, but the surveys did not work.
Answers were often vague, little helpful or - even worse - fraudulent.
And even if you promised anonymity, some workers did not trust the process.
"There was simply never consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who operates the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce Hair Care Society Madison Reed.
She called people from the outside for help.
A new race of Human Resources start-ups is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel.
By developing and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring the employee commitment, it allows companies to conduct surveys, to address specific groups and demographic groups, to provide employees with anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases to enable whistleblowers to bypass the C-Suite executives and to contact the Board of Directors directly.
"You now have tools such as Strava and Fitbit for tracking their health, but where is the fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Errett said that she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint.
In addition to the snap surveys and surveys of certain teams, it offers a heat card of the company that at a glance shows which units have most complaints and which executives have low consent results - so you can drill why.
Companies are coming to see that at the top of the workplace culture must remain so that you do not become the next Uber involved in scandals, since a former employee has published a blog post describing an environment of harassment in which those who have spoken were punished.
For start-ups like Glint, this desire for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity.
The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could have more than $118.7 billion in 2020, according to the financial website Let's Talk Payments.
Denver, Colorado, start-up converter, which helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity in miscredit at the beginning of this year in the middle of the Uber case.
Conversion has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently registered as a client.
Like Glint, Convercent lets companies send customized "Puls" surveys, collect confidential answers in real time, and view the heat maps of your problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior.
And if the Chief Executive is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.
"The court of public opinion has captured the regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and managing director of Convercent.
When a company is found that treats its employees badly or behaves unethically, it can experience costly consequences through consumer boycott, workers' flood and complaints, said Quinlan.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 locations, has used Converten for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have an easy way of reaching their headquarters.
Earlier, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a telephone number or email for the headquarters, file a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously.
It was often an intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesday's General Counsel, who said there was no good way to follow the complaints of employees.
Now, as the company employs Conversion, problems previously hidden by executives sitting in offices in cities or states can be identified and addressed more quickly, such as discrimination, harassment or unfair practices.
"I can get closer to this holistic 360-degree view in the experience of employment," said Vitrano, who heads Ruby Director's Risk Management Group.
"And we protect our shareholders from employment disputes."
Companies began to take ethics, values and employee commitment more seriously in 2002 after the accounting company Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations by the Enron scandal, said Quinlan.
But it took time for the "social media to get right" that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry from going online.
"Before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Conversion offer your software as a service, and burden companies with recurring fees for the use of their products.
It is a business model and a chance that finds the consent of venture capital investors who have supported both start-ups.
Convert received $10 million in financing in February from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising the total capital to $47 million.
Glitzern secured $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners and brought its total financing to $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising, given the networked nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
There is a growing complex of research that shows that today's employees expect more of their jobs than before.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only bets.
The employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you are giving your time to a company with a positive mission.
"If people are happy to be in a business feeling that their voices are heard, and that the work you are doing is worth it, then they feel more committed to making this company successful," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, who uses both Conversion and Glint.
Investors reach returns when their portfolio companies run well. Companies run well when employees are involved and engaged.
If the analytics tools third parties promise to increase commitment and the use of employees, it is no wonder that you will find support.
The data on employee commitment according to the experts of the workplace culture is important.
But the data is useless if the managers of a company do not take any action.
In fact, when a company asks employees for your feedback, it may be expected that change is on the way.
And if change does not come quickly enough, or not at all, this can breed disappointments and discourage employees.
"If you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you must be ready to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the business management company Kotter International, who has seen companies that have relied too much on collecting data.
"For if you don't follow, employees will ask themselves, "Did you really hear me?
Do you take care of it?
And whoever you don't care about, why should I?"
Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly employee surveys, was able to take action on the same day when a problem is reported on Glint, says Ersave.
And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees, it was through the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, able to reorganise several teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems.
At Ruby Tuesday, the company is always getting new insights about the employees, and it hopes that in the long run, this will lead to a better bonding of employees in a sector known for high sales.
"If you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people," said Vitrano.
"And if you lose people, you also lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you will lose companies.
The NCAA removes the two-day practices and makes a long day for the Bruins
It goes on at 23 o'clock when a lot of UCLA football players are talking on one side of the team's new field of practice on campus.
Some have removed their jersey tops and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp.
For a good part of the team, these inactive minutes are a lunch break.
Players who are enrolled in the summer courses will return to their final exams after the three-hour exercise before returning to the Wasserman Football Center at 6:30 the next morning.
"This is a real treadmill for the boys for the next three days," said Bruins trainer Jim Mora shortly before Monday became Tuesday.
The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to facilitate the burden of players, and it has actually extended its days - at least until the finale on Friday.
Therefore, the first three training sessions of the UCLA should begin at 19:15 to meet the player's already packed schedules.
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day on which the Bruins postponed the start of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Moras performed six games in Westwood practical exercises.
They are scheduled to hold 18 exercises during August. 20 before the start of the formal game preparations for their launch against Texas A & M in September.
Mora said he supported the NCAA's change of rules, even if he added another point to the player's busy routes.
"We put this enormous burden on them for three or four days, and it's very challenging," said Mora.
"And they've just pushed it through, they're gonna get stuck, they're great people.
I think as soon as we arrive to Saturday and we have more time, it will be really great."
The UCLA will end its practices as soon as the camp has ended, which will not be an easy task in view of the clear lines of its fields from a adjacent parking lot and the adjoining Luskin Center, a hotel of the elevated class that has already been thrown with football, which cleared a network of protection behind a gate post.
Bruins players should occupy the hotel this weekend, but Mora admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season.
"We'll put our safety in place," said Mora.
"That's a real problem, and it's not far from coming to think people rent a room there and then set themselves up there to record an exercise.
If you have the video tape of an exercise, it's a pretty good business.
But we have security forces there, and we have security forces on parking lot 8.
We'll do the best with what we have.
I'm not worried too much about that.
We have a plan."
Facebook wants to intensify fact review in the fight against fake messages
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false reports to third party fact reviewers and then display their results under the original article, said the world’s largest online social network on Thursday. It’s one of its efforts to fight fake news.
The company said in an opinion on its website that it will start using updated machine learning methods to identify possible false reports and to send them to fact reviewers who may display the results of the fact-finding from the original article.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news, many of which believe that they have also influenced the US presidential elections in 2016.
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe, with the French voters flooded with false stories in the run-up to the presidential elections in May, and Germany supports a plan to punish social media networks if they fail to quickly eliminate hateful postings as before the elections there in September.
On Thursday, in a separate German declaration, Facebook said that a test of the new fact review was underway in the USA, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to knowing what stories are being challenged by third party fact reviewers, people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share," said Sara Su, product manager for Facebook messages in a blog.
She added that Facebook will continue testing its feature on the "related article" and working on other changes to its message feed to reduce false messages.
Creating a Comic Roman: A Castle in the History of England
In his recent past, the little Scotey Castle was shown in a Squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cozy seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent and has now become an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mossy Yorkshireman who loves historical documents.
"I think it's so nice to look at the handwriting of someone who's been dead for 300 years," he laments.
"What a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand."
'A Castle in England' covers the period from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scotney. Each story was illustrated by another emerging British artist - Isaac Lengiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It is not the first book of Rhodes based on an archive: He wrote 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found unexpectedly emotional.
"I only responded to the thumb print on the side of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700s who worked for the Jacobinians," he says.
"This is his thumbprint!
And letters always smell of smoke, because at that time a fire was lit because of the light.
For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect, as if it were itself.
Oh, I love archives!"
For someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle for almost four months ("To be honest: I overrated my welcome greeting a little") all this seems too nice to be true.
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, looking through the archives and studying the many treasures and curiousities of the castle, such as the mounted hyena heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the trench.
He walked through the site and the ruins of the old castle and talked to landscapers, gardeners and sometimes to the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.
Then, at night, he drank "whiskey and started writing".
The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown, since the National Trust only received full access in 2006 when the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employees began to take care of the archive he described as "Hund of years in which Aristocrats said "Oh, throw it on the attic".
Diaries, letters from the time of the English Empire, maps that represent who had what: "You might think that land conflicts would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a birch to fight for the two families.
Boys, let everything go!"
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immerse themselves in English history on a broader basis, including 'The Labourer', who follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381.
"There is a record of a riot that occurred in the castle in 1380, in this book entitled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex'," says Rhodes.
"The peasant uprising started in this area and I thought a revolt was a good start.
Maybe they're connected to each other?"
Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like 'The Priest', which tells the story of the Jesuit Father, whom the Darrell family hid during the English Reformation for seven years.
Or 'The Smuggler', in which the smuggler Arthur Darrell from the 18th century is represented, who staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery made only years later when his coffin was dug).
The Darrells are Rhodes' Loved Family of Scotney: "The gentlemen seemed to be pretty yawns, always making debts and spending money on things they couldn't afford.
Other generations of Darrell men solved their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of good-looking boys, with a talent to advertise."
After the end of his work in the castle Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences
He has brought a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elämänmäki, the grounds of a sanatorium from the early 20th century, which has since been reclaimed by nature.
But Scotney has a special place for him.
"I was sad to go again," he says.
It was like, "Oh, now I have to deal with the damn life again."
Campaign started: Over 300 years old Marienkapelle covered in Rhöndorf
With the cover of the 301-year-old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf, the city of Bad Honnef started its campaign on Friday for the introduction of a new roof brand (roundshow of Thursday).
Until Thursday, Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and slogan secret.
At the end of August, there will be a festival on the island of Grafenwerth as the highlight of the campaign.
"Too nice for us.
Or?", the makers of the action asked since yesterday on the posters on the Rhöndorf chapel.
"We don't really think that (of course!)," they write on their online website yesterday.
"But we use this measure to win your attention.
And to make it clear that some things are better than it seems.
Basically, we are firmly convinced that we as Bad Honnefer citizens know very well about the beauty and attractiveness of our city."
The action is about more than "only" a logo and a slogan, it goes on to say.
"It is important to make a single promise, one that gives the city an unmistakable unique character."
Finally, it competes with other municipalities.
The city of Bad Honnef can cost a medium five-digit sum of its new roof brand and campaign.
Military Reforms in Turkey - Erdogans Fear of the Army
Every year at the beginning of August, in Ankara, the Supreme Military Council (YAS) advises on retirements and promotions in the officer corps.
So is this week.
At first glance a normal process.
But nothing is routine among the Turkish forces a year after the coup attempt.
The meeting was no longer held in the General Staff building, as it used to be, but in the Prime Minister's office.
The five Vice-Presidents and the Ministers for Defence, Home Affairs, Justice and Foreign Affairs took part in the deliberations under the chairmanship of the Head of Government.
So the civilians in the YAS were overnumbered.
The government attracts the reins in the military.
Chief of Staff Hulsi Akar remains in office, but the commanders of the army, the Air Force and the Navy were transferred.
Since the failed coup, Chief of State Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals.
More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of the exile preacher Fethullah Gülen, who sees Erdogan as the wiredriver of the coup attempt.
486 people who are supposed to have been directly involved in the coup attempt are being negotiated in Ankara since this week.
The day after the coup, Erdogan had called the attempt to overthrow "God's gift" because he gave him the opportunity to "clean fully" the forces.
But does Erdogan really control the army?
At the end of February, the newspaper "Hürriyet" published an article entitled "Unrest in the Military Headquarters".
In the general staff there were concerns about an increasing "Islamization" of the army, which manifested itself, among other things, in the lifting of the headcloth ban for soldiers, the newspaper wrote.
The great cleansing of the army and the security forces goes on anyway.
In mid-July, Erdogan had another 7395 state servants fired by decree, including 2303 police officers and 546 soldiers.
It seemed as if Erdogan had tamed the military.
The generals were considered earlier than the actual masters of the country.
Three times they relied on their role as guardians of the secular state order.
After his 2002 election, Erdogan pushed back the power of the military step by step, not least with reference to the European Union's reform targets.
Former officers say that Erdogan is specifically driving the Islamisation of the armed forces.
In the magazine "Vocal Europe", an unnamed officer who sought asylum for the coup attempt for fear of persecution abroad warned that the Turkish army would be "full of extremists and Salafists" in a few years.
If that happens, NATO could not leave such a development cold.
In any case, there is doubt in the alliance after the cleanings about the readiness of the Turkish army to use it.
The management structures and operational capabilities are "weak", say NATO diplomats.
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
There will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card, said President Donald Trump, quoted by the media.
It provides for a reduction of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stricter rules for obtaining visas for temporary work permits and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the President.
The draft law is to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, increase wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers and will do so by changing the way the US will spend green cards on citizens from other countries."
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system.
This new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English, who have the financial resources to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy," said Trump, quoted by the American media.
Ministry wants to renovate route for racing platform shuttle
Over and over the past few months, there has always been a dispute about the future of the race runway shuttle - now it should go very quickly.
Before the end of the year, the route on which the tourist train runs will be built.
According to the Ministry of Transport, construction work on the route is to begin this year in order to ensure the long-term future of the race path shuttle.
"With the decision to continue ordering and renovating the Ilmenau-Rennsteig route, the country is committed to this particularly important connection for tourism," said Transport State Secretary Klaus Sühl on Friday in Erfurt.
The cost of repairing the route amounted to about 2.5 million euros.
Of this sum, the country accounts for 75 percent.
The contract, on the basis of which the shuttle is to be ordered by the country in the future, is currently being finalized, said Sühl.
The Ministry and Südthüringen Bahn as an operator have already agreed on the technical details.
"This means that the timetable, the vehicles used and the quality standards are negotiated," said Sühl.
The planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be concluded for a period of eleven years.
This meant that the racing platform shuttle was to be ordered regularly on December 2017.
The Rennsteig shuttle is a popular railway link between the Ilmenau and Rennsteig railway stations, especially among tourists.
In the past few months, a pilot operation has tested whether the route is used by a sufficient number of people to order it again regularly in the future.
In addition, the route is heavily depleted in parts.
The rise of sex robots is real, and we should worry
Just when you thought it couldn't get any more crazy in 2017, a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots comes.
Yes, indeed.
Sex robots are a big thing right now.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharkey, emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we must start taking their rise seriously.
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernail.
"People make fun of them, but companies deliver a lot of them, and we will see them much more often," said Mr. Sharky when he published his new report.
Modern sex dolls have developed from their inflatable partners into robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence.
The user can also "adjust" his robot according to his beliefs and choose everything, from the robot's eye color to the shape of the breasts, to the type or color of his fingernails.
But it becomes even more disturbing, as many robots have the "personalities" that would make a Stepford woman look progressive.
Modern sex dolls have developed into robots with a silicone skin.
For example, the RealBotix robot allows its users to adapt their robots to the characteristics they find appealing, such as shyness.
And then there are the Roxxxy Gold sex robots developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities like "Frigid Farrah", which conveys the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventure" personality.
"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as best you can," the True Companion website is admiring.
So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.
She also has her moods throughout the day - quite like real people!
It can be tired, fixed on conversation, or it can be "in mood"!"
There are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robors - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sublime female traits, the allusions to rape, when you take a step on Frigid (named here: reluctant) Farrah, concern you the most.
On his website True Companion Roxxx compared Roxxy to a vibrator, but for men.
"If women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can't men have Roxxxy?" it says on the website.
However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just a different sex toy.
Their emergence and increasing refinement point to something darker and deeper in our culture, a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition.
Most men will not, of course, keep sex robots, and while the FRR notes their increasing popularity, they remain at the brink of consumer culture for the time being.
But what is soaked out of the periphery can be very instructive with regard to the spirit of the time in which we live.
And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market gives them permission to do so.
There is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots appear at a time when the rights of women worldwide are threatened, in which there is a president in the White House who has boasted of having sexually attacked women.
The most dissuasive aspect of the television series 'The Handmaid's Tale' ('The Report of the Virgin') is not the graphic images, the engulfed bodies and the outcast eyes, but how realistic this vision works.
The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap.
The goal behind these sex robors is to make a physical resemblance to actual women as realistic as possible (although with pornstar proportions).
Their builders want them to feel human that they imitate the movement of a real body.
But, when it comes to their "personalities", the robots do not represent real women.
You can't separate from your companion or just leave.
They have no mediation or background history, nothing that indicates independence or anything that could disrupt the imagination of total submission.
In other words, they are pleasant slaves.
Or to express it in the 2017 speech: servant girl
Trump's great performance?
He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of common sense
It has become a bond wisdom of the Trump era that the political divisions that have polarized the US electorate have also split families in small format.
Around Christmas and Christmas there were newspapers in the United States with advice on how to deal with Trump’s horror of electing relatives.
We're all supposed to be trying to burst our filter bubbles.
The power of Trump to bring families together has been less noted.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-wing poet who lives in Chicago and has been working with the Republicans in our family for a long time, visited me in New York this week.
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican kinship with which she had fought for decades because of politics, is suddenly and strangely on the same side.
This is certainly a good thing about the dining table, but I notice in a further context that this also poses considerable risks.
The left has been strengthened by Trump, but the appalling effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.
When we talk about "normalization" and Trump, we refer to the creepy possibility that one day his mutilations will no longer repel us.
There is, however, an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump "normalizes" the Republican of the right wing, which suddenly appears to be the epitome of reasonableness compared to his standards.
Today I find myself infested by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's original version of the crazed - the dog on the car roof, which is 14% income tax (but at least we knew what his tax statement looked like) - both of which actually occur as a very mild crime compared to Trump.
If Trump goes, the next Republican candidate only needs to be spiritually healthy in order to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.
When my cousin was in town, we took our children to the carousel in Central Park, the largest carousel in the New York Park Department, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need a caffeine.
The horses are enormously large, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are spicy and the animals twist to look over their own shoulders with fear - extremely dark and the climbing music conveys this in a strange way.
So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of tall buildings become old, the skylines become too familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city does not satisfy the dream.
Thirty-five years later, and I am still not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss cottage - the theme Pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage does not count - but a large roundabout in the north of London.
However, the Central Park Carousel is still a strange magical experience, as two two-year-olds, one 11-year-old and two women in the 40s can go on it and all have a great time.
If I could have rated the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately no one asked.
On the other hand, this week in a department store I was forced to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card.
In the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same, plus the option to balance the rating with a 15% tip - this to buy something over the shop table.
This not only slows down what should actually be a neutral exchange, but also puts pressure on the server to put personality into a situation where none is necessary.
The poor woman in the department store was apologisingly grinning, while I had the experience of giving her my credit card with five stars.
Oscar Pistorius transferred from prison to hospital with chest pain
Pistorius left prison for the second time for a hospital visit.
Last year he was hospitalized for treating cuts at his wrists, which according to the prison authorities he suffered in his cell after a case.
Pistorius was sentenced for murder after an appeal by the prosecutors against a first death sentence.
He killed Steenkamp in the early morning hours of Valentine's Day 2013 by shooting her several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed that he thought his girlfriend was a nocturnal invader hiding in the cabin.
The prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal this time against the six-year sentence of Pistorius, of which they say she is too forbearous.
The National Criminal Prosecution Authority said it would object to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the opposition could be heard this year.
Pistorius runs the risk that his punishment will be increased to 15 years if the prosecutors are successful.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
When Bauer Arnold finds a strange egg
As the last of the Blumberg schools, the fourth graders from Fußen and Epfenhofen were released into the holidays and into the secondary schools.
In the future, three of the drop-off students will go to high school, four to the real school.
Head of the school Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at Biesental in Epfenhofen on Tuesday evening.
The 29 students of the four classes, led by Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder, chose a young eagle to grow up in the chicken farm and then be released into freedom.
In addition, the band performed a musical titled "Der Adler im Hühnerhof".
Bauer Arnold found a strange egg and let it hatch from his chickens.
Instead of a chicken chick, a small eagle came out.
But the hope of making a chicken out of it broke, the eagle spread out his wings on a high mountain and escaped.
After that, classes three and four showed a chicken dance in Yvonne Frank's study.
The hens danced with the young gamblers who wore cylinders to make the bet.
The eagle stands for integration, said school director Angelika Sitte.
Although the young animal is different from the other young animals (kids), it is part of it.
But he will never be like a chicken.
His purpose was to be free.
She wished every fourth grader that he felt accepted in his new school.
The following words of thanks followed to the colleagues, former head of school Michael Müller, who repeatedly gets into school bottlenecks, and the parents.
The chick time is now over, explained class teacher Sophia Schumacher.
After two years of teaching, she was very reluctant to release her students, for it had been a really great time.
Finally, she could have relied on the fourth graders.
Finally, all the students made a song of summer time and holiday season sound.
The children found great joy in doing so.
Eight primary school students are already registered for the new school year.
Two Bulgarians Arrested for Illegal Camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians were detained for illegal camping in Greece, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, quoted by television, announced.
On the morning of August 1st, a group of illegal people, including the two Bulgarians, were arrested by the police in Sithonia.
On the same day, they were released while an investigation is under way.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported that the Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have intensified control of free camp and impose significant fines on anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose.
The checks will continue throughout the season.
The Ministry said the court could impose a fine.
Software update for diesel vehicles: What the data subjects need to know now
How exactly does the software update take place?
Do diesel drivers have to participate in the action?
The most important questions and answers at a glance.
At the Diesel Summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for around 5.3 million cars.
They are intended to improve the exhaust gas behaviour of cars of the Euro 5 and partially Euro 6 emission classes.
Euro-4 diesel or worse are excluded.
Anja Smetanin from the ACE Auto Club Europe gives estimates:
Is the new action mandatory?
No, the negotiated software updates are voluntary.
"The mandatory updates previously apply only to the vehicles that have fake software," says Anja Smetanin.
Their retrofitting has been arranged by the Federal Motor Vehicle Office (KBA).
How and from when will customers be informed about updates?
Manufacturers have announced a rapid implementation in the coming months, but have not yet mentioned a precise date.
Daimler has informed each person concerned.
If an inspection is due anyway, this will be done within the framework.
How long should the total number of conversions go?
"Heavy to say," says Smetanin.
This depends on the commitment of manufacturers and on political pressure.
"For we have seen that car manufacturers are not acting voluntarily on the subject of environment so far."
How long will the update take?
The conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop.
It could be more time-consuming to get an appointment.
What are drivers who do not drive BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group?
The ACE advises to wait.
According to Smetanin, foreign producers are thought to be tracking.
Is there now a massive drop in the price of Euro-4 cars?
The ACE fears that.
But just in the regions where driving bans threaten.
In rural areas, there has been no loss of value for older diesel.
The ACE advises to wait with a sale.
LL Cool J receives Kennedy Center award
The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington.
The first award ceremony under President Trump promises to become political.
One of the prizewinners doesn't want to come - out of protest.
LL Cool J (49) is the first rapper to receive one of the coveted awards of the renowned Kennedy Center.
This year, as the cultural institution announced on Thursday, singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68) and choreographer Carmen de Lavallade (86) and TV producer Norman Lear (95) are among the honoured.
The awards will be handed over at the beginning of December.
Traditionally, US President Donald Trump will hold a reception and join his wife Melania in the ceremony.
This is why Lear, known for his progressive TV series, has already announced that Lear will not participate in the Gala.
The "New York Times" he said, "This presidency has decided to neglect the arts and human rights completely - even to take away the resources from them - and that burdens me."
The 59-year-old Estefan stressed that she would use the conversation with Trump to clarify her point of view.
The Kennedy Center, named after former President John F. Kennedy, is the largest cultural institution in the U.S. capital.
The previous winners include Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks and Sting.
We make the city worth living
Roland Wacker, Haslach's city builder, will retire next year.
The job is already advertised - however suitable candidates are rare.
For 31 years, Wacker has been a city builder.
And the work still makes him great fun of how he mediates in the press conversation.
He reports on varied but also demanding tasks that await his successor.
At the same time, he is surprised that no application has yet fulfilled the requirement profile.
The city is looking for an architect or construction engineer at the next possible time.
So, while respecting the regular termination periods, there should still be enough time for an intervention.
Since Haslach acts as the Lower Building Law Authority for the Administrative Community, the applicant must provide the relevant financial statements.
Because this function definitely wants to keep the city.
If they were no longer able to fill these out, citizens would have to go to Offenburg for advice.
But proximity to the citizen is important to the city and to it itself, says Wacker, who reports a good operating climate and good mood between the authority and the citizens.
In more than 30 years in office, some important projects have accumulated, looking back on Wacker with pride.
"We make the city worth living," he is sure about the construction office and its employees.
But also in the future varied projects are on the agenda: The transformation of the former Hukla area and the Niederhofenparkplatz have been initiated.
The Kinzig bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is being renewed, the stadium renovation is still the subject.
The latter alone will beat up with around 1.5 million euros, "if we do it right," says Wacker.
"All in all, great tasks await my successor.
The work here is fun."
In design, there is a large room for a city builder.
With Haslach's own construction yard and gardening journeys, we react quite flexibly to many things.
"You can move a lot," says Wacker, and the design of the green spaces is often mentioned by citizens and visitors in praise.
Since the old town is under monument protection as an ensemble, it is important to "have an eye for what fits in", when new buildings are approved, the outgoing city builder emphasizes.
In any case, the city builder bears high responsibility.
He's a builder, "at the end, everything runs over my table."
In support and coordination he can count on many years of employees: Markus Neumaier (construction) has been with Manfred Schöner for ten years, Manfred Schöner (deep building) for 15 years.
Also, that his successor remains long, Wacker wishes: "We are looking for someone who really wants to identify with the place and stay".
Continuity is important not only for a good operating climate, but also for the further design of the city.
According to information provided by the city of Haslach, if you want to inherit Roland Wacker, you should be able to study as a diploma engineer or a Bachelor's degree in architecture and have good expertise in the fields of building planning and construction planning.
The municipal construction office is under construction and civil engineering, construction planning, land-based affairs, urban property management, urban farm with construction yard and urban gardening, and under construction law, including monument protection.
Bicycle thrown on lines: South Railway Locked
According to police, the previously unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway track crossing in the area of Leobener Straße (B116) onto the lines.
These were so badly damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped.
The investigators assume two male perpetrators and have been looking for them since the night hours.
Near the crime scene, witnesses had seen a rosarod scooter and a bicycle driver.
"This goes far beyond a bubbubble stroke," said ÖBB speaker Christoph Posch to the APA.
He or the perpetrators would have put themselves in great danger and also put the train at risk.
In addition to the damage to the locomotive and the plant, as well as the delay minutes and the costs of the railway replacement traffic, the perpetrators could also receive the penalty of the railway customers.
Overall, a "significant" sum was assumed, said the speaker.
The damage was remedied on Friday afternoon, and the rail traffic on the south railway could be managed without disabilities.
Nearly ten passenger trains had failed Friday morning, two of which concerned long distance transport.
freight trains did not fail, but they were late.
According to ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch, some 200 meters of overhead lines had to be exchanged.
Insulators and masts have also been damaged.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help to relieve IBD (inflammatory intestinal disease)
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.
But a new study claims exactly the opposite: A diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could relieve the symptoms of patients with inflammatory intestinal disease.
The incurable condition, which affects about 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the UK, causes stomach cramps and bloating, recurring or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
While those affected are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms, researchers at Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins helps to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine.
The lead researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells patrol in the intestine to ensure that harmful microbes hidden in the food do not penetrate the body.
Cells capable of causing inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue.
If the balance tends too far towards inflammation, it can result in inflammatory intestinal disease.
Experiments have shown that a kind of tolerance-promoting immune cell occurs in mice carrying a certain bacterium in their intestines.
And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.
Professor Colonna said: "We have established a connection between a species of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestinal microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote the promotion.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had these immune cells".
He proposed that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan promote more tolerant, less inflammatory intestinal environment, if the same system also works in humans.
Postdoc Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan investigated a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found out that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same strain, which was housed separately, had not.
She suspected that the difference had to do with the intestines of the mice - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The intestines of the mice were DNA-sequenced and six species of bacteria were found present in the mice with the immune cells, but without them the mice were missing.
mice were raised in a sterile environment so that they lacked a intestinal robioma and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they received L. reuteri and the immune cells.
To understand how the bacteria affected the immune system, the researchers let L. reuteri grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the fluid - without the bacteria - to immature immune cells isolated from the mice.
The immune cells developed into the tolerant cells.
When the active component was cleaned from the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism known as indol-3-milchic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the feed of the mice, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophan values were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.
It is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory intestinal disease.
She said, "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote, as these cells control inflammations on the inner surface of the intestine.
Potentially, high tryptophan values in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an extension of this population."
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United with Nemanja Matic has committed a "genie"
With Manchester United, Nemanja Matic signed a "genie", Jose Mourinho believes after the midfielder made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
The 40 million pounds signature of Chelsea began with a 2:1 victory in Dublin, the last pre-season game before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid began on Tuesday, and impressed in the holder role when people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira marched as desired.
However, Matic had been excluded from the blues' preparatory Asia tour and managed only 45 minutes, which Mourinho admitted that he had to improve before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," said Mourinho.
"We will help him to be ready sooner than later."
In addition to Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also started in the Aviva Stadium, when Mourinho formed his start-XI for the beginning of the season.
This week, The Independent revealed that Mourinho wanted three further new commitments, but he insisted that the club had already done a "fantastic work" to fulfill three of its four priority new commitments.
"To get three out of four, I thank the club for that," he added.
"I'll be happier if they get four out of four for me, but they've gone to great lengths."
Boeing "malt" Dreamliner in the sky
The US aircraft manufacturer Boeing painted the silhouette of a dreamliner in the sky.
The pilots flew off Seattle in Washington, but the drawing began in Marquette, Michigan, and moved across the USA in the form of a dreamliner, several thousand kilometers.
The action lasted 18 hours and a minute.
On the radar screens was the shape of a dreamliner.
The whole thing was a endurance test for new engines.
Boeing had previously made such advertising.
The number "787" and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky.
New low for Martin Schulz - Hannover, we have a problem
How the wind turns: When Sigmar Gabriel was still SPD chief, social-democratic prime minister presidents always looked at Berlin with some concern before elections.
Only no interference from the party headquarters, no counterwind from the Federation - so was the most important wish of the election fighters.
Since Martin Schulz led the party, this has changed fundamentally.
Since then, employees from the Willy Brandt House have been watching the events in the SPD-regulated state capitals with growing horror.
What Schulz got from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described in the approach with counterwinds.
It was deep down.
One after another.
The Bundes-CDU sees a general signal against coalitions of SPD and Greens after the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony.
"This shows once again: Red Green simply cannot rule reliably," said CDU General Secretary Peter Tauber to the editorial network Deutschland (RND).
The surprising resignation of a Green MP has plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a severe crisis.
Five months before the country election, his red-green coalition lost its one-voice majority to the opposition from CDU and FDP.
Green Federal Managing Director Michael Kellner has asked the apostate Lower Saxony Green Deputies Elke Twesten to return their mandate.
The violation of the CDU means a clear distortion of the electorate's will.
Every Twesten has to return its mandate immediately," said the Federal Managing Director and President of the Green Party to the editorial network of Germany (RND).
"This must not be true at all," sighs a SPD election fighter, as the new Hiobs message reaches the party headquarters on Friday morning.
Stephan Weil, SPD's Prime Minister of Lower Saxony, is present after the transition of the Green Deputies Elke Twesten to the CDU without a majority of their own government.
It is the provisional highlight of a whole series of major and small crises in SPD national associations.
And nobody knows what's next.
The mister began with the unexpected clear defeat at the Saarland election in March.
A blue eye, no more, calmed down the comrades at the time.
After the state elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia, everything would be different.
That's what it became - and it's all gotten much worse.
The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into the tumble, the Düsseldorf pleas slammed the party smoothly.
The comrades got up in the weeks after that.
Then, when they had just taken new courage, the G-20 summit of Hamburg came.
And with him came the next deep blow.
Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD leader, lost his Nimbus that weekend because he was sitting in the Elbphilharmonie while his city was burning.
And because in crisis communication after that, he did pretty much everything you can do wrong.
Since then Scholz has been fighting for his political survival.
So now also Stephan Weil.
The Lower Saxony Prime Minister has been criticised for a long time because of the VW exhaust gas affair and its role in the Supervisory Board.
Mistakes were added.
Nevertheless, or perhaps just because of that, Weil has tried more and more to put accents in the league in recent weeks.
The efforts of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin were not hidden by comrades in the vicinity of Martin Schulz.
They had him granted because they promised to stabilize the party.
Now the exact opposite could occur.
Weil does not really blame the party-internal twist of the Lower Saxony Greens.
And Schulz isn't.
In the meantime, the comrades are trying to keep their own ranks closed.
Her anger is directed towards the Greens, and here, above all, to the apostate parliamentarian Twesten.
"It is intolerable and harmful to democracy how Ms Twesten puts her own career interests above the interests of all others," says Matthias Miersch, head of the party left in the SPD-Bundestagsfrektion, the editorial network Deutschland (RND).
Mrs Twesten has not been elected to the parliament because of her person as a direct candidate, but through the list of the Lower Saxony Greens, the Lower Saxony MP continues.
The logical consequence would be that she would return her mandate.
Thomas Opermann, head of the SPD-Bundestagsfraction, complains of an "undemocratic maneuver".
"The will to vote four years ago was clear: People have made Stephan Weil the Prime Minister," says Oppermann, who is leading the Lower Saxony SPD as the top candidate for the Bundestag election, the RND.
"Now the personal career thinking of a future CDU delegate distorts the election result," continued Oppermann.
He called for clarification of the backgrounds.
I want to know if there has been more or if there have been further commitments from the CDU Lower Saxony.
Funding for local core III
If you want to clean up your old house, you can soon get support from the country.
On Wednesday, Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of STEG informed city development in Empfingen.
At the beginning of the information event, Schindler once again gave a review of what had happened.
Since 1991 there have been rehabilitation areas in Empfingen.
At that time, in the reorganisation area I from 1991 to 2004, the country of Baden-Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding.
In the recovery area II from 2005 to 2016, the grant was still 60 percent.
For Schindler, the current renovations are a "success project" - it is important to promote internal development, and not only to develop new construction areas.
On 4 April, the Government President Karlsruhe received the information that there will be a reorganisation zone III.
The funding amounted to 833 333 euros, of which 500 000 euros would be from the country, the rest from the municipality of Empfingen.
How does a rehabilitation area come to be?
According to Schindler, one will continue to investigate where the "real old" houses are.
However, it also plays a role in reorganising whether interest in the planned area is at all interested.
If necessary, the territorial boundaries could then shift again.
The STEG represented Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel on Wednesday evening.
Keller presented the contents of the Federal-Landes-Programme "Social City", in which the renovations would then be carried out.
The programme focuses on the revitalisation of urban areas, the improvement of living and working conditions and the preservation and expansion of infrastructure.
The measures would be carried out in object-related terms, i.e. per property.
The reorganisation area would then finally be set out as a statute.
Since 1 January 2017, the granting period for the funding has been until 30 April 2026.
By September of this year, however, the inventory would first be carried out, in which a questionnaire will be sent to the participants in the reorganisation area.
As far as possible, the statutes will be adopted in November or December so that the reorganisations can be started in the coming year.
Pietzschmann then explained that each municipality had to carry out the said preliminary investigations.
It is about assessing urban maladministrations and deciding when to renovate and to what extent.
A reorganisation note will then be entered in the base book for the respective property.
Pietzschmann himself will come to Empfingen again and take a picture of the situation, she promised.
Gotzel stressed that a key success factor for the project was the participation of stakeholders.
Therefore, there will be questionnaires which will be sent postally to the citizens in the coming weeks and can be completed by the end of the summer holidays.
The yellow questionnaire is the "building and land sheet", which deals, among other things, with the structural condition and the plans for renovation.
In the grey questionnaire, the "household and apartment sheet", information about the size, distribution and inhabitants of a living room can be provided.
The blue "operational sheet" must be filled out only if business premises are operated in the building.
However, it should be noted that Gotzel points out that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding.
In addition, new construction measures are not eligible.
Schindler stressed that the distribution of the funding functions according to the "wind dog principle" - who comes first, grinds first.
One could not "reserve" funding for later.
At the end of the project, photos of the project "Ortskern II" were shown to make a renovation "tasteful".
British inventor sets himself up a microchip to come into the house and car with a hand movement
A British inventor is the first in the country to be equipped with a microchip so that he can open his door, enter his office, and even start his car with a hand movement.
Steven Northam, 33, had implanted the tiny chip between thumbs and index fingers and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company BioTeq.
He joined with Dr. Geoff Watson, an advisory anaesthetist at Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out according to medical standards.
The technology resembles a cat and dog implanted microchip and lasts only 30 seconds.
Mr. Northam's company also wants to change the locks on houses and cars in such a way that they are compatible with the chip, all at a surcharge of £300 per lock.
The married father of one has now installed both at home and with his BMW Z4 technology, which begins when his hand is on the wheel.
The advertising costs of the White House cost the taxpayer thousands
The White House's decision to fly a marine helicopter to the South Lawn for an event that highlights American production last month costs taxpayers up to $24,000, according to the military data left to the TIME magazine.
The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, was the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American building programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and white house executive officials made a tour of products from all 50 states.
The helicopter, manufactured in Connecticut, was exhibited alongside a Maine yacht, a Wisconsin fire engine and a Mississippi forklift.
The White House military office required the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or FRAGO, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter.
"I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility," wrote the commander of the HMX-1 on the eve of the event to his superior, the deputy naval commander for aviation.
The news indicated that the helicopter arrived at the South Lawn on July 17th, around 7 a.m. for the event at 3 p.m., and remained until the lawn was cleared between 18:00 and 21:00 p.m. on that evening.
The note adds that if the departure from the White House was to be delayed, a second crew would be needed for the return flight due to the limitation of the hours of service.
The original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event, while the unit's security personnel remained on the ground during the time.
From the records made available to the TIME it was not clear whether a second flight crew was needed in the end.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
Data sets indicate that HMX-1 asked if the event could violate the determination.
"One question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case," the commander wrote.
"Sounds like you're locked," the deputy commander replied.
The event "Made in America" was called an official event by the White House and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.
But also official events have political overtones.
At the event, the president encouraged the reform of the health reform under way in the Senate, and he propagated the efforts to curb government legislation.
The use of the aircraft, known as Marine One or Air Force One, for politically beneficial purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are obliged to use them for the journey.
But demanding their use only for a photo-op is unusual.
Trump conducted an investigation in February when the presidential aircraft provided taxi services against the background of its first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, and its Twitter account is full of messages that complain about the use of the presidential aircraft by its predecessor.
"The White House is enthusiastic about the show "Made In America" - the products from all 50 states produced by American workers with American materials," said Lindsay Walters, deputy press secretary of the White House.
HMX-1 crews often carry out training flights in the area around Washington and South Lawn to sell the US president in the White House with precise centimetres.
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX-1 carried out 58 practice landings in the White House.
The flight for the "Made in America" event included the training needs of the flight crew for the month, said one official.
Helicopter units also flew 11 hours on this day for "non-presidency support missions".
The White House said that taxpayers took over the burden for none of the other props presented at the event.
A speaker from Sikorsky said that the company had not been involved in issuing the helicopter on the South Law.
HMX-1 does not have budget records for the presidential flights, and it is difficult to identify the exact costs of the event.
However, according to the US Department of Defense's hourly tariffs for the financial year 2017, the DoD refund rate for the VH-3D is USD 24,380 per flight hour.
The unit records the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.
The White House argues that the actual costs for the operation of the helicopter are well below this rate.
"Determining the costs of taxpayers on the basis of the estimates for the refund rates is most misleading," said Walters.
"These estimates include personnel, maintenance and many other hidden costs contained in the annual resources."
According to a 2015 RAND study, the refund rates for DoD do not include personnel costs, but take into account the costs of fuel, maintenance and contract conclusion.
At that time, former White House press spokesperson Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter for the event.
"The idea is to present things made in America this week," Spicer said.
"And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security, and I assume that hundreds, if not thousands, are dependent on it.
And I think, like most Americans, we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly.
It is, of course, appropriate to highlight this."
It was not clear whether Trump was interacting with the helicopter when he took his tour over the South Lawn for the event, but he sat in the driver's seat of a fire car.
In the White House Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and joked with the media about his own fleet of company products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the president, "I have three of them."
TC BW News before tricky task
Top rider of the Second Tennis-Bundesliga takes part in the table 3 Searchsdorfer SV.
The TC Blau-Weiss Neuss will take place tomorrow from 11 a.m. in Kiel at the table three-way Searchsdorfer SV.
Despite the flawless balance of five games, the leader of the Second Tennis Bundesliga has been given the sense of reality.
Team leader Marius Zay has respect for the opponent.
"This is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation.
Especially in the back positions, I like the team very much."
For class and stability with the Searchsdorfer SV, imports from the high north are mainly concerned.
"The Danes and Finns can even refer to deployments in the Davis Cup.
And they are also strong in double," says Zay with a view to Harri Heliovaara (Finland), Andre Göransson (Sweden), Sören and Esben Olesen, Martin Pedersen and Andreas Bjerrehus (all Denmark).
"That will be difficult for us as always.
You also need a good portion of luck."
The Neusser team for the trip to the high north is practical.
His debut for blue-white could be Maxime Janvier.
If the current Challenger tournament in the Italian Biella does not make it to the Bundesliga-Partie, Zdenek Kolar (Czech Republic) who plays in the Czech Liberec tournament will be the first to be used in this season.
The so far unconquered Chilean Hans Podlipnik-Castillo was yesterday with the Belarusian Andrei Vasilevski at the ATP tournament in Kitzbühel on the ball.
But he was supposed to be in Kiel as well as Botic Van de Zandschulp, Niels Lootsma (both Netherlands) and the Belgian Julien Cagina.
After his two victories last Sunday against the club at the Alster, Máté Valkusz could go to the team again.
If it is not enough for the 18-year-old Hungary, which was the number one of the junior world rankings in January 2016, someone from the coaching team around Marius Zay fills up the cadre.
How America Can Harm OMV
Truly happy, Donald Trump did not work when he put his signature under the law to tighten sanctions against Russia on Wednesday night.
"In having passed the law," the Congress packed a few "constitutional rules", he put it.
The reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected, and even Brussels was foaming against the US advance.
After all, the draft provides for the punishment of European companies that help the Russians to build gas pipelines into the EU.
Since then, investors of the local OMV, who co-financed the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea line Nord Stream 2 together with other European companies, have been concerned accordingly.
The threat scene is enormous.
Nevertheless, it was too early for an assessment of the consequences, according to the official statement of the oil group.
In fact, Donald Trump himself would still have to bring the sanctions to life by executive order.
Twelve weapons are his choice.
"The press" has looked at what the group could resist and which could really hurt him.
Narco's season 3 trailers: Without Pablo Escobar, the Cali Cartel in Netflix's hit series will be brought to the heart
Despite the second season of Narcos, which Pablo Escobars Killer reveals, the series of Netflix is far from over.
The season three and four were already confirmed by the streaming service, the first received their first trailer and showed the latest villains of the show.
With the third season, the DEA has focused its attention on the richest organization of drug trafficking in the world: the Cali cartel.
Guided by four powerful sponsors, they operate "like a Fortune 500 company" only with more state bribes and violent actions.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is her head, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) commands the Mexican connection, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) is located in New York.
In the newly published trailer Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, the guy who invites American and Colombian law enforcement authorities to support the war on drugs.
Other new actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bshe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos will begin on 1 September.
Scroll backwards: The city employs 46 kitchen aids
The city organizes the Kita lunch table itself again.
With fixed contacts for the children and an assignment to the team.
The clock is turned back in the city's daycare centers.
As of 1 September, the city of Krefeld will take over the food supply in the urban day care facilities (kitas) again in its own direction.
For Sonja Pommeranz, Deputy Head of the Department of Youth Aid, this is a good news: "We were all very pleased."
Boiled is still out of the house: A caterer takes over this task and supplies freshly cooked food cooled.
The city operates in the Krefelder area 46 day care centers, in 44 children get a warm meal at lunchtime.
In the past kitayear, 2800 children were sitting at the tables, and the need is growing steadily.
"In the meantime, not only children who are cared for for 45 hours of the week eat in the kita for lunch," Pommeranz explains.
"The offer is also valid in the 35-hour care if children stay until 2pm."
46 part-time workers have kitchen service as of 1 September: they heat up the delivered food, supplement it with salad, raw food and fruit, portion the meal individually, give the food, clean, rinse and clean the kitchen.
"The employees are strongly assigned to a kita," says Pommeranz.
The size - there are two-group as well as seven-group facilities - determines the length of the hour.
"The kitchen helpers now belong firmly to the Kita team," says Pommeranz.
"They are thus much more involved and it is easier to implement pedagogical concepts for the kital management."
Because it is also about: healthy nutrition and cooking lessons.
"The children should help prepare the food."
The direct connection of the kitchen power to the team would make sense.
Also for the children.
"You have a known power in the Kita, a person who is familiar with them, and not constantly changing people."
This continuity was important for the children.
The cleaning of the Kita rooms - so far also the task of the kitchen staff - will be done by special cleaning staff in the future.
This variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has besides the quality improvement of the kitchen performance also the charm that it has proved to be the most economical in the cost comparison between directing its own and foreign assignment for the city, says the press office.
And that, although 46 part-time workers are re-employed.
"But these hours don't fall so much into the weight of around 750 people in the educational field," Sonja Pommeranz says.
Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women, says the UN
Elections can only be representative if all members of society, including women, play a role, said the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, Head of the United Nations Mission, said that hundreds of women will be candidates for the Council elections in the provinces. Three women are candidates for the role of vice-president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overestimated," he said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women are fully involved and involved in all parts of the electoral process.
Afghan elections to the Provincial Council and the presidential elections will take place on 5 April.
The Taliban has published threats to an election process that coincides with the transition from international combat to an advisory role.
This year, for the first time, the elections will be peacefully handed over power from a democratically elected government to the next.
Haysom said that a strong role for women will strengthen the democratic success of Afghanistan.
The Afghan independent electoral commission reports that 1.2 million women are registered by a total of 3.6 million voters.

Men try to rob 13-year-old girl
Two young men aged 19 and 23 are said to have tried on Thursday to rob a 13-year-old girl.
According to police information, the men spoke to the 13-year-olds who stayed with friends on the Kolpingstraße about 2:55 p.m. because they wanted to phone with the girl's phone.
But the 13-year-old refused the request and continued with her friends.
One of the perpetrators then tried to grab the girl's cell phone and necklace, which was wrong.
Without prey, the duo fled.
The two young men were later arrested by the police.
Investigations are under way.
GMB concern about investments in the McVItie factory in Glasgow
A trade union would like to check with managers of the Biskuit manufacturer McViie about the long-term commitment to production at their plant in Glasgow.
GMB Scotland said that the company had been silent about the future of investments at the Tollcross site.
More than 500 employees work in the factory, which produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies in addition to other products.
McVities owner Pladis said he invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years.
He added that employees and union representatives would be "first to know" if their activities changed.
In a letter to the company's head of the branch, GMB asked Scotland McViie's to "refer to the thought that financing for the modernisation of production lines would not advance".
GMB senior organizer Drew Duffy, said: "The fact that we cannot gain clarity from the General Site Manager about the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross is deeply related to our members.
Generations of families have worked here, and the labour force is concentrated heavily on the local community and the Greater Glasgow region, an important pillar for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantage.
Therefore, from the perspective of jobs, wages and prosperity, and against the background of Brexit, the rising cost of living and the chronic decline in production, the eastern end of Glasgow urgently requires a thriving production presence at McVitie".
A spokesperson from Pladis said: "The Tollcross branch manager received a letter from GMB Scotland only yesterday, and the company will respond directly to it, as we appreciate the continued commitment of employees and trade union representatives.
Two months ago, we had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross, where some questions were discussed openly.
We discussed with the employees that, like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate, we are constantly reviewing our business - and this applies to all our business units and locations - in order to remain competitive.
She added: "In recent years, we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our Tollcross site, especially in production lines and operational improvements.
We fully recognise the legacy of Tollcross as a production site. If our operations at the site change, the employees and their union representatives will be the first to know this."
Did the PSG warn Barcelona three years ago about Neymar?
La Liga's page may regret her interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not fail in her persecution of Neymar after making an offer of £189 million to trigger his release clause, but did they warn Barcelona three years ago about the world record robbery?
The sensational approach has fueled the transfer window in summer, because the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand, with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United for 89 million pounds last season.
After the end, Neymar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the world’s most paid professional sportsman. PSG offers wages of more than GBP 500,000 a week.
Barcelona is angry at the way Neymar forced his way out, although a source near the Catalan Board of Directors insists that the club has always given its best to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned three years ago by the PSG president of this prospect?
When Manchester City expressed an interest in Blaise Matuidi's signature in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strict warning for any club that wanted to sign one of the best players of PSG.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we'll be in opposition to them, we'll contact their players," said Al-Khelaifi.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to sign one of our players with them, this will have consequences."
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line, with the Spanish club expressing interest in the PSG middle field player Marco Verratti at the beginning of this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to leave under any circumstances, and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offers for Neymar.
Roller tossed and damaged
On the night from Friday to Saturday, an unknown perpetrator deliberately threw over a scooter placed in the Königsfelder Straße in front of the property number 30 and thus caused material damage to the vehicle's disguise of over 200 euros.
Schramberg Police, phone 07422/27 01-0, asks for advice.
To an accident on the B 215 between Stolzenau and Leese, the police are looking for witnesses.
Because a car approached him on his lane, the driver of a VW Touran had to escape and then touch the guideboard.
On Thursday evening the 34-year-old from Rehburg-Loccum with his VW was on the B 215 from Stolzenau on the way towards Leese.
In the area around Stolzenau, a car met him on his lane, so that he had to escape to the right.
The Touran driver also touched the guideboard.
The car was damaged.
The passenger car driver, a Mercedes Benz, had overtaken a truck and continued his journey without taking care of the traffic accident.
According to the accident victim, it can be good that the Mercedes driver had not noticed the accident at all.
The police are now asking witnesses of the incident and the driver of the vehicle to contact the Commissioner in Stolzenau at Tel. 05761 / 92060.
Interview: "Domspatzen report relieves Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger"
The Regensburg Domspatzen report on the abuse cases relieves Pope-Brother Georg Ratzinger.
This means author and historian Michael Hesemann.
The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburg Cathedral Patzen continues to provide for discussions.
Christian Weisender, spokesperson of the reform movement "We are a Church", said after publication to the German Press Agency, he expected an excuse from the former Bishop of Regensburg and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from the Cathedral chapel master Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the retired Pope Benedict XVI.
It would be very useful for the Catholic Church to express its deep regret for its own omissions or for its then false assessment of the processes.
On the other hand, the Vatican newspaper "Osservatore Romano" criticised the "two-scale" measurement of violence in the cathedral spatula.
With regard to the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubt that it is "disgusting and shameful acts" that would have to be punished and prevented in the future; however, the "grad media manipulation" is striking, according to the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the Italian national bioethics committee.
"The habit of describing the Catholic Church as the source of all evils is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to consider it normal," writes Scaraffia.
Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis also said in an interview with Bayerische Rundfunk: "You like to go to the church and that's a found eating."
In addition, she pointed out that in her youth "beats were a normal educational tool" to "get through with a lot of kids like me."
It found it unfair to apply today's standards to earlier decades, because the world has changed.
In connection with the reports on the abuse cases, Pope George Ratzinger also often appeared.
Completely wrong, says author and historian Michael Hesemann, who with Ratzinger wrote the book of remembrance "My Brother of the Pope" (translated into 12 languages).
"I have to protect Georg Ratzinger," says Hesemann, "because all this had nothing to do with him," he evaluates the results of the final report.
What exactly does the 440-page report presented by the lawyer Ulrich Weber, appointed by the Bishop of Regensburg, say?
Between 1945 and the early 1990s, "with high plausibility" victims of attacks, 67 domspatzen were sexually abused.
The final report says about Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "In summary, it can be stated that in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence were applied by Domkatellmeister R..
Especially in the event of high emotionality, the punishment for the students could also be more severe.
Nevertheless, unlike many other accuseds, many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore, in many cases, despite violence, even link positive memories with him."
In the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger reliefs his opinion.
Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "consequences of violence against the patrons of the Regensburger Domspatzen" gives an contradictory picture of Domkapelmeister Georg Ratzinger.
On the one hand, many students highlight his "humanity".
On the other hand, he also appears as a choleric and perfectionist, who often became hand-held when a domspatz musically did not give a top performance.
How do you value this final report as his biographer?
Michael Hesemann: If you make the effort and read the entire 440-page report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger appears in it.
Just eight pages are devoted to him, and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of co-operator or co-conscience in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.
The excretions of violence at the preschool also occurred outside its sphere of activity.
One can at least accuse him of having learned too late or of not taking first indications seriously enough.
The domspatzengymnasium on which he worked was perceived by virtually all respondents as - so literally - "redemption", "heaven" and "better world".
Thus, the broad majority of his students Georg Ratzinger exhibits a very excellent witness, describing him as "warm-hearted", "popular", "righteous", "competent" and "understanding", as extremely kind teachers, who regularly supplied the boys with cakes, biscuits and candies and was "always shifted from grapes of children".
Only a minority complains about its perfectionism and its high emotionality, which has already led to outbreaks of anger.
Not only did he blow with chairs and throw the keyblade on the floor, but he also distributed ear figs and pulled guys too naughty on the hair or ears, he admitted himself years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for it.
It must be said, however, that in the time in question, the 1960s and 1970s, such methods of education were widespread among parents and teachers.
Do you know any of these breeding methods?
Of course, I think each of us was born before 1968.
I have also experienced this in a secular school, a state gymnasium.
Compared to what this report is actually about, namely the horrific sexual abuse and the excesses of violence at preschool, it is, of course, bagatella.
There you wonder if it is not more to do with his acquaintance and his role as brother of Benedict XVI that many media just fell on him.
Many who have never understood him continue to work with the Bavarian pope with zeal.
But the truth is, the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every way!
In the media, a great deal has been reported in connection with the report on abuse of the Regensburg Cathedrals.
In the final report, is Georg Ratzinger also burdened with any development or co-science with regard to sexual abuse?
Michael Hesemann: Clearly no.
None of the 67 victims of sexual assaults claim to have entrusted themselves to the cathedral master.
Not even the parents were inaugurated.
"I never dared to talk to my father or mother about it," said one affected person alternately to the others, "it was all very embarrassing to me."
The real problem in reconciling sexual abuse was and is that most victims remain silent.
If they did not even entrust themselves to parents and siblings, then certainly not a choir conductor, who would have been a professional colleague of the perpetrators.
How do the Domspatzen students judge Ratzinger's role in the cases of abuse?
Michael Hesemann: A student surveyed put it this way: "As regards sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) would have had timely knowledge and could have stopped the respective perpetrator.
I think it ... is also really absurd to assume that it is only for him ... that boys have opened up more intrusive or clearer or even more, than to their parents, boarding school leaders, trust teachers etc.
That you talk to him about sex ... - unthinkable."
Thus, the report comes to the very clear conclusion: "The fact that students and/or their surroundings were entrusted to him in advance could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation".
Thus, as far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger must be acquitted of any co-science.
Neither can he be accused of not preventing him or bringing him to the fore.
Therefore, there is no reason to link his good name with these reprehensible crimes, as has unfortunately happened in some cases.
In the media much of "violence" was to be read at the Regensburg Cathedrals.
Former cathedral master Georg Ratzinger is accused in the report "Wegschauen".
Does he have to live with this accusation?
Michael Hesemann: This is the big problem that in reporting everything was mixed and mixed into a huge melange of sexual abuse and excesses of violence and somewhere in the middle, Georg Ratzinger.
But that is precisely an abuse of the report.
There is a clean separation: between preschool and the gymnasium of the cathedral spats, between sexual abuse and excesses of violence, as well as, let us say, other accusations.
In addition, the report deals with incidents from the time since 1945, also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not choir director of the cathedral spats.
The whole terrible beating pedagogy, the cases in which boys were directly harassed and painted by sadistic teachers, and suffered horribly, all took place at preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where truly scandalous states must have ruled.
But they had nothing to do with Domkapelmeister Georg Ratzinger, because he didn't see the boys until they were already on the Domspatzengymnasium.
On that, as the vast majority of witnesses emphasize, the topic "preschool" was taboo.
One was only happy to have escaped from her and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even "paradisiac" conditions.
What was different on the Domspatzengymnasium?
Michael Hesemann: There was discipline, but no sadistic violence.
And this is also true of Georg Ratzinger, who concluded that "many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore in many cases, despite violence, even link positive memories with him."
So at most the accusation remains to have looked away.
However, despite all the efforts, the report was able to define only two periods of time in which it was reported to him by the states in preschool.
The first time in 1970/71, when he started to establish himself and of the processes at a school where he was not working and responsible (so the witness) didn't want to hear anything, and then only around 1993 again.
Did Georg Ratzinger consistently close his ears before the states?
Michael Hesemann: No, because already in 1989, he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium, which the report even reproduces.
In this he points out that "in the preschool the punishment will continue to be practiced".
Even in view of the danger of negative press releases, he strongly recommended intervention.
This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed, when beating sentences had long been prohibited in Bavaria.
Before that, they happened in a legal grey zone, as each of us knows.
It was also difficult for him to estimate where the persons concerned might have been exaggerated or dramatized and where the allowed limit had really been exceeded.
But you can't say he'd always looked away.
That's just not true.
It was not until 1980 that the beating of schools was officially abolished in Bavaria.
Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today's educational standards to the time at that time.
How do you see that?
Michael Hesemann: We historians are talking about "iftrick of anachronism", i.e. the danger of judging past according to today's moral standards.
The princess is right.
But this does not apply, of course, to sexual abuse, which at all times was abominable and not to what was broken up in preschool in revulsions and violence on innocent children’s souls, which goes far beyond what was then customary.
That's all terrible, and I'm glad it's finally being reworked.
But at the same time, I have to protect Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him.
His means of disciplining and punishing, i.e. ear figs and pulling on the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.
When physical punishment was then forbidden, he also strictly adhered to it.
What picture of his Regensburg time did Georg Ratzinger present in the talks with you for the book "My Brother of the Pope"?
Did the subject of beating punishment also come up?
Michael Hesemann: Well, the book is about the life of his brother Joseph, i.e. Pope Benedict XVI, tells from his perspective, as the cathedral spats played only a side role.
Nevertheless, I do not hide at all that he had a strict regiment there.
But this must also be said: Without this perfectionism, without the demand for absolute discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world rank out of the previously nationally known Regensburg Cathedrals, true European cultural ambassadors and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).
With cookies and bonbons alone, one does not make a big singer out of stubborn boys and stand before every success, no matter in any field, but always discipline, passion and self-surpassing.
What kind of a person did you experience in the conversations with Georg Ratzinger on her book?
Michael Hesemann: Through the work on the book and beyond, I really got to know Georg Ratzinger very well, and I have experienced time and again as a wonderful, humorous, basic, deeply believing and hearty people, from whom one cannot imagine that he could do something to suffer even one fly.
I get regular contact with how many former domspatzen still today, 23 years after his retirement, regularly keep in touch with him, visit him, read to him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family.
So those who still do not forgive him that he was once strict with them are clearly in the minority.
Most of the domes are grateful to him today for enriching their lives and bringing them the world of music.
And that he was always a good, fatherly teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but he was also a lovable respectable person to whom they still look up and which they worship.
And, once again, quite clearly, all that one accuses him of are educational methods that were on the agenda at the time.
We can be glad that we have long overcome this time.
But it is most unfair to turn a man into a media scapegoat just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother.
There, the evil intention behind it is all too obvious.
Because the report that has just been published relieves him.
Now the intention would be to leave a 93-year-old man who has earned great merit and without anyone outside Bavaria and perhaps Germany's probably no one would know the Regensburg Cathedrals at last in peace.
