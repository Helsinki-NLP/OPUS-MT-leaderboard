Biker reacts quickly and prevents worse
On Friday evening, a traffic accident occurred on the country road between Machtolsheim and Merklingen, in which a motorcyclist was easily injured thanks to his rapid reaction.
Car driver overlooks biker
A 44-year-old driver wanted to turn left on the Landesstraße 1230 towards Machtolsheim at about 21.30 a.m. with her VW from Merklingen.
She saw the 24-year-old, right-to-run motor driver coming from Nellingen.
At collision, hand and foot brake levers fly away
The biker was still trying to avoid the car, yet he was stripping it at the rear of the car.
Through the striping process, the hand and foot brake levers were torn off at the Suzuki and the driver was no longer able to brake off.
He was currently driving his motorcycle in the green strips next to the roadway and had it rolled out there without falling.
Biker suffers leg injury
Due to the collision with the car the biker nevertheless suffered a injury to the bee and had to be treated in a clinic.
Mamming: Corna mass infection: 174 harvest helpers infected
After a corona mass infection on a large vegetable farm in the Lower Bavarian mamming, almost 500 people are quarantined and are no longer allowed to leave the farm.
A security service monitors the ban.
A total of 174 harvesters were tested positively for the corona pathogen Sars-CoV-2, as reported by the Landratsamt Dingolfing-Landau on Saturday evening.
"Unfortunately, in order to avoid further spread, we need to take this step to protect the population," said Landrat Werner Bumeder (CSU).
Previously, seven employees had already been infected in the plant - this was the reason for the series test.
The farm is a large vegetable farm that grows strawberries, cucumbers, cabbage and red prayer - but the cucumbers only for inlay glasses.
Mamming is a rural community with well 3300 inhabitants near Dingolfing with its large BMW plant.
Bumeder appealed to the citizens to maintain peace and quiet: "Our information is a closed group of people".
On the farm were separated from non-infected employees, the site is now surrounded by a fence.
Greens and SPDs shared responsibility for the state government.
The two opposition groups accused Prime Minister Markus Söder (CSU) and his cabinet of neglecting the control of accommodation for seasonal workers.
"This can be bitterly revenged when such local infections have to be taken out and regional lockdowns arranged," said Jürgen Mistol, the parliamentary director of the Greens.
The SPD sees this as quite similar: "We have already requested a special control programme for farms with harvest workers after the Corona outbreak in the Wiesenhof-Schlachthof in mid-May," said environmental expert Florian von Brunn.
"The hygiene conditions at the workplace and living conditions need to be closely monitored from our point of view.
This obviously didn't happen."
The outbreak had come "with announcement".
Subway station Aidenbachstraße: Dangerous dispute: 19-year-old falls into the trackbed after Schubser
In a dispute between two youth groups at Aidenbachstraße Metro Station, a 19-year-old fell through a pusher and slipped into the trackbed.
Obersendling - On Friday there was a dispute between two youth groups at the Aidenbachstraße Metro Station at around 4:15 p.m.

According to the first investigation, a Municher (17) pushed a 19-year-old to the ground.
The young man slipped over the platform edge and fell into the trackbed.
Persons from the 17-year-old group helped climb the fallen one out of the track.
There was no danger of entering a railway.
According to the police, conflicts between the two people occurred after that.

Report: Seehofer insists on longer storage data
Stock data storage is currently suspended.
However, Federal Minister of the Interior Horst Seehofer calls for an extension of the storage period after a media report.
He wants to strengthen the fight against child abuse.
Federal Minister for the Interior Horst Seehofer (CSU) calls for an extended storage of data for a media report - instead of the planned 10 weeks for half a year.
As reported in the "Image on Sunday", Seehofer Justice Minister Christine Lambrecht (SPD) asked for a rapid change in law in a letter.
Seehofer therefore intends to strengthen measures against child abuse.
He believes it makes sense to make "compulsory adjustments to the law already now", says the newspaper from the letter.
Currently, stock data storage is suspended.
A decision by the ECJ is expected to do so.
However, Seehofer wants the changes before, so that they can be applied immediately after a possible positive judgment, the report continues.
A spokesperson from the Ministry of Justice told the newspaper that it would only be possible to make a meaningful assessment of the need for legal adaptations if the courts had decided.
In the fight against child abuse and child pornography, Seehofer, together with the interior ministers of the countries, had already declared itself in June for a storage of data.
NBA: Strip club troubles for Clippers-Star Lou Williams
Excitement in the NBA!
Lou Williams (33), basketball professional of Los Angeles Clippers, is said to have left the tournament quarter in Disney World in Orlando/Florida with permission for a funeral.
According to U.S. media reports, however, he still visited the strip club "Magic City" in Atlanta in the evening.
Williams, who is said to have admitted to the visit according to ESPN, is back in isolation, is tested daily on Covid-19.
His reason for the visit: Chicken Wings.
In February last year, "Sweet Lou", as he is called in the NBA, has already expressed his love for exactly these Wings.
The American wrote: "Magic City and Blue Flame (another strip club in Atlanta, notes R.) have the best Wings in the city".
NBA-Insider Shams Charania announced on Twitter on Sunday that the NBA Williams ordered a ten-day quarantine.
This means that the Clippers star misses the first two official games after the test game phase.
In Disney World, the NBA wants to play the Corona season.
The best 22 teams with training games are currently preparing for the season finals that start at night on Friday.
After mass infection, Söder expresses itself to the Corona site
Munich - Minister of Health Melanie Huml (CSU) has already announced on Sunday a testament for large farms.
The press conference will be on our homepage live.
The case in Mamming in Dingolfing-Landau district has startled authorities and politics.
At the large vegetable farm are currently working almost 500 harvest helpers from several countries, over a third have infected with the corona pathogen.
The farm is now in quarantine and is locked with a fence.
No one is allowed to leave the area, no food is delivered.
The authorities now offer free corona tests to the well 3300 inhabitants of the municipality.
Since the harvesters had little contact with the local population, the Landratsamt so far assumes that the infections have not spread beyond the farm.
"Conscience bites": confession of the alleged arsonist of Nantes
"My client showed himself cooperatively," said the newspaper's lawyer Quentin Chabert.
The defender added: "He deeply regrets the deeds, the confession was a liberation for him."
His mandate was "panged by the bites of conscience and taken away very much from the extent of destruction".
In the event of a conviction, according to the Public Prosecutor's Office, ten years of imprisonment and a fine of 150,000 euros threaten the man.
The Gothic Saint-Peter-and-Paul Cathedral in Nantes had been severely damaged during a fire during the night on Saturday last week.
The fire broke out in the church in three places far from each other.
Laboratory tests hardened the suspicion of arson.
The now detained suspect had already been arrested a few hours after the fire.
He was released after a day.
The man worked as a volunteer for the diocese of Nantes and was responsible for the closure of the cathedral on the eve of the fire.
Since there was no trace of violent intrusion into the church, he quickly entered the field of view of the investigators.
Discuss the abolition of the 50+1 rule
Former DFB President Reinhard Grindel has recommended that the 50+1 rule be abolished.
"German football should at least discuss setting conditions and clear rules for investors before the EU Commission creates complete facts," Grindel said.
He stressed: "The 50+1 rules do not work for the clubs most likely to become dangerous in Bavaria and Dortmund: see Leipzig or Leverkusen.
In this respect, it is not around the debate whether it is necessary to facilitate the involvement of investors by associations wishing to break into this Phalanx".
He doubted, however, whether there was a willingness in the German Football League to allow majority participations prohibited in the Bundesliga by the 50+1 rule.
"It remains a legal risk to draw investment fences around the Bundesliga business location in a European internal market," said Grindel.
The former DFB boss sees the danger that "the attempts to ensure more competitive balance in the Bundesliga will ultimately only weaken the competitiveness of our top clubs at European level, but do not lead to more tension in the championship".
Even an equal distribution of TV funds would not produce a decisive effect.
"The FC Bayern makes a turnover of 750 million euros, Borussia Dortmund of 500 million and RB Leipzig of 300 million.
So the differences are already immense among the first three clubs alone.
The other 15 clubs have an average budget of 130 million," said the 58-year-old.
With a view to the past, Grindel feels betrayed.
"Unfortunately, there have been people who have noticed this mistake and gone through the press instead of addressing it," Grindel said about the adoption of an expensive clock that had led to his resignation in April 2019.
"I've been very busy with that humanly."
He had received the gift worth about 11,000 euros from a Ukrainian official.
"I committed a compliance violation, and it was right to draw the consequences from it," Grindel said.
"With the ominous watch gift, I was completely transparent and unwarranted.
Many in the DFB knew about it."
He had never "made a meal out of the gift," the 58-year-old assured.
"That may be called naive, at least this form of transparency was the complete opposite of corruption."
"Black Lives Matter": Injured and dead

Investigations were made.
Rakoczy in Bad Kissingen: Historical costumes defy Corona
Although the big sauce was missing in the spa city, visitors and actors enjoyed the Rakoczy-Flair of the alternative program.
It was unusual for visitors, actors and organizers: The Rakoczy weekend without Rakoczy-Fest.
But: Even though the big party mile in the city center was missing, the crowds and program highlights like Saale are burning, Rakoczy-Ball or trap, many of them were at their expense in the Corona-compliant alternative program.
"I think we have managed to spread Rakoczy-Flair," says Kurdirektorin Sylvie Thormann.
The guests would have accepted it well.
In principle, one returns to the beginnings of the Rakoczy festival, when the historians were in the focus of the festival alone.
Pleasant atmosphere
Vesna Konhäuser has been visiting the Rakoczy-Fest Bad Kissingen with her husband for more than 25 years.
So this time in the Corona year.
The couple has made it cozy at Luitpold Casino, watch the historians strolling and listen to Cuban live music at the playground restaurant.
"I also like it so much," says Konhäuser.
They do not miss the masses of people who otherwise belong to Rakoczy.
But for this you lack the usual program highlights, especially Saale burns on Friday evening as well as the historic ceremony and the final fireworks on Sunday evening.
"That's too bad.
The weather would have been great this year," she says.
Rakoczy riding tournament should take place again
For the actors of the historical spa guests, the alternative program partly meant more work.
For example, Christina Gold, who plays part in the train trip in a normal year and can be seen there on the carriage of the Kurgarten café.
This year she was walking in the city on Saturdays and Sundays in costume.
"That's more strenuous, otherwise we'll have it easier," she says.
The equestrian club had less to do, even if individual riders were on the way in the park.
"We very much hope that the riding quadrilles will take place again next year," says Chairman Ulrike Waldhofen.
She announced that after several years of break 2021 a Rakoczy riding tournament should take place again.
28 Corona cases in Spanish second league Fuenlabrada
The Spanish football secondligist CF Fuenlabrada slighs deeper and deeper into the crisis because of a Corona outbreak.
Since the newcomer from near Madrid, despite the first cases of Corona on July 20th, to fly to the city of A Coruña, a deep blow follows the next.
By Sunday, 28 players or team members had been tested positively, one came to the hospital, as the club announced.
Fuenlabrada from the city of the same name southwest of Madrid still had the chance to reach the ascent playoffs.
Now even the descent to the B-group of the Second League is threatening.

In photos it can be seen how players would have hung underwear and club clothing in their rooms in the hotel for drying after apparently having to wash them themselves.
Also, the bed linen had not been changed for five days.
Another problem is food.
Neither good nor sufficient, wrote "AS".
The club management, on the other hand, announced that they were satisfied with the hotel.
The lawyer of the club, Javier Tebas Llanos, rejected the accusation of deliberately threatening public health.
The son of the President of the Spanish Primera Division, Javier Tebas, as reported by the news agency Europa Press and the sports newspaper "Marca", had not been violated.
Before departure, there were four infected persons until July 19th, but they were all isolated and were not included.
All players and team members had been tested again right before the flight to A Coruña on Monday.
When the team was already in A Coruña, five or six other team members of the Corona test had been positive.
The game was cancelled 60 minutes before the appetizer, said Tebas Llanos.

Radprofi Tony Martin: Career continuation imaginable
Timer specialist Tony Martin thinks about a continuation of his career.
Frankfurt/Main - The seven-time world champion Tony Martin can imagine continuing his cycling career.
"I'm just covering the framework conditions with the team, how and in what way it could continue," said the 35-year-old of the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung".
Martin is currently employed by the Dutch team Jumbo-Visma and had considered ending his career after this year before the Corona break.
The negotiations with his team are also about the number of racing days, he said.
Or for other problems that would plague him as a family father, Martin said.
In the past he had risen after a fall, and the first thought had been: "Quickly back on the wheel.
Today, as a father of a little daughter, I think: What if."
The pro admitted that there are some aspects with which it is increasingly difficult.
"But it was good for me to know what I had in cycling and how much fun he was doing from the Corona time."
At the Tour de l'Ain (5th to 9th August), the time travel specialist enters the competition again.

"A high-ranking opponent like Monaco is a good test for us in terms of the game against Basel.
Like all Frankfurters, I look forward to seeing Niko Kovac again," said Eintracht-Trainer Adi Hütter.
The 50-year-old Austrian had succeeded the Croat in his uniform.
In March the Frankfurters lost the eighth final match against Basel in their own stadium with 0:3.

Argentina rejects counter-offer of creditors
The new demands could not be met, the Ministry of Economic Affairs in Buenos Aires announced on Saturday.
"This would not only be irresponsible, but also unfair," said one statement.
"While 50 percent of children live in poverty in Argentina, we cannot increase the short-term profits of our creditors."
The debt of the second largest economy in South America is no longer sustainable under current conditions.
Therefore, Argentina calls on its private creditors to waive some of its claims of around 66 billion US dollars (about 59 billion euros).
If there is no agreement, the country will once again be threatened by the state.
It would be the ninth default in Argentine history.
The lenders had demanded higher interest on government bonds and changes to some contractual clauses.
The Argentine government, however, holds on to its final offer and is not ready to make any further concessions.
Argentina is in a severe financial and economic crisis.
The inflation rate was last over 50 percent.
For the current year, experts expect an economic downturn of around ten percent.
At the end of May, Argentina had not paid interest claims of $503 million and had thus slipped into a limited payment failure.
Arrived professionally - privately not yet
"It's going super good" - this conclusion draws Dr. Stefanie Kramer after her first days at the notary in Eggenfelden.
At the end, everything went very quickly: in mid-May, Dr. Stefanie Kramer learned that she will succeed Lutz Feller in the Eggenfelden notary office.
Just six weeks later, at the beginning of July, the graduate lawyer took up the work, and the normal daily business has long been on full tour.
"I still have to arrive in private," she explains in conversation with the Rottaler anzeiger and laughs.
Of course, the short lead time had not been enough to move the food point from Regensburg completely to Eggenfelden, reports the native Dingolfinger.
She is currently looking for a suitable apartment or a house in the city with her husband, who is a judge at the Landgericht in Regensburg.
At least her husband was able to apply for parental leave in the short term in order to ensure the care of the two daughters (31⁄2 and 11⁄2 years old).
In order not to have to commute from Regensburg every day, she also had a chance to stay overnight with her parents in Dingolfing, explains the 39-year-old.
Grown up in the neighbouring district, the city of Eggenfelden is of course a long term term term.
During visits with her family in the past few months, she found: "Eggenfelden is a really beautiful small town".
She was all the more pleased that she had made the race in the competition for the job.
Also in Dr. Stefanie Kramer's professional career, her home town of Niederbayern plays a central role: After the law school in Passau, she completed her referendum period and the 2nd State examination in Regensburg.
After several stations as a notary artist, among others in Rehau and Hof in Oberfranken, Babenhausen in Unterallgäu and Regensburg - at that time she also trained "in addition" the doctorate in labour law - she took her first position as a notary in Rotthalmünster in the district of Passau in 2012.
In 2016 she went into parental age, after which she finally moved to Regensburg.
Since then, she has been in charge of representation services in various notarial offices.
When the position in Eggenfelden had been announced because of the imminent retirement of Lutz Feller, she had seen the right time for full professional re-entry, explains the 39-year-old.
The team of its predecessor, who will take over the office's holiday office in the future, has taken over Dr. Stefanie Kramer completely - and has a praise for the firm's team ready: "It's going great!"
It makes it easier for her to rely on recorded processes to take care of the forthcoming relocation of the private point of food.
In terms of kindergarten-respective cribs, she has already contacted a local institution.
And everything works as desired, she hopes to be able to follow her hobby here soon - and get to know the most beautiful jogging tracks of the Rottal.
BVB plans to start the league with a maximum of 15,000 spectators
Dortmund The largest German football stadium in Dortmund will not be filled even 20 percent for the start of the season in the event of a fan return.
"Due to the distance regulation that must be enforced, we are currently planning with 12,000 to 15,000 spectators," said Borussia Dortmund's Managing Director Carsten Cramer.
Usually, the arena in the district city at Bundesliga games holds just over 81,000 spectators.
In the ghost games of the past season caused by the Corona pandemic, the BVB had lost around four million euros per game.
Cramer, responsible for marketing, digitization and internationalization at BVB, hopes that in addition to the normal audiences, some of the approximately 4000 places in the hospitality area can be opened again: "It is of course a blow to the accountant when these revenues are completely broken away."
In view of the ongoing corona crisis, all "good advice to take a stable side length for the first time".
"If many companies are not doing well and 6.8 million people are in short-term work in Germany alone, then the need is limited to entertainment," said Cramer.
The Dortmund Marketing Chief praised the BVB professional for their partial renunciation, which is intended to help overcome the crisis: "Of course, the players know that their renunciation has a different effect than when we put 100 people working in merchandise on short work."
Tiny Miracles: Early start to life with a few hundred grams
Hardly heavier than a packerl of butter, just three tablespoons of blood in his entire body: that was Gabriel when he was born - he weighed exactly 273 grams.
The Bub is one of about 400 early children who are cared for annually at the Graz Children's Clinic.
A quarter of them weigh less than 1,500 grams, a few - like Gabriel and his brothers Raphael and Michael - are extreme lightweights with not even a kilogram of birth weight.
They are so small and so early that neither lung, nor intestine, nor muscle are fully trained.
Their skin is sometimes so tender that they could damage the electrodes of an ECG.
And they are so tiny that they sometimes wear doll clothing and mini-windles specially made for them.
But not so small that they wouldn't be in the mood - "and like", Berndt Urlesberger smiles.
"Even if, of course, they don't scream as loud as big babies."
When the whiteboard becomes the stage
Despite Corona Theater in the classroom: The whiteboard as a stage experienced the 9th classes of the Sankt-Jakobus-Gymnasium in Abtsgmünd shortly before the start of the holiday.
Actress Julia Sylvester from the Aalen Theatre presented the production "The Home Dress" to the students - via video.
The students were then able to share the play and performance with the actress and director Winfried Tobias via Skype.
The idea for the performance format was born from the current Corona situation.
Teacher Teresa Nar was pleased about the enrichment of the teaching.
Even though everyone agreed that the direct encounter in the theatre and stage room would provide additional incentives, the theatre also sees the potential for contact in the schools.
"If we continue to improve the technical framework, this could become an interesting addition to the game", said director Winfried Tobias.
First round triggered: the TSV 1860 would meet in the DFB Cup at Eintracht Frankfurt
Should the TSV 1860 qualify for the DFB Cup, the lions will meet in the first round at Eintracht Frankfurt.

Three years later, the award came as the best actress in William Wyler's "The Heiress" (The Erbin).
She was also awarded a lot of recognition as a neurotic eccentricist in "Der darken Spiegel" and "Die Slangngrube".
Daphne du Maurier proposed her for the lead role in the filming of her novel "My Cousine Rachel" in 1952.
The piece became a worldwide success.
With her long-standing friend Bette Davis, she played in "Weighing Song for a Body".
He married Marcus Goodrich (1946-1953) and was the son of Benjamin.
In Paris, de Havilland married the journalist Pierre Paul Galante and had the daughter Gisèle with him.
This marriage also broke.
However, rumors about an affair with former British Prime Minister Edward Heath have never been confirmed.
"Road to Timmendorf": Beach volleyball: Thole/Wickler miss finale at Comeback
The second World Championships Julius Thole and Clemens Wickler missed the final at the beach volleyball tournament "Road to Timmendorf".
At the meeting of the top teams in Düsseldorf, they presented their national team colleagues Nils Ehlers and Lars Flüggen with 1:2 (17:21, 21:17, 19:21).
In September of last year, Thole/Wickler had played at the World Tour Final in Rome.
In the final match on the Rhine, their conquerors Ehlers/Flüggen filed a defeat against the surprise team Lukas Pfrechner and his interim partner Steven van de Velde with 0:2 (17:21, 17:21).
In addition to the show tournament, three starting places for the German championships were played in Timmendorfer Strand at the beginning of September: the tickets secured Armin Dollinger/Simon Kulzer, Manuel Harms/Richard Peemüller and Simon Pfretschner/Milan Sievers.
Kalbitz outcast from AfD confirmed - FDP speaks of "fig leaf"
From the point of view of the FDP, Andreas Kalbitz's exclusion from the AfD is only a "fig leaf" and does not change the character of the party.
"The AfD is the parliamentary arm of the extreme right in Germany.
Andreas Kalbitz is only part of the tip of the iceberg of the radicals in the AfD," said FDP internal politician Benjamin Strasser of the news agency dpa in Berlin.
On Saturday in Stuttgart, the Federal Arbitration Court of the AfD confirmed the exclusion of Kalbitz, which the Federal Executive Board had decided by a majority in May.
Kalbitz is chairman of the AfD Group at Brandenburger Landtag.
"If the AfD were really about consistently removing right-wing extremists from their party, officials like Björn Höcke and his followers would have long been excluded," Strasser said.
"However, there is no political will in the AfD, because right-wing extremism now belongs to the party".
Similarly, CSU Secretary General Markus Blume said: "The fact that Andreas Kalbitz is now excluded does not say anything and does not change anything," he said to the "world on Sunday".
"It speaks more volumes, how many Frenetic supporters still have a right-wing extremity in the middle of the AfD."
Flower assumes that the AfD will again land below five percent at elections in the future.
"The days of the AfD in the parliaments are counted."
Kalbitz was one of the spokespersons of the officially dissolved "wings" around the Thüringer AfD country and political leader Björn Höcke; the protection of the Constitution considers it "secured right-wing extremist".
In May, the AfD Federal Board of Directors had thrown Kalbitz out of the party.
As a reason, he stated that Kalbitz had not indicated an earlier membership of the now banned right-wing extremity "Homely German Youth" (HDJ) and the Republicans at the time of his entry into the party.
Kalbitz contests membership in the HDJ.
The chairman of the Left Group in the Brandenburger Landtag, Sebastian Walter, also stressed that the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court did not change the character of the AfD: "The wolf only ate chalk.
The AfD remains a right-wing extreme party, whether with or without Kalbitz".
Neither the Federal Party nor the right wing will be weakened by this decision.
"The maneuver of the Meuthen-Truppe is perceptible.
They want to escape further observation through constitutional protection and try to get under the radar," said Walter.
"The AfD won't get rid of the spirits she called.
There's no change in a noise drop," commented the Brandenburg SPD Secretary-General Erik Stohn on the decision in the case of Kalbitz.
"Here the AfD national association and the group remained their right leader to this day."
The legal debate on Kalbitz's membership in the AfD will continue.
He announced on Saturday that he would now take civil action against the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court.
North Sea wind farms deliver well 21 percent more electricity
The wind power stations on the German North Sea fed 11.51 terawatt hours of electricity into the grid in the first six months of the year.
That's 21 percent more than in the same period of the previous year, the network operator Tennet announced in Bayreuth.
Tennet is responsible for the transmission of the North Sea electricity to the mainland and the transmission through the German electricity grid.
The wind turbines on the Baltic Sea, which are not part of the network area of Tennet, fed in a further 2.22 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity.
Overall, the wind current from the North and the Baltic Sea thus comes to 13,73 TWh, compared to a good 11,64 TWh in the first half of 2019.
The wind harvest at sea thus represents almost 19 percent of the total wind current in Germany, which is about four percentage points more than a year ago.
New wind farms provide higher production capacity
The increased contribution of offshore wind energy is seen in addition to the wind conditions resulting from higher production capacity, as new wind farms have been connected to the grid over the past twelve months.
If the 1270 wind power plants in the North Sea were all running with full power at the same time, they could generate 6.7 gigawatts of electricity in a arithmetic way.
The transmission capacity is sufficient; according to Tennet, it is 7.1 gigawatt.
It is expected to rise to 17 gigawatts in the German North Sea by 2030.
"In Germany and the Netherlands, we are investing 20 billion euros in the expansion of offshore network connections," said Tennet Managing Director Tim Meyerjürgens.
In reality, wind farms cannot exploit their capacity at sea, but reach about 40 percent.
This year's record day is January 2, when the North Sea wind farms generated more than six gigawatts of electricity.
On average, the North Sea wind turbines produce about 2.5 to 3.0 gigawatts of electricity, which corresponds to three to four nuclear power plants.
This could provide electricity to nearly seven million households.
Art "Skirmish" - an exhibition by the Leipzig artist Christian Bold at the Galerie des Gmündeer Kunstverein.
That was almost a little anniversary celebration for 130.
Birthday of the Gmünde Kunstverein: The opening of the exhibition "Skirmish" with works by the Leipzig artist Christian Bold sprang up the usual framework after the Corona break.
Much more art friends than usual followed the dialogue between the artist and the chairman of the Kunstverein, Professor Dr. Klaus Ripper.
The musical equivalent delivered the band "Defenders of the Universe" on the southern Kornhausplatz.
On the north side of the gallery, the association "Sandtogether".
Freital: Windbergfest for Corona cancelled
The Windbergfest is not taking place this year.
The city of Freital has cancelled the three-day festival planned in September.
In other years more than 30,000 people had visited this city festival.
"We have certainly not made this decision easy and - in awareness of how difficult it is for those involved - hoped until the last minute," said Mayor Uwe Rumberg (partisan).
"But in the end, we are responsible for the health of many thousands of people here as organizers."
For if tens of thousands had been flown to the land and to the tent, minimum distances, hygiene regulations and contact tracking could not have been observed in accordance with the current Corona Protection Regulation.
Or the restrictions would have been so strong that not much would have been left of a popular festival.
In addition, the organisational and monitoring effort would increase disproportionately by a lot.
Rumberg comforted himself next year.
Then the city of Freital celebrates its 100th anniversary with, among other things, the Winterberg Festival from 7th to 9th May 2021 and the day of the Saxony from 10th to 12th September 2021.
Dressage Olympic winner Werth in Achleiten not to beat
Achleiten - The six-time Olympic winner Isabell Werth was the outstanding rider at the dressage tournament in the Austrian Achleiten.
The 51-year-old from Rheinberg came to four victories on the weekend at four starts.
After she had won a Grand Prix for the opening of ordination gold and Quantaz, she was also on Sunday in the Grand Prix Special and in the freestyle.
On the 15-year-old mare Weihegold Werth made a clear stand against Austrian Victoria Max-Theurer on Abegglen on Sunday.
The Germans were on Quantaz on Saturday, too, in the freestyle of their 34-year-old student Victoria Max-Theurer.
Werth's winner horse Quantaz belongs to Max Theurer.
The most successful dressage rider in the world is to establish the ten-year-old stallion in the Grand Prix.
For Quantaz, it was the first choice at all.
Already at the first tournament in Achleiten three weeks ago Werth had won all important four exams.
The last of the three international tournaments is scheduled for August 14-16.
Future air traffic controllers in Worms
Wormser Hochschule goes on to the air: The "DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung" is a professorship for "Air Traffic Management".
A corresponding contract between the university and the DFS has now been signed in Worms.
The contract was first concluded for three years and starts in 2021.
With the professorship there is the possibility to enable the start of the study not only in the summer but also for the winter semester.
This allows twice as many students to be trained as before.
At the same time, the capacities are equally used at both the university and the DFS air navigation academy.
The DFS will advise the university on the establishment and occupation of the professorship.
represented at the university since 2019
Since the summer semester of 2019, the first students have been in the Air Traffic Management programme as part of their training as air traffic controllers at Worms University.
Nine students started this year.
So far, the experiences of the DFS are very positive, the achievements of the students are excellent.
The combination of study and pilot training contributes significantly to further increasing the attractiveness of the pilot profession.
"In these times, promotion is not easy for us economically.
However, we firmly expect that air traffic will recover and grow again in the long term.
In order to continue to fulfil our legal mandate, we need highly qualified staff," says Professor Klaus-Dieter Scheurle, Chairman of the DFS Executive Board at the signing of the contract.
"For the DFS, the Stiftung Professorship is a future-proof investment that will provide air traffic controllers with a broad, professional knowledge base in the long term.
We therefore continue our good cooperation with the university and at the same time support our attractiveness as an employer."
This is also underlined by Professor Dr. Jens Hermsdorf, President of Worms University: "The professorship of the foundation forms an important bridge between science and business.
With it, we would like to link up the already existing cooperation with the DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung as a practical partner for the dual Bachelor's program Air Traffic Management".
The trust of the German air navigation service is at the same time motivation and commitment for the Worm University to further develop its teaching and research expertise in the fields of the future of air transport.
With the first professorship of the foundation for a dual course of study, the university could set very special highlights and innovative priorities for its students in the field of air traffic controllers of tomorrow.
Dr. Denis Alt, State Secretary at the Ministry of Science, Training and Culture, stresses: "The Worms University has a unique feature in Rhineland-Palatinate with its focus on air transport.
Today's signing of the cooperation agreement strengthens the profile of the university".
Rescue helicopter lands on the A 45
The A 45 motorway was fully blocked on Saturday afternoon in the direction of Aschaffenburg, as after a traffic accident the rescue helicopters were in use.
A 76-year-old went straight out in the curve with a Ford around 12.40 o'clock in the Alzenau-Mitte exit and landed at the guiding board.
The impact caused the front airbags, the driver suffered minor injuries in the face and had to be taken to a hospital for treatment.
The injuries of the 72-year-old passenger were supplied by the emergency doctor and the patient flew to a hospital with the rescue helicopter.
At present, however, the police assume that there is no danger of life.
The damaged vehicle, on which a damage of about 2000 euros arose, had to be towed off.
According to the meat industry, heil wants to examine other industries
The Corona crisis brought to light the conditions in parts of the meat industry.
Law-enforcement is about to happen.
But are they right, and will they abide by it?
Federal Labour Minister Hubertus Heil (SPD) intends to review other sectors according to the strict rules now planned against abuses in the meat industry.
"We will look at our industry for industry and then take appropriate measures for the respective industry if necessary," said Heil of the German press agency in Berlin.
Germany's employers are already warning against restricting work contracts in general.
After the massive corona outbreak of the meat giant Tönnies in North Rhine-Westphalia, the Federal Cabinet intends to adopt a law of salvation on Wednesday.
Large-scale slaughterers should no longer be allowed to use foreign personnel in slaughter, cutting and meat processing.
To this end, the use of contract workers and temporary workers should be prohibited.
Employers President Ingo Kramer said the dpa: "Finger away from a general restriction of work contracts and workers' leave if one does not want to completely strangle the economy."
For example, for large areas of crafts, construction and plant construction contracts, the basis for their value added by the customer is mandatory.
"The sins of individuals cannot destroy such an important instrument."
Heil said: "My goal is not to ban works contracts anywhere in the German economy".
Work contracts are useful.
"When an industrial company instructs a craftsman to install a safety system, this is a normal factory contract."
The German meat industry considers that a ban on work contracts and loan work alone in its industry is unconstitutional.
It is not possible to explain why, in the future, the portioning and packaging of cheeses should be subject to different labour law from sausages, according to an opinion on the draft law, as reported by the "New Osnabrücker Zeitung" (Saturday).
Therefore, a ban would increase consumer prices by 10 to 20 percent per kilogram and product.
Many Eastern European workers from contract companies worked 16 hours a day in the industry following the results of an examination of the NRW Labour Protection Administration.
Often they had no break.
Wage was reserved for protective equipment or rent.
It was also noted that the situation in the accommodation of employees was often miserable.
Heil said that a relatively sharp law had already come into force for the meat industry in 2017.
However, these had been bypassed by "tricky constructions".
"Now it is essential to clean up".
The politician announced: "In the Labour Protection Act, which we want to adopt in the Cabinet at the end of July, measures not only concern the meat sector - for example, higher occupational safety testing rates or clear criteria for Community accommodation".
The present draft includes amendments to the law on the safeguarding of workers' rights in the meat industry and the Labour Protection Act.
Brandenburg's Minister for Consumer Protection Ursula Nonnemacher (Green) believes that more intensive controls are necessary.
"I would like us to be able to make even more controls in many supervisory areas: food controls, animal welfare, everything possible, for example animal transports," said Nonnemacher on Sunday in the RBB broadcast "Brandenburg aktuell".
However, more controls also require more staffing.
Three dead in the crash of ultralight aircraft in Germany
When an ultra-light aircraft crashed into a multi-family house in Wesel in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia, three people died according to the police.
A child was easily injured.
Two more people had been saved in the accident, said a spokesperson at the Wesel district control station.
A parachute had been found at the accident site, the police said.
The "Rheinische Post" reported, calling on eyewitnesses, that before the crash the plane had crashed with a hot air balloon.
At the house it is a single or two-family house.
Further details were not known at first.
Raumung von Frankfurter Opernplatz run peacefully
A week after the outrisings in Frankfurt, the room of the Opera Square in the night was peaceful.
Most recently, a few dozen people were still in the square, but left him before the beginning of the lockout at 1 o'clock.
The police had been in service with numerous officials since the early evening, and there was a larger police call throughout the city.
For the first time this weekend from midnight, there was a ban on the opera field, on which there had been scratches a week ago.
Police had been attacked out of the crowd with bottles.
At least five officers were injured after police inputs, several police vehicles were damaged.
The night to Saturday was also quiet.
Car skips: Young woman injured in case of accident on federal road 83 at Hofgeismar
In an accident between Schöneberg and Humme, a 21-year-old suffered serious injuries on Sunday at about 13.25.
She was taken to Kassel Hospital.
With thermal imaging cameras, the fire brigade sought potential co-pilots.
According to the police, the woman was on the road 83 towards her place of residence Humme when her car came off the road from the previously unexplained cause and overrun several times.
In order to save the accident, the fire department had to cut the roof of the car free.
Since it was unclear if someone was still in the vehicle, the adjacent corn field was searched from the rotary ladder with a thermal imaging camera.
The drone season from Warburg, which also works with thermal imaging cameras, had also been ordered for the search.
However, the forces did not find anyone among the tall corn plants.
The serious injury was brought to the Kasselsler Klinikum by the ambulance.
Almost 50 forces of the Hofgeismar fire brigade, Humme and Schöneberg were on site.
The federal road was closed for two hours because of the accident.
Juventus Turin Champion in Italy
Turin - After a redeeming goal by Cristiano Ronaldo, record champion Juventus Turin secured the Italian championship for the ninth time in series.
The team around the five-time world football team made the 36th Scudetto of the club's history perfect with a 2:0 (1:0) on Sunday evening in the home game against Sampdoria.
Ronaldo met at 1:0 a.m. before half-time.
With 83 points, Turin, who without the last long injured ex-national player Sami Khedira, is no longer forced away from place one two days before the end of the season of Serie A.
The second table of Inter Milan is seven points below.
Juventus was harmless despite optical superiority in the first half-time, then Ronaldo met after a release variant with the last action.
The 35-year-old of Miralem Pjanic used a flat shot directly from the criminal area border (45.+7).
Ronaldo was also involved in 2:0 against the now more offensive guests, after his shot he dusted Federico Bernardeschi (67.).
This ensured the complete but decisive success.
The follard meter shot at the latte in the 89th minute is likely to have just Ronaldo himself with regard to the score of the goal hunter.
"It is complicated to stay mentally and physically at ball height for 90 minutes.
The games are strange, and the momentum changes very slightly," explained Trainer Maurizio Sarri after the 1:2 at Udinese Calcio on Thursday.
Especially the mental exhaustion of its players is great, said the Juve coach.
Due to the defeat, the Turiners had not yet been able to make the championship perfect.
Juve's final calming advantage at the top of the table was due mainly to the weakness of the competitors.
In the eleven games before the game on Sunday, the Sarri team had only five victories.
It is questionable whether Ronaldo will also become a goalkeeper king.
While the Portuguese superstar had achieved 31 goals so far, the former Dortmundian Ciro Immolle had already 34 hits on his account at the Hellas Verona after his three-pack at the 5:1 (1:1) table four Lazio Rome - as many as Robert Lewandowski contributed to the title win of FC Bayern.
The record in Italy is held by the current Juve-Profi Gonzalo Higuaín.
The Argentines scored 36 goals for the SSC Naples in the 2015/2016 season.
In August, the next title chance awaits the "Old Lady" of Italian football.
Juventus is in the eighth finale of the Champions League, but on 7 August he has to compete against Olympique Lyon in order to reach the final tournament in Lisbon.
In the next K.o. round, Real Madrid or Manchester City would wait as an opponent.
Baden-Württemberg: Over 250 illegal car races recorded
Stuttgart - All in danger of penalties and court rulings in spite of the fact that in the case of countless illegal races, motorists continue to gas on the Baden-Württemberg streets: Last year and the first four months of this year, the police in the southwest have already registered more than 250 illegal car races.
There are no comparable values for the years before, but the racers are increasingly doing work for the judicial authorities: in 2018, a total of 155 investigation proceedings were conducted in the public prosecutors between Konstanz and Mannheim for illegal races, a year later it was 252 and in the current year until the beginning of June 151.
The race was less about organized events, as the Ministry of the Interior replied to a request from the Landtags-SPD.
In most cases the drivers have spontaneously fought against each other or they have taken the flight from the police - this is also indicated as an illegal race.
At the wheel was mainly German men aged 18 to 60.
113 Penalties - 15 times Imprisonment
Only in relatively few cases are the raser caught and also asked to pay the checkout: According to the Ministry of the Interior, a total of 113 fines have been imposed since 2018 and 15 imprisonment sentences have been pronounced.
There are no indications, however, that the number of illegal car races is actually increasing.
Rather, other drivers responded more sensitively than before because of the many tragic accidents and processes of past years and showed more frequently, said a ministerial spokesperson.
Especially popular with Rasern is the highway 8. Time and again motorists brake off traffic there to get space and use the free route for a race.
Last August a dozen riders were caught near Kirchheim under under Teck, three months earlier they were even 18 riders on the A8 at Merklingen.
A81 is the most popular race track
On the A81, the police register even more races than on any other federal highway.
With a tempo limit, the aim is to slow down the lawns on the particularly affected section between narrow and geising.
The most high-priced and well-boiled sports and luxury cars often have Swiss marks because the drivers avoid driving to Germany because of the high penalties for speedy driving and car racing in neighboring countries.
For the SPD, the tempo limit should not be reduced on a few routes: "With a general tempo limit of 130 kilometres, we would get rid of this problem on motorways," says Martin Rivoir, the transport expert of the SPD's state-of-the-art group.
"The inhibitory threshold for lawns would be significantly higher if you are not supposed to be legal here and there with 200 kilometres and more on the road".
Rivoir thinks less of education or image campaigns: "Whoever is in such a way overcoming all the rules and not only putting his own life at risk, but also the lives of other traffic users, is hardly yet accessible with reason".
ADAC calls for stronger police intervention
This is not enough for the ADAC: "We assume that Raser cannot be deterred from the tempo limits," says Holger Bach, Head of Transport and Environment at the ADAC Württemberg.
It requires additional and also harder checks on the routes concerned.
Not rarely does the high-touring mass of forces become more painful and follow-up serious: Since January 2019 and until April 2020, three people throughout the country died in the race, two of them uninvolved in a nightly crash in Stuttgart's city centre and one in Gerlingen.
Two young men were supposed to have made a car race there in November.
One of the vehicles came off the road, bumped against a garden wall, and remained on the side of the 18-year-old passenger who died.
21 more people were injured during the race of the past two years.
However, in the opinion of Interior Minister Thomas Strobl, sharper penalties are not necessary: "The need for legal action to sanction illegal motor vehicle racing is not seen," says the paper of the Ministry of Interior.
Blue light of July 23rd: thirsty breakers steal drinks from snacks
Rohrdorf: A man broke into a snack on Thursday in Rohrdorf (Kreis Calw) and stole drinks and cash.
A witness heard about 3.40 a.m. noises in the valley road and ran toward the snack.
There he noticed a man who was serving on the fridge with drinks and left the snack following by a previously opened entrance door.
The perpetrator fled to the meadows behind the snack.
According to police, the burglar also used a cash desk and stole cash in the low three-digit area.
The suspect is described as follows: It is about 1.75 to 1.80 meters tall and of strong stature.
In fact, he wore a black hooded sweater, black pants and light shoes.
The police receive further evidence.
Ackermann sprints for victory on final stage at Sibiu Tour
Radprofi Pascal Ackermann won his second day on the final stage of the 10th Sibiu Tour.
The 26-year-old Palatinate from the Bora-hansgrohe team was established on the 109-kilometre-long section with its start and finish in Hermannstadt in the mass sprint after winning a stage on Saturday.
It was the season victories three and four for Ackermann.
In the overall ranking, his Austrian teammate Gregor Mühlberger prevailed.
The 26-year-old had decided for himself on the morning and thus took over the top in the classification.
Only 104 riders had joined the final stage in the evening.
No less than 18 starters had fallen victim to the time limit in the mountain season.
"I'm really happy to start the season restart with a victory," Ackermann explained after his success on Saturday.
"The sprint was really hectic," said the 26-year-old.
300 meters before the finish he simply put on his sprint, "and it also worked perfectly."
In accordance with the rules of the World Federation of the UCI, a Corona test was carried out six days before the start of the race for all race participants and their companions.
During the complete tour, drivers and caregivers in isolated hygiene bubbles were separated from the organization team and the media.
Viewers at the start and target were not allowed.
Head Office gave instructions for lay resuscitation
Düsseldorf - Tragic accident on Sunday afternoon in Düsseldorf-Garath.
In a multi-family house, a child (4) suddenly lay in the water lifeless while swimming.
According to fire brigade, the emergency call arrived shortly before 1 p.m.
"A management Participant immediately gave instructions on lay-resuscitation," said a fire-responsor to BILD.
The incoming rescue forces took over the revival measures a little later.
The child in danger of death was transported to the University Hospital under resuscitation.
Why it failed is unclear.
The police routinely started investigations into the accident.
The fire fighter: "We're starting from a tragic accident in the apartment."
Nuremberg: Unauthorized Tuning Meeting - Police intervenes, 700 vehicles and around 1100 people
Hundreds of cars and temporarily more than 1000 people participated on Saturday night in a "Tuning meeting" in the parking lot of a furniture house.
The police implemented their announcement to strengthen control of such events.
A big tuning meeting took place on Saturday evening (July 25, 2020) in Nuremberg's southern city.
Several hundred vehicles were involved.
According to the Mittelfranken police, an increased number of vehicles in the area of a large parking lot on the Ingolstadter Straße had been detected by the Nürnberg traffic police at about 22.30 a.m.
The police then carried out a variety of vehicle controls there.
Only recently had the police announced that they would want to take greater action against so-called autoposers.
Illegal Tuning Meeting in Nuremberg: Only a small part of the "scene"
The officials counted well 700 vehicles and about 1100 people, the police reported.
However, only a small proportion of those present in the "Autoposer" and " Tuningscene" are to be attributed to this.
Apparently, most of the relevant scene followed the appeal of the police.
On the basis of the on-the-spot vehicles and persons, it is assumed that these were mainly scrutinised.
In addition, the majority of those present were in line with the current anti-infection regulations, in particular the maintenance of the minimum distance and the carrying of a mouth-to-speech protection.
The on-the-spot control measures were completed by 9 a.m.
In total, the officials found such structural changes in 10 vehicles that the operating permit had expired.
Four of these vehicles had to be ensured.
No car racing
Illegal car races didn't exist.
"The police presidium will continue to keep the events in mind and continue to carry out enhanced control measures, including in connection with the emergence of scrutinists," it said.
The agency News5 spoke to Jürgen Schrödinger of the participating towing company: "They have all the beautiful rims that we can't scratch," says Schrödinger.
Special tapes would be used for this purpose.
Even because the cars are wider, the company had to be careful not to cause any damage.
"The young people are supposed to get their cars back unharmed."
Employment agency figures: 900 suspected abuses in short-term work
Berlin - The Bundesagentur für Arbeit (BA) according to its own statement, about 900 suspected cases of abuse of the short-term worker's allowance.
"This is extremely little for more than 880.000 companies that have reported short-term work," said Daniel Terzenbach, Managing Director responsible for the operating business of the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung".
When, at the beginning of the Corona crisis, a lot of companies had suddenly applied for short-term work, BA had to react quickly.
The test usually lasts up to three weeks.
"So much time was not available to us in this hot phase.
That's all the more precise we'll look at the accounts.
I'm sure there's going to be some more.
We are not naive and have a long breath."
Indications of abuse often come from the affected employees or trade unions.
In addition, BA uses analysis software to identify abuse patterns.
According to Terzenbach, BA is preparing for a possible insolvency disorder in autumn.
"Will there be significantly more insolvencys than in the previous year?
The assessments are disintegrating, but in the case of the case, we are ready to train our employees in the employment agencies for the processing of claims for insolvency money."
The figures are still inconspicuous, said Terzenbach.
World Heritage in Potsdam: Party in the New Garden Dissolved
Potsdam - On Friday evening about 40 young people celebrated a party in the New Garden.
The collection had been dissolved at 8.48 p.m. by the local drivers of the Stiftung Prussian Schlösser und Garten (SPSG), the Foundation announced on PNN request.
The young people would have left the park.
On Saturday evening, some youths would have played Rugby in the New Garden.
The meadow had been cleared by local drivers, said SPSG spokesman Frank Kallensee on Sunday.
Time and again there are illegal celebrations in the parks
In the Foundation’s parks, there are repeated collections where the Covid-19 transit regulation does not comply with the rules on distance and hygiene.
At the end of June there was a celebration with about 300 people in the Park Babelsberg, a week later about 150 people celebrated in the Neue Garten.
Even without a coronary decree, the parks are closed in the event of a dark break.
Camping on the meadows is prohibited according to park regulations, there are few exceptions.
The Foundation has been complaining for a long time that visitors would leave more and more garbage and destroy protected biotopes.
In Berlin, illegal park parties have reached a different dimension.
In the Hasenheide district of Neukölln, 5,000 people celebrated an illegal techno party at night.
The event was dissolved by the police.
Austria: Mass Tests after Corona Eruption in Tourist Location
With hundreds of tests, authorities have responded to a Corona outbreak in the popular Upper Austrian tourist resort of St. Wolfgang.
The number of confirmed cases increased to 48, as reported by the Landing Authorities in Linz.
More than 100 results were outstanding in the evening.
As a result, many of the infected young interns are in tourism establishments, but at least one holiday guest has been tested positively.
Residents, guests and tourism staff were asked to stay in their accommodation on Saturday evening.
The blocking hour was set at 23 o'clock.
"There are cancellations and cancellations there and there" of bookings, said the head of the Tourist Association Wolfgangsee, Hans Wieser, the dpa.
Also individual guests should leave early.
St. Wolfgang is the most important tourist resort in Upper Austria, with more than 400,000 overnight stays last year.
In a normal season about a third of the guests are German.
On Friday the first infections had become public.
On Saturday, the head of the district authority, Alois Lanz, defended the behavior of the interns who had celebrated and could have infected in several locations.
"We all liked this in our youth," he told the radio station Ö1.
However, two bars were closed on Friday to prevent further infections.
The Tourism Association launched an information campaign to raise awareness of the dangers of Covid-19.
From Saturday, hundreds of employees, vacationers and locals were tested.
In addition, all guests who were in St. Wolfgang from 15 July were contacted.
The outbreak arouses memories of the Austrian ski and party town of Ischgl in Tyrol, which was a centre of corona spread throughout Europe in the early stages of the pandemic.
A total of more than 1500 people are currently infected with the virus in Austria.
The new infections focus on Vienna and Upper Austria.
Premier League: Man United and Chelsea qualified for Champions League
London (dpa) - English football record champion Manchester United returns to the Champions League after a year's absence.
On the last day of the Premier League, the Red Devils secured the third place by a 2:0 (0:0) success against the direct competitor Leicester City.
The Foxes now have to be satisfied with the Europe League, because the FC Chelsea still passed and qualified as fourth for the King's class as well.
In the fight against the descent Aston Villa was allowed to cheer.
Manchester United led by Bruno Fernandes (71st minute).
After a Red Card for Leicester City in the replay period, Jesse Lingard (90.+8) came to the end.
Chelsea, in the Champions League final opponent of FC Bayern, won with 2:0 (2:0) against Wolverhampton Wanderers thanks to Mason Mount (45.+1) and Olivier Giroud (45.+4).
"This means a lot to me," said coach Frank Lampard, who is also in the finale of the FA Cup against Arsenal in his first season as Chelsea coach.
Chelsea's victory against Wolverhampton also benefited Tottenham Hotspur, who was still passing the Wolves with a thin 1:1 (1:0) at Crystal Palace and started sixth in the Europe League.
Aston Villa decided to use Watford and the AFC Bournemouth, but had to shudder for a long time at West Ham United.
The late tour of Jack Grealish (84.) immediately compared Andrej Jarmolenko (85.).
The 1:1 (0:0) was enough because Watford lost 2:3 (1:3) at Arsenal.
The club, which shot three trainers in the season, descends after five first league years.
Just like Bournemouth, who could no longer save himself through a 3:1 (2:1) at Everton FC.
In the end there was a point missing.
FC Liverpool, who has been established as an English champion since the end of June, secured a club record with a 3:1 (1:1) victory at Newcastle United.
99 counters are the highest value the Reds have ever achieved in a football season.
Coach Jürgen Klopp and his team barely missed the score record in English football.
The best brand holds Manchester City with 100 points in the 2017/18 season.
After the Newcastle lead in the first minute, Virgil van Dijk (38th), Divock Origi (59th) and Sadio Mané (89th) played the game on Sunday for Liverpool.
"For this wonderful club it was an extraordinary season," said Torschütte van Dijk after the game, "that should encourage us to defend the title.
It's going to be hard".
In the end, the Premier League boss is probably satisfied.
Because of the Coronavirus crisis, the football operation in England had been interrupted from March 13 to June 17.
In the meantime, even an early termination or a release of the remaining games on neutral ground was discussed.
Finally, however, the season could be finished without special events - but as in Germany without spectators in the stadiums.
Arrests and violence in demonstrations against Netanyahu
The protests in Israel against head of government Netanyaius are becoming more and more violent.
In the night, violent conflicts have taken place.
The Israeli police took violent action in the night of Sunday in Jerusalem against participants in a demonstration against the right-wing conservative head of government Benjamin Netanyahu.
Twelve people had been arrested for participation in unrest, said police spokesperson Micky Rosenfeld.
The police, among other things, used waterthrowers to disband the rally.
Overall, according to media reports on Saturday evening, some 6,000 people had gathered near Netanyahu's office.
They protested against unemployment, corruption and Netanyahus dealing with the Corona crisis.
The protesters beat drums, blew in horns, and called Netanyahu to resign.
Participants of an area demonstration supported by Netanyahu were also arrested, the news page "ynet" reported.
People also demonstrated in many other places in Israel, including in front of the private villa of the head of government in the coastal city of Caesarea and in a park in Tel Aviv.
A man was arrested after police statements near Tel Aviv because it is suspected that he sprayed from a driving car of pepper spray on demonstrators on the roadside.
Another man was arrested after a trade fair attack on a demonstrator in the south of the country.
The demonstrator had been slightly injured on the neck.
In Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, there have been several demonstrations against Netanyahu.
The rallies accompany the corruption process against the head of government.
Netanyahu was most recently criticized for handling the Corona crisis.
Among other things, he is given rapid easing and a lack of preparation for a second corona wave.
The Corona crisis has hardly added to the country's economy.
The unemployment rate was last over 20 percent.
The number of new infections with the Coronavirus in Israel has finally increased to ever new record values.
Accident at Ahlen (NRW) - Transporter force on car - nine injured - Ruhrgebiet - Bild.de
Ahlen - On Saturday afternoon on the B58 at Ahlen, an accident caused nine minor injuries.
A car driver was on her way with her two children (3,5) towards Beckum.
The police said, "It was likely that she had suddenly slowed down because she wanted to bend down."
The driver of a Mercedes transporter who drove behind her must have seen this too late.
He hit the back of the car.
In the accident, three inmates in the car and six in the transporter were slightly injured.
Several ambulances took them to a surrounding hospital.
North Korea locks out border city after Corona suspicion
To date, North Korea has seen a "lightening success" in its own measures to combat the corona virus.
Now the country is reporting a suspicion for the first time.
Because of a first official Corona suspicion in the country, North Korea has completely sealed a big city out of fear of a disaster.
Despite the strictest epidemiological defense measures in the last six months, "the evil virus could have been introduced into the country," the state media reported.
For the region around the border town of Kaesong the emergency situation had been imposed.
The Communist leadership called for the highest level of alert.
Should the suspicion be confirmed, it would be the first official case of infection with Sars-Cov-2 in the shot-off country.
To date, North Korea has not registered a single infection and described its defence as a "light success".
The data were questioned abroad.
The disease symptoms were reportedly found in a "outbreaker" who illegally crossed the military demark line between South and North Korea on 19 July.
The person had moved to South Korea three years ago and had now returned across the border.
For the border crossing within the four-kilometre-wide and largely still lacking military buffer zone, South Korea did not at first have a confirmation.
However, South Korea's military, according to reports by the national news agency Yonhap, recognized the possibility of illegal border crossing to North Korea as high.
Some people were under investigation.
According to North Korea, on Saturday, because of the suspected urgency meeting of the Labour Party Politburo under the chairmanship of Kim Jong Un.
The "hazardous situation in Kaesong could trigger a deadly and destructive disaster".
Kim had already arranged on Friday as a preventive measure to "block Kaesong completely and isolate every district and region from others," it continued.
The person concerned, as well as all the people in Kaesong who had had contact with her, had been put under quarantine.
The party's central military commission is therefore supposed to investigate the "outbreak" as well as the conduct of the responsible military unit and, if necessary, impose severe punishment.
It is estimated that in Kaesong about 300,000 people live.
Tension in front of the Council: City-East and noise protection are still under discussion before a big summer break
"In addition to environmental issues, the committee members will also vote on the plan for building the large-scale project of the city centre development-east," says it rather casually in the middle of the urban press release to the next municipal council meeting on Tuesday, 28 July, at 4.30 p.m. in the Großen Saal of CongressCentrums Pforzheim.
In particular, the appreciation of the eastern city is, however, debated controversially until the end.
The majority of this is scarce, most recently in individual committees, even dissuasive depending on the presence.
An appeal from the economy (construction, real estate, commerce and IT), which is now not to fail after nearly ten years of preparation from the administration and then from the municipal council, criticised project opponents Reinhard Klein as "non-parliamentary opposition", "unimaginable", "speculation", "debtment" and "conscious false statements".
"Everyone thinks it's better to know," said Klein, who has been the only representative of the Pforzheim Citizens' List for a year.
In fact, after reading the Treaties, he was in this position: "I know what I'm talking about".
The city's exit is cheaper, the Technical City Hall is opposed to statements by the city administration after subsidies, whose existence is small, to clean up for 8.5 million euros.
The city will develop very differently than it is predicted in the town hall and by the proponents of the economy.
To design the city by its own strength and not an investor: that is its plan B. One day after Klein, the FDP/FW/UB/LED Group, which also rejects the project, presented an alternative concept.
It also essentially provides for the renovation of the Technical City Hall, the opening of the castle, the renting of the ex-thale for administrative areas and a small part of the city center transformation ideally with local carriers.
Environmental issues play a central role
In addition, environmental issues in particular will play a central role.
Among other things, the municipal council will vote on the noise action plan.
This includes various measures to protect the Pforzheim population from health noise caused by road traffic, including frequent speed reductions.
In a press release, the local transport club Germany welcomes the widespread introduction of tempo 30. However, the political leaders in the city are not innocent of having to do so because, by neglecting the liner bus traffic with thinned speeds and by little commitment to cycling, they have only contributed to the massive increase in car traffic and therefore noise, according to the VCD.
The municipal council also agrees on the participation of the city of the energy and climate protection agency Pforzheim/Enzkreis.
It is also on the agenda of the accession to the Baden-Württemberg climate pact, the redefinition of parental contributions in the urban day-care institutions and the application for membership in the federal Smart City funding.
Citizens are welcome, but need to pay attention to Corona protection measures.
Tim Zimmermann starts the new season with much delay
With almost half a year delay, Tim Zimmermann will start his first season in the ADAC GT Masters on July 31.
Before the league of the super sports car can start the regular operation, the first test runs were on.
For Zimmermann, it was mainly about getting to know his Lamborghini Huracan GT3.
For a long time, the Corona crisis has prevented Tim Zimmermann from taking up his first service in the new Lamborghini Huracan of Grasser Racing.
Under special hygiene conditions, this was now possible.
The 23-year-old Langenargen turned his first laps on the Lausitzring and was able to get used to his premiere in the GT3 car.
"There are a few things that are different from the Porsche from the previous season," says Zimmermann.
"With the ABS, for example, you have to go differently into the curves.
But it's really been a lot of fun."
Zimmermann also had fun with Steijn Schothorst, with which he will share his orange sports car in the GT Masters.
Despite his only 25 years of experience in GT sports, the Dutchman has been able to help his new teammate in many things.
"I'm not a beginner in motor sports, but every new series also presents new challenges," says Zimmermann.
"Steijn and I understand ourselves dazzlingly and we also made enormous progress from session to session at the Lausitzring."
Right there - at the Lausitzring - the GT Masters will also host its first race.
From 31 July the 33 super sports cars will race through the Lausitz.
Zimmermann, who is one of 15 new serials, knows the route.
In 2015, he was last guest in Motodrom.
"It worked fast and I had little to get used to," says Zimmermann, who starts for the Friedrichshafen Renngemeinschaft Graf Zeppelin.
"The Lausitzring has many fast passages that you have to meet optimally in order to be fast."
How fast carpenter really is, it turns out in two weeks.
"Of course, the teams poker a little at the tests," he says.
"But finally we are very satisfied and look forward to the first weekend at the Lausitzring".
The race in Brandenburg will be the start of a densely pushed calendar.
Seven races will be on until the beginning of November.
The current state is that no spectators will be allowed - but there is a prominent guest.
In mid-August at the Nürburgring, former Formula 1 pilot Niko Hülkenberg will reach into the GT steering wheel.
British transport minister of quarantine decision caught cold
The British Government’s decision to put Spain’s holidaymakers in quarantine for two weeks after their return, according to press reports, has caught the country’s transport minister coldly.
According to this, Grant Shapps is currently on vacation in Spain, while his colleagues at home decided to take the measure on Saturday.
Due to the again rising number of coronas in Spain, London's cabinet removed the country from the list of countries from which entry without quarantine is possible.
The new regulation will apply from today, Sunday, so Shapps will have to return to quarantine.
In Austria, the government has also imposed quarantine measures on returnees.
But the scheme applies to those who are only on the day of holiday, only from Saturday, August 1, and was not introduced overnight.
In Austria, by the way, Spain has been regarded as one of the "safe countries" for which there is no need for quarantine in Austria.
"Many ministers should have known in advance that there is a possibility that a quarantine will be imposed on vacationers in Spain," commented Labour deputy Diane Abbot.
"But obviously no one has bothered to tell Grant Shapp's message."
Nearly one month after the end of the Corona emergency in Spain and the expiry of the severe exit barrier, the infection rates in the country are rising again.
In particular, virologists make nightlife responsible for the new spread.
Spain is one of the most popular holiday countries in the UK.
The British Government is currently dissuading from non-essential travel to mainland Spain, with the exception of British holidaymakers and Canary Islands.
So far, more than 272,000 infections have been registered in Spain with the novel corona virus and more than 28,000 deaths.
Russia: Day of the Navy: Putin announces hypersonic weapons for warships
Russian President Vladimir Putin announced on the day of the Navy in his country a equipment of warships with state-of-the-art hypersonic weapons.
With these weapons unique in the world, the fighting opportunities of the Russian naval forces would be expanded, said Putin on Sunday in St. Petersburg at the central naval paradise.
According to Interfax, the Ministry of Defence also informed Interfax about successful tests of the naval hypersonic missile Zircon.
The hypersonic weapons have a multiple of the sound speed of around 343 meters per second.
They are considered weapons of the future.
Underwater Tropedeo continues to be built
It was also built on the atomicly fitted underwater torpedo Poseidon.
The planned seafood is planned for the destruction of coastal targets.
The president, who himself also used a military boat, said that 40 new ships would be put to service this year alone in the individual fleet associations of the largest country in the world.
Russia has such a large coastal area as no other country in the world.
For 300 years, the Navy has been reliably protecting Russia, said Putin at the day celebrated by sailors throughout the country.
Also in many other Russian coastal towns, the marine forces embarked on the marine day with parades.
In Syria, where Russia is fighting alongside forces of Bashar al-Assad, the military demonstrated strength at a arms show in the Mediterranean port of Tartus.
There, ammunition was also fired.
In a video published by the Ministry of Defence, not only warships, including a submarine, but also fighter helicopters and jets, were to be seen.
Hurricane "Hanna" reaches Texas: Help made difficult because of Corona
Washington - The first hurricane of this year's season across the Atlantic has hit land in Texas.
Life-threatening floods, strong winds and violent rains now threatened parts of the U.S. state, reported the National Hurricane Center of the US Climate Agency NOAA at night on Sunday (local time).
Governor Greg Abbott proclaimed the emergency for many districts.
The Texas-grassing Corona pandemic made the work of the helpers difficult, Abbott continued according to US media.
Evacuated for Caution Called
"Every hurricane is a huge challenge," said Abbott, according to the Houston Chronicle newspaper.
In view of the twilight in Texas, he added: "This challenge is complicated and is aggravated by the fact that it sweeps through an area that is the most affected by Covid-19 in the state".
According to Johns-Hopkins University, approximately 5,000 people have died in Texas alone as a result of the Corona pandemic.
Abbott called for caution on people who had to leave their homes.
You should not ignore practices that we have used to, for example wearing masks, the governor said, according to the station CBS.
It is important that all distances were kept.
Therefore, hotel rooms have been provided in some places.
In addition, emergency accommodation should be tested on Corona.
At first damage had only been reported from the coastal city of Port Mansfield.
Storm warning taken back
At wind speeds of up to 150 kilometers per hour, "Hanna" was hit on land on the island of Padre Island, according to authorities.
The tropical storm had previously been elevated to the lowest level of hurricane.
For the coastal section from Port Mansfield to Sargent, a storm flood warning had first been issued and later withdrawn.
Authorities expected a weakening, while "Hanna" continued to move into the interior of the country and to turn to the north-east of Mexico.
"Douglass" moves to Hawaii
In the Pacific, Hurricane "Douglas" was on the way to Hawaii on Sunday with wind speeds of about 150 kilometers per hour.
However, the Hurricane Center expected to continue to weaken.
According to the prediction, it is supposed to be on Sunday (local time) near the largest islands of Hawaii - then as a storm just below the hurricane threshold.
This year, after a forecast of May, NOAA expected an above-average active Hurricane season above the Atlantic Ocean.
From June to the end of November, up to ten hurricanes could be expected, of which up to six could be very severe vortex storms, had the authority declared.
On average, there are six hurricanes per year above the Atlantic, three of which develop into storms of great strength.
In view of the climate data available and the higher water temperature in the Atlantic and Caribbean, the probability of a normal season was only 30 percent, which was an underaverage even at ten percent.
US President Donald Trump wrote on Twitter that his government was watching the storms closely and was in contact with the affected states.
Four gates recognized: video assistant "punished" Sassuolo
Sassuolos Filip Djuric were recognized two goals
Naples - Four goals achieved, four goals recognized: Sassuolo Calcio experienced a ravenish evening at 0:2 (0:1) at the SSC Naples in the Italian football league series A - and was really mad at the video assistant of the referee.
"A festival of ungiven gates for Sassuolo.
The VAR has never been so hard on a team," commented Corriere dello Sport.
Host Naples had been guided by a gate by foreign defender Elseid Hisaj in the 8th minute, in which 32nd minute Filip Djuric first rejoiced the compensation.
The Video Assistant Referee (VAR) withdrew the hits due to a remote position.
Five minutes later Djuric shot the ball again in the net - again the VAR intervened.
Also the goals of attacker Francesco Caputo (50.) and Domenico Berardi (61.) the referee team withdrew after mentioning the VAR.
In the replay period, Allan made the 2-0-end for Naples and the bitter evening for Sassuolo perfect.
"The VAR is worse for Sassuolo than a radar attack on the street and punishes Sassuolo like no team before.
The new technology provides records," writes the "Gazzetta dello Sport".
FC Bayern Munich: Pavard injured
Munich (dpa) - The start to the hot preparatory phase for the Champions League began for double winner FC Bayern with a setback.
After a short holiday and a few days of training, Hansi Flick recovered "somehow well" after the first team training, he has to think about how he can rebuild his successful defense after the injury of World Champion Benjamin Pavard.
The Frenchman, who is behind Captain Manuel Neuer and Middle Field Chief Joshua Kimmich, has had the third most of the use minutes, suffered a band injury at the left foot root and threatens to be missing in decisive king-class duels.
In the Munich Schmuddelwetter, the legal defender broke off a training game and was driven off the course with a golf cart.
How long the unlimited regular player has to pause in the fight for the title is open.
The 24-year-old may hope for a commitment to the eighth-final against the FC Chelsea on August 8th, for the final tournament starting in Lisbon on August 12th.
But the Bavaria do not want to be stopped by the miscarriage of the training on Sunday.
Flick mentioned in his personal triple formula the three attributes he wants to see from his stars on the way to Portugal's capital.
Quality, intensity and concentration are supposed to show his winning title collectors in the ideally next 28 days to the King Class Endgame on August 23.
"We have simply mastered the duty tasks with championship and cup excellent.
Now it's up to us to create something special," said Flick.
Until the Munichers can deal with the final tournament and previously a training camp at the Algarve in concrete terms, however, the eighth final duty is on against the FC Chelsea.
After the 3–0 play in front of the Corona Pause, the Londoners in the local arena should not become a Bayern nightmare like in the lost "Final dahoam" in 2012.
"We have to go through the door first.
We want to win, create good conditions and recharge confidence with a good game," Flick demanded.
A vote test is on Friday against Olympique Marseille.
With a long speech, Flick had sworn his stars, who had been on holiday after the double 13 days, on a unique August.
He welcomed 31 players on Säbener Straße, including the new players around Edel-Shopping Leroy Sané, who first met all new colleagues on the square after his change from Manchester City.
"Leroy has inserted himself well like all the new ones," Flick reported.
But instead of talking about the new season, if Sané & Co. are no longer allowed to train, Flick would rather talk about the current title project of the German series champion.
After days of single and small group training, the team is now trained in strength for the Londoners, who are in contrast to the Flick ensemble in play rhythm.
After that, the Munichers could have a quarter final against the Barcelona FC and Lionel Messi, and in the semi-finals, Real Madrid, Manchester City or Juventus Turin are possible opponents.
One way to the final in Lisbon "is not quite as easy," stressed the chief coach, who can rely on the services of his new assistant Miroslav Klose in training from Tuesday.
The World Cup Recorder Klose and Flick know about such a common tournament preparation, which is particularly important for the 0-to-100 vote.
With his current team the work was "a pleasure", Flick praised.
The "focus on winnings" is an impressive trait of his team.
The tournament with Neuner teams was also ambitious on Sunday.
Of the service providers, all were present, including the demigrant Thiago and defender David Alaba, whose stay is not guaranteed beyond the king-class season.
Formula 1 needs a special rule to curtail its world champion
Since the required number of continents cannot be driven, the FIA has to improvise in order to award the World Cup titles.
All America races, however, have been cancelled.
Racing Calendars are becoming more and more concrete
The racing calendar of the current Formula 1 season continues to take shape.
In addition to the ten confirmed Grand Prix, three more racetracks were added during the week.
In October at the Nürburgring in Germany and in the Portuguese Portimão will be driven.
On November 1st, Lewis Hamilton and Co. fight for World Cup points on the Italian traditional race track in Imola.
This will include 13 races in the racing calendar 2020 at current level.
"We are pleased that we continue to make great progress in the completion of our plans for the 2020 season," said Formula 1 boss Chase Carey.
A total of 15 to 18 races will be held in the King's Class of Motorsports during this exceptional season.
Formula One wants to finish its season in Asia.
The final race calendar will be fixed and published in the coming weeks.
According to media reports, there could still be performances in Vietnam and Malaysia at the end of November before the officially scheduled races in Bahrain and Abu Dhabi in December.
Rules require races on three continents
However, the Formula One Rules require at least three continents to be awarded the World Championships.
Even if, as is currently planned, only two continents are to be driven, there should be a world champion.
With the help of a special rule, the FIA intends to award the titles under "Exceptional Circumstances" because of the coronavirus pandemic.
The traditional start of the season in Australia in March had to be cancelled in the short term due to the onset of the Corona crisis.
A return to the continent this year is not a topic.
In addition, Formula One will not be a guest in America this year.
Rejection meets with criticism in Brazil
Due to the tense corona situation, the races will not take place in Canada, the USA, Mexico and Brazil.
"We are looking forward to being with them again in the next season," Carey said.
The rejection of the Americas was particularly critical in Brazil: "The rejection was not surprising for us, but we cannot accept the reasons," said Tamas Rohonyi, promoter of the Grand Prix in São Paulo.
Thus, the infection figures in the area of São Paulo are significantly lower than in other regions of Brazil.
Moreover, the concerns of some teams about not wanting to drive in Brazil would not justify any rejection.
The required security measures have been prepared.
Greta Thunberg: Bad look at Donald Trump went around the world
Greta Thunberg spoke about her meeting with US President Donald Trump.
Greta Thunberg was a guest in Stephen Colbert's well-known latenight show and revealed what she had in mind during her interview with Donald Trump.
Klimaatkivistin Greta Thunberg was a guest in a popular US latenight show.
Among other things, she told of her fight against the powerful of the world.
The teenager also spoke about her famous "evil gaze" during her encounter with Donald Trump.
New York City - Over the past two years, climate activist Greta Thunberg has been drawing attention to herself with her tireless commitment to the Fridays For Future movement.
Now, in a well-known latenight show, she talked about her plans in the future as well as her meeting with US President Donald Trump at the UN Climate Summit last year.
Latenight presenter Stephen Colbert welcomed 17-year-old Thunberg on Tuesday in your show and conducted a longer interview with the Swedish woman.
She talked not only about her fight against climate change, but also about her conflict with the world's powerful people.
"There are some things that surprised me," she said.
"How far people are going to turn the focus away from the climate crisis," she shook.
"Everything from organized hate campaigns to threats, just because a group of children is going to the street" she experienced.
Head of state and leading politicians who ridicule them in social media or even try to silence them, she finds "happiness" because she shows the reactions "because they have no other answer to them".
It became particularly interesting at the end of the interview when Greta Thunberg was addressed to a well-known scene in which she took a bitterly angry look after U.S. President Trump.
At the 2019 UN Climate Summit in New York, for which the actress sailed across the Atlantic, her expressive look was captured by the cameras and has since been seen by countless people on the Internet.
A GIF was created from the short clip, i.e. an animated image that eventually became one of the most commonly used images for Trump opponents.
But what did the 17-year-old think about the U.S. president at this moment?
In response to Stephen Colbert's relatively open question, she replied only briefly and dryly: "To be honest, I think there is no need for further explanation."
The experienced satirist Colbert probably did not expect the sluggish answer and disappeared from the picture.
With her "How dare you?" speech on the principles of climate protection, she was remembered by many at the climate conference.
Ex-Dortmund Real Estate with Three Pack for Lazio Rome
Ciro Immolle is now in the race for Europe's Golden Shoes with Bavaria's Robert Lewandowski.
The former Dortmunder Ciro Immolle continues to have the best chance to become a goalkeeper king in the Italian football championship.
At 5:1 (1:1) victory of Lazio Rome in Hellas Verona, the former BVB professional contributed three hits, including two elf meters in the replay times of both halves.
The 30-year-old now has 34 season goals on his account from the fourth season to the end of the season - as many did Robert Lewandowski of FC Bayern München in the final Bundesliga season.
In Italy Cristiano Ronaldo follows with 30 goals so far, the Portuguese superstar met with the top rider in the evening still on Sampdoria Genoa.
Fleetwood Mac co-founder Peter Green died
His life was like a roller coaster ride: After a rapid climb with Fleetwood Mac, it went steep downhill and then slowly upward.
Now Bluesrock guitarist Peter Green died at the age of 73.
Ingenious guitarist, drug junkie, cult trailer: The co-founder of the band Fleetwood Mac, Peter Green, is dead.
He died peacefully at the age of 73, and on Saturday, family members announced in an official opinion that another opinion would be announced for the next days.
Top musicians like Peter Frampton recognized Green as one of the best blues and rock guitarists.
Mick Fleetwood spoke in an emotional reaction of a "monumental loss" for all former and present members of the band Fleetwood Mac.
The drummer Fleetwood and the guitarist Green had founded the already legendary band in London in 1967, yet today his dreamy instrumental hit "Albatross".
The life of the musician ("The End Of The Game", "In The Skies") was like a rollercoaster ride.
With Fleetwood Mac, Green experienced a rapid rise - the band celebrated their greatest successes but then without him.
There has been a dispute, among other things, because Green wanted to donate all the profits of the group for charity purposes.
He began to appear in wide robes and with great crucifix.
Mental problems are also said to have played a role.
The band left the band in 1970 three years after it was founded.
A social descent followed.
The blues rock guitarist suffered from drug abuse and schizophrenia, as biographers reported.
For a long time, Green was treated in the psychiatry.
During most of the 1970s, the musician disappeared from the picture.
He occasionally lived on the street, worked as a cemetery gardener, and spent some time in an Israeli kibbuz.
Green was born in 1946 as the son of a Jewish working family in London's Bethnal Green district.
In his early years, he was enthusiastic about US blues musicians such as B.B. King and Muddy Waters.
At the age of 11, he learned the first guitar grips.
At the age of 15, the teenager began playing professional guitar and five years later got the chance to stand on stage as a lead guitarist for the instrumental band Peter B's Looners.
A few days later, he was assigned to the Bluesbreakers as a replacement for his idol Eric Clapton.
In the middle of the Blues-Boom, Green founded Fleetwood Mac together with his Bluesbreakers colleagues Mick Fleetwood and John McVie in the summer of 1967.
The song "Albatross" composed by Green provided the group with the first number one hit in the winter of 1968/69 and catapulted it to the top of the British music scene.
But the quick rise soon showed its shadow sides: Green did not cope with the media rumour, his experiments with the drug LSD became more extreme.
He later commented on the life between music and addiction in an interview: "The worst thing that happened to me in life is the drugs - the best thing was to land a number one hit".
Towards the end of the decade, Green succeeded in a surprising achievement in 1979 with an album inspired by religious themes.
Fleetwood Mac now swam on a wave of success without him in a new formation.
Her 1977 album "Rumours" sold more than 40 million times worldwide.
In spite of various small solo successes, Green did not succeed in making a bigger comeback until he started his new career with a group of friends.
The British "Daily Telegraph" spoke of a rock star returning to earth at that time.
Green released some albums with the Peter Green Splinter Group free of drugs until the band disbanded in 2004.
For music experts, he was already a blues legend in his lifetime - and with his gentle sound one of the most influential guitarists of the past decades.
