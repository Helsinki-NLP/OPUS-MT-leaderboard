28-year-old chef found dead in San Francisco Mall
A 28-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the staircase of a local shopping centre.
The victim's brother said he can't imagine anyone who would want to harm him, "At last he went uphill."
The body found in the Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning was identified as the 28-year-old Frank Galicia from San Francisco, told the judicial department in San Francisco.
The San Francisco Police Department said death was classified as murder and the investigations were ongoing.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told ABS station KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who used to work as a cook in Boston, had met his dream job six months ago as a cook at the Sons & Daughters Restaurant in San Francisco.
A speaker of the Sons & Daughters said that they were "shocked and destroyed on the ground" about his death.
"We're a little team that works like a close family and we're gonna miss him painfully," the speaker continued.
Our thoughts and condolences are in this difficult time with Frank's family and friends.
Louis Galicia indicated that Frank first lived in hostels, but that "the things for him finally went uphill."
"He found an apartment, he had a girlfriend," said Louis Garcia KGO.
Louis Galicia said he couldn't imagine anyone trying to harm his younger brother.
He was a friendly person with a big heart.
His way of connecting with his family was always to cook something, to prepare us dinner," said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to take part in any kind of dispute.
He was the brother who swam with the current.
"With all that goes wrong in the world, he was this uncut diamond that lit brightly every day," he said.
Any person who has information on the case will be asked to call the SFPD's notice telephone under the number 415-575-4444.
Jennifer Aniston: I'm always put in drawers
Jennifer Aniston doesn't always have to be perfect or successful.
In an interview, the Hollywood star has now made this absolutely clear.
"I'm always stuck in drawers or getting a label from the outside, which usually have little to do with me and reality."
"I myself don't want to always be perfect and successful."
"Truely, these things are better for me."
Jennifer Aniston (47) can only laugh that she is considered "Miss Perfect", as she explains in the current "Cosmopolitan".
The actress prefers to spend her time at home, in the form of television with a loose dutt and Mexican food, the magazine says.
In the white light, they raise the question of the desire for children: "We women don't have to be married or have children to be perfect," said the Hollywood star.
In her new film "Mother's Day - Love Is Not a Children's Game" Aniston is seen as a single mother of two sons.
The film will run with us from 25 August.
Golfer Langer gets the sport pyramid
His experiences on the horse are manageable.
At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Langer was looking for a little variety with a ride on the beach with some colleagues.
It was a premiere for the 58-year-old.
CHIO: "Golden Sports Pyramid" for Bernhard Langer
After a few minutes the horses remembered their celebration evening, they hunted home in a quick gallop to the feeders.
One kilometer at this pace, I was afraid.
"It wasn't a good experience," says Langer.
And with that the riding career ended again.
On Saturday, Germany's best golfer ever - 101 tournament victories - was again close to horses.
He and his family were led over the complex of the ALRV, and he didn't even swing on a horse for photo purposes.
Longer was the first time in Aachen and thus also at the CHIO.
The reason was quite convincing.
The German sports aid handed over the Golden Sport Pyramid to the man from Anhausen as part of a small gala.
The sympathetic athlete is not lacking in awards.
Federal Merit Cross, Silver Laurel Leaf, Champions Tour Player of the year...
Even the British Queen has already made him noble.
Langer is the 18th prize winner of the sports pyramid.
In Aachen, he met Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday.
"This award means a lot to me," says Langer, "because it is awarded not only for sporting successes but also for social engagement."
Langer has been supporting young people for decades.
And so he also passed on the prize money of 25,000 euros.
With 15 other outstanding athletes, the two-time US champion was admitted to the Hall of Fame of German Sports on Saturday.
The winners include the track athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the Turner Eberhard Gienger, the fighters Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the rower Peter-Michael Kolbe, Bob driver Meinhard Nehmer, Judoka Frank Wieneke, the jumper Alwin Schockemöhle and posthumous the handballer Erhard Wunderlich.
Many of these sports legends had come to Aachen on Saturday.
After the official part, the illustrative society migrated to the Spring Stadium, where the Lavazza Prize ran.
Bernhard Langer kept away from the big animals.
Clintons and Trump's Economic Policy Compare: It's all about the money
Investment in infrastructure and prevent the TTP trade agreement - both Clinton and Trump want to do so.
However, the two US presidency applicants disagree on tax and energy policy as well as on a matter of principle.
The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are based on a fundamental, rather philosophical, difference.
The one about the role of the state.
Trump wants to keep those in doubt rather small and warns of how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations.
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate it to death, he says.
He himself would be quite different, Trump claims.
It will go back massively on regulations, and it is strongly committed to a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for businesses.
Clinton, on the other hand, says that the state has certain tasks to perform, it has disadvantaged opportunities to open up and it needs money to do so.
That's why the taxes for the rich would be increased, she says.
Interestingly, both are very close to the topic of infrastructure.
Trump and Clinton say that they have to invest in them almost literally.
The democratic candidate even announces the biggest investment in new jobs since World War II.
State investment programmes in infrastructure are classical democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the state-critical tea party wing of the Republicans.
So Trump could still have party-internal discussions.
The differences in energy and climate policy are more significant.
Trump wants to build coal-fired power stations and to re-establish coal production in the USA.
Oil production should also be possible in protected areas so far, and the Paris Convention on Climate Change is to be announced.
With its investment programme, Clinton, on the other hand, explicitly wants to expand the renewable energies and demands: "A country will become the superpower of clean energies and create millions of jobs."
"It will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be us."
But not only in infrastructure, but also in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far apart.
TPP, the Trans-Pacific Trade Agreement, both do not want to sign.
At the same time, however, both do not want to isolate the US from international trade - but just better protect American jobs.
They're supposed to be better paid, like Clinton.
The current minimum wage of $7.25 would be a hunger wage.
He wants to raise it to 15 dollars an hour.
What Trump wants to do on this question is not quite clear: Once he says: the minimum wage must be up, then he says he should not be changed.
However, the major discussion over the coming months is likely to be more concerned with the tax policy of the two camps.
On the one hand, Trump wants to relieve the economy and its citizens in order to stimulate growth.
His critics hold him up, which would only make the budget deficit even bigger.
On the other hand, Clinton, who at least wants the rich to demand that they pay more taxes, and their critics say that more taxes are not the solution either.
Escape: "Every refugee woman has experience with sexual violence"
Sexual violence almost belongs to everyday life for women fleeing alone.
When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized.
A house offers refuge.
Four women sit in a large kitchen.
Everyone has a baby who is not more than one year old.
One put her little son in her arm.
He looks curiously into the room with big eyes.
His mother stares at the table top.
Until she realizes she's being observed.
She smiles briefly and kisses the little one.
The scene is normal.
Until you talk to Katrin Bahr.
She is the head of the division of Condrobs, a social assistance agency in Bavaria, and deals, among other things, with the issue of women on the run.
The four women in the kitchen are refugees.
They live in the north of Munich in one of the few decentralized accommodations for single women and their children in Bavaria.
In January, Condrobs opened the facility together with Pro Familia and the Municher Frauenhilfe.
She was recently officially opened.
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.
There are no men - not even as visitors.
The exception is a guard in front of the door.
"It is not exaggerating to say that every woman who arrives here has experienced sexual violence on her escape," says Bahr.
"Men flee for wars because they are persecuted politically, because they are threatened with torture or death, or because their families send them to Europe as hopemakers," she says.
In women, other reasons for escape prevail: "Many steal secretly because they see no other way out".
In their homeland, they have experienced sexual violence, forced marriages, homicides, slavery or forced prostitution.
That's what drives them away.
On the run, it goes on.
"The fact that tugs demand a sexual act for a bottle of water, for example, is not a rarity," says Bahr.
And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.
Who believes that this ends as soon as they arrive in Germany, mistaken, says Bahr.
Once again, single women in refugee homes would often be considered inferior and, worst of all, abused.
This causes about 90 percent of women living in the accommodation in the north of Munich to be traumatized, she estimates.
"Some of the children are certainly not born voluntarily."
Many women are so used to saying nothing.
"Or they do not trust to speak openly about the experienced, because the shame is too great."
Since they often don't know how to help, it takes more accommodations just for them, Bahr demands.
In Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for the housing of refugees.
To the question of whether they knew of a project similar to that in Munich in their area of competence, some respond with No.
In the Oberpfalz and Oberfranken, for example, there is no such thing in government accommodation.
Also in Schwaben, fleeing women alone are not accommodated separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, the government's press spokesperson.
In Oberbayern, Unter- und Mittelfranken there are floors or own houses in some community accommodation only for single women and their children.
The exception is Niederbayern, where there are two central accommodations exclusively for women.
The Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality in the European Parliament also calls for women to be kept separate from men.
In a study published for the Committee, it says: "It is very important that men and women are accommodated separately."
"If privacy occurs, or if men and women are accommodated together, violence against women can occur continuously".
In particular, the washrooms should be separated and easily accessible to women, says the study.
How much the women feel this protection need can be read at the insistence of the house in Munich.
"Since talking about us, we have a long waiting list," says Bahr.
You could easily open a second house.
Assistant doctors strike: Demands for new industrial combat measures
Deputys of assistant doctors have called on their trade union to approve new industrial combat measures in their disputes regarding a new contract.
The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has called on its entire council to approve more industrial combat measures from the beginning of September.
The JDC said that it had failed to address the concerns about the Treaty.
Assistant doctors and medical professionals voted in July on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BMA.
He was rejected by 58% of his members who voted in the elections.
In a letter to the members, which was published on Twitter on Thursday evening, the chairman of the JDC Ellen McCourt said that the government would have remained "constantly quiet" to problems, leading to the rejection of the contract.
She said, "In view of this, the JDC Board of Directors voted to reject the proposed new contract completely and requested official renegotiations on all your concerns."
In response to the government's silence, the JDC Board today submitted a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve an ongoing programme of escalating industrial combat measures beginning in September.
The disputes caused assistants to strike six times this year, the first total failures in the history of the NHS.
The director of the BMA Assistant Doctor Dr. Johann Malawana resigned after the election to reject the agreed contractual terms recommended by the BMA.
He informed BMA members during the meetings, which were held by 54,000 assistant doctors and medical students before the vote, that the Treaty was advantageous and should be adopted.
After the vote, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said that the contract for doctors in England would necessarily be introduced.
Russia and Turkey: An Alliance of Outsiders?
It was a gesture that ended a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and to announce an official war of words and economic sanctions for the end of the eight months.
But when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish opponent in the golden hall of the St. Petersburg Palace, I cannot deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most.
There was the handshake, yes.
But Putin's smile seemed slim and he hardly radiated warmth, even for his restraining conditions.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his "love friend" Putin - according to a report five times.
I couldn't count it anymore.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but will even improve.
The next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan had behaved as if nothing bad had never happened.
It seemed to me that his enthusiasm was rather the opposite.
But one of Putin's lasting cools showed that Russia's head of state had forgotten nothing.
Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the launch of a Russian fighter at the Syrian border by Turkey.
Moscow's reaction at the time was hot.
Putin distributed and accused Ankara of falling into Russia's back.
The offense was even bigger because it was committed by a supposed friend.
Building up confidence will be difficult, if not impossible.
Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.
For months the state-controlled media carried out a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara.
All of a sudden, it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything.
The most serious accusations of senior officials were that Erdogan's own family would have benefited from the illegal oil trade in Syria's territories controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He has fought this vehemently.
But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.
Finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse he wanted to hear from President Erdogan.
Russia was able to record some sort of victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of a ceasefire are obvious.
Erdogan primarily needs all the friends he can get after he was almost deprived of his office last month in a failed coup.
Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.
But there are also economic motives.
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular the prohibition of charter flights that usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.
The number has fallen by almost 90%.
In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be facilitated when the flights are resumed.
They count on a late seasonal onslaught to the Mediterranean.
This week, state television predicted cheaper fruits and vegetables as soon as Turkish agricultural imports were allowed back.
A report in Vedemosti put it this way: "Tourists there for a long time, tomatoes here for a long time."
But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry at the West because it sees its reaction to the attempted takeover of power as a weak response.
In addition, there is the continuing resentment over the rate of snails in EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is keen to benefit from the cool mood and to reduce Turkey's relationship with the West.
The Russian chief of state in Ankara certainly won a bonus for demanding support for the elected state bodies after the coup attempt.
This is a matter of course for Moscow, which itself has a deep fear of regime change.
The summit meeting in this magnificent palace by the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to present one, as one analyst once described to me, "Alliance of outsiders": two countries that feel irrational and ill-treated from the West and are now allied.
Nevertheless, despite public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two.
The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently played the role as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposite sides.
It could be significant that after almost three hours of initial discussions, both presidents at the press conference said that they had not even striped the subject.
The President of Turkey deliberately avoids answering a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize them.
There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator to Syria can be found.
But after months of open hostilities - and given the potential for a perfect disaster when NATO member Turkey shot off the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state at least talk to each other again.
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available for customers outside Scotland
According to the CEO of the Bank, the RBS brand is only to be reduced to a back office roll.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank's global ambitions.
Since then, the bank has distanced itself when it almost collapsed and had to be saved eight years ago.
During this time, brand strategists have used "RBS" to protect other end-user financial brands.
She supported the international sport with a million pounds of sponsoring, from Six Nations Rugby to Wimbledon winner Andy Murray.
But now she has decided to focus on more national brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available for customers in Scotland, but will not be initialized.
In England and Wales, all RSB references, decentralised headquarters and stock exchange listing will switch to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other smaller brands for the private customer business that will be given more importance - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a tour of customers and employees in Inverness-shire.
He told BBC Scotland: "The RSB brand will become our investor brand as well as the brand under which our employees will be employed, as we will now become more a bank of brands."
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I am now saying that we are not pursuing global goals but local goals.
Each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with the customers under these brands.
RBS has already said that it will no longer continue its Six Nations sponsoring and that it will increase the perceptibility of the various brands in its sports sponsoring.
"It's time for us to become a brand bank, because how do we focus inside (we asked) on making this a better bank for customers?" said the Chief Executive Officer.
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and launch these brands.
But with our work, the focus on customer needs and not our own, I think, you will see many changes.
We can launch these brands again, so I think the time has come.
Frankie Dettori achieved his 3,000th profit at Newmarket on Predilection
Dettori sprays champagne after a double at Newmarket that brings him 3,000th win
On Friday, the Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th British win at Newmarket.
He set on Predilection, which is trained by John Gosden, on his local race track with his second win of the night a milestone.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach the milestone in the flat race.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddry and Willie Carson.
The three-time winner Dettori, who won in Ghayar before, said, "It's something special."
I'm very emotional because my family is here too
I'm very happy that it happened at Newmarket because I landed here 30 years ago.
It's not a big meeting, it's not Royal Ascot - it's a banal Friday night with 20,000 people.
I am relieved and very modest.
Dettori takes up the joy when he takes the victory at Predilection
Two jockeys have reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time winner Sir Anthony McCoy, who achieved more than 4,300 victories in a record-breaking career.
Lester Piggott, the nine-time derby winner had 4,493 career victories
Frankie is one of the best jockey of modernism and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone that only a few have reached before him.
It has style and is strong, but it is its tactical intellect, which distinguishes it from the others in the weight control room.
He is a fantastic ambassador for races, his enthusiasm and charisma fans have been enthusiastic about this sport for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that if he wasn't just a weekend and big tournament jockey, he'd have won 6,000 wins!
Frankie has already won almost 30 years in GB, which is great.
He has a lively personality, which is good for a British race, but beyond that, he is an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dismount
From Flying Finishes to Flying Dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the sign of the British flat race for two decades.
It was nervous.
A whole series of big tournament wins, including his famous "Glorious Seven" in Ascot in 1996, but he also survived an airplane crash and received a drug ban.
Three years ago he had difficulties at the beginning when he returned from his six-month lock, but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to defy his two-flers and return to his best form.
And he's far from finished - Dettori once said that he wants to continue in competitions up to his at least 50th age.
Russia's Putin fires Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly released his Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov was part of Putin's closest circle of trust for many years.
The 63-year-old was appointed Special Representative for Environmental and Transport Affairs.
According to a Kremlin opinion, Putin had "ordered the dismissal of Ivanov from his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration without giving any reason".
Anton Vaino, who had been Ivanov's deputy since 2012, was appointed as his successor.
Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in the Estonian capital Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the renowned Moscow Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Embassy in Tokyo.
On the Kremlin website, it is said (in Russian) that he was later head of the log and staff of the government staff.
About his appointment, he said to Putin, "Thank you for your trust."
I believe that it is the government's most important task to support your activity as head of state with regard to draft laws and controls to implement your instructions.
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.
Do the smiling faces convince?
This step has made Moscow a mystery.
Sergei Ivanov was for a long time one of Vladimir Putin's closest confidants and works like him for the Soviet intelligence service, the KGB.
As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, who was broadcast on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff resigned at their own request.
But despite the smile for the cameras, only a few of them are convinced - especially now, shortly before the parliamentary elections.
So is there a consequence of a kind of power struggle here?
Nobody knows that right now.
But the official claim - that a man who was once praised as a potential president wants to lead Russian environmental policy - was very sceptical.
In his remarks to Putin, quoted on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said, "It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 to entrust me with these very complicated posts - one could almost say - difficult posts for four years.
As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months.
Ivanov accepted the post in December 2011.
He was previously Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, former member of the KGB State Security Service.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed as his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov one of five people he trusted most.
It was once assumed that Ivanov could become President of Russia after Putin's second term, since a third term of office had violated the Constitution.
But this post was taken by another nearby ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister before becoming president three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds Star Thomas Gibson fired after beating producers
Gibson was involved in a physical dispute last month in the series set in Los Angeles.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, announced their termination in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized publicly on Thursday prior to the announcement of his termination.
On the set there were artistic differences and disagreements.
I regret the incident," he said in a communication.
Details of how the character of Gibson is written out from the series that follows a team of FBI agents are expected to be published at a later date, according to the opinion of ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
The 54-year-old, who previously played at the Sitcom Dharma & Greg, has been involved since the first season of the series in 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds and have put in my whole heart blood for the past twelve years," said Gibson in a communication published on Friday.
I had hoped to be there until the end, but that won't be possible now.
I would just like to thank the authors, producers, actors, our wonderful crew and, above all, the best fans you can only wish for a series.
The planned broadcast of the twelfth season is scheduled for 28 September.
Puzzles of fish landing in the garden in Banff
A local of Banff requested help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks that the 75 fish could be sandaaled out by a fountain.
Mr. Bain, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, published on Periscope a video of the spectacle in the hope that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two-inch long fish.

The £1.35 billion project will be completed by May 2017
Engineers have connected the north deck of the Queensferry Crossing with the viaduct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of four closures of the "deck blowers" approaching completion around each of the three towers of the bridge.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 slant ropes.
The £1.35 billion project will be completed by May 2017.
Minister of Economic Affairs Keith Brown today visited the construction site and was one of the first to go from land to the bridge.
He said, "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Crossings.
We are all witnesses to an engineering art of a truly epic measure in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for the fit.
In total, almost 79% of the total bridge decks are in their place and the last section of the deck today gets a concrete cast for the deck in Rosyth, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place.
Michael Martin, project manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: "The first closure represents a significant milestone in every bridge project.
In this fantastic project, the closure represents forward-looking construction and civil engineering.
After the installation of the last section of the road deck and its connection to the north tower deck under construction, we then had to close the remaining gap on the north or the country side.
This was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters south.
This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.
Massive, since the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs approx. 6,000 tons and had to be pulled up at a slope of about 3%.
Hick, as the tolerances the team was working on were tiny - on each side they were only a few millimeters.
Fortunately, everything went very well.
Rescue in the Moelfre Bay: Three men have "happiness still to be alive"
Three men have "happiness to be alive" after being thrown by their fishing boat in front of Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station struck on Friday at 13:20 BST alarm after a crew observed the event in Moelfre Bay.
The three men had difficulties swimming safely while their boat continued to move from their own strength.
"We saw the boat turning around in its vicinity and imagined the worst," said the head of the rescue station of Moelfre Vince Jones.
"Happyly, the strong winds have already blown the boat out of its reach until we let it into water," he added.
Two of the men were saved from a local fishing boat, while the third man at the age of 60 was exhausted and found hanging on a boy without a life jacket.
They all came aboard the coastal rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station
Mr. Jones said, "The three men who were thrown into the water are lucky and alive.
Although the boat engine had an emergency stopline, it was loosened from the person who controlled the boat when the boat was known.
Someone watched over these men today.
Heavyly injured - man enters his ex-girlfriend
A man attacked his ex-girlfriend in Hamburg-Harburg with a knife and seriously injured.
As the police told us yesterday, the 50-year-old had got the key to the apartment to get his personal things.
Instead, the alcoholic perpetrators cut the clothes of his ex-girlfriend.
When this guy came into the apartment, he stooped on her twice.
The 44-year-old was injured by the hand and the body.
The police were able to arrest the perpetrator.
While the 50-year-old destroyed the clothes of his ex-girlfriend, he called his mother.
He then alerted his sister.
Together with her companion, the 45-year-old wanted to calm her brother down.
But she couldn't move him to leave the apartment.
That's why she left the house with her companion.
On the street they met the ex-lifemate of the man.
When the two women reentered the apartment, the 50-year-old pushed his sister aside and attacked his ex-girlfriend.
Who builds Braunschweig's cheap apartments?
The SPD and the Greens believe that investors should be made much more responsible in the future.
How do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1300 cheap apartments in the coming years?
The SPD proposes to the next Council meeting a "working concept for living".
But dispute is programmed.
First of all, the question is: Who should actually build the cheap apartments?
There has been a lack of regulation so far.
SPD President Christoph Bratmann says: "We agree with the Greens: If you want to build on urban areas, 20 percent of all apartments will have to be registered as social housing in the future."
However, the cheap apartments can also be built in the stock.
However, Bratmann said that the big issue in the town hall is: "How do you deal with investors who want to build on private areas?"
"We want investors on such areas to build at least 10 percent, but as much as possible 20 percent of the housing as social housing."
A new urban housing funding programme, which will cost millions and will still have to be financed, will provide incentives.
The problem, Bratmann says: "There is currently no agreement between the political groups."
The CDU wants to make investors as few rules as possible.
The left wants still tough conditions for investors.
Despite that, Bratmann said, the situation on the housing market was aggravated.
If the concept of action is implemented, it will provide additional tasks in the construction management.
More staff is needed.
It's unclear whether we're going to get the experts.
But the program is not yet complete: because the around 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway.
How, though, can we compensate for the loss of around 1300 more favourable dwellings, whose promotion will expire in the next few years?
By 2020 alone, there will be 500 apartments.
In order to prevent this, says the planning spokesperson Nicole Palm, the city should now purchase out-of-date bonds.
In addition, it would be necessary to think about getting home back to price fixing.
This is possible in the West City.
At once, the problem can be solved.
Because in the West City, deadlines expire at the end of the year.
About 1800 apartments could be brought back to the price link for cheap apartments.
Only: That's what the owners, the housing companies don't want.
For the number of social housing in the western city is increased dramatically again, away from the goal of so-called mixing.
There should no longer be a concentration of social weak people in just a few districts.
The Greens expect that there will still be movement in the discussion.
Group chairman Holger Herbitschke says: "For a broad majority, the CDU must go into the boat."
Although they had concentrated on more construction sites for single-family houses.
What does not mean, however, is that a compromise cannot be found.
Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that is worthwhile
It is fascinating to see how the world changes.
That teenagers and children no longer go outside to play, but rather prefer to spend their free time staring on screens, has been complained by many in the last decade.
Pokemon Go is about getting people off the sofa and getting more active.
The time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then to video games and finally to smartphones.
Therefore, it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not exclude each other.
Of course, I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters that were first created for the video games in the 1990s (later created a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs).
How many phenomena of pop culture decreased interest before the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July.
The market launch in other countries was shifted by the massive demand that overburdened the servers.
Within a few days Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, the players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pokémons that are tracked with a GPS and, once they have been found, can be "photographed" (via a screenshot on the phone) or "captured".
A generation who played the game when she was younger joined the madman and jumped for the search from the sofa.
In the US, the game led to a significant increase in steps that the "average" person travels every day.
Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch that tracks 35,000 users, recently told Washington Post that within two days of the launch of the game, the number of tracked people who train 30 minutes each day jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it only sees the raw data to increase performance.
Many public education campaigns on health that people want to "take 30 minutes of time," "come from the sofa" and "be active every day" hit deaf ears, because many public messages to health are boring and come from people who look miserable.
Nevertheless, the importance of sports cannot be overrated.
Those who regularly drive sports reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to mention here.
But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it makes people do something outdoors that is fun for them.
Thus, three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.
Some people even make new friendships on hunting.
As always, there are murricane spoilers who always have to complain about something.
And yes, someone could run into a door.
What is it?
There's been a breakthrough.
Even if smartphone apps like Fitbit had been able to track our activity before, they gave us no reason to play sports as this game does.
The new will lose its appeal and use will decrease over time.
Due to Pokemon's success, however, there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with getting active in the real world, helping many people hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.

Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is immune to all this.
Dynamic on the jumping horse.
Easy on the beam.
Breathtaking on the ground.
On the whole, brilliant.
And now also Olympic winner.
The 19-year-old American gymnast climbed on Thursday to become a multi-fight title and enlarged the gap between itself and the rest of the world in front of the eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games.
Her overall result of 62,198 was clearly in front of the silver medal winner and "Final Five" teammate Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medal winner Aliya Mustafina.
The Americans Simone Biles will play on the floating bar during the single multi-fight finale of women in the art tournaments at the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.
Biles is the fourth heterosexual American to win a multi-fight title and the fifth, while she strengthens her reputation for being the best of her generation or even of her own.
She broke into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey found an end at this moment.
This success puts her in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who brought her sports to new heights:
Biles has dominated her sport for the last three years, 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold medals - with such amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the 1984 Olympic winner Mary Lou Retton said of her that she is "the best gymnast I've ever seen."
She expected a final exam in Brazil, a competition that did not go so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a load of over-dimensional expectations.
Not returning to the family in Spring, Texas with a handful of gold would be considered a disappointment.
The Americans Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman embrace each other after winning gold and silver in the women's single match finals at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday
Biles picked up the first medal on Tuesday, while she served as an exclamation mark at the farewell celebration of the retired team coordinator Martha Karolyi.
Although Biles insisted on never having the future planned during her long journey to the top, that is not really true.
Part of their soil exercises - which contain their typical tumbling pass - are tuned to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio.
It's not a coincidence.
This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a little child and discovered by coach Aimee Boorman's mother during a school trip to the gym, in the Boorman, became powerful.
Since the summer of 2013, she has no longer lost any more competition, a victory series that will last as long as she wishes.
Even though Mustafina passed through two spins slightly, the picture was tricky.
Swift beams and floor tournaments - where Biles holds the World Championship title - listened.
She picked up again with 15,433 on the floating bar - and with a 15,933 on the floor put another on it.
Raisman hugged her gently as they expected her end of her - a pure formality - and tears flowed on bile's shiny red, white, and blue eyeliners when the vision she once described in her collection book became reality.
Raisman's performance was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place, but the bronze medal went on Mustafina in a tievre.
This time the 22-year-old captain of the team, called "Oma" by the Americans, had a lead.
After her soil practice, she threw kiss hands to the audience, overwhelmed by a comeback that sometimes seemed doubtful.
As far as Biles is concerned, the rapidly expanding Tweet of the 19-year-olds from the beginning of this week has a completely new meaning:
Police: 3 victims shot in serial murder case while listening to music in the car
According to police reports published on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot who had been killed in one of the most deadly attacks for a decade in Phoenix's first serial murder case while talking in the car and listening to music.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot on June 12, while the car was parked in a driveway, the authorities said.
The perpetrator fired eight shots from a handgun while standing on the passenger side of the car and then fleeing with another vehicle, is to be read in the report.
The police told us that the triple murder did not seem to have been the result of a robbery, as the attacker did not take the handbags or the $2,900 that were owned by one of the adult victims.
Phoenix Sgt. Sgt.'s police spokesperson Jonathan Howard said that the shooting led the investigators to take a closer look at whether it was linked to four previous attacks.
In total, seven people were killed and two more were injured in hispanic residential areas within four months in nine attacks.
"It happens in a residential area in front of a house," Howard told the KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, at the beginning of the month.
It is believed that the suspect used several vehicles, including a brown Nissan from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to disclose the evidence that led them to conclude that the attacks were linked and were committed by the same murderer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized due to her injuries and died later.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter, Maleah, died on site.
A witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a parked car and hear music.
The authorities also published a police report on the shooting, which aimed at an empty pickup truck half an hour before the triple murder and which is assumed to be the serial killer's work.
Detectives found cartridge shells and secured a ball from the seat as well as bullet fragments from the engine compartment.
Mother of a 6-year-old with microcephalia: "It gets better"
Like most 6-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto loves singing, toys and of course his mother.
But like the least of his peers, Edmund Mikrocephalie, the result of a genetic disorder his mother Elizabeth Picciuto knew nothing about during her pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was, I can't do it.
I can't do this.
I didn't get involved with that.
What's wrong at all -- of course, they've gotten involved in it," she said.
She and her husband Vincent were told that Edmund may never be able to recognize them and that he may not even survive.
Some doctors even went so far as to suggest that they institutionalize him.
"My first answer was, 'I didn't know that people are still doing," said Picciuto.
Edmund can run with the help of a walker.
Edmund could neither sit nor scratch until his third year and he still cannot speak.
But he's progressing slowly.
It can run with support and cycle.
He also loves to play and sing with his two brothers.
Elizabeth shows the sign language that Edmund has invented for "Please sing something before me."
"We teach him sign language," said Picciuto CBS News.
But it's not a typical sign language -- she says, Edmund invented some characters alone.
Microcephalia has a variety of causes: genetics such as Edmund and infections with viruses such as measles or the zika virus during pregnancy.
Symptoms and forecasts may vary greatly.
It is too early to say how it will affect the life of the infected with the Zikavirus.
Picciuto remembers the emotional price of an uncertain future.
I constantly asked what was going to happen?
What's going to happen?
And she still doesn't really know.
I haven't asked for the prognosis for a long time, because I don't expect anyone to really tell me.
But Picciuto has a hopeful advice for mothers of infants with birth damage caused by the Zika virus.
It'll be better.
You know it's gonna be better for you.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rains, floods give rise to rescues in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rains and large floods in Louisiana forced the governor to declare the emergency on Friday. More rainfall is expected all Saturday.
Many rivers in the southeast of Louisiana and the south of Mississippi flooded their banks and threatened with large floods after extreme rainfall, reported the National Weather Service.
The Governor of Louisiana John Bel Edwards announced that state officials are in constant contact with the local authorities and that assistance to the communities concerned is already on the road.
Mike Steele, a spokesperson for the Governor's Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparingness, announced that the demands for floodboats, boats and sandbags increased.
Steele said that only the municipality of Tangipahoa had requested ten thousand sandbags.
A flood warning system is used over large parts in the south of Louisiana until Saturday.
The weather service indicated that additional 3-5 inches of rain could fall in this area.
In the south of Alabama a flood warning system was used on Friday, while in the area Mobile it continued to rain.
The River Committee near Baton Rouges and the river Amite near Denham Springs, both of which are located in Louisiana, will most likely reach record levels over the weekend.
The meteologist Alek Krautmann says that both rivers could flood many houses in the suburbs near Baton Rouge.
He also said that a downstream flood in Ascension Parish poses a danger, as these will only flow slowly into Lake Maurepa via the tributary rivers.
The river Tickfaw, south of the Mississippi state border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest level on Friday at 09.00, which was ever recorded.
Rescue teams still used to feed people from floodwater in the districts of Amite and Wilkinson in southwest Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were among those rescued on Friday near Gloster.
Hansford, 62, says that water from Beaver Creek, usually more than 400 feet away from his house, rose strongly overnight.
He said that another stepson who lives nearby would have warned him.
"We're awake and the water was flowing in," said Hansford.
It reached my waist.
His wife told Hansford that in the 48 years she lived there, she had never seen such an uprising of the river.
Hansford said that he and his family members had all the disabilities and he was the only one who could swim.
Hansford said that all three of them had saved in a large military truck and had brought them to the next fire station in Gloster, where they were housed until Friday.
Krautmann said that the flood had "swiftly spread out" as there continued to be heavy rainfall and that the authorities would hesitate to consider evacuation instructions.
According to Krautmann, an observer near Livingstone reported from midnight to Friday morning from 13.75 inches of rain.
Krautmann said that the soil has been considerably well-bredededededed by the rains since Wednesday.
The authorities indicated that severe rains and floods caused the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and educational failure in five school districts.
The CBS subsidiary WWL reported that one associate in Tangipahoa reported 200 flooded houses.
The inhabitants were evacuated into two churches, both now flooded.
The mayor of the municipality of Robby Miller said that the authorities had rescued 72 people and seven pets washed by the floods.
In the cities of Amite and Hammond, emergency shelters were set up to accommodate the evacuates.
"As soon as the water starts going back, they will be able to return to their homes," he said.
In the town of Hammond of the municipality of Tangipahoa, almost two dozen streets were closed due to the flood and sandbags were provided for the residents to take away, hoping to keep the water from their homes and shops.
"The last great flood we had was in March," said Lacy Landrum of the city administration.
This seems to be a similar incident.
In Mississippi, the emergency manager Rupert Lacy of Harrison County said it was still raining on the Gulf Coast.
According to his information, a handful of houses should have been reported as flooded on Thursday, but none have been reported until now on Friday.
Keith Townson, manager at Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places I've never seen before," said Townson, "and it's still coming."
Mahaj Brown, 6, "drained by bullets", survives shooting in Philadelphia
The police tell us that the 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, this week already the second time a 6-year-old child is shot.
The boy's grandparents identified him as Mahaj Brown for CBS Philadelphia.
The grandparents indicated that Brown suffered several shot injuries, including in the loin, leg, arm and abdomen, but that he was conscious when he was transported to the hospital.
"He's been through a lot, his little body was holed with bullets," his grandmother Delores Melendez told the transmitter.
I just can't believe that.
The condition of the boy was considered critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations.
The boy's family told the transmitter that he was likely to recover.
He should have started the first class in a local primary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in Germantown.
Three men were also shot: two at the age of 29 and one at a age of 32.
One of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition; the other two are in stable condition according to CBS Philadelphia.
The boy was found on the front seat of a car along with the 29-year-old who is in a critical state, reports the transmitter.
The other two victims were not in the car, and the police just found out if one of the wounded men of the perpetrators could be there.
Researchers told CBS Philadelphia that there seemed to have been a crossfire between several shooters.
Patron shells for storm rifles traced back to various storm rifles covered the crime scene.
It seems that this was clearly an ongoing struggle.
On the road, on both sides of the walkway, there were sleeves.
For example, there seem to have been several armed fighters who were very active in this field," police skin man Anthony Ginaldi told the stationer in Philadelphia.
Several houses and vehicles were also hit in the area.
There was no arrest and the police are currently reviewing the surveillance video.
On Tuesday another 6-year-old girl was hit by a cross-checker on her arm when she was playing in front of her home in the West Oak Lane residential area.
She's recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That's what I imagine under the women's Olympic team in gymnastics, for more than one reason.
First of all, since 1984 I have been with every summer olimpiade and the USA has never been so dominant.
And second, this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who inspired many young girls of different skin colors.
The structure of this team, which rounds out Aly Raisman, who is a Jew and Madison Kocian, who is a Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This team finally reflects the US.
It has strengthened the black and hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.
In the last four years the number one among the female gymnasts was an African-American.
Last year Simone and Gabby were #1 and #2.
That shows strength.
At the last Olympic Games Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and America rejoiced.
Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of triple world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they provided unexpected yet mastery gymnastic routines.
On Thursday Simone became the fourth, heterosexual American to win gold at an individual multi-fight event for women.
Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image
We experience the top of this sport, but that's not how gymnastics look throughout the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all took the same path as Aly and Madison to make it to the Olympic team.
They are the "last five" because the next Olympic team will only have four gymnasts in the team. Moreover, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a coach.
But the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport and gymnastics primarily in private gymnastics, which are maintained by parents, who stand up for the training, furniture, travel, clothing, competition and hotel costs (for the trainers and their gymnists and families).
The majority of these gymnastics are located in wealthy suburbs that can support the business.
In these clubs, the gymnasts receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment for the families.
Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, both have trained her athletes since they started playing.
We need to allow the communities to exercise more affordable and accessible gymnastics than in countless young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I founded my 20-year gymnastics.
At my events we offered free and affordable tournaments in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youths (especially black and Hispanic) and trained national and international winners.
In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer the youth high-quality tournaments that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Turns develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.
This combination offers lifelong benefits for health as well as for school and professional success.
It's the inspiration of this team to get thousands of young girls to be interested in gymnastics and that's great.
It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.
It's such an exciting time.
Thanks Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real representation of "Girl Power" by getting the Olympic team gold and thanking her so many young girls with different backgrounds motivated her to begin her way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
Assistant doctors want to organise further strikes after they have rejected Jeremy Hunt's proposal
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting a reformed contract with British Medical Association officials, but 58 percent of the 37,000 assistants who voted in an election rejected him.
In July Hunt had revealed plans to force the contract to be introduced and said that the NHS were in a "nobody country" and any further delay would be harmful to employees and patients.
The first assistant doctors are to receive a new contract, which includes changes to night and weekend work to improve care at unstinting time.
Dr Ellen McCourt, chairman of the BMA Committee on Assistant Doctors, said last night in a communication: "Assistants still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it will fuel the current workforce crisis and fail to treat all doctors fairly."
At only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors falls under the new contract, progress has to be made and time is running out.
Efforts by the BMA to resolve the disputes by talks encountered the government's reluctance to participate and sometimes to silence ears.
This was the promise that Jeremy Hunt had made only last month about the fact that his door would always be open.
"Jeremy Hunt must act now, stop the compulsion and address the concerns of the assistant doctors."
If he does not do so, the assistant doctors have made it clear that they are willing to carry out further industrial combat measures.
The last strike at the end of April provided a postponement of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments, since nurses and specialists were involved to provide doctors on the strike post chain coverage.
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting the reformed treaty with the British Medical Association officials.
The BMA wants a better weekly reward for the 54,000 assistant doctors who will be subject to the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, Director General of the NHS staff, called on the assistant doctors to stop the strike.
Mortimer said: "Work combat measures do not reach anything of the few, but already burdened teams and service providers and only provide the patients, caregivers and their families with worries, distress and interruption."
In the last two months, we have spoken to the Committee of Assistant Doctors and have responded positively to the concerns of guardianship and whistleblowing with the Ministry of Health and other ministries.
Employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as posting, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning from a professional leave, training rates, mutual recognition of the curriculum, training leave and gender pay gap in medicine - was a sign of the seriousness of employers, health education England and the Ministry of Health regarding compliance with the agreements with BMA in November, February and May.
The £2 per day drug that can reduce heart attack risk
Thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £2-per-day drug after the authorities have recommended to administer this more people for a longer period of time.
The coagulation-inhibiting drug Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease.
The drug has been administered for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a stroke or another heart attack.
The NHS NICE regulatory authority has recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
The NHS NICE regulatory authority has recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
About 140,000 people suffer a heart attack each year, and a quarter of them suffer another heart attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulations of fatty materials in the arteries walls that form coatings.
If the coating breaks apart, it can cause a blood clot that clogs the blood flow to the heart and causes a heart attack.
When the blood clot dissolves, it can flow through the bloodstream and clog the blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk of having another.
Ticagrelor, produced by the British company AstraZeneca and distributed under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots more unlikely.
The draft NICE guide, published today, recommends a 12-month intake of 90mg of Ticagrelor, followed by 60mg with a twice daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, Director of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Centre, said: "Despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all people who have had a heart attack have another heart attack or a stroke - often with disastrous consequences."
Fear of a new heart attack can have a significant negative impact on the quality of life of a person.
Experience shows that Ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
Through a preliminary recommendation from Ticagrelor, we are pleased that we are able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it.
The information on the effectiveness and safety of Ticagrelor - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years, and the draft instructions do not recommend treatment beyond that period.
Political correctness culture makes election fraud flourish in Muslim areas
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year on the occasion of a government report because of corruption
A culture of political correctness has led to widespread election fraud in Muslim communities knowingly being ignored as a destructive government report revealed today.
Former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles verbally attacks the police, election observers and town halls to ignore evidence of election abuse due to "hypersensibility to ethnicity and religion".
The former Minister of Integration and Local Government, who is now an anti-corruption king, said that the intimidation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set up barricades outside electoral cabins to protect intimidated voters.
He recommends that voters should carry a card to prove their identity in elections.
At the moment, a elector simply has to mention his name and address.
The report proposes that non-removable ink should be applied to a person's finger if they give up their vote to prevent a person from choosing twice.
Whistleblower should get more protection, says Sir Eric.
It calls on the press to have more access to community documents and decisions by non-official committees or working groups.
"This not only serves against election fraud, but also aims to protect the local government from the broader culture of corruption and financial fraud associated with it," he said.
The report was arranged by Downing Street as a result of the Tower Hamlet's election scandal in the east of London.
Last year, a Special Election Court decided that the reigning mayor Lutfur Rahman should be removed from his office after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman had "perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community in a cynical way" and that he had silenced his critics with racism and Islamophobic accusations.
Rahman is said to have "led his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him."
Up to 300 votes were either doubtful or the result of an imitation in which one person chooses as someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud all over the country.
He was particularly alarming about the fraudulent choice of letters - in which older members of the Muslim community had pressured people to elect a candidate of their choice.
Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean up the electoral system, including running IDs to prove the identity
His report states: "As evidence it was appropriate that pressure was exerted on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, in particular women and young people, to choose according to the will of the older people, especially communities with Pakistani or Bangladeshi background.
"There were concerns that... state institutions would have knowingly ignored such behaviour due to "politically correct" hypersensitivity to ethics and religion."
Sir Eric issued 50 recommendations to clean the system, including the prohibition that political activists process letter-election documents to stop "elections".
The report, which is considered by Theresa May, also requires tougher registration checks to prevent the register from being used for immigration and social fraud purposes.
Consider options to ask voters before choosing your ID.
Use non-removable ink on a person's finger once she has given her voice to prevent someone from choosing twice.
Systematic checks on the nationality of a person to ensure that they are eligible for election.
A three-year limit to requests for an automatic mail selection.
Prohibition that political activists process complete letter elections and envelopes of letter elections.
The police have the power to set up blockages to set up electoral stations.
A legislative amendment that facilitates an intimidation charge under the Representation of the People Act 1983 (Volksvertrettungsgesetz 1983).
Photographer ban in election stations.
Require that only English be used in the electoral stations (with the exception of Wales).
Intensification of training to ensure that employees enforce the rule that voters go to the electorate alone.
Sir Eric falls through the Metropolitan Police and finds it "surprising" that after the Tower Hamlet's case no prosecution was made.
"The electoral court has declared Lutfur Rahman and his alternate to be improbable because of a litany of corrupt and illegal practices," he said.
It became guilty because of a number of reasons for adequate, in accordance with the high requirements in criminal proceedings.
He also criticises the ineffective "restraints" of the election registration departments of the town halls.
Sir Eric said, "The court ruling in Tower Hamlets last year was a warning signal.
Our country, as the mother of Parliaments, has a proud legacy, but the worrying and hidden spread of election fraud and denial of some authorities threatens this reputation.
Crazy to Kate's Radler double walker and other famous Olympic sports enthusiasts in Rio
This week, fans of the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio have come across the French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot outside the edge and band, who has proved to be an impressive double-goss of the Duchess of Cambridge.
But this summer the 24-year-old Olympic woman is by far not the only gold fighter who has his own famous double-goers - at least not if one can believe the social media.
In honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that are currently flickering on our screens, FEMAIL has created a list of Olympics that have more than a certain resemblance to Hollywood celebrities.
The hunter and the wolf: team member of the US team in archery Brady Ellison, on the left, is compared since childhood with Leonardo DiCaprio
In addition to Kate's double walker on the cycling track, many people on the Internet pointed out how a certain archer could be the twin of A-Promi Leonardo DiCaprio.
The team member of the U.S. team in archery Brady Ellison has caused a storm on Twitter, after pictures on which he sees the Wolf of Wall Street Star horribly appear.
In fact, the archer got the insanity in the social media and admitted that he had already heard from his childhood that he looked like Leo.
"I see no similarity myself, except for facial hair," said Brady at the Huffington Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I guess I'll take that as a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be even more central this year: the conspicuous similarity between British far jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
The Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina with her big, expressive eyes is supposed to be able to go through as a double-goer for the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the swimming pool, the South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to the Glee Star Matthew Morrison for years.
A gear higher: this user believes Nathan is the "athletic version" of the Inception actor
Another persistent comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who has similar heavy eyebrows and lips.
The Russian silver medalist Yulia Efimova has more than just the sun tanned skin and blonde hair like the actress Annalynne McCord, while American Nathan Adrian was certified by fans, a "athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt".
Strong women: Football star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, right, have a similar face and eyes
Not the only one: A Twitter user was very happy that others noticed the similarities as well
Theory put into space: According to this user there is perhaps a reason for the similarity of the couple
A Twitter user explained her satisfaction that "the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are almost identical."
In fact, the US football star Hope Solo and the Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter have an incredibly similar face and eyes.
Other popular comparisons included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to that of actress Laura Linney as well as the gold medal winner in the turn Gabby Douglas, who has her own beautiful, wide smile similar to that of Bring It On Star Gabrielle Union.
CBC commentator for the Olympic Games apologizes for his statement that Chinese swimmer "has died like a pig"
Byron MacDonald's analysis of the fourth place of the 14-year-old Ai Yanhan at Dr 4x200m freestyle swimming season outraged spectators of the CBC live transmission of the Olmypian Games on Wednesday
The Canadian station CBC had to apologize after one of his commentators said that the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "as Mief went off" and died like "a pig" during the race.
The commentator Byron MacDonalds thought his microphone was turned off when he gave his own opinions at the end of the 4x200m freestyle swimming season.
MacDonald, who had been brought to the CBS's commentator team to give more "color", could be heard saying, "This little 14-year-old Chinese has lost the connection, baby".
Too excited, went off like Mief, died like a pig.
Thank you for that.
The Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second stage of the swimming season 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck, enabling Canadians to unlock the gap to China.
Viewers across Canada responded quickly online after being shocked by the sound and the language
Emmett Macfarlane tweet, "Did the CBC commentator just say that the 14-year-old swimmer from China "has died like a pig"????
The idiot didn't get that they were still on show."
Ai Yanhan from China was described in the final 4 x 200m freestyle swimming season for women: "This little 14-year-old Chinese has lost the connection, baby."
The criticism of Byron MacDonald on Twitter came fast and hard, in which many talked to him
Twitter users did not hold back when they heard how insensitive Byron MacDonald was
Another Twitter user Sarah Paradis wrote: "Wow, #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and make us all look like racists.
A short time later, Scott Russel, who moderated the CBC show, apologized live for MacDonald's comment and said, "We apologize that the comment was broadcast over a swimming performance."
It was an unfortunately chosen formulation, we're sorry it happened."
In the end, CBC apologized over 90 times to the people who responded to the comment via Twitter
Commentary colleague Scott Russel had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald
CBC copied and inserted his excuse to more than 90 other Twitter users who had complained about MacDonald's comments
The network also apologized quickly and issued a message.
We sincerely regret that these statements have been made and that they have been made possible.
Last night we quickly apologized to our audiences on the show and our followers in the social media.
To clarify one, Byron's comments related to the performance of the swimmer and not to her as a person.
Nevertheless, they were inappropriate and an unfortunately chosen formulation. Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon MacDonald apologized on the show and tried to justify his comment by saying that it was not his intention to be interpreted as a personal attack.
"I would like to take a moment to apologize for the comment I made after the women's swimming season in the CBC Olympic mission," he said.
"I have referred to the performance of the swimmer and not to her as a person."
Of course, no contempt was intended and I am very sorry."
Buyers in Primark are indignant about woman trying shamelessly underwear in the middle of the business
The buyers did not know where to look when a woman took off her clothes in the middle of a Primark to try underpants.
To make the situation worse, as she looked in it, she pulled her out and put her back on the shelf.
She continued to browse and tried four pairs of underpants in a shop at Bouverie Place Shopping Center in Folkestone.
The Primark store at the Bouverie Place shopping center in Folkestone, where the woman tried the underpants before she put them back on the shelf
A mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was in business at the same time, said that after the mysterious woman tried underwear, "she put on again and left business without buying anything."
She said, "People could not believe what they saw."
Standing in the middle of the sales area, she took a pair of underpants out of the print, pulled off her own tights and pants and tried them on.
"She didn't even try to find a more discreet place to do it - she just stood there, naughty like Oskar."
"Everyone stared when she took off the underpants again, who obviously didn't like them, because she put them back on the shelf."
She repeated the same with three more underpants before she finally decided she didn't like anything, put on herself again and went out.
"She didn't seem to interfere that she was watching someone - or thinking about the person who might buy the underpants she had tried."
Ms. Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said, "How disgusting to think that someone would take underpants home with them who had a different person and who had not been washed."
The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson added: "As I have learned, the employees have tried to remove the clothes from the sale after she left - which is just as good."
"I would hate to go home with a new pair of underpants and find out that another woman hated her and took her off and she wasn't washed."
A spokesperson from Primark said: "Primark is aware of the incident that occurred on Tuesday, August 9th in our branch in Folkstone."
All the products in question were withdrawn from the sale.
How to Protect Yourself With Krav Maga From Arms Attacks
The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a little safer for you.
We talked to Rhon Mizrachi, a grandmaster of the Krav Maga Association in New York, to find out how to handle armed robbers at close range.
Regardless of whether you approach you from the front or from the back, this video will show you how to turn the spear around for your robber.
When you approach from behind, you should turn around first, so that you can see your attacker and "get out of the shooting line," says Mizrachi.
Take the gun between your fore arm and your shoulder before you beat it in the face with your free elbow.
Hit him with the knee in the bar and twist while the attacker bends in front of pain, the gun out of his hands. Hit him with the run into the face and move backwards while they turn the gun on him.
In the case of attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the shooting line, take the gun and twist it so that the attacker cannot shoot.
At the same time reduce the weight on the weapon and hit the attacker on the chest, then twist the weapon out of his grip before they move backward and turn the weapon on him.
Sounds difficult?
Look at the video to see exactly what the situation is like.
But remember, it's safest to hand over your money in the event of a robbery - unless you're a Krav Maga Grandmaster.
Traveler Ian Wright shames his tongue for a guide in the most dirty places in Europe
A British traveler subjected his immune system and grievances to a serious test - leaking some of the most dirty and disgusting places in Europe.
The presenter and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk, scraped his train on a Euro-Sham, a railing on the Piccadilly Circus, a rinsing button of a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to demonstrate the resilience of his immune system.
Before licking each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he's going to let himself in.
But the experiment filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" brought some surprising results to light.
The thought of licking the rinsing button of a train toilet that has already been used by thousands of others may be completely repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.
On his journey across Europe, Mr Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, nothing he leaked left more than a bad aftertaste in his mouth.
Mr Wright became known for testing the resilience of his intestine by traveling through the world and eating strange as well as wonderful things.
From public land at railway stations to toilet washers, the task of which definitely put his immune system under a sample
In the film he said: "As a child, I was relatively un concerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water."
In the film, he definitely lived up to his reputation.
The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.
Its sample strip showed a luminometer number of more than 4000 units.
In comparison, the number of hands washed fresh is less than 60.
But there was a Russian toilet that he refused to lick after their luminometer number was more than 4000 units, while freshly washed hands had one of less than 60
Mr. Wright and the Finnish producer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength", which shows the number of bacteria in different locations such as the bathroom
In the film, he says, "That comes close to the worst thing I've smelled in a toilet."
There's nothing more dirty than that!
I'm not gonna lick anything here because it's disgusting in here.
"The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish producer of dairy products Valio.
The company equips Mr Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system.
Valios Senior Venice President of Snacks, juices and New Categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something fascinating to look at and at the same time explain the benefits of probiotics.
We carried out crazy brainstorms that ended with us saying, "Let's call Ian."
They claim that interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon
Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a wider context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the meaning of intestinal health and how they are linked to the immune system.
The growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.
I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added: "Let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had licked some of the things I had instructed him to lick, like the disgusting Russian toilet shown in the film."
Of course, there were things that made it easier to get Ian to lick them and others in which this was quite difficult.
I'm glad we recorded some of these dirty treats on film."
In a 2015 survey conducted by Valio, 84 percent of all lactic acid bacteria surveyed reported, in particular, the well-being of stomach and intestines and 58 percent, that they at least occasionally use products containing added lactic acid bacteria.
Asocial family destroyed before delogging Social housing in Saltash, Cornwall
An asocial family left their social home after a delogging with a damage of £50,000 because it had terrorized its neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown by her property in Saltash, Cornwall after a long list of complaints.
After being violently removed from their property, shocked employees of the housing cooperative found property in an irreparable state.
The walls showed clapping holes, wood pieces were torn up, garbage was scattered on the floor, and graffiti was lubricationd to the walls.
The family has been relocated and it is assumed that she now lives in a private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, who works for the house management at Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid the apartment could be repaired.
She said, "It was an absolute nightmare for people here, and I believe that people don't have to live that way.
There are many things to consider, since this property will probably be considered not so beautiful part of Cornwalls.
The family is notorious and so is its reputation.
The couple had three sons living in the apartment and the police said that the terror that the family had committed included street fights with baseball hits, intimidators of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive screaming, fighting and cursing.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, received an arrangement for anti-social behaviour in June.
In some rooms of the house, which may be demolished, old garbage has been found
In the property where drugs have been traded in the past, the wood pieces have been torn up
Neighbors said they saw them fighting on the street and had to be phoned regularly
Cornwall Housing, after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to take off voluntarily, delegated her and her partner this week violently from the estate.
The delogging was celebrated by eased neighbors who said that their life was made hell.
One of them said, "They didn't care about anyone."
We lived next to them for 20 years and it was always bad.
The countless times we tell the police here are incredible.
"Today we couldn't sleep."
We got up because it was so quiet here - we're not used to it!
Now that they're finally gone, it'll be nice.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said that it would have failed to cooperate with the local authorities.
The family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals for 20 years
On the overcrowded side of the town hall, trash and old toys were thrown down
He added: "It is a shame that the tenant failed to accept any responsibility for their behavior and for their family, since a delogging is always the last step to consider Cornwall Housing.
This was a very difficult case because the behavior was extreme and their actions had to be terrible for their neighbors.
I appreciate all the work that my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall have done, as well as members of the community who have bravely responded to us and have provided us with the information.
I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbours and convey the message that anti-social behaviour is not tolerated.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times, but that they were all over 20.
A dirty mattress left in one of the bedrooms of the house after the delogging on the floor
Workers of the house administration will now have to dispose of garbage mountains that surround the house
In 2014, the police ran a raid in the house and found over 70g of cannabis as well as scales, paraphernalia and cash of £1,700.
Skeldon received a fine after confessing to the possession of a Class B drug in commercial intent.
She claimed that the money was for a tombstone of her son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After they were without a shelter, it is assumed that Tanya and her partner now live in a private accommodation in Plymouth.
Many of the walls of the house were stained with graffiti.
The police say they're going to delog tenants who don't comply with the house rules.
Angela Crow of the Devon and Cornwall Police informed that the delogging was a clear warning to the other tenants who did not comply with the house rules.
"This is about those who think they can behave without self-provocation and those who have been damaged by such behavior," she said.
Devon and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behavior that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists panicked in Portugal after a deep-flying military jet beach is over
Sun Worshipers in Aveiro, Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
A Portuguese P-3C Orion aircraft of the Air Forces laid down an incredible crash flight
Air Forces indicated that it was on a training flight, but insisted that there was no safety risk
This was the moment when frightened tourists start to panic after a deep-flying jet falls over a full beach.
Dramatic video recordings showed how the military aircraft flew almost in the immediate vicinity of the sun worshipers on the beach in Aveiro in northern Portugal.
The vacationers jumped up when they understandably began to worry about the noise of the jet engines without first seeing what was happening to them through the clouds.
The incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the many vacationers who posted videos about the dramatic Fly-By in the social media, said, "Two times it really flew very deep and there was a moment when it looked like it was crashing."
Nuno Arroja added: "I was surfing right now and it felt like the plane was falling on me."
Tourists on the beach of Aveiro were panicked when the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly deep
The Portuguese Air Forces today indicated that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and had to fly so deep that this was the only way to recognize them.
The speaker said that due to the poor visibility of nearby surface fires, the jet flew a little deeper than usual, but the air forces insisted that safety was not at risk at all.
This summer, fires destroyed parts of the mainland of Portugal, in which four people died on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Forces today indicated that the pilot had to fly so deeply because of the conditions - strong fog and fire smoke - which limited his view
The plane was on a training flight where the pilot had to take fishing boats as part of the exercise.
Supercup: Barca with concerns about Seville
Seville - The Barcelona FC fights for the first step to the first title win in the new football season on Sunday.
The Catalans compete in the Spanish Supercup in the duel against the FC Sevilla, and the replay starts three days later in Camp Nou.
The double-winner must waive Neymar in force fairs with the lower Cup finalist and ruling Europa League champion, among other things, who competes with Brazil in the Olympic football tournament.
In addition, the goalie Marc-Andre ter Stegen is missing.
In training, the German suffered a tape dip in the knee, which explains the one-off question at Barca in favour of Claudio Bravo at least for the time being.
The Chilean International and Ter Slogen have been competing for the status of number one in Barcelona for two years.
Coach Luis Enrique gave up a clear decision in this respect and left Bravo in the league, but Ter Stegen made the lead in most other applications.
Before the first mandatory game of the new season, the Spanish champion has doubts about the fitness status of the team, which was humiliated on Saturday in a test game of Liverpool with 0:4.
Also in the 3-2 test galopp against Sampdoria on Wednesday, Lionel Messi and Co. did not really convince.
Seville, in turn, has to digest the 2-3 defeat after being extended in the European Supercup against Real Madrid and strives for the second triumph at the "Supercopa de Espana".
Barcelona has won the record with eleven results in this competition so far.
Ma Long in its own league to table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic player.
The 27-year-old defeated his countryman and title defender Zhang Jike 4:0 (12,5,4,4) on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro.
With this, the world rankings first won the "Golden Grand Slam" with successes at World Cup, World Tour final tournament and Olympia.
Bronze went to the Japanese Jun Mizutani.
As expected, the two Chinese made it into the final game and made up the title of each other.
This made it clear that for the third time in a row, a Chinese would pick up the single title in the sign of the Five Rings.
The last non-Chinese on the top Olympic step was the former SVS-NÖ Legioner Ryu Seung-min from South Korea.
Ma and Zhang were left alone on the record, between the sets and at time-outs they had no coaches with them.
They had moved back to the gallery and let their guardians go on each other in the fair competition alone.
"I've played the matches up here for my country."
"I'm playing for myself in the final," Zhang said.
After the game, gold and silver medal winners posing with the China flag.
The match itself was unexpectedly one-sided.
Ma had to fight with his 28-year-old opponent only in the first sentence.
After that, he set the pace on the plate and left Zhang only 13 points.
The superiority of Ma did not develop the expected captivating match.
Nevertheless, there were enough breathtaking ball changes to see.
Mizutani won the bronze match against the 40-year-old Vladimir Samsonov 4:1.
In his quarter-final against the German European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov, the Belarusian had suffered a rib injury, was then in medical treatment, had to be satisfied with sheet metal.
The Sweden Jan-Ove Waldner (38/2004) and Jörgen Persson (42/2008) had also become Olympic-fourths in a similar high table tennis age.
Donald Trump overcomes violent problems" in the election campaign
The leadership of the U.S. republicans is plagued by massive concerns, even in traditionally conservative states their majority.
Presidential candidate Donald Trump now admitted weaknesses in his election campaign in the former Republican high castle Utah.
A rare moment in which the normally large and self-confident multimillionaire expressed such concerns as correspondents reported.
After he threw 16 rivals out of the race within his own Republican camp, the doubts about his success in the fight for the White House are growing.
"We have huge problems in Utah," Trump told evangelical Christians, who asked for support in important states such as Ohio, Florida or Virginia.
If false reports about his candidacy were to be found, he returned to his well-known media chatter.
Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image
Utah is usually a safe bank for Republicans.
According to a survey of SurveyUSA from June, Trump and his competitor from the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, were on the same footing.
Other institutions see Trump as front, but not with the distance common to Republican candidates in the state.
Arizona and Georgia are also considered at risk.
In an interview by CNBC, Trump answered the question of how he wanted to stop Clinton's advance: "Just as I have done so far."
And after that: this will be "either successful or I will make a very nice, long holiday".
He doesn't do anything but "tell the truth."
If it is not sufficient for him in the end for reasons of political correctness, Trump continued.
Then I return to a very good way of life.
According to press reports, the Trump party should have threatened to delete funds to support its election campaign, if it could not present better polls.
Instead, the Republicans' candidates for the Congress are to be taken more seriously.
Olympia: Threesome fraud at doping test
The IOC wants to set up a disciplinary commission on the case.
Kenya's light athletes are threatening after the second doping affair at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
After a fraud attempt at a doping check in the Olympic village, Kenya sent a coach home.
The International Olympic Committee announced that it would immediately set up a disciplinary committee to investigate the case.
One Kenyan official had announced that the former Sprinter and today's coach, John Anzrah, had made a urine test in the Olympic village under the name of the 800-metre-runner Ferguson Rotich.
This had been reported to the team management of Kenya by the doping controls.
The World Association of IAAF has asked the IOC for information on the case to try out its own investigations, an IAAF spokesman told.
" Depending on the results of the investigation and the following measures of the IOC, the IAAF will carry out an assessment," said an IAAF statement.
"He (Anzrah) went to the doping control station and issued himself as Ferguson Rotich, gave the sample and signed it," said Kenya's Head of Mission Stephan Arap Soi.
He was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete who was on the list for the World Anti-Doping Agency's training controls.
Ferguson Rotich had become over 800 meters in 2015 in Beijing World Cup-fourths.
Four days earlier, the Kenyan athletics head of delegation Michael Rotich had been deducted from the Rio Games.
He is said to have informed athletes of upcoming doping tests against money payments in his country.
According to media reports, he was arrested on his return to Nairobi Airport.
Kenya has been under special observation at the IOC for a long time after numerous doping incidents.
The announcement of the more than 2000 doping controls imposed by the IOC prior to the Rio Games has been unusually preceded by the fact that athletes from Kenya and Russia in particular are being visited.
The World Anti-Doping Agency had put a lot of pressure on the African country to create an anti-doping law and a functioning control system before the summer games in Brazil.
The law was passed a few weeks before the Olympic Conference.
As a result, WADA took Kenya from the list of countries whose doping fighting is in accordance with the rules of the WADA.
Kenya is considered a large runner nation.
The country's athletes won the most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing.
A number of ARD television reports have repeatedly made accusations that doping funds are easily accessible in Kenya and that there is a significant mentality of sports fraud.
The IOC member Richard Pound recently requested a similar investigation in Kenya as he had done in Russian athletics.
It has been demonstrated that this sport has been performed in a comprehensive and systematic manner.
Russia's light athletes were then excluded from the summer games.

In the Shakespeare Year, the Salzburg Festival presents the "West Side Story" with Tony and Maria as a tragic love couple, similar to Romeo and Julia.
With a surprising Cecilia Bartoli.
A musical conquers Salzburg: the "West Side Story", Leornard Bernstein's masterpiece.
The artistic director Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical to the temple of classicalism and fulfilled a youth dream with the role of Mary.
In the orchestral grave the Simón Bolívar Orchestra under the direction of the Venetian conductor Gustavo Dudamel: "This music is full of rhythm," he energizes.
We always say she's very Latin-American.
There are many Latin American ingredients in their tempo and melody.
It is a wonderful mixture, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.
I'd say we really have Bernstein's music in our blood!
In this production Bartoli plays an elderly Mary.
She remembers her love with Tony with grief, while the younger Maria plays and dances.
The role of Mary has always fascinated me.
First because it is musically exceptional!
And then there would be Mary's personality.
She says in her song: "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and white and bright".
So she is smart, of course also naive, and very passionate.
"She resembles me very much, my Italian character, which I have as a Roman," Bartoli laughs.
Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."
It's such an honor to work with her.
She's a very generous person.
And Bartoli gives the compliment: "Dadamel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate!"
Conducting is a necessity for him.
You can see it in each of his movements, in his eyes, it's his life!
It is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him.
We both have a rather southern temperament, a fire, a passion and also a cheerful approach to life, which is very important at all!
For American director Philip Wm. McKinley, the "West Side Story" is highly up-to-date: "This piece is about prejudice and fanaticism."
Today we have the refugees, then the Puerto Ricans went to New York, and the New Yorkers did not want them.
They are the same topics, and they are just as meaningful today as they were at the time.
59 years later, the piece is still relevant.
London Schoolgirl, who joined the IS, was killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join the ISIS, reportedly died in Syria.
The lawyer Taíke Akunjee said that her family learned about her death in Raqqa, Syria a few weeks ago.
It was suspected that she was killed by a Russian air raid in Raqqa, the group's bulwark in the country, reported ITV news on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, died shortly after she had planned to leave the war-ridden country and return to England.
"One can only hope that the only good is - as a reminder and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going to a war zone - to prevent people from ever making this decision," said Akunjee.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other schoolgirls from the east of London boarded an airplane for Turkey and then a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultana's family was told that she married an ISIS fighter in Syria - and became a widow within a few months.
Reid says that Clinton will remain candidate for the Supreme Court in the event of an election win at Garland
Harry Reid, leader of the Democrats in the Senate, is convinced that the presidential candidate of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, will nominate the judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court.
The Republicans in the Senate have blocked Garland's confirmation since his nomination by Barack Obama in March.
The majority leader in the Mitch McConnell Senate is of the opinion that the next president will appoint the successor of the late judge at the Supreme Court Antonin Scalia.
Reid said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he expected Clinton to select Garland "with a certain degree of certainty".
A speaker from Reid later said that he hadn't talked to Clinton yet if she would nominate Garland and speculate.
He praised Garland and said that Clinton's team wouldn't cause trouble with a new candidate.
Garland is the top judge of the U.S. Appellation Court for the District of Columbia.
Raid said Republicans blocked Garland's nomination, were Lakais and helpers of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He also noted that Donald Trump was not suitable for the Presidential Office.
Treats wants Nacktkalendar for "Women and Men"
The Treats Magazine works with photographer David Bellemere to release a 1970s Pirelli-inspired Calendar for 2017.
But instead of famous naked people, they want to find the next generation of top models for their NU Muse Calendar for 2017.
The editor-in-chief of Treats Steve Shaw told us at the beginning of this year that his nude magazine was different from old school playboys, since "Playboy is for men".
I'll do this for women.
He seems to think that the calendar does too.
"We have to return to the depiction of timeless and classic nudity, in which both women and men feel comfortable and inspired by these images of a female body," said Shaw in a press release on the release of the calendar.
Women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art.
Models can submit their pictures online or personally to open casting calls in Los Angeles and New York.
Turkey: Kurdish community expects mass flight
"Whoever does not adapt and praises Erdogan, sits on packed suitcases," says Ercan Karakoyun, Chairman of the Gülen-near Foundation Dialogue and World.
In the short term, the Kurdish municipality of Germany expects tens of thousands of people seeking protection who flee from Turkey to Germany.
In the medium term, it could even become "some hundred thousand", believes association president Ali Toprak.
Due to the tough action of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the coup attempt, the Kurdish municipality of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany.
"In the short term, I expect tens of thousands, with a few hundred thousand protection seekers from Turkey in Germany in the medium term, when the Erdogan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition," says Association President Ali Toprak of the "world" of Friday.
Because the government had already covered Kurdish strongholds with criminal acts months ago, 500,000 Kurds within Turkey were on the run.
After the doomed coup, secular and oppositional ethnic Turks would be added.
Many will want to start anew in Europe if they are further suppressed in Turkey.
"It can't be that a state that receives refugees itself produces refugees in its own country," said Toprak.
The head of the association complained of the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish but also in Alevitan cities.
In this way Erdogan wants to increase the exit pressure on the remaining Kurds.
"They are the last major minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have been exterminated or driven out over the past hundred years," said Toprak, who is also a CDU member.
The head of the association demanded that the federal government "position itself as sharply as Austria against Erdogan and his followers".
In Germany, too, a "witch hunt" against Erdogan critics takes place.
I don't feel safe in Germany for the first time in the last few months.
The German branch of the Gülen movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad.
More Turks will seek asylum in Germany, especially Kurds and oppositionists.
The branding as a Gülen trailer destroys teachers and other academics' professional existence.
"Whoever does not adapt and praises Erdogan, sits on packed suitcases, by the way, also the Kemalists and Seculars," said Ercan Karakoyun, Chairman of the Gülen-near Foundation Dialogue and Education, the "World".
As the newspaper reports on figures from the Federal Ministry of the Interior, the Turks already presented the largest group of asylum seekers recognized for political persecution in Germany before the coup.
By the 30th of June, these were 11,386 people, and thus almost 29 percent of all were recognized as eligible for asylum (39,625).
In this survey, there are no refugees from war, poverty or perspektiveness.
The right to asylum under the Basic Law is exclusively political, i.e. from the state, individually persecuted.
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: "Go where it hurts"
Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: The locals don't get anything from the summer election campaign - and the holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to choose the country day.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.
In 2021, the country elections will not take place again directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Schwerin Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.
Because it's more stupid than before: summer holidays, heat and country election campaign - that's biting.
The locals who are to be convinced by the election fighters are on vacation.
Most of the vacationers who are in the country on the road on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee are not locals, so do not choose the country day.
In addition, there are practical problems: during the holidays, helpers who hang up posters, blow up balloons, distribute flyers, and end up counting voices, just toilingly up.
Until September 4th, 2016, the election and last holiday day, Mecklenburg-Ultra once again has to pass election campaign just past the people.
The hot phase, if you can say that at all, has just begun.
And it's also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Selling, leader of a SPD/CDU coalition, must be afraid of his office.
The SPD, since 1998 strongest party, is now clearly behind the CDU in surveys.
Exciting is how strong Neuling AfD is cut off and what is left at the end of the coalition.
Sellering, 66 years old and since 2008 head of government, makes an almost inconspicuous election campaign, one turns away from his large posters.
He travels through the country, distributes roses and chats a little with the people, just as his legendary word-carrier predecessor Harald Ringstorff did.
Otherwise, soul ring has gotten cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel the blame for flowering the AfD.
Their refugee policy, their "We do it" has accelerated the rise of the right-wing populists, which will probably cost him the beautiful office now.
The CDU with its top candidate, the Interior Minister Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced what it is like to do in the right place at the wrong time.
She has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to large-scale meetings; Merkel is in the northeast.
But the target group was not right, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berliner and Saxony than Mecklenburger and Vorpommern.
"There was probably the majority from other federal states," complained Vincent Kokert, General Secretary of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in the NDR.
But no one from other corners of Germany is sorry to listen to Angela Merkel once.
Otherwise, the Northeast CDU largely renounces the usual election stands on marketplaces and in front of shopping centers with umbrellas and balloons.
That, says Kokert, only plays a "subordinate role".
The Union has also noted that in the country you are bubbling away the base, that it has to work hard to find a wire to the people again.
You go like the Left, the SPD, the Greens: in the wideness of the country hardly exists.
However, the advice of the CDU election fighter Kokert to his fellow fighters is self-evident: "You must go where it hurts, that is, where people are: village festivals, golden weddings, every birthday celebration must be used".
Because much is at stake, Selling has now called his SPD for a particularly committed election campaign.
In surveys, the Social Democrats were last behind CDU (25) and only just before the AfD (19).
At the 2011 election, the SPD had won clearly with 35.6 percent before the CDU (22).
The Greens, a small party with seven percent in the polls, are expected to make the leap into the country day.
They make the holiday note a modern virtue and spend most of their election campaign on the Internet.
"Online election campaign", it is called the president of the state Claudia Müller.
Otherwise, green campaigners are looking for local voters among the holidaymakers.
Silke Gajek, the top candidate, is just swirling through the Mecklenburg lakes with a houseboat and still likes it.
Their impression: "Electoral leave in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is not a punishment".
B27 refurbishment: restaurants suffer from blockage
The speed with which the B 27 is being renovated does not mean anything.
For those responsible for the construction work, which start at 5.30 a.m. and end at 8 p.m., there is all praise.
"They've made everything pretty sloppy," Elvira Tetzlaff says about the jet gas station.
This is a super team.
There is no delay either.
At the beginning of the week, the construction site could be moved to the south by half-time, and by the end of October, everything will be finished.
It is also praised that those responsible for the construction work should meet, for example, when it comes to the establishment of rescue access points.
Since the construction site has migrated south on Monday and the blockage of the Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen has also been lifted and the connection to Rottenburg has been restored, the traffic situation within the village has relaxed.
Citizens can now return to the B 27 from many things.
The escape traffic through the place seems to be going down.
"There were, in some cases, considerable complaints," says Florian King, Deputy Chief Executive Officer responsible for the technical management of the reorganisation.
The residents of Bachsatzstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise, because many of them were searching for sluggish paths and were more familiar with their navi than with the signs.
This led to some trucks being destroyed in residential areas.
Since the speed limits were also not met, the municipality demanded the measuring vehicle from Mössingen.
"There have been significant excesses," says King, who once made himself aware of the situation on the ground.
Two to three per minute have already been flashed.
The fastest was on the way at 77 kilometres in the tempo 30 zone.
Since the construction site has moved on, however, it has become quieter.
For businessmen on the B 27, it is only a little comfort that the street is now open again for customers from Rottenburg.
Businessmen don't like to look at the cards.
But that the B 27 renovation has led to sales cuts in them, let everyone who is asked see through.
However, some are more and some less affected.
Whoever has less to do with the "end customer", that is, produced for other companies, for whom the renovation has little consequences.
At the Autohaus Maier Thomas Sulz also speaks of a "highest slight decline", but also acknowledges that of course "the running clientele is missing".
The locals along the road are busiest.
J. Albert Göhner, owner of the Steakhouse, formerly Krone, finds clear words.
That's already threatening existence.
Not only him, but all the restaurants have hit it hard.
The customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil were missing.
We must be happy about every euro turnover.
The sales loss is "widely more than 50 percent".
The road renovation had dropped its operation "by two years".
He had half of his employees released.
If I had a company with 4,000 employees and half had been released, politics would have reacted differently.
Instead, President-in-Office Jörg Schmidt replied to a request from Gohner whether there could be a financial compensation, stating that the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the benefits of the situation on B 27. Now it must also bear the disadvantages resulting from the remediation.
Göhner knows of other districts, where such a thing was handled more generously.
In all the complaints, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist.
Finally, the family business has been located here since 1715, he refers to the long history.
He can understand that other regulars are now less often looking by due to the complicated traffic management.
If you can't drive here, it's also beautiful elsewhere.
The fact that his regular clients come back after the completion of the renovation work has no doubt about that.
Despite the crises with BSE and avian influenza, Göhner holds the impact of the B 27 construction work on his clientele for the greatest crisis his restaurant has experienced in its many years of history.
Six months of construction work, that's already brutal.
On behalf of the fight against terrorism, laws are constantly being put in place.
Following the recent attacks, Interior Minister de Maizière is now presenting a thick security package.
But what does a tolerance status have to do with terror?
And what does the coalition partner say about all of this?
Thomas de Maizière gives the reconciler.
All his proposals were "politically reasonable" to the coalition partner, says the Federal Minister of the Interior in presenting his new security package.
They don't overwhelm anyone.
Other further issues were first discussed within the parties.
I'm also involved.
As Minister of the Interior, however, he was given results and at a "achieveable consensus" within the coalition.
After the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, De Maizière left a little time to present his conclusions on security in the Republic.
But they are now all the more extensive.
Some things are already known, announced, tailored: The fact that a new security authority is supposed to take care of cracking encrypted communication is not new.
Neither is the fact that Germany has to implement several EU standards on passenger data and arms law.
The call for more video surveillance and personnel for the security authorities is also not surprising.
In part, de Maizière launches a second call for proposals that have not yet been made with the SPD: he wants to punish sympathy advertising for terrorist groups and to stop jihadists with double citizenship from the German passport.
"These will be difficult points for the SPD," admits the CDU-Man.
Nevertheless, he considers this reasonable and does not demand anything that would have no chance at all for the coalition partner.
A few new ideas will also be presented by de Maizière.
They partly have it in themselves: He plans quick procedures for deportations and more ways to arrest people before deportation.
Refugees who are brought specifically into the country should have their smartphones checked before and disclose social media accounts for a security check.
In tolerances for rejected asylum seekers, he wants to put some even worse than before - for example, those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers in order to conceal their identity.
Some of them are politically and legally sensitive.
Some of them are still inexhaustible and leave questions open.
And on a number of points - in the treatment of patient people for example - the question arises: What does this have to do with security and terror?
Yes, says de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the topics of refugees and terror.
But it can't be said that the perpetrators of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.
In addition, in view of the high numbers of refugees, many people were concerned about security.
And things that deeply occupied people were not excluded even in election times.
Internal security has become enormously focused.
Only the attacks in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.
Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.
The uncertainty is great.
And yes, there are election struggles on.
Union and SPD are therefore increasingly involved in the issue of internal security.
In the last few days, the two parties have gone high.
Only a barley dispute about the equipment of the federal police, then about a security policy Idea collection of some Union Interior Ministers, in which the head of the department also demands a ban on Burka and a rejection of double citizenship.
De Maizière is also trying to make up for reconciled tones.
He doesn't think he's going anywhere from a double pass.
We have satisfied the discussion in Germany.
To reopen them, don't make sense.
And with a Burka ban, he had constitutional concerns.
Whether his own package is constitutionally-proof at all corners and whether it is actually "presumptuous" for the coalition partner is still to be seen.
There's a lot in there that could cause a fight.
However, the SPD is also currently trying to profile itself on the topic of internal security.
Head of the Party Sigmar Gabriel first carefully signals willingness to talk and says: "The SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further increasing security".
Volkswagen's still coming through with a smile.
Despite diesel scandals, extradition rates are rising worldwide.
But it's not going around in all markets.
In the recall action, there is a vortex around a term.
Volkswagen starts with extraditions in the second half of the year.
Europe's largest car manufacturer, despite its many brands and a few well-running markets, has continued to have a positive impact over the past year.
But in July, the core brand VW was weakening especially in Western Europe, again taxing total sales, as reported by the company mentioned in the Dax.
Worldwide, the VW brand sold 1.8 percent less vehicles in July with 449100 cars than in the previous month.
In Western Europe alone, after China's second most important market, sales were 14 percent below the previous month's level.
In Germany's home market, deliveries dropped by almost a sixth.
Head of the brand Jürgen Stackmann led the weaker figures from July, mainly to two days less sales in Europe.
In addition, in some core markets there has been a retention of sales through "changed economic conditions".
In addition to the situation surrounding the coup attempt in Turkey, the British vote on the exit from the EU has also been burdened, explained one speaker.
In the U.S., where the exhaust gas affair first escalated, there is also a minus.
Large support for VW is the Chinese market.
Overall, the mainly affected brand of the Lower Saxony continues to be gleaming through the Diesel scandal: After the first seven months, only a drop in delivery is recorded from 0.9 percent to 3.37 million vehicles.
Chief Sales Officer Fred Kappler continued to show a sales increase from January to July.
1.3% more vehicles delivered Volkswagen at that time, 5.904 million worldwide.
Volkswagen had manipulated with a software exhaust test.
In Germany alone, VW calls about 2.5 million cars for conversion to the workshops.
In the course of the conversion, VW confirmed that the conversion of the cars has no negative effects.
After the conversion of the vehicles, there was no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power.
The car manufacturer issued a "guarantee" certificate to customers after the conversion, but did not speak of a "guarantee", as it was called on Friday in business circles.
The reason is legal fineness.
The "Focus" had reported that Volkswagen was now granting its German customers a guarantee for converted diesel models.
This was confirmed last Monday by VW representatives at the Federal Ministry of Transport.
It was confirmed from the Ministry of Transport that there was this meeting.
"VW has to fully fulfil the requirements of my investigative commission and KBA."
"Derogations are not accepted," said Federal Minister for Transport Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) according to the Ministry.
VW has taken over the guarantee that fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power after conversion will not lead to deterioration and that all vehicle type relevant values have remained unchanged.
Volkswagen itself does not use the term "guarantee" as it was called in corporate circles.
With the broad term "guarantee", Volkswagen sees the possibility that, for example, half a year after the conversion, customers might come to a workshop with a motor damage - and this could result in the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it.
In the interest of customers, it is also important to avoid any other damage that does not have anything to do with the exhaust scandal, as it was said, being insecure in respect of possible guarantee schemes.
Therefore, VW does not use the term "guarantee".
The Raiffeisenbank Gmund am Tegernsee requires rich savers in the future - as the second institute in Germany.
Chief of Bank Josef Paul said on Thursday: "It's only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on giro or daily money accounts."
The Bundesverband Deutscher Banken speaks of a single case and sees no signal in it: Normal savers would "not be afraid to pay for their savings-gross penalty rate".
Banks will have to pay their 0.4% penalty interest overnight at the European Central Bank (ECB).
From September, Raiffeisenbank Gmund will charge this fee to private and corporate customers for deposits of over 100,000 euros on giro or daily cash accounts.
"The first 100,000 euros are free."
"The next 100,000 euros will cost 400 euros a year in the future," said Paul.
He has been guarding 40 million euros for some time, which could be withdrawn from one day to another and which he could not use.
"They lie with me on the central bank account and cause 0.4 percent costs," said the bank manager.
"I can't lay down for every million euros."
He now passes on the costs in accordance with the polluter principle.
Just leaving the cash in the safes of the Raiffeisenbank would be far too dangerous: "I've already experienced four robberys, I don't like the fifth!" said the bank's board.
Most customers would understand and switch to other types of investment.
Few migrated to other banks.
The Bavarian Co-operative Association stated: "The ECB's extreme monetary policy rate causes significant costs for all banks".
To carry them alone is "not possible in the long term".
Some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account management, credit cards or transfers.
With penalty rates for deposits starting from three million euros, the Thüringer Volks- und Raiffeisenbank Altenburger Land had made headlines with its Skatbank branch in 2014.
Michael Kemmer, Chief Executive Officer of the Banking Association, said: "We do not expect private customers to have to pay for deposits across the board, and competition in Germany is far too strong among banks and savings banks."
A banker said that on Lake Tegern there were "a clientele that is somewhat more luxuriantly equipped with wealth".
"This can become a problem for a small bank" if it is guarded free of charge.
Founded in 1911, Gmund has branches in Bad Wiessee, Rottach-Egern, Kreuth and Tegernsee.
The region is home to well-known actors, athletes and entrepreneurs.
The Bavarian cooperative association "No other banks are currently known to calculate a deposit replacement for private customers," said Spokesman Ernst.
At the end of June, Uwe Fröhlich, President of the Federal Association of German Volksbanken and Raiffeisenbanken (BVR), said: "The threshold to go negative towards the private customer is very, very high".
Competition is tough, and it threatens to lead investors to competition.
The customers in Germany will not let this fall in width.
Destination records: Who actually buys records?
Lonely men of middle age love plates.
Before you rush to the comment section to sow it under the pseudonym NotAllMenMittelenMittelenOlder with harsh insults, this statement is derived from current data.
According to YouGov, the much discussed resurgence of records is not due to a boom in Millennials that wants to welcome the novelty of physical objects, but to Midlife nostalgia.
Those who recently bought a record are likely to be between 45 and 54.
In fact, the age group 18-24 is the most unlikely buyer group.
It is also not a hordes of hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers keep their feelings rather for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending alone (69% vs. 66%).
But are the results of YouGov correct?
If this blog were a news report on TV, the camera would follow me while I walk in the middle of a busy street in Soho, wear a modest grey suit and study wildly before I stop, hold my hands and say something definite like, "Well, let's take a closer look at it."
So let's take a look at it.
Even if the heart of Sohos slowly loses its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where independent sellers once lived - there is still a handful of fantastic record specialties.
I would probably ask the cameraman to switch off the camera for the next part where I stand close to different men in such shops and try to estimate their age and mind by observation.
Stuart from Glasgow, 55, to whom I went from Sister Ray (number of data: two young women, three men middle-aged) to Reccless Records (number of data: eight men middle-aged, one woman, probably around 20) is a day for a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.
Is he a collector, I ask?
"I guess," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates.
These records, pictured above (he sent me the scan by e-mail, I didn't follow him home), dressed the walls of his living room.
The reason he owns such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records that he could not afford when they appeared and again buy items he sold when he was young and pleaded.
"Many things I buy are from the late '60s, early '70s, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. Things I was probably too young to buy them," he says.
He agrees that those who buy records are rather introverted and like to spend time alone, adding: "I don't smoke and I don't drink very much.
That's my vice.
Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many customers he meets are related to the YouGov profile.
However, he has also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media hpe, people who have heard about the comeback and see themselves being prompted to buy their old records again.
People usually got rid of the conversations I had around 1998 or 1999 of their collection.
Customers who once sold their records to buy their CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again," he says.
This would explain the boom to followers of the record revival of a certain age.
But what about the alleged emotional significance of plates?
It only takes a few seconds in a business like Phonica to realize that record transactions offer a soothing community of like-minded people.
According to Wez, some of the older customers took the lead in the contactless payment system.
Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to withdraw from the stability of familiar record envelopes, from objects that awaken happy youth memories.
"I think sometimes it can be the filling of an empty or the possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort," says Wez.
It's like this with me as a collector, and I think many people do.
It is a simple way to engage spiritually.
"We are like their social workers!" an employee flows from a record stack.
A survey by the ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people who bought a record last month had not heard them.
The survey also found that 41% have a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record do not own a record player.
At this time of the news report, I would probably look very concerned as I browse through a stack of Bossa Nova compilations.
Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (number of data: three men of middle age) has noticed a "tropheena aspect" of the Revival.
"Someone just recently came in here and said, "I don't own a record player, but I'd like to buy a radiohead record so I can put it on the shelf," he says.
This is not a big percentage, but it happens end up.
More productive, less musicy.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
These are younger people, not older ones, who come in slowly.
Fopp, who has devoted almost a whole floor to the records, has a colorful audience when I go in.
There are couples around 70, tourists taking photos, teens and women middle age.
Even if the atmosphere is a little less relaxed than in the aforementioned shops - Wild Beast's latest synthesizer and sex-packed pop instead of experimental jazz from the speakers - it is good to see such diversity among customers.
None of them look unusually lonely, but nagging psychological traumas are hard to detect when standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been running around the store for a few minutes and looks at the variety of plates for sale.
She's more like a window shopping than a big shopping.
She doesn't deserve much, so collecting records is not a real option, she says.
It costs a lot.
It's easy to hear music from a computer or in other ways, but the beauty of records is..." she drives off with a loved sigh.
I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.
My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: Urban Outfitters.
While I'm giving the impression of patterning the jeans hotpants, I'm watching a group of young teenage girls grouping around Polaroid cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter think about buying a Crosley record player.
To the left is a staircase, a wall full of records of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, essential records for an average collection.
No one looks at them - perhaps because they are purely decorative, some so far up that it is impossible to touch them.
It's pure "plattenkunst".
But given that every attraction for these items means more money for the industry and that some customers could send to the depths of Sohos for more, there is nothing to complain about.
It is no surprise that a population that has more time and money than others is also the one that spends most on luxury items such as plates.
Even though my research showed that the results of YouGov are correct, they are disregarded, at least in record stores in Soho, by the large number of female collectors who exist in reality, record stores and online forums.
These people are probably working hard in school or in offices.
They certainly do not spend their Thursday morning strolling through record shops of Berwick Street and leafing through plates, while avoiding the staring look of an ominous, 30-year-old false moderator who is standing up above the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Greenland shark is the longest living vertebrate - video report
Scientists say that Greenland shark has the longest life span of all vertebrates on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who investigates sharks, says that the record was with a female who is assumed to be between 272 and 512 years old and five meters long.
French court rejects offer about demolition of shops in the jungle refugee camp
A French court has refused an offer from the authorities in Calais to tear down dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, where thousands of refugees live.
At a court hearing this week, the Calais authorities argued that the state should be empowered to tear down 72 provisional shops in which persons within the warehouse sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, sell, offer hairdressing services, or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants.
The Calais Prefecture argued that these places should be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which would pose a fire risk and health risk.
Humanitarian groups informed the court that shops and restaurants were important because the free meals offered by the government-supported association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.
They also argued that the provisional shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.
A Lille court ruled that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people who run the 72 provisional transactions, but acknowledged that the concerns of Calais Prefecture were "absolutely understandable."
Judge Jean-François Molla said that the grocery stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much greater role than simply feeding people who "live in extremely precarious conditions."
He said that the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places threatened by the tear was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp, which is operated non-profit-making and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes and advice on asylum matters for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed the petition to keep the Kids' café.
In a letter to the Guardian, it was said that the closure would be "for these children of a disaster of which the youngest eight years are old."
The two aid organizations Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle camp had increased to over 9,000 people - the highest number up to now - after a steep increase in new arrivals during the summer.
Despite Olympic disappointment: Martin remains combative
Despite his disappointing appearance in the Olympic era, Radprofi Tony Martin does not want to be undermined.
"I continue to keep an eye on the World Cup, remain confident and continue to fight," wrote the 31-year-old on Facebook on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro.
He has no explanation for his miserable twelfth place at the sugar hut.
"It's really hard for me to comment on yesterday's time trial," said Martin.
He had to analyze in peace what reasons led to the debacle.
Martin wanted to compete for the title at the World Championships in Qatar in October.
"I'm going to look at everything that we've changed lately."
"That also counts my position," wrote the three-time World Champion, who had lost more than three minutes on the 54.5 km on the Olympic winner Fabian Cancellara (Switzerland) on Wednesday.
Olympia: Tennis professional Siegemund misses semi-finals
The victory of Laura Siegemund ended in the Rio quarter final: The world rankings-32. from Metzingen were missed by a 1:6, 1:6 against Monica Puig (Puerto Rico/WTA-Nr.
34) the semifinals of the Olympic tennis tournament.
Siegemund, who was plagued by back problems, was able to carry out her supplement only once and was powerless compared to the previous rounds.
On Thursday the medal hope Angelique Kerber (Kiel/Nr. 2) had the chance to jump into the lead round.
The Australian Open winner met Britishman Johanna Konta (No. 10).
As the last German tennis professional, Tommy Haas had brought a medal (silver) in Sydney in 2000.
There were two German DTB starters in the quarter final of summer games last year.
Never was a German duo in an Olympic single half-final.
Group increases with start-up for live video game transfers
Watching other people playing video games is a huge trend - it also wants to benefit Microsoft.
The technology group buys the start-up Beam, which specializes in this hobby.
As much money for the acquisition flows, Microsoft did not announce on Thursday.
With his offer, Beam did not start until January and already has more than 100,000 users.
You can watch others play, but you can also intervene yourself.
For example, they can give up missions and face enemies and provide equipment.
The Playful Activision Blizzard launches a new HD video service for the booming world of e-sports.
On the way to the global media event, Facebook is supposed to help.
The advertising industry has already stopped.
The employees of the start-up, which has been based in Seattle, Washington, to date, are moving to the Microsoft headquarters in Redmond, California, as Beam co-founder and CEO Matt Salsamendi reported.
For customers, therefore, nothing should change as a result of the acquisition.
According to Microsoft, Beam is integrated into the video game department around the Xbox console.
The market of live streaming of video game activities is growing rapidly.
Known platforms are Tswitch and YouTube Gaming.
Twitch had been bought by Amazon in 2014 - for almost a billion dollars.
YouTube Gaming belongs to the Google mother alphabet.
Here comes the Enforcement Trailer
Germany's lawns have to adapt to the next generation speedometers: in various federal states, including Hessen and Brandenburg, new lightning devices are tested, which are intended to be particularly effective.
For example, the futuristic Enforcement Trailer of Vitronic from Wiesbaden can be used in accident areas where it would be too dangerous for police mobile measurement.
For example, at motorway construction sites or bridges with temporary speed limit, there is often no infrastructure necessary to ensure compliance with the speed limit with a stationary flash.
However, a permanent mobile build-up can be too dangerous or costly.
The Enforcement Trailer is self-contained: its battery lasts five days with continuous measurement operation, the case data are transmitted encrypted by a modem.
With laser measurement technology, all vehicles can be captured simultaneously across several tracks.
Variable speed limits as well as transit bans according to time, lanes and vehicle class can also be monitored.
In high-speed condition one can move the trailer according to the manufacturer with any car with trailer coupling.
So that it is not easily stolen, it is lowered in measurement mode, so that the wheels disappear in the armored and by the way also fireproof outer shell.
In addition, a built-in alarm system is intended to protect the lightning from vandalism.
Since 2015, the trailer has been tested by Vitronic in various federal states and is now also used.
Foreign authorities also flash with the new technology: Recently France ordered 100 pieces, after an order of 150 pieces last year.
Great Britain picks up silver in the 7er rugby after Fiji Masterclass picks up gold
The impressive performance of the UK in the 7th rugby came in the final on Thursday evening to an abrupt stop at the last obstacle in the form of the Fijis when they were beaten with a result of 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji awarded a master class in handling, side-stepping, backs, line run and raw strength to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any color.
The defeat was sweetened by the not too bad consolation of the silver medal - Britain's fourth on that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The clear defeat of the Boxes, 7-5 in the semi-final on the same day could fall on them in the final.
But regardless of that, Fiji would have hit a 15-man team in best shape in this form.
It could be a consolation for GB - but it probably won't - that at least one Britishman will have a gold medal around his neck tomorrow: Fiji's Chief Trainer Ben Ryan, the former head of England from Wimbledon.
GB had a difficult path behind it.
Eight years ago, they lost every game under Ryan at the Adelaide Sevens.
This is where they lost only one.
This blow will hurt, but progress is amazing.
Fiji started wonderfully and had the attacks take off GBs out of fun.
It felt to Captain Tom Mitchell and Co. as if you were walking in driving buses. The World Series winners went up 5-5 when Osea Kolinisau ran up in the corner.
With another four minutes of play, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner, which he converted.
12-0 and GB hardly touched the ball.
A supreme tangle of Mitchell stopped the mountain from reaching a third goal by man Leone Nakarawa, but it just stopped Fiji.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua left a touchdown in the right corner and it stood 0-17 for GB.
Nakarawa added a new one since the rehearsing and there was still over a minute of playing time ... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou praised by other weak tacklings of the GB team and stormed to the line to make a goal.
The conversion brought a 29-0 to the break.
It's like Fiji was born to play the 7 while GB is still learning.
That's how it is.
GB made fundamental changes in the mid-term and closed the fijian gap...for all four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time until Joshua went through Tuisova after a brilliant interplay of Fiji.
Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game had long been in favor of the South Sea insulan, whose fans sang, waved flags and danced on the stand.
It was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fiji.
Mata Viliame put the i-cup with another attempt in the last seconds.
The whistle sounded, the Fiji hugged themselves, and GB kicked to death in the lawn.
Earlier that day Fiji had defeated Japan in the semi-finals with 20-5 and Britain pushed South Africa into a narrow semi-final match from the race - Great Britain's conversion of the difference.
Kyle Brown brought the box forward in the first half, but Dan Norton broke the line with an impressive footwork and scored a goal under the posts in the second half.
A brilliant late tackling by Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-Aside team, secured the win - and thus the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by the fight with the coach's cancer to win the row
There will be no more emotional gold than at these games and that means something.
From the first rowing to the last, 220 hard skys that go into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.
Although there were only the two sitting on the oar, there were three voices in the boat. The echo of the coach Robin Williams, was all present when they rowed the second Olympic gold in a row without a tax wife in succession, the first women in the history of British sports that set such a standard.
Their dominance was absolute, at least their 39.ter unbeatable use, which is also unprecedented.
What we see are two brilliant athletes who glide across the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not completely reflect the nature of triumph.
Behind each gold in rowing is a battalion of willing helpers who contribute to the incremental progress that makes the difference and it was no more helpful than the coach who did not know 30 months ago whether he would survive this day than was diagnosed with cancer.
As he said, it was risky.
I had bladder cancer, which can be operated on, and they did.
If you don't, he'll spread everywhere.
It would have been a pretty bad situation.
It changes a little the outlook.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio was lucky that he could start his treatment at the beginning of 2014, outside the season, which kept the interruption to a minimum, if that is the right term in such circumstances.
I needed money, so I had to get better soon.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suffice.
That's how it starts.
Rowing in itself is a challenge, but that makes it even bigger.
In the immediacy of the victory, her first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nervous morning talking to him a little more than usual, trying to deal with his own fears.
Stanning, who was a captain in the Royal Artillery Regiment in a deployment in Afghanistan, said, "I was an emotional wreck this week. That may be a bit extreme, but it means so much."
It only repeats how much it means to me, how much I and Helen and Robin have worked.
There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin we wouldn't be anyone, so a massive thank you to him. He's the best trainer in the world.
I couldn't have wanted a better person to train or a better trainer.
Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race in the last five years.
The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up.
Even in the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to open up, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.
We were very trapped at the moment.
Helen called "stay in the process, stay in the process."
It is really important not to let yourself be carried away.
We had a good start and at the same time we were not about to do something great.
We didn't want a fireworks today, we just wanted to achieve a good result, go out and win the race, what we did.
The couple will take one year off before it will make decisions about its future.
Glover must appear at a wedding next week, her own with the TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say that was my last race.
That would have meant too much pressure.
In London it took about six months to understand that I was an Olympic winner.
It was all so new to me and I was so stressed.
Here it took about four minutes.
That feels so much better," she said.
31 years of exemplary clarity
The managing director of the water purpose association "Veitensteingruppe", Ruppert Göller, retires.
The association is considered to be a "bavarian model".
A small Franconian drinking water association as a model for the large water producers.
That is what was said some time ago in the original sound in a contribution from the Bavarian radio.
A little later, the water forum of the government of Unterfranken appreciated the purpose association.
The work of the Veitensteingruppe was considered "bavarian-wide as an example".
Behind all of this is Rupert Göller, who was a 31-year-old employee, of whom 28 years as Managing Director.
Now he was retired at the age of 65.
The drinking water association of the Veitenstein group, based in Kottendorf, municipality of Breitbrunn, promotes about 150000 cubic metres of water annually and supplies 32 villages and hamlets with about 5500 inhabitants.
The municipalities are the municipalities of Kirchlauter, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and Baunach.
There are water supply contracts for other cities and municipalities.
The current chairman, Breitbrunn's mayor Gertrud Bühl (FW), reminded us that Rupert Göller was employed as a water station in 1985 and was already appointed as Managing Director of the Zielungsverband in 1988.
"His duties have been very varied and they ranged from water pipeline construction and maintenance work to office and organizational activities, the budget creation, calculation of fees and contributions to emergency operations on weekends," said the president.
As an outstanding event, it called the commissioning and initiation of the new wells (1994), land purchases in the new wells (1998) and compensation for farmers, the refurbishment of the high tanks (1999), the re-purchasing of a central computer control (2004) and the partial renewal of water pipelines.
There has been no stop, and there have been repeated changes because water means life and drinking water is the most important food.
In her laudatio she praised Göllers faithful, reliable and correct service over 31 years.
He has worked with a lot of heart blood for his water purpose association and he has actually lived the water purpose association as if it were his own company.
A few weeks ago, as a real practitioner, he was allowed to present the Veitenstein Group's concept of success for nitrate reduction in front of the Water Forum of the district of Unterfranken.
He has received a lot of recognition and praise for this.
Rupert Göller, for his part, praised Alfons Griebel, who had worked with him for 28 years.
He's the best water guard, and he was a loyal boy.
Together we were an unbeatable team.
From his point of view, he described the well building and the restructuring of the purpose association.
However, the biggest challenge and the most difficult use were the break at the high tank at Kirchlauter on January 3.
Here, at minus 17 degrees will have to work all night long so that the towns could be supplied with water.
Once again the supply of Neubrunn could only be maintained, because the high tank of Pettstadt was filled with hoses.
The management of the drinking water association was handed over to Daniel Stürmer from Lauter, who succeeds Rupert Göller.
The soprano Anna Netrebko is open to the autism of her son Tiago - and addresses other affected parents: "You must have the courage to talk about it."
"Medicine has made great progress," said the 44-year-old of the Italian newspaper "Corriere della Sera".
When the disease was detected with her son, she believed she had to die.
In the meantime, however, the eight-year-old Tiago has made good progress and is now learning privately in New York, where the best therapists have been.
"To give an example, if I ask him something two years ago when I sang the Milan Scala, he won't remember anything," said Netrebko.
But he is the happiest man on earth.
Tiago comes from Netrebko's connection to the bass baritone Erwin Schrott.
She is now married to the Tenor Yusif Eyvazov.
Relationship in Bargtheideheide - man shoots at companion
A 35-year-old man shot at his partner on Friday at 10.45 a.m. in a multi-family house in Bargteheide (Stormarn district) and killed her.
"The man himself called us and told us to shoot his partner," said a police spokeswoman.
The culprit is on the run, and after him is publicly hunted.
In the meantime, Germany, for Sven S. could be on the road.
The man is about 1,80 meters tall, muscular, browned and has a smoothness.
Meanwhile, the police have published a photo of him.
It's a few years old, though.
Meanwhile, the man wears a smooth.
The man should not be addressed directly.
He could carry the gun with him, the police said.
Whoever sees Sven S., call the 110.
The police are talking about a 'relationship'.
The victim was born in 1988, the perpetrator in 1981.
At first, the police in Lübeck did not want to give any information about the tathergang or the relationship between perpetrator and victim, but confirmed that a person had been killed.
"It's a murder crime."
"That's all we're saying at the moment," said a police spokeswoman in Lübeck.
According to eyewitnesses, a special mission command (SEK) was at the scene.
Steel - light-view for German steel industry
The crisis-stricken and energy-intensive German steel industry is spared from additional costs at millions.
Financial burdens that threatened the industry from the promotion of green electricity are off the table.
It remains with the exemption from the renewable energy surcharge at the existing plants for the so-called self-power production in the German steel industry, said Federal Minister of Economic Affairs Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the "West German General Newspaper" (WAZ, Friday issue).
"I'm really happy that we could finally achieve this after two years of tough negotiations."
The European Commission had therefore initially planned to ask steel producers using gas from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption.
According to the German Industry Association, the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year.
Gabriel told the WAZ that there was now a principle agreement with the EU Commission after talks with Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.
Only when the generators are replaced in the steelworks will an EEG surcharge of 20 percent fall.
But these too are not raised in the steel industry.
The IG Metall welcomed the agreement between Germany and the EU Commission on self-generation.
This largely sets the status quo of the previous scheme.
The successful efforts of Gabriel have been of particular importance to the steel industry.
"With regard to our campaign 'Steel Is a Future', this is a first step."
"More must follow."
"Climate and employment targets must also be weighed in the reform of emissions trading," said IG Metall-Chef Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt.
Since the financial crisis in 2008, the steel industry in Europe has suffered from overcapacity and a significant price pressure.
Last year, the situation intensified as China’s world’s largest producer country threw massive steel on the world market in view of the weakening domestic demand.
European producers accuse Chinese steel companies of price dumping.
In the course of this spring, the situation has been somewhat relaxed.
On the one hand, import duties imposed on imported steel have had an effect, and on the other hand, the economic prospects in China have been brightened.
It is unclear how sustainable the price recovery is.
The German industry primer Thyssenkrupp remained cautious on Thursday.
Last but not least, prices would have stagnated.
The industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.
Thyssenkrupp did not want to exclude closures of individual works.
In the German steel industry, some 86,000 people were employed at the end of 2015.
In July, German steel producers remain cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders.
At 3.4 million tons, they produced well over six percent less raw steel than in the previous month, as reported by the business association Stahl on Friday.
After a brief increase in May, the quantity produced now dropped for the second month in a row.
Since the beginning of the year, production has been below the previous year's level by two percent.
The association expects an increase in emissions in the coming months, thanks to an improved order situation.
Community, mind, health: singing works well for seniors
Ursel Kipp has accompanied the singing all her life: as a young girl she was in the school choir, in the Magisterium studies she completed the subject music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a senior choir.
"Singing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes.
After a sample, she feels balanced, cheerful and more alive overall, she says.
By the way, she does something good to her health and to her mind.
From several perspectives, singing is a great hobby for seniors, says Erhard Hackler of the Deutsche Seniorenliga.
Most seniors sing in the choir and share the joy of music with like-minded people, says Hackler.
Through regular co-existence, seniors can establish and maintain social contacts.
Because often social and family structures dissolve in old age, a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.
This experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir: "Determining and organizing, relying on the others and learning from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together".
Singing can be exhausting in a positive sense, says Hackler.
Because seniors train a deep and controlled breathing.
Whoever regularly demands his lungs doesn't get out of the pustle so quickly in everyday life.
Even when it comes to maintaining the sound of the voice in old age, singing is an optimal hobby.
On older people, singing often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz of the Federal Labour Association of Senior Organisations.
In the older generations the common singing had a much higher priority, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and in leisure, she explains.
Lenz often observes that singing or listening songs in older people awakens many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.
Through lyrics and especially melodies, even the diseased people of the past are insinuated by long-standing events.
In addition, when singing, a special performance is required for the head, explains Lenz.
At the same time, focusing on your own voice and on a predetermined rhythm and adapting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.
Especially older people who live alone practice not only focusing on themselves.
Another positive aspect is the recognition experienced by singing in the choir, says Hackler.
A enthusiastic audience is a great praise.
The feeling of self-esteem also grows through singing in the choir.
Show myself: If I practice for a long time, I get better and grow beyond myself - strengthen this experience.
So there are good reasons to start singing, so there are enough.
If you want to try a new hobby, don't hesitate - even if you think you have little talent, Lenz advises.
You don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who hears when a sound goes next to it?
Looking for the right offer, seniors have different options, says hackers.
If someone from the circle of acquaintances sings in a senior choir, you can just join.
Many cities also offer overviews of the choirs in the area.
Anyone who wants to sing in an ecclesial choir can contact the church or the church leader directly.
Many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet.
If you don't have access to the Internet, you can ask your family, friends or neighbors for help with your Internet search.
Those who want to sing should definitely join a choir, advises hackers.
Singing does the soul well and has something liberating - this applies to any age.
Cats react more sensitively than cats to the cries of the young
Biologists in Hanover have investigated the effect of calling cat babies on adult animals.
To their surprise, the mauen also did not leave the males cold - however, they always behaved the same way in contrast to the females.
Female cats can detect the excruciation of cat babies at the mites of the little ones.
They react ten percent faster to the sounds of kittens who feel in great distress, as scientists from the University of Veterinary Sciences and the Hannover Medical University (MHH) have found out.
Although hangovers also respond to the calls of kittens - but always the same.
"Obviously, the acoustic differences between the mowing of less and more excruciating young animals are either inconceivable or not of importance to the males," said the biologist Wiebke Konerding of the MHH.
She is the first author of the study to be published on Friday in the journal "BMC Evolutionary Biology".
In a previous investigation, the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the kitty scream differed with the urgency of their need for help.
A total of nine adult cats and eight kittens from the MHH animal husbandry were observed.
On the one hand, they were given a call of little ones who were taken out of the throwbox for three minutes and separated from mother and siblings.
On the other hand, they were confronted with cries of more excited kittens, which were also lifted up.
The researchers consider their results to be meaningful despite the low sample.
"All females, even those who had not yet had their own offspring, responded differently to the cries," said Konerding.
They turned faster to the speaker when the calls of the very excited kittens were played.
This ability may have been inborn or developed with sexual maturity.
"A surprise was that the males even responded," said the biologist.
In the past, scientists have studied the reactions of women and men to baby sounds several times in humans.
Some studies also showed that women responded more sensitively to infants, whether they were mothers or not, the biologist Marina Scheumann reported.
Podolski grabs Supercup with "Gala"
Hakan Sükür is a football legend in Turkey.
In Turkey, an arrest warrant has been issued against former football star Hakan Sükür.
He is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
An important football game takes place in Turkey for the first time after the coup attempt.
Before the duel of the archrivals between Besiktas Istanbul and Lukas Podolski's Galatasaray Istanbul around the Supercup in Konya, the official line is clear: "Business as usual" is announced.
Even when the state of emergency was imposed after the attempt to overthrow in July, the government claimed that the everyday life of normal citizens should not be affected.
But this does not apply to those who are suspected of belonging to the movement of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is being held responsible for the coup attempt.
It does not stop in front of the football.
The prosecutor issued an arrest warrant against the former Starkicker Hakan Sükür.
According to this, the Sükür, now living in America, is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
Sükür is said to be a follower of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is held responsible for the coup attempt by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Although the exceptional condition imposed for 90 days is still valid until October, it actually has no effect on the lives of most Turks.
The nocturnal "democracy guards" in public places throughout the country declared Erdogan to be finished on Wednesday.
The sport - like the whole country - is divided into followers and opponents Erdogans.
Especially fans of the workers' club Besikta are not traditionally friends of the president.
What unites the majority of the Turks, however, in the face of dramatic experiences in history, is the strict rejection of military coups.
Even the fans agree - whether their heart beats for Galatasaray or Besiktas.
==References====External links==* Official website
The Cologneer demonstrated his sporting value in the past season: With 17 goals and nine templates in all competitions, the 31-year-old finished his first season as the top scorer of his club.
In the final match against Fenerbahce, he scored the 1:0 win.
The newspaper "Fanatik" cheered him: "He was the best on the square."
He finished the season in an excellent way and secured his team the cup.
Thanks to "Poldi", the disappointing season for the record champion came to a conciliatory conclusion.
After the first round K.o in the Champions League, the "Löwen" also retired early in the Europa League.
==References====External links==
The season was not good.
The cup was the only way to win something.
"We've done that and that's the most important thing," said Podolski.
For Master Besiktas the year ran better.
Thanks in particular to Mario Gomez, who laid the foundation for the 14th title with 26 seasonal hits as a South-Lig-Torschützenkönig.
This is also the reason why the fans continue to hope for the return of the 31-year-old.
The Gomez, under contract with the AC Florence and loaned to Besiktas only after the coup attempt, had announced that he would not return to the country after his vacation because of the political situation in the country.
"If Mario wants to come to us, he just has to say it," quoted the magazine "Kicker" Club Chief Fikret Orman.
To this end, however, the stormer would have to be willing to waive some one third of his estimated annual salary of 7.5 million euros, Orman said: "We cannot pay his salary at Florence".
Despite Doping: These athletes still have medal opportunities at Olympia in Rio
The 34-year-old Justin Gatlin was already locked twice for dopings (2001 and 2006).
Rio de Janeiro - Whistleblow Julia Stepanowa is not allowed to start in Rio.
Other transmitted athletics-sinders can only laugh at it - they fight for medals in Rio.
The theme Doping still determines the headlines at the Rio Olympic Games.
The Russian swimmer Julija Jefimova, who had been suinging her starting right shortly before the games after a doping lock, was mercilessly pimped and exploited at her start (100 meters breast).
There was a quirky scene: with a smile set up, she was still proud of the hall and had provoked her performance.
When it was established that it would not get gold, the audience broke out into a jubilant storm.
However, there are many more athletes who start despite the doping past at the Rio Olympic Games.
Here is an overview:
Justin Gatlin (100, 200, 4x100m season/USA): The 34-year-old is one of the most controversial figures in athletics.
He was already locked twice because of dopings (2001 and 2006 to 2010).
Since his ban, the 2004 Olympic winner and ex-world champion have been running even faster than before, he is the number one in the world for more than 100 m in 9.80 seconds and is considered the biggest challenger of Usain Bolt.
Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce (100, 4x100 m season/Jamaica): The two-time Olympic winner and seven-time world champion had to hold a six-month barrier in 2010 after the ingestion of oxycodone.
She had severe toothache after surgery, the 29-year-old defended herself.
Sandra Perkovic (Discus/Croatia): In 2011, the Olympic winner of 2012, World Champion of 2013 and European Champion from 2010 to 2016, was tested positively for the banned stimulant drug methyl hexanamin.
Perkovic disputed the knowledgeable intake and was blocked for six months.
The four widest litters this year go to the account of the great gold favorite.
LaShawn Merritt (200, 400, 4x400 m season/USA): The Beijing Olympic champion and two world champions over 400 m, had been tested positively in 2010 and locked for 21 months.
A penis enlargement tool had been responsible, Merritt claimed.
This year, the 30-year-old is the fastest man in the world to date, over 200 and 400 m.
Ivan Tichon (Hammerwerf, Belarus): Probably hardly any athlete was later denied so many medals.
Tichon lost his 2005 World Cup title nine years later after he was diagnosed with Testosterone doping.
The now 40-year-old also had to surrender Olympic silver 2004 due to steroid dopings and the EM title 2006 due to testosterone abuse.
He won the bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games on the basis of a judgment of the International Sports Court CAS.
With 80.04 m he is in second place in the world rankings.
Liu Hong (20 km walk, China): The world recordr and gold favorite was tested positively only in May, but may still start in Rio.
At the 29-year-old world champion, indications of the use of a banned food supplement were found, the blocking of the World Anti-Doping Agency WADA was mild and was already running off on July 13.
Bomb terror in Thailand - Austrian wounded - Several dead
The Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman, said the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Thomas Schnoll, Friday morning.
She had suffered cuts and had been treated in the hospital, but had already been able to leave.
She planned her home trip for early September.
Whether further explosions on the holiday island of Phuket as well as in the southern cities of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon are also affected by Austrian citizens, it is still unclear for the time being.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities, according to Schnoll.
In Hua Hin, located about 200 kilometers south of Bangkok capital, two bombs exploded on Thursday evening in an outing district.
According to police, a Thai woman had been killed and about 20 people injured, including the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.
On Friday morning, two bombardments went up again, and according to the authorities, another person was killed.
Phuket also reported a bomb explosion in the early days.
In the detonation near Patong beach, popular with holidaymakers, a taxi driver was injured after police statements.
In Surat Thani on the south-east coast of the country, another bomb exploded, killing an urban employee.
According to the authorities, the bomb rate had gone into the air in a flower bed in front of the area of the coastal police.
Finally, detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the southwest coast as well as in Chumphon on the southeast coast claimed several injuries.
They're supposed to be connected to the explosions in Hua Hin.
"The bombings carry the same manuscript," said army general Danai Kritmethavee Friday morning in front of journalists.
"We expect this to be a coordinated attack."
It is too early to express themselves on possible motives - but probably it is about the actions of Muslim rebels.
Thai media also wanted to identify a pattern typical of the bomb attacks of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.
The Thai police, on the other hand, declared that the attacks were not related to the Islamic uprising movement or to international terrorism.
"This is only local sabotage that is limited to limited areas and provinces," said a speaker in Bangkok.
Rather, it is assumed that the bombs were laid by opponents of the ruling military junta.
In recent days, the authorities have received intelligence evidence of upcoming attacks in the south of the country - but they have not been informed of the exact date and places.
It is still unclear which group is behind the attacks.
The police instructed their officials across the country to strengthen security around important government buildings as well as airports, railway stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.
In Thailand there are always smaller bombings, but they usually do not target tourists.
In Hua Hin is a palace used for years by Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej.
After the bomb explosions, the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs on its homepage strongly recommends that the instructions of the Thai security authorities be followed.
High safety risk (security level 3) applied to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla, as well as Preah Vihear and the surrounding area.
After conflicts between security forces and Muslim sections of the population, it is not necessary to travel to these provinces.
Increased safety risk (security level 2) applies to the rest of the country.
The attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution prepared by the military junta.
This will also give the military great influence in the coming years.
Junta chief and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs had been an attempt to create chaos while the country was moving towards stability, an improvement in the economic situation and tourism.
The military unta, which had taken power in 2014 after a phase of bloody unrest, has taken advantage of itself to restore the Kingdom to stability and order.
However, even the military has not managed to control the insurrection of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country for years.
In the conflict, more than 6,500 people have already been killed.
About a year ago, 20 people were killed in Bangkok in an attack on a popular Hindu shrine - most of them foreign tourists.
It was the bloodiest attack of the recent history of the country.
The right "Identitarian Movement" has been visited by the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection.
According to several national offices, the federal constitutional guardians have also observed the group.
"At the 'Identitarian Movement', we see evidence points for efforts against the liberal democratic basic order," said Head of Constitutional Protection Hans-Georg Maaßen of the German press agency in Berlin.
Thus, immigrants of Islamic faith or of the Middle East are defamed in an extremist way.
That's why we're watching the movement, too.
The "Identitarian Movement" is a group with French roots, which has also been active in Germany since 2012.
It turns against "multi-kulti-Wahn", "uncontrolled mass immigration" and the "loss of one's own identity through alienation".
Constitutional guardians in nine federal states - Bremen, Bavaria, Hessen, Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, NRW, Lower Saxony, Saxony and Thuringia - are already observing the "idententiaries".
Maaßen said that his authority had agreed closely with the state offices in the decision.
"Groups like the 'Identitarian Movement' are trying to pick up their target group where it stands," said the Head of Constitutional Protection.
In general, extremists try to address them with youth-friendly language, often with pop music.
That would be Islamists as well as right-wing extremists.
That's not a real commercial for your own business.
The propaganda is supposed to appeal to people emotionally.
Young people are particularly vulnerable there.
That's dangerous.
Finally, there were reports from several federal states about contacts between the "identities" and AfD politicians.
Maassen said he had no knowledge of that.
For the protection of the Constitution, possible contacts of this kind are only relevant from a certain point of view.
It is important whether the respective party - in this case the AfD - changes its target direction by certain persons who are extremist, and becomes so extremist.
It is therefore crucial whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party.
This is not recognizable.
In view of the marked increase in legal offences and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee shelters, it said that it would not speak of new right-wing terrorism in this context.
But in recent years, we have found that there can be legal terrorist structures.
There was the group 'Old School Society' or the Vrijtal group.
It may well be that other right-wing terrorist groups or micro-groups are forming, planning attacks against asylum seekers, against refugee homes or attacks from other right-wing extremist motives.
However, a German-wide or pan-European governance of legal terrorism is not recognizable.
The previous groups were created at regional level or in social networks.
Concerned was that many attacks on the account of people who had not appeared in the right scene before.
That is the worrying thing.
Many of the suspects in attacks on asylum shelters had not previously been known as criminals, politically motivated perpetrators or supporters of the right scene.
"Many people have thus committed crimes that previously had nothing to do with right-wing extremists, who may have been politically indifferent, or who have chosen CDU, SPD or Left, but then radicalized themselves by right-wing extremist mood."
Rio 2016: Robel Kiros Habte becomes an Internet hit
Not always do the Olympics or world records determine the headlines at the Olympic Games.
This shows the courageous appearance of Robel Kiros Habte at the Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro.
In the Aquatics Center, the slightly overweight swimmer from Ethiopia swam so slowly that he could not be seen in the TV pictures at times.
He simply disappeared - no matter how far the neckline was selected.
Habte became a viral Internet hit in the social networks.
In fact, the 24-year-old finished his lead with a residue of 48 seconds and finished 59th place of 59 starters.
But it was rather his not exactly sporty figure that attracted the attention of the international media.
Why does the 24-year-old still participate in the Olympic Games?
The Ethiopian was granted a special start right by the International Swimming Association.
This is distributed to make swimming more known in under-represented countries.
Since most athletes run in Ethopia, Habte just wanted to do something else.
Preparation is everything: Robel Kiros Habte is getting ready for the big race.
Quickly the first nicknames made the round.
Some media called him "the ruble of the whale".
The English boulevard "The Sun" made fun of him with "Dad Bod".
His time, he only hit with a minute and nearly five seconds over the 100 meter freestyle, played no role there.
Comparisons with "Eric the Eel" have also been made.
At the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, the course of Eric Moussambani provided media attention.
Unforgettable was the appearance of the swimmer from Equatorial Guinea when he had to perform alone in a run ahead of 100 metres of freestyle.
At the time, Moussambani was fired.
The then 22-year-old learned to swim only eight months before Olympia and had never reached such a long distance before the competition.

Geretsried - The owner of a shop at New Place has been stolen.
According to the police, 67-year-old Geretsrieder had left her business on Monday at 5.30 p.m. and had forgotten to close a window on the ground floor.
When she came back the next morning at 8:15 a.m., about 250 euros had disappeared from the cash register.
Traces of the perpetrator could not be found.
There is also no video surveillance.
Trump doesn't see the imminent election defeat so closely
The Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at an election campaign in Florida.
If the election to the U.S. President does not take place, Donald Trump already has an alternative idea.
He'll go on vacation.
If Donald Trump lost the U.S. presidential elections in November, he wouldn't care less: "Finally, it will either work, or I have a very, very nice, long vacation," said the Republican candidate in a telephone interview with the US TV station CNBC.
If it is not sufficient for him in the end for reasons of political correctness, Trump said that is all right.
He called the U.S. President Barack Obama and the candidate of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, the founder of the terrorist militia Islamic State (IS).
Within his party, more and more resistance was formed.
Post is entering the market in electric transporters
An electric delivery vehicle of the Deutsche Post in action.
The interest of other companies in the company is apparently great.
Post plans to sell their electric car StreetScooter, too.
The Group will soon start trading with the transporter.
The Post Office will also offer its electric transporters from next year on the free car market.
"We want to enter the sale to third parties," said a post speaker on Friday.
The company has been examining for months whether it should sell its self-developed StreetScooter, with which letters and packages are delivered, to other companies as well.
Post-Chairman Jürgen Gerdes had said that there were always demands, for example from craftsmen.
According to information provided by the news magazine "Der Spiegel", the Bonn Group is about to enter the mass production of the vehicles.
In the post-own manufacturing, the company plans the construction of up to 10,000 cars per year and shift.
Gerdes had announced that the Group wanted to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and in the long term considered a complete change to the environmentally friendly vehicles.
"We will take a very, very robust step towards 2020," he said at the end of July.
I can imagine that we're changing the entire fleet.
The StreetScooter has been active on Germany's roads since 2014.
GfK leadership shall act after disappointing business figures
The consumer research company GfK exchanges its boss Matthias Hartmann.
The resignations came suddenly - but not quite surprising.
The difficult situation of the market research company GfK suggested that the chair of CEO Matthias Hartmann is becoming more uncertain the longer the success he has promised.
Turbulences at the head of the Nuremberg market research company GfK: After new disappointing business figures and the resignation of corporate management, the worldwide number five of the industry is facing a new beginning.
GfK CEO wants to leave the company at the end of the year.
The Chairman of the GfK Supervisory Board Arno Mahlert is already leaving the Supervisory Board with effect from 12 September.
The management board already took over the previous board member Gerhard Hausruckinger on 1 September, the company announced.
He should officially take over the function of a "Chairsperson" until a successor was found for Hartmann.
As a reason for the resignations, the company called "different views" on long-term business policy orientation.
Details didn't want to mention a business spokesperson on Friday.
Those who will lead the market research company in the future are still unclear.
In investor circles on Friday, it was said that shareholders were last disappointed by the continuing successes of the restructuring started years ago.
Mr. Hartmann has been at GfK's tip since 2011.
"The fruits of the restructuring are not yet visible after 5 years," it said.
In view of the last bad GfK business figures, each shareholder will at some point become restless.
"If that were the case with BMW, the Quandts would do the same," it said.
After setbacks in the previous quarter, the company could not have stopped its loss journey even in the second quarter of 2016.
At 361.2 million euros, sales were 6.1 percent lower than the comparable quarter of the previous year.
With respect to the first half of the year, sales decreased by 3.4 percent by 721,2 million euros.
Profits in the second quarter have mainly affected the lower value of the company in view of its difficult economic situation.
The company's depreciation of 139 million euros in the Consumer Experience business segment provided the Group with a loss of 148.2 million euros.
In the second quarter of 2015, the GfK generated a consolidated profit of 19.7 million.
Accidents - Bus slips into crooks in trenches: eight injured
In the event of an accident in a coach with 43 senior passengers, eight people were injured on Thursday in Krummhörn (Landkreis Aurich).
Two of the inmates suffered serious injuries, told the police.
The 66-year-old driver of the bus of a travel company from Eisenach, according to her information, had to avoid an accommodating truck, which was partly on the counter-carriage.
The bus came off the road to the right and slipped into a trench, as a spokesman of the Aurich/Wittmund police reported.
"Due to the situation of the bus, people could not leave the bus independently," she said.
The fire brigade freed the inmates.
Six ambulances and an emergency car came to the accident site on the Landesstraße 2.
The unscathed travelers were brought back by a liner bus to the Krummhörner district of Pewsum.
There they should wait for a replacement van from the travel company.
The investigators asked the truck driver and possible witnesses to report to the police.
Fees per cubic metre of wastewater amount to EUR 3,36 for the waste water plant Neudorf/Reuth/Welschenkahl 3.44 instead of EUR 2,10; for Zultenberg/Lindenberg/Lopp (previously EUR 2,26) and for Azendorf EUR 3,64 (previously EUR 2,18).
At the plant in Azendorf, the waste water charge will increase again at the latest if appropriate improvement measures become necessary.
After a surplus calculation, the wastewater price in Azendorf will then be 4.37 euros per cubic metre.
As Mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, the approval of the household by the Landratsamt Kulmbach found that there were undercovers for these wastewater plants.
The Kasendorf market is obliged to operate the plants on a cost-effective basis because of legal basis.
From 1 October 2016, citizens as well as commercial and industrial companies from Welschenkahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to get deeper into the wallet.
Fees are between 48 and 67 percent.
As Managing Director Herbert Schmidt pointed out to the Board, a recalculation of the fees for the waste water plants of the market community was necessary.
In the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over- or under-covers from the previous calculation period should also be compensated.
The serious charges imposed by Schmidt were based on the fact that all three waste water plants are relatively small facilities with a very low waste water attack, which is between 6800 and 12000 cubic metres per year.
For example, due to the low distribution base, expenditure would have a serious impact on the necessary repairs of several thousand euros.
Furthermore, the waste water supply in all three plants was slightly declining.
Furthermore, during the previous calculation period, not least due to their age, a significant amount of remediation and repair expenses had been incurred in all three plants.
The plant in Azendorf is almost 30 years old, the plants for Welschenkahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp almost 20 years old.
Schmidt pointed out that the Azendorf wastewater system had to replace the mechanical ventilation system due to damage.
In the Welschenkahl pump plant, the almost 20-year-old conveyors had to be overtaken from the ground up and at the Lopp pond treatment plant, after nearly 20 years of operation, the first sewage pond had to be dredging, the sewage sludge disposed of and an additional ventilation possibility installed in order to comply with water law requirements in the future.
Schmidt: "These extraordinary expenses came with the continued maintenance and maintenance costs, which should be taken into account accordingly in the new calculation period."
The same applies to electricity costs which were still significantly below the current level during the previous calculation in 2011/2012.
Stone houses made it clear that in the case of the small wastewater attack in the three plants, the costs for the operation and maintenance "striked in full".
Schmidt added that the market community had been spared from large entertainment costs in the waste water plants over the past 20 years.
In the opinion of Steinhäuser, the situation for these plants would remain precarious in the long run, especially since the supply area of the waste water treatment association Friesenbachtal could not be expanded by these plants because they are deficient facilities.
Bulgaria recorded inflation for the first time in 8 months
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1% on a monthly basis in July.
This is the highest value (since June 2012) and the first over zero since October last year when positive 0.2% were recorded.
The annual average inflation of the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) was -0,8 % compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015).
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101.0%, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0%.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) was -0.2 % and annual inflation in July 2016 was -0.2 % compared to July 2015.
In July 2016, a price increase of the following categories of consumer goods was observed compared to the previous month: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%); transport (1.8%); leisure and culture (6.3%); restaurants and hotels (1.2%); various goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell for clothing and shoes (2.2%); furniture, household appliances and routine maintenance (0.5%); health (0.1%).
Prices remained as in the previous month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco; flats, water, electricity, gas and other fuels; communications; and education unchanged.
Snapchat "Anime" effect criticized as Asian cartoon
Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it is insensitive to breeds.
With its filter tool, Snapchat enables around 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in such a way that borders on the absurdity.
You can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be a Roy Lichtenstein painting.
The filters are unmistakable, property distorting tools that generate more than 30 million improved selfies a day.
All missteps come to the public.
Snapchat filters have in the past attracted criticism in which they were accused that the app would promote Blackface or promote white skin as a beauty ideal.
When this week some users proposed a filter that gave them slot eyes, false teeth and bloated cheeks, some critics called it a racist cartoon of Asians - "yellow face".
They wondered if these repeated controversys indicated a major problem that the company has with diversity.
The news and indignation were widely spread on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat announced that it would have disabled the feature.
The company offered an excuse: the filter was intended as a homage to anime characters and not as a cartoon of Asians.
But outsiders who experienced racism reminded the filter of injuring clichés.
Others firmly rejected the anime comparison.
In an e-mail, Grace Sepapani, a Korean-American art student, wrote, whose tweets were widely spread over the photos, that the filter was "injurious and mischievous."
She added that "it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very reprehensible Asian cartoon and the filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not yellow-sighted, but that the yellow face has been pulled into the devaluation extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural stumbling wire.
American culture seems to be involved in an endless struggle for diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all control.
And Snapchats large audience of young people - who are more diverse in race than their older counterparts - could rather expect sensitivity.
If one of Snapchat's filtering creates an image that is offensive to a user, "so it's much more difficult that such things remain unnoticed than they used to be," said 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.
On Thursday, Zhu, who works as a product manager and engineer for medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account, calling on others to do the same.
In an essay for medium and in a telephone interview, she said that she believed that racial controversy reflected a lack of diversity in Snapchat’s recruitment practices.
Zhu criticized the largely white, only male leadership and finished her essay with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
"Either she doesn't have a different representation of people with different skin colors in her workforce, so they can make such decisions," said the Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people with different skin colors who work there but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say something about it."
Others share their opinion, a complaint that Snapchat has largely left unanswered.
The company does not publish any figures on the diversity of its workforce and refers to its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the cultural backgrounds of his employees, but according to one speaker, the company recently recruited a staff manager who focused on under-represented groups and on internal integration efforts.
Zhu told her that she was going to keep her Snapchat account closed and added, "I wonder if they need more users like us to say that this isn't OK."
Military leadership Falsified ISIS intelligence information, determines Congress Committee
Military members of the United States Central Command changed intelligence in order to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than the actual states on the ground, reported a Congress investigation committee in a report on Thursday.
The preliminary report, prepared by a task force of the Republican members of the Armed Forces Committee, the Intelligence Committee and the Wehrbudget Committee, reports of great discontent among Central Command intelligence analysts who reported how superiors changed their assessments of the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.
The Central Command, Cencom in short, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"The news service information, which was typically nodded by high-ranking Centcom commanders, regularly provided a more positive picture of American efforts against terrorism than the actual states on the ground and were consistently more positive than analyses of other intelligence services," a newspaper article quoted the report.
"What happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when poor analyses are presented to our political leaders," noted Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives.
The management errors in the Centcom range to the top of the organization.
The ten-page report shows in detail constant problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces.
Although there is no direct evidence that government leaders under Obama have given instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts were exposed to pressure from their forelaws to draw a more optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic state, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
"During the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, opinions and statements before the Congress were much more positive than they are in line with the facts," the report noted.
For example, a Centcom member publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mossul could begin in April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"After months of investigation, so much is clear." said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congressman from Kansas, in an opinion.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the Central Command's tops changed the intelligence reports to reduce the threat posed by ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans launched the Task Force after they were told that analysts were concerned about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State.
The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings as the investigations continue.
In addition, further investigations of the Centcom reports are underway by the General Inspector of the Ministry of Defence.
Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday, which were consistent with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.
"In 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an excessively limited process for the preparation of intelligence assessments on ISIL and the Iraqi security services," announced the High-Level Democracy in the Committee, member of the Adam B. Schiff House of Representatives, in an opinion.
This process, Mr. Schiff said, "slowed the publication of intelligence reports," damaged the morale among analysts and "gave too little room for dissenting opinions."
But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats indicated that they had not found any evidence of the White House's intervention to the Centcom analysts regarding a certain political opinion.
The preliminary results of the Congress investigations were published on Tuesday by "The Daily Beast".
Last August, the New York Times reported investigations by the Pentagon General Inspector, who had been taken up after Centcom Analyst’s complaints.
Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon press spokesperson, stated in an opinion that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on Congress reports while the investigation of the General Inspector was still underway.
But he also stated that "experts sometimes have quite divergent opinions on the interpretation of complex data, and that intelligence and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence."
The investigations have consequences beyond the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (an allegation made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence).
However, the accusations made last year raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.
The criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State reminds of disputes more than ten years ago when a Centcom Analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a document about how the then government under George W. Bush, contrary to the recommendations of many analysts, provided only a small crew force in Iraq and did not take much time to consider the consequences of the 2003 invasion.
Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the uprising against the current reporting of the Islamic State.
Last year, the team around Mr. Hooker, according to government authorities, noted that, contrary to government statements, air strikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State would not have a significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, since these provisional refineries had put into operation to sell oil on the black market.
However, this finding was not published, the Times reported in September.
Centcom's then commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the legislative because of his overly positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel at the Central Command.
The USA wins fourth match in women's field hockey, a showdown with the UK is about to take place
One day after she had shot three goals during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two goals for the women's American field hockey team in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3-0.
Five goals in two games should actually be a memorable achievement, but Bam (27) said she could not remember having ever done that.
"I have no idea." she said.
I'm not one of those people who keep their gates in mind.
However, she knows this: the Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are equally in their group with the British in the first place, which, after their 2-0 victory against Japan, remain unbeatable.
The United Kingdom and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final game of the first round.
Both teams have already qualified for the quarter finale, the game will decide which of the two will be awarded first and second place within their group from six teams each.
The first place will leave the strong Dutch women a little longer out of the way that the other group leads.
However the game goes out on Saturday, the Americans have triggered a surprising whirl through their success story, four years after they landed in the last of 12 places at the past London Games.
Bam was part of this team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and for the first time at the age of three had a hockey hit in her hands (her two older sisters played sports at Drexel University), at the age of 16, she became a national player in the USA, the youngest in the team's history.
She missed the Olympics in 2008 because she could not qualify for the cadre.
Then came the year 2012, in which everything went wrong for her and her team.
In the following year, Craig Parnham, an Englishman, became a national team coach and thus began to turn things to the better.
"A cultural change, a mental change and a physical change," said Bam.
We didn't have the work allowance in London that we now have.
We've been able to tear the row all the way around.
On Thursday evening Bam opened the Torreigen in the first half of the game with a backhand from the nearby area.
India had gone into the game without winning in the tournament, but the team showed up surprisingly tough and held the score from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands.
She completed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then pulled into the middle and ran the ball into the gate to give the Americans a 2-0 guided tour.
Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter.
The Shutout was the first of the entire tournaments for the goalkeeper of the USA, Jackie Briggs, who had to record a goal in each of the previous games.
She's got a run.
Just like Bam.
"We are in a good position," said Parnham, but how well will depend on the result of the next game on Saturday.
In the middle of the rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen des Trampolins
Wherever you are, no matter how late it is, it's the Olympic Games.
The events in Rio de Janeiro feel constant and inevitable, a fast-paced season run between competition and pursuit.
It is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod, which is directed from the armbrush protector to the swimmer to the triathlete.
You can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor's conversation in the queue in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, who is at the Olympic Games for the first time and is a woman's swarm with dimples, could have been among those well-known names that are sent to Prime Time, built up by sponsors and well-being TV advertising if he were a swimmer, gymnast or even fighter.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is fighting for gold in the Olympic trampoline tournaments.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event.
Further from the center, partly in the shade are the sports that are not generally recognized: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
We will always have the breast-swimming and may it rule for a long time.
But if I could modestly make arguments for my particular darling, then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.
Although trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000 when it made its debut in Sydney, it has been so sparsely perceived over the last 16 years that many of those, I had interviewed, did not know it was an Olympic sport at all.
This could also be regional ignorance.
Although the United States sent athletes to the competition, it has never won a medal in trampoline jumping and had an athlete until 2012 who made it to the final round.
The Chinese and Russians tend to share the prices for men and the Chinese and the Canadians for women.
Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.
The trampoline jumping has a certain outside charm, partly because it sounds more suitable for the unexplained ear for a clowns school than for the Olympic Games.
At this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but just an earthbound enthusiast.
It has humorous potential - the cartoonic tremor of its never-ending impact - as well as the Grazie des Turnen and Diving, the two sports that essentially unite it.
The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, meaning "jumpboard."
Uprising winners jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot up to 30 feet in the air and have a series of falling movements (turning, hedges and saltos) before they land on their feet.
They are assessed according to the official Olympic programme according to execution, difficulty and "airtime".
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women will compete against each other in Rio.
The most common Olympic vector is straight out.
Medal hopeers must continue in their quest for gold, go faster, go up and over, sometimes to the finish, sometimes back and forth, up and down on the playground.
They not only hunt the finish line or the output wall, but also another moaning goal in television transmission: that of the world or the Olympic record.
The goal-oriented pursuit is noble, admirable, even fanatical - and it is enough to even stir a spectator to tears.
But it is also what I feel is a bit tiring when I watch these games.
Of this, the trampoline offers a breathing break.
The vector of the trampoline jumper is above.
A forward movement is not the goal.
He or she crashes, apparently heavy like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly goes up again.
Even here there is a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegantly elegant of time and gravity.
It is as Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games can only be.
The women's qualification and final rounds will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men's on Saturday, also at 13.00.
NBC will broadcast the final rounds as part of an afternoon block on both days from 14.00.
In the middle of the Olympic mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is probably overlooked in the general tumult.
If the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the angaffe and objectification of male athletes - as the male US tournaments suggested recently by The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Dooley is expecting his new fan community, airborne.
"A generation protests" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the USA
Violent Protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrations calling for political change in Ethiopia encountered violent government resistance.
Witnesses say that twenty protesters were killed during the clashes with the police in gunfires.
Is Ethiopia just crashing?
In the last ten years, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy.
But in recent months, protests against the government have shaken the country and spread into more and more areas.
Last week thousands of people stormed on the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.
According to human rights organisations, the government's response was merciless.
Witnesses indicated that police shot and killed some unarmed demonstrators.
Videos in circulation about the protests that are probably from the last or the beginning of this year show how security people beat young people with sticks, while they were forced to make a handstand against a wall.
The head of the UN Human Rights Authority is now calling for an in-depth investigation.
"It has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.
Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa after Nigeria and its stability is estimated by the West.
American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terrorist threats beyond the region, especially in Somalia. Few countries in Africa, if at all, receive so much Western help.
Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable pace.
Its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new shuttle train in the capital Addis Ababa.
The streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
Although Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have constantly led the government to suppress it - the opposition in the country was restricted, with dissidents being effectively silenced.
Many were sent to exile or prison, killed or driven into the vast desert.
But that could change.
"If you suppress people and have no other options except to protest, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopia.
The whole youth protests.
A generation protests.
There are numerous complaints covering everything from land use to stranglehold with regard to the power of the ruling coalition.
After a widely criticised election last year, the governing party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of Parliament.
At the same time, tensions rise along the border with Eritrea; a struggle for this juicy, controversial line took hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogade, which have been more or less defeated in recent years, could exploit the turbulence and rearm themselves.
Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness now explode after years of simmering under the surface.
The first seems harmless: smartphones.
Only in recent years have many Ethiopians been able to communicate through social media, as cheaper smartphones have become more frequent and Internet services have improved.
Even if the government is blocking access to Facebook and Twitter, which it does at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate via Internet proxies that hide where they are staying.
Several young Ethiopians indicated that they were gathering to protests.
The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.
Since Eons, the Amharas, who come from Ethopias mostly Christian highlands, have flourished in politics and economy, exploiting the Oromos, many of which are Muslims and live in flatland areas.
But that's changing right now.
"We are about to coordinate under a umbrella," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of Oromos.
The largest protests took place in areas of the Amhara and Oromos.
Many Amharas and Oromos feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tijez, which make up about 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military, in the secret services, in trade and politics.
The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was the Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until his death from a disease not made public in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could think around corners.
Analysts say that he was particularly decorated in perceiving early signs of dissatisfaction and using Special Representative to handle opponents and make them harmless.
"The current regime lacks this basic skill," said Mr. Abdi, a conflict analyst.
Ethiopia's new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively opaque reasons to take Mr Meles' position.
Unlike Mr Meles, who came from the Tiğ region of northern Ethiopia, Mr Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of security services controlled by the security authorities.
Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such a riot was in 2005, after thousands protested against elections, which according to analysts seem to have been messed up by the government and then stolen.
During the subsequent raids, many protesters were killed, even though they were less than in recent months and this time of unrest went by relatively quickly.
Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuting train, as well as for its measurable progress in combating poverty.
But obviously this has not prevented the intensification of the internal displeasure of the Ethiopian government.
And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protesters attacked in Gondar, an amharic city, shops run by Tiür, and hatred of Tiğ is becoming increasingly common in social media.
Analysts say that the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a strange position.
The American government used Ethiopia as the basis for drone flights across neighboring Somalia, even though it recently announced that it had closed that base.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volatile area.
"This," said Mr. Abdi, "is a very thin path."
Donald Trump explains his claim Obama had founded ISIS was "Sarkasmus"
On Friday, Donald J. Trump tried to scatter the last controversy surrounding his campaign, stating that his repeated claim, President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the Islamic terrorist group, had not been serious.
This clarification raised new questions about the capacity of the Republican Presidency candidate to communicate clearly and comprehensiblely with the American public.
It also brings his fellow competitors, who try to protect him during an eventful phase, into the peculiar position to have to explain statements that he could not have meant at all.
After making the allusion to an election event on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump rowed back on the claim on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he really did not mean that the President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.
But in an early morning tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was just sarcastic.
The Tweet was the contrast to the previous day when Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews that he meant the accusation completely serious.
When conservative radio moderator Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr. Trump weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wanted to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate wanted to know nothing about it.
The last storm of criticism comes down on Mr. Trump while he tried to focus his campaign on the economic situation because of falling polls.
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton gave speeches on the economic situation in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return to this topic.
Reporting on Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he had found her speech boring.
Mr. Trump has already made Sarkasmus his defense.
At the end of July he drew strong criticism when he thought that the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but later he said, "Of course I meant this sarcastic."
This method allows Mr. Trump to shift the linguistic boundaries in politics and then row back as needed.
"I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are received from his fans, how they arrive, and then, if necessary, "clear" depending on how the response is. " said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who observes the language of both candidates.
But I also believe that he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.
Instead of defusing the tone for the presidential elections, Mr Trump has adopted an even more appalling tone, as his polls have continued to decline.
A new survey by NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist, published on Friday, showed a leading lead in the states of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.
While Mr. Trump generally tries not to apologize for his provocative statements, he often accuses his critics of distorting his statements or misinterpreting his humor.
But while he is increasingly in the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr Trump's jokes have brought his loyal associates into the uncomfortable situation of having to stand with him, regardless of how provocative his statements may be.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trump's most prominent advocates, made great efforts to defend the candidates today in a CNN interview of Thursday.
"I think what he says are legitimate, political comments," said Mr. Giuliani, who was asked about the accuracy of Mr. Trump's statements as to whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State.
It is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called them rear-benchers, completely wrong and therefore it happened because he withdrew the troops from Iraq.
Most mainstream republicans try to argue that the government under Obama, in which Mrs. Clinton served as Foreign Minister, allowed ISIS to spread by failing to bring the situation under aggressive control in the Middle East.
Before the elections in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of riding around on each of his words and being biased against him.
He mocked the "poor, pitiful" television experts who tried to understand him and said, "You can't!".
Some of the Democrats ridiculed Mr Trump's excuse as just another proof that he was inappropriate for the presidential office.
Once driven over the price from the market, Café returns to Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a shabby café in Williamsburg, where you could only pay cash that had no Wi-Fi, but served good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, the prices from his Bedford Avenue shopfront were pushed out.
The Soap Cherie business, which replaced Verb in summer 2014, sold soap in the form of cupcakes.
Locals mourned it as the last loss in a emerging city.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know New York is a change, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel is excluded and Verb is now a soap business."
But if New York is a change, it's also a reinventive step.
A revived Verb Cafe opened in Greenpoint last November, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepted credit cards, but still has some of the same employees and a similar simple atmosphere.
The coffee is still good.
The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-standing employee of the old café, which is the owner and managing director of the new café.
He started working at Verb in 2001 and remained there until the end.
When a customer offered to provide money for a new office, he was excited to do it, he said.
Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot.
Verb uses the same distributor for the bagels bought the same espresso machine model.
It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment.
He introduced new ingredients.
On the menu are sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are garnations like capers and sauced onions.
There are natural rice dishes.
The café no longer serves beer, for which there are fresh juices.
After nine months Rodriguez said that he had noticed a constant stream of old regular customers.
"Many old customers were also driven out by prizes from Williamsburg," he said.
Recently, on a Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.
Oliveira, 34, used to live in Williamsburg and visited the verb regularly.
Even after she had moved to Greenpoint, she would take the path.
After the verb closed, she gave up her coffee drink for a while, she said.
"I realized that it was coffee and culture in the verb that I liked," she said.
Now she's drinking coffee again, even if she ordered a Blended Chai Tea on that day instead of her usual Iced Coffee, which is another new addition.
Since the beginning of the verb in 2003, Tom Rosenthal has been another long-standing and faithful customer.
He went there before work and inevitably always ordered the same thing.
"I came four months after seven, every day, like a Swiss pocket watch, and they're preparing my Everything bagel with butter," he said.
Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and include new ingredients in the menu.
Nowadays Rosenthal still gets his usual order, but sometimes he alternates his everything-bagel with bacon, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez said he didn't like the fact that the soap business took over the old business.
In fact, the owners of the Soap Cherie offered a special soap for verb with the cold brewed coffee of the café as an ingredient.
"I think we're going to get on their offer," said Rodriguez.
And the traditional Polish inhabitants of Greenpoint have also accepted the café.
A new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodriguez said he intends to issue it soon so that his new neighbors feel welcome.
The location also has other advantages.
A local juice shop wants to fill and sell the cold-brown coffee in the bottle.
There is a chance that the café will expand to a neighboring building.
For many customers, a new verb is enough to get their old favorites.
Joseph Witt was a regular expert and said that he was destroyed on the ground when the café closed.
When the new café opened, Whitt said that entering the local and ordering a new coffee felt like a return home.
"I had to smell it," he said.
The depressing food of the economic crisis in "a rich meal"
In March 1933, shortly after his rise to the President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office.
As a gourmet, President Roosevelt had a facility for refined delicacy on Fifth Avenue such as Pâte de foie grass and Maryland water turtle soup.
His menu that day was a little more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, potato puree and dessert a plum pudding.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added, "It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat."
The couple live in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.
Coe's last book "Chop Suey" was about Chinese cuisine in the US, while Ziegelman in her book "97 Orchard" tells about living in a home on the Lower East Side from the food perspective.
Her latest collaboration, "A decent meal", which will be published on Tuesday in the Harper publishing house, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They showed culinary solidarity when they met a reporter at the Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, snorkelless snack in the Flatiron District, which has been in the business since the stock exchange crash in 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces, while Coe, 57, ate turkey with potato puree and vegetable mixture.
When the reporter ordered hackbread, the couple found it appropriate for a discussion about eating in the Great Depression era.
"Rich foods were very popular," Ziegelman said.
There was peanut bread, liver cheese and bean bread.
They were prepared from an ingredient and something cheap, stretching the ingredient.
Imagine eating so many peanuts they serve as dinners.

"It must have been in the stomach like lead," he said.
In the years before the Great Depression, the table was an all-you-can-eat buffet in an American household, especially in rural areas.
Women's teams bought for male field workers and freshly baked pasta was served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during World War I. "A Square Meal" records the ways the country used to stop being the country of Schlaraffen.
"It was a time when food became a central, tense topic for the Americans," Coe welcomed why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
The new budget diet was just as tense: mysterious food such as breads and cashrolls became basic food products, the cashroll as a "wonderful way to reuse food remains," noted Ziegelman, as cooks could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce.
Fresh fruit has been replaced by cheaper dry fruit.
Meat, which has been the center of American cuisine for years, has become a rarely served luxury.
Unique mixtures were tried out, as calorie-rich and nutritious satisfaction had priority over taste or even common sense.
During her research for the book, which also includes recipes, Ziegelman prepared a dish from this epoch, baked onions with peanut butter.
"It wasn't a popular addition to lunch," Coe says.
Ziegelmann continues: "It was surreal."
Peanut butter and baked onions do not match each other.
It was typical for many of the domestic recipes.
As never before or since, household operators - including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - were driving the country's eating habits.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "housekeeping politicians" and to meet the challenge of turning pomps like creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals.
"A Square Meal" is a festival of historic treats.
Especially tasty are the reports on the government's response to the hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's Lass-mich-Kuchen-Essen-Haltung.
While publicly praising the simple Iowa farmhouse kitchen of his kitchen, he fed like the million-severe man of the world he became.
"He liked continental cuisine like fish with cucumber sauce," said Coe.
He ate in an almost gold-plated dining room and wore a tuxedo.
He was amazingly non-reality.
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, had not asked him to stand an example with his stomach.
As described in the book, the hire of a housekeeper with no interest in tastes by Ms. Roosevelt led the White House to produce the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most insolently prepared."
Many of the species from the Great Depression era, dealing with food, were rejected as soon as the land got back on its feet.
The legacy lies on our continued focus on calories and food, said Ziegelman, as well as on how science was applied to food.
When writing the book, the couple stated that they had better understood the eating habits of Ziegelman’s mother - in - law mother - in - law, for example, how she could not throw away food.
"She had a real fear of wasting food," said Coe.
Ziegelman remembered, "She actually made people sick."
There was the windbag incident.
After the plates were cleared at Eisenberg's, they and Coe pulled out a dessert that they had prepared at home: the plaumendessert, which President Roosevelt ate at lunch.
"It's called Prune Whip," said Ziegelman, adding that it was a common trick to miss modest recipes a fancy name.
There was no whipped cream, only plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone dived a little reluctantly into the tough, brown slipper.
Amazingly, it did not taste bad.
Coe got a copy three times.
Like a can-do-budgeter, he said to his wife, "A few hacked walnuts would help."
Killed in bomb attack: He was the hero of Aleppo
He put his own life at stake to help others: Khaled Omar.
He was the hero of Aleppo: Khaled Omar dedicated his life to the people of Syria.
He risked anything to save others' lives.
Now the 30-year-old has died even in a Fassbomben attack by the Assad regime.
Omar was a member of the "White Helmets", a civil protection group that, according to picture paper, saved nearly 60,000 people.
2900 volunteers risk their own lives to draw people from bombed homes and to provide first aid in the war area.
They are the heroes of the war in Syria.
Omar was the face of the group: a video of the civil defender showing him in an 11-hour rescue of a infant from the ruins of a house went around the world in 2014.
It made the Syrian a shining symbol in the horror of war.
As a hero, however, he never saw himself, according to the picture, "To me this is the real Jihad."
"When I die saving lives, I think God sees a martyr inside me."
Shortly before Omar himself fell victim to an attack, he had talked in a video about the last bombings in Syria.
The helicopters dropped four barrel bombs above the Alzadia district, one was filled with chlorinated gas.
A woman and two children died, seven people suffer from respiratory distress.
"We're now eliminating the toxic remains of the bomb so that children don't play with it," the picture quotes his last words before he died.
The deadly bomb of the Assad regime was supposed to have hit terrorists.
Greenland shark: The oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old
Rare sight.
Greenland sharks usually come to the surface only in winter.
This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the research ship Sanna.
He was born in 1624 and swims with a good 1 km/h through the North Atlantic - to this day.
Greenland sharks only get young with 150 years.
Occasionally the Greenland shark swims along the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour it reaches an average of just 1,220 meters.
Only when it comes to it, the five-metre-long animal accelerates to a full 2.6 km/h - and is at this maximum speed half as fast as a seal.
This slow-moving lifestyle, however, seems to be a patent recipe for an old age.
Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "Science" at least about a Greenland shark that could be 392 years old.
"Insanity," comments Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock, commenting on this life span, which is a world record for vertebrates.
Although the evolutionary biologist had long suspected that Greenland sharks would become stone-old.
Only the evidence was missing.
Greenland sharks are hard to observe, after all they live mainly in the ice sea off the thinly populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitzbergen.
Because they prefer water temperatures by six degrees Celsius, they usually appear only in winter at the surface.
Researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland sharks.
They measured their slow pace when they equipped six animals with a transmitter in front of Spitzbergen.
These sharks still make prey: In the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jaw bones of a young polar bear.
They may hunt sleeping animals or patrol at the bottom of the ice sea and search for cadavers that pelt down from higher layers of water.
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues have now investigated 28 Greenland sharks that fishermen brought from Greenland or Spitzbergen between 2010 and 2013 as by-catch from the depth of the North Atlantic.
The smallest shark was just 81 centimetres long, while the largest 502 centimetres was measured.
To determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the lens core of the sharks using the carbon-14 method.
This center of the eye lens arises even before the birth of sharks, the proteins contained therein are no longer renewed.
The two smallest sharks had a remarkable amount of carbon-14 in the lens core.
Its birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s when nuclear weapons tests sluggished larger quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.
On the other hand, in the third smallest animal with a length of 220 centimetres, the lens core contained a small surplus of carbon-14 from the nuclear experiments, so it should have celebrated its 50th birthday during its investigation in 2012.
All larger Greenland sharks, on the other hand, had normal carbon-14 volumes in their lens core, resulting from cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.
In fact, for a 493-centimetre Greenland shark, the carbon 14-clock showed an age of 335 years, while the record shark with 502 centimetres may even be 392 years old.
The fact that Greenland shark females only get young when they are longer than four meters was known.
Now the researchers of the length were able to assign an age.
Since one of the animals with 392 centimetres probably stood at the threshold of sexual maturity and its age was determined at 156 years, Greenland sharks with the propagation are obviously at least a century and a half.
This too should be world record for vertebrates.
The fact that such methuses live mainly in icy waters is not a coincidence.
Also the previous record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland whale, in whose bacon at the neck a 120-year-old harpoon tip, was caught in front of Alaska.
Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often runs on sparfire.
So they mature later - and age slower.
In addition, to keep warm in cold water, the animals often become particularly large.
Because the volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal loses heat.
The heat loss of a gram of mouse is therefore much greater than with a gram of elephant.
Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.
"A smaller animal therefore lives more dangerously and should focus on having as many descendants as possible as possible as possible as possible," explains evolution biologist Scheuerlein.
A very large animal, on the other hand, should rather invest its resources in a long life.
Construction floor in a double pack
In the recent meeting, the municipal council focused on issues relating to construction.
With ease, the committee accepted Mayor Robert Putz's communication that "the marketing of the recently designated residential areas can finally begin".
After the land, plotting and development questions have been clarified and the applications for survey have been submitted, the sale of the land in the residential areas "Strasslweg" and "Schönau-West" (Binderstraße - Extension Section 1) to interested parties is no longer in the way.
The municipal council is convinced that the construction sites in the rural and quiet residential community of Schönau appeal to young families and armed seniors alike.
As it was said, construction volunteers can now report to the town hall, and the municipal council is expected to discuss the award of the plots in its September session.
In order to be able to comply with requests for the establishment of other commercial enterprises, linked to job creation, the municipal council decided to amend the land use plan in sub-sectors only in spring of this year.
For example, in the area of sub-timers, the industrial area already designated there is extended by two plots towards State Road 2112.
Frankfurt Benefited From Brexit
In competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg, the city of am Main has the best chances of attracting jobs and companies moved from London.
"It is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Brexit vote," says Michael Voigtländer, Head of the IW's Financial Markets and Property Markets Competence Field.
After the Brexit referendum, it is uncertain whether money houses can continue operating from London from financial transactions across the EU.
The so-called EU passport has so far been approved by them in the UK.
That's what big US banks are using.
Several banks have already announced moving jobs.
The Lobby Association "Frankfurt Main Finance" expects 10000 new jobs on the Main within five years.
For Frankfurt, according to the IW, the headquarters of the European Central Bank (ECB) combines responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the euro area, as well as other important authorities such as the European Insurance Supervisory Authority (EIOPA) and the ESRB Risk Council.
Although the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) is headquartered in Paris, it is less important for the financial sector than the ECB.
"The proximity to the notes bank is important for banks, as they can communicate directly with the supervision," says IW professor Voigtländer.
While Luxembourg is home to a large fund industry, it is also worse to cut off the infrastructure as well as Dublin.
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the large airport.
In addition, the city has easy-to-availability commercial properties.
"In Paris it is not so easy to find free high-quality offices," says Voigtländer.
At the Seine, rents for first-class commercial properties are also 50 percent higher than in the Main.
In addition, Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime.
In a ranking of the company consultancy Mercer, the city ranks seven, Luxembourg ranked 19th, Dublin ranked 33rd and Paris 37th.
Although quality of life is a question of preference: "With its already strong position as a financial location for the European Single Market, Frankfurt could attract other banks and investors," follows the IW.
However, despite Brexit vote, London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe, say the business researchers.
In London, according to figures from the Landesbank Helaba, around 1,400 people worked in the banking industry at the end of 2015, and in Frankfurt, 62500.
Gilead receives legal costs from hepatitis C patent dispute with Merck
A U.S. judge decided that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to reimbursement of the legal costs arising from the Hepatits C dispute with the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was freed from a $200 million compensation for the infringement of two patents by Merck, which were related to the blockbuster drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni of Gilead, after a U.S. judge discovered a pattern of misbehaviour by Merck, including perjury and other unethical acts.
When the action was brought on Thursday, U.S. judge Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead is entitled to a decision on the costs incurred during the defense of the case.
Merck tries to align himself with Gilead, which controls the market of a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other and claimed ownership of laboratory work based on Sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in Gilead’s drugs.
U.S.-supported troops say they have regained full control of Manbij from the Islamic State
Supported by the United States, the full control of the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border has been re-enforced after the last IS fighters in the city have left, said a spokesman of the group on Friday.
The Democratic forces of Syria (DKS) are combing through the city after the exodus of the remaining group of fighters who have buried themselves within the city.
They freed over 2,000 civilians who were held hostage by the fighters, and told Sharfan Darwish of the Manby Military Councillor Reuters, allied with the DKS.
"The city is now under complete control, but we're just doing cleaning," he told Reuters.
Clintons earn 10.75 million in 2015 and pay 34.2% federal taxes
Hillary Clinton has published her 2015 tax return on Friday, which for the presidential candidate of the Democrats and her husband showed an income of USD 10.75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 34.2%.
In 2015, the Clintons donated USD 1 million for charity purposes, mainly to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton generated almost USD 5.3 million in redundancies; former Foreign Minister gave an income of USD 3 million from the Simon & Schuster publishing house for her book on her term of office in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Clinton's candidate for vice-president, Senator Tim Kaine from Virginia, together with his wife Anne Holton, has published his tax statements for the last ten years.
They paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3% in 2015.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set standards on financial transparency," said Clinton's campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri in an opinion.
In a stark contrast to this, Donald Trump is hiding behind false excuses and withdrawals regarding his previous promises to publish his tax statements.
It is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax statements, although they are not obliged by law to do so.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have indicated a tax audit by the tax authorities as a reason for his refusal.
"You are on the train," wrote Clinton's campaign assistant, Ian Sams, on Twitter, regarding the publication of the presidential candidate of the Democrats.
On Thursday, Michael Cohen, Trump's Special Advisor, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish something until the tax checks were completed.
Trump's critics, including the Republican presidential candidate of 2012 Mitt Romney, have already made it clear that his refusal raises issues regarding assets, his donations for charities, his business gestures and various other links, in particular with Russia.
Clinton has already crashed on the subject and on Friday released a video on the Internet in which high-ranking Republican Trump asks to publish his tax statement.
On Thursday she also addressed the subject during a speech on the economy in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what every other presidential candidate has done in the last decades and to publish his tax statements." she said to the crowd.
Politico has reported that Trump paid no or very little tax during the 1990s, and a New York Times business journalist quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax advisers on Friday, stating that this could still be the case.
Federal taxes have become a topic in the election campaign.
Clinton supports a scheme named after the billionaire and investor Warren Buffett, which would ensure that people who earn more than USD 1 million will pay a tax rate of at least 30%.
President Obama also supports the proposal.
During an election campaign for Hillary Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway industrial conglomerate is based here, demanded Trump to exchange their tax statements.
Buffett said that he had also been subject to an IRS tax check and Trump had "fear" before the voters and not before the tax authorities.
Clinton's campaign has published tax return until 2007.
The Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average effective federal tax rate of approximately 32% between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 40.5%.
The 2015 Clintons tax return showed that it only earned USD 100 of its income as a wage, unlike most of all Americans.
Its main investment was a cost-effective index fund from which Clinton's dividends and revenues of USD 109,000 were taxed.

condoms with chili powder, fireworks promote Tanzania's elephant protection
Nature conservationists in Tanzania use an unorthodox way to prevent elephants from going into man-inhabited settlements - they throw condoms on them filled with chili powder.
The method has proved effective and the Honeyguide Foundation, which already had the idea years ago, has intensified its promotion along with the US nature protection by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania, using a non-violent four-step method to protect their homes and harvest without hurting animals.
Previously, many spears have used to defend themselves.
Friday is the World Elephant Day dedicated to animal welfare.
"Since we have developed the toolkit, we have been able to observe a change of attitude within these communities, and they are much more confident that they can keep elephants from their fields without harming the elephants," said Honeyguide Damian Bell's Managing Director in a communication.
The first two steps include lighting the elephant with a torch and blowing into a horn.
If it is not deterred, a so-called "chili cloud" is thrown.
Chili powder mixed with earth is packed together with a fireworks body into a condom, the end of which is turned to the ignition line.
When it is lit, the condom bursts up with a bang and sprays fine dust on chili powder into the air.
A touch quite quite quite already out to chase away the elephant.
One last possibility is a thrower who shoots a gold rain fireworks into the air, causing a loud, bright explosion.
City council decides unanimously: No kiosk new building at St. Goarer Rheinufer
Usually, the St. Goarer investment projects of commercial operators accept with kiss hand - especially the retail sector in the heart of the city is regarded as clearly expandable.
However, the city council unanimously rejected the request for a new sale ski on the Rhine bank in the immediate vicinity of the Rhine Balcony under construction.
"In principle, we welcome new commercial operators, but this kiosk does not fit at this location in an exposed location on the banks of the Rhine," said Michael Hubrath for the CDU Group.
Jewish director beats Berlin's hotel because Israeli pre-election for "Arab" invitation was removed - RT News
A French director with Jewish roots unraveled a media uproar after he revealed that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not list any Israeli pre-elections, as it would have "demanded" Arab guests according to an employee.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentation "Shoah" released his anger at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his last stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the hotel's country dial list.
However, the country was not listed between the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, that Israel was eliminated and deleted?
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead, Kempinksi Bristol offers an opportunity to choose Israel via its own call center.
Looking for an explanation, the director turned to the hotel reception.
The answer he received there "shocked him", as Lanzmann wrote.
The hotel worker said that the measure was "an intentional decision of the management of Kempinski hotels."
The reason behind it caused even more anger in the director.
"Most of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the dial-up be deleted," Lanzmann's employee was quoted.
The Israeli ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called this a "great shame," reports the Süddeutsche Zeitung.
We were appalled and appalled by this event.
That's really very embarrassing.
The fact that this happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is an even greater shame.
That doesn't need any explanation.
We expect the hotel to "draw the right conclusions," said the official.
The incident triggered a rather large response on the Internet, in which people called the whole thing a scandal.
Some suggested to the Kempinski Hotel that it would have given in to the alleged calls of Arab guests.
"Sorry," said another article, pointing out that the hotel, located on the noble Kurfürstendamm, is close to a synagogue.
The hotel quickly rejected all charges and called the incident an "accident" and "apologized" with Lanzmann, reports Der Spiegel.
"There was never a direct instruction to not include Israel in the Quick Election List," the Süddeutsche Zeitung quoted a speaker of the Kempinski Hotel.
It adds that the country selection has now been added.
Police use tear gas & rubber shots against protesting Brazilian students
On Thursday, students met the police in the Brazilian city of São Paulo when they gathered together to demonstrate the government's reforms for the public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber shots against the demonstrators.
The difficulties began when police officers tried to drive the students apart, leading the police to use rubber shots and tear gas.
Several hundred students participated in the demonstrations to express their dismay at the plans.
According to the proposals of the governor of the state of São Paulo Gerald Alckmin, just under 100 public schools are closed, while 300,000 students are being implemented to save money.
Some of the protestants were seen spraying graffiti against provisional President Michel Temer on walls.
The recent protests took place a few days after demonstrators went to the streets in order to support the suspended President Dilma Rousseff, who had been expelled from office by a vote of the Senate for their withdrawal.
Trade between Russia and Iran is rising suddenly to 71% - RT Business
With the lifting of sanctions, according to the Russian Ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, the trade turnover between Moscow and Tehran grew by 70.9% annually.
Since the international sanctions against Iran were lifted, Russian companies’ interest in business in the country grew strongly, the Ambassador said.
Russian companies are taking on existing links with Iran, while new companies are ready to access the market.
Of course, further trade expansion is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," said Dzhagaryan.
He noted that trade sales between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9% in the first five months of 2016 compared to period in 2015 and amounted to $ 856 million.
In particular, Russian imports into Iran increased by 91.5 percent and amounted to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $158 million.
The trade upturn was achieved by supplies of machines, land vehicles and weapons," said the ambassador.
Dzhagaryan expects a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia for this year.
Last year, the Russian foreign representation spent around 35,000 visas, primarily travel visas, on Iranian citizens.
Iran also reached the top 20 of the countries with regard to the number of tourists in Russia.
One could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia from last year, were broken," he said.
At the same time, only relatively few Russians visit Iran, something the ambassador hopes will change.
"I personally can recommend the visit of the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, the monuments of the old Persian civilization have received in good condition," he said.
Witnesses looked for: Drinks market in Waldbröl attacked
A robbery took place on Thursday evening on the beverage market of Rewe XXL at the Waldbröler Gerberstraße.
Under the control of a gun of fire, three darkly dressed people who had disguised their faces demanded the employee of the beverage market to issue cash and then fled first on foot and then probably with a silver-colored VW golf.
The police are not telling how much money has been exploited.
The perpetrators are said to have been between 1.60 and 1.70 meters tall, that is, relatively small.
The beverage market is directly accessible from the park deck of the Rewe market and is poorly accessible.
After the robbery, the perpetrators must have run towards Gerberstraße, Friedrich-Engelbert-Weg and fled from the gravel parking lot in front of the car park entrance with the silver car, possibly towards B 256 (Schladernring).
Those who have made observations at the time of action (about 7.45 p.m.) that are related to the robbery are to report to the police urgently.
Nagold: Game and fun at summer leisure
Eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and young people of the social pedagogical group/social group work of the Nagold Children's Protection Federation with their caregivers at their summer leisure in Nussdorf, near Mühlacker.
In the quiet leisure home Hardtwäldle, the life-loving group was quartered during the first week of school holidays.
Several full-day trips were on the program.
On the one hand, we went to Bretten with the visit of the petting zoo.
On the other hand, to Maulfronn, where there was a special children's tour in the world-famous monastery.
The third trip led to Pforzheim.
In the Celtenmuseum in Hochdorf, the group learned a lot about everyday life and the food of the Celts.
On the hot days, the group enjoyed at the low lake in Maulfronn, which invited you to jump, swim and plank.
Culinary children and caregivers were spoiled with their self-prepared body foods such as the acids Spätzle, the Seebronner Pfännle, Iselshauser-Bloff, the English Breakfast and Tübingen Bolognese.
Workshops have been made to make beautiful gems made of pearls and stones or a Roman mill game made of wood.
Other highlights of leisure were fishing in a nearby pond, the evenings by fire and the closing "Colorful evening".
On the day of the trip home, the sun laughed and the children and young people returned home satisfied.
Haigerloch: Pilgrimages to the gate of mercy
The ministrants from Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were on the way on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to to Freiburg.
Four stages were managed together.
In order to bridge the time to the next Rome pilgrimage of all ministrants in an expected two years, the St. Anna administration round has decided to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrimage.
A number of pilgrimage goals were examined and a final decision was made for the bishop city of Freiburg, where this year a special pilgrimage destination was offered on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy with the open gate of mercy at Freiburg Münster.
16 minis from Bittelbronn, Gruol, Haigerloch and Heiligenkammeren were on their way.
On the evening before, Father Storost sent out the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrim crosses and granted the pilgrims' segen.
From Horb to Villingen was driven by train, where there is also a Münster of Our Lady and so the pilgrimage from Münster was taken.
The individual day tours were surrounded by a short impulse with various prayers, songs and scriptures in the morning and evening.
But also on the go, the minis at field crosses, chapels or churches always rested again and again to sing a song from their own composition of pilgrim song.
The parish homes of the local parish were available for the nights.
At the stages, Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller provided a tasty as well as strengthening dinner and breakfast.
On the second day it went over Furtwangen to Gütenbach.
The next day, the stage was taken to St. Peter, which was the most strenuous roadway, but had to initially descend about 500 metres above sea level and then climb again.
The deserved reward was a shared barbecue at the bathroom.
After the morning impulse on the fourth pilgrim day in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter, it went on the final stage to Freiburg.
Visiblely facilitated and happy, the minis arrived at the Freiburg Münster in the afternoon and went through the gate of mercy.
With a small impulse, God was thanked here.
In the evening fair in Münster, the minis arrived at the pilgrimage destination were welcomed by co-operator Markus Obert.
After the service, the pilgrims were able to visit the sacristy and the high altar.
The next day was still time for the Breisgaumetropole.
In the afternoon, it went back to Horb by train.
Finally, all participants agreed that the days were marked by spirituality and a strong community experience.
Shot Callum Skinner storms home when British gold for cycling hits
Scotland's Callum Skinner rested last night in the men's team sprint in the Velodrom in Rio to glory when the British team defended the title of London 2012.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor role that his countryman Sir Chris Hoy had made his own. The boy's coin made the legend proud when he stormed home to get a victory from New Zealand's favourites.
England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic gold medals.
They repeated the trick after they won only a modest sixth place in the March World Railway Championships in London despite Hoy's resignation.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.
They did this in good time as a hindrance.
Hoy's retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.
Skinner was the man they stayed with when they saw potential in the bulkhead that has now unfolded.
Hindes, Kenny - who won with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner set an Olympic record in the qualification rounds, but in the standard rounds the New Zealanders won in the first round.
And the British trio won the duel with gold.
Hindes was just back after his round, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it.
A change of strategy made up a large part of the transformation in which hinds went in a higher gear to slow him down and enable Kenny and, above all, Skinner to keep the pace.
Hoy watched from his position as a BBC expert and noticed Skinner, Kenny and Hindes as they rose to the pedestal.
The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said, "It's a flattering comparison."
I'm just here to do my best and make a name for myself.
We set an Olympic record in the final round and defeated the world champion.
It was just incredible.
There is no better way to win this.
After the 2012 triumph on the side of Kennys and Hoys, Hindes admitted that after a weak start, he deliberately fell on the track.
He withdrew this statement later and there was no opposition from England's rivals.
In such an outstanding victory, there was no such problem this time.
Hindes said, "It feels like London with all the GB flags on the stand."
We have met as a team in the last three months.
We got away so bad with so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics.
This is an event, a gold medal for the nation that won seven out of 10 titles in both Beijing and London.
If this is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, we expect successful five days in the Velodrome.
With the form Kennys it is in the field of possible that he repeats Hoy's victory of three Olympic gold medals in one competition.
This would mean for Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on 23 March (a seemingly sacred date for British sports; on that day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were also born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.
That would be Hoy's.
Kenny will participate next in the sprint, which starts today and will go over three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said, "I only enjoy this for the moment."
The team event is always best.
You can win it with your colleagues.
It feels a bit lonely to win alone.
Hindes said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to knight."
It was the only medal contest of the day, but there were other good news for England.
Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-kilometre race.
They arrived at the finish in 3:51,942.
The world record, which won gold in London in 2012, was 3:51,659.
The first and final round (22.42) will take place today on the second day of the beaver, in which Wiggins will certainly be in the focus.
He had disputed with officials before the qualification yesterday when officials called him to measure his height.
In the corresponding women's competition, which continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie advanced in world record time in 4:13,260.
The GB team relies on its strong train bike team to dominate the mid-term of the Olympic Games and get a crowd of medals.
After a truly extraordinary representation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were dropped.
It took place in the background, according to the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April in the midst of sexism and bullying accusations as well as the retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, if you look at the first evening of the competition in Velodrome, it looks like the now legendary reputation of GBs, which reached its peak at the perfect moment, could be repeated again.
The future of Portland's meltdown due to the abolition of the energy contract is questionable
The future of Portland's aluminium melting in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs of workers - is at stake, as the operator will terminate the energy supply contract and thus cancel all supply contracts, as announced by the supplying energy company.
This step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year not to grant any further subsidies for the operation of the plant.
A subsidy set for 20 years expires in November.
Up to 2000 jobs in the Alcoa plant in Portland are at stake.
No fewer than 2000 jobs - both direct and indirect - could be at risk in the event of closure.
In addition, domino effects could occur as the melting plant consumes about 10 percent of Victoria's total electricity generation.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry Melterei, which led to the closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
The melting of Alcoa in Portland loses money and risks closing down.
This step follows years of speculation regarding the future of the plant, originally due to the strong Australian dollar and lastly due to the electricity price for the plant.
AGL, which supplies the large aluminium fusion plant with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that it is expected that three further owners will terminate their contracts.
The plant is owned by the majority of Alcoa and Alumina joint ventures, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares.
"AGL assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Portland, which means further physical demand for electricity from the melting plant," the company said.
AGL continued to state that the contracts were so-called "security transactions", which should have entered into force from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period, so that they will end in 2017.
"From this point of view, AGL assumes that the contracts will contribute to the revenue in the financial year 17," said the electricity supplier.
All potential impact on revenue on AGL from the CJ18 is currently limited by the forecasts of the strong future markets for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL announced that it had already written off the value of the contracts in its annual conclusion of $187 million in "awaiting a termination".
Alcoa said that the decision to pay off the contracts, the "ability of Alcoas to operate the melting shop or to ensure the power supply to the melting shop" was not detrimental.
The US company said that in 2010 it concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, which should have entered into force from November this year, even if it still owes it a declaration of why it resigned from the contract.
Analysts warn against the possible closure of the Portland meltery in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle because of the poor economic conditions of the industry.
Regarding the statements of the analysts at the beginning of the week, the Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland consumes around 600 megawatts and Tomago around 900 megawatts of electricity each year.
Should both plants disappear from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the [power market].
And that wouldn't be good for us as a power generator," he said.
More than just a Kardashian reality TV star, Kendall is on the cover of the September issue of the Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of Kardashian-Jenner Clans Kris is on the cover of the coveted September issue of the US Vogue.
Kendall, the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder and running on the Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on their Instagram account on Thursday.
"In a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover made me cry," Kendall wrote.
The revelation of the cover followed a bizarre (or simply Keeping Up with the Kardashians similar?), scripted reality video showing the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (with the exception of the problems Rob and Caitlyn as well as in the presence of the most popular showbiz uncle and producers of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest), how they forgot the cover of their sister and ended with a classic turn: they all planned a surprise party.
This represents the cliché-based act almost every birthday episode of a children's show (Seacrest brought the sentence, "You thought we had forgotten you?," with the honesty of a cartoon rabbit on a radio station at 8 a.m.), but Kris had to let her other girls participate in this publicity somehow.
With regard to the September issue of the Vogue, a new era of the Kardashians has certainly begun.
Kendall's big sister Kim likes to have beaten her as far as the Vogue cover is concerned (she and her husband Kanye West were on display in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for themselves.
The September issue is the most sold edition of the year for Vogue.
With an extent that is more similar to an image book than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a large number of advertisers (according to Fashionista, of the 832 pages of the 615 pages of advertising).
The revelation of his cover star is so eagerly expected that in the last two years, images of the magazine have been sipping before the official announcement.
Women already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have been clearly more "presences, the models" than "models that are famous" on the cover.
Oscar winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga had the honour.
But even in the low chance that Mrs. Jenner - described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" of her generation - falls under the earlier category, she is in good company.
These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or young people of today who know how to shoot a good snapchat video (even if it all applies to Jenner).
They are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry.
Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lemonade.
Of course, Jenner's success doesn't please everyone.
With its reality TV story, Jenner's position in the fashion world was always a bit tense.
In June, the former Victoria's secret model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticized her and called her "the bitches of the moment."
These feelings got high again when the news came out with the appearance of Jenner on the Vogue cover.
But riding around on the malaise seems to pass the point.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of the Vogue.
In the truest sense of the word, it is a supermodel.
She's running for Marc Jacobs.
She's advertising for your primer of Estee Lauder.
She and all her sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their respective paywall apps.
She sells pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter to the magazine LOVE.
And in her free time, she can be seen on reality TV, probably just to see her sister Kourtney and her children.
Municipal law centres reject 160,000 people every year
More than 160,000 of the country's most needy persons are rejected annually by the municipal law centres, while the industry focuses on the impact of further cuts on already overburdened transactions.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly older people, immigrants, needy workers, victims of violence and those who have no means for unjust delogging and similar - are rejected when applying for free legal advice and legal assistance.
Legal services of the municipality, which have already been overly used, are ready for further reductions.
As of June next year, it is planned that these legal centres will lose another 30 percent of their federal funds.
The director of the Queen's Community Law Centres James Farrell said that the last survey of the National Association of Municipal Law Centres revealed that thousands of people are already rejected each year.
Farrell said that the situation would only get worse without the Federal Government's decision being repealed.
"Queensland's municipal law centers are chronically underfinanced, meaning that thousands of people of important services you need are rejected," he said.
People who leave violent relationships, people with incomprehensible and oppressive debts, families who go through separations, workers who have been unjustly released - all these people have problems of a legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot get the help they need.
As of June 2017, the Federal Government will cut the funds by 30 percent, which means that thousands of more needy people from Queensland will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help.
We call on the Federal State Attorney-General and the Federal Minister of Justice as well as the Senators of Queensland George Brandis to abolish these cuts immediately so that people can get the help they need from legal problems.
Last year, the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise legal aid to the national average.
It is now time to look at the needs of municipal law centres and their customer communities and that the Palaszczuk government invests in this important work.
Donald Trump campaign charged after employees reportedly drew gun
New York: Donald Trump's campaign was charged with alleged inactivity after you were told that their campaign leader for North Carolina had a gun to shoot at an employee in February while they were on their way in a jeep in February.
The incident is described in an indictment filed by Vincent Bordini on Wednesday in Charlotte's State Court, a former software programmer for the campaign in that state.
Bordini stated that for months he had waited for the matter to be settled internally before he realized that "this would not happen."
The campaign manager, Earl Philip," drew a gun, put his right index finger on the trigger, and rammed the run in Vincent's knikehle," Bordini charged in his charge.
After complaining at the local and regional campaign management, Bordini found that at least four others had already had the same experience with Phillip, he stated in the indictment.
"Weapons don't need to be fired to cause damage," said Bordini.
The charge comes only two days after the Republican presidential candidate triggered a riot when he told a crowd in North Carolina that the "Second Amendment People" - gun owners and weapon friends - should take action if his rival Hillary Clinton were elected and appointed judges.
Trump's campaign made it clear that the media had torn his words out of the context and that he would not incite to violence.
Bordini's complaint requires compensation from the campaign for the breach of due diligence and Philip for injury to the body and permanent emotional damage.
Trump's press spokesperson Hope Hicks could not be reached for an opinion.
Attempts to contact Philip also failed.
WCCB, a local news station in Charlotte, reports that Phillip is no longer a campaign employee.
He did not respond to calls from his consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services.
The Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has so far led a controversial campaign.
The trial is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, Supreme Court, County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Berlin/Schwerin: Survey before country elections: to lose SPD and CDU
In the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (4 September) and Berlin (18 September), significant losses are recorded for the government parties SPD and CDU.
This resulted in representative surveys of the opinion research institute INSA for the "image" newspaper (Friday).
While the red-black government coalition in the north could rule slightly further, this is not possible according to the survey values in Berlin.
In both federal states, however, the SPD would be the strongest party and would have good chances of continuing to represent the head of government.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the SPD crashed from 35.6% five years ago to 24 percent.
According to the survey, the party is only just ahead of the CDU, which could return to 23 percent.
The third place is disputed between the left and the AfD.
The left would be 19 percent (previously 18.4 percent), the AfD would be represented for the first time in the country day with 19 percent.
Despite slight losses, the Greens are returning to Schwerin Landtag with 6 percent (previously 8.7%).
NPD and FDP would not be represented in the state with 3 percent each.
According to the survey, the SPD would only reach 23 percent (2011 election: 28.3 percent).
The CDU reached only 18 percent after 23.4 percent.
It is therefore still behind the green with 19 percent (2011: 17.6 percent), but in front of the left with 15 percent (previously 11.7%).
The AfD would be represented in the House of Representatives for the first time with 14 percent.
With 5 percent, the FDP could hope for a return, but the pirates would miss the move as opposed to 2011.
Nokia 9000 Communicator: The first smartphone
E-mail and Internet in slow motion: 20 years ago, the Nokia Communicator came on the market.
The successors dominate the world today - its manufacturer experienced a disaster.
The device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.
It was thicker and bigger, so it was not well in the hand either.
On the contrary, it was pretty clumsy.
The built-in memory was initially eight megabytes, which would today be sufficient for about two high-resolution selfies.
An iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gigabytes.
The "Nokia 9000 Communicator" came into business exactly 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996 - and it was the first smartphone.
For a few euros, lovers can still buy the devices on the Internet, but they somehow come from the stone age of the Internet age.
20 years ago, however, the communicator was a sensation.
The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the computer trade fair Cebit in Hanover as "office in Western pocket format".
In fact, the new mobile phone could be sent and received a lot for then standards: SMS and emails could be sent and received, also by fax the communicator was reached.
Even the access to websites was possible via HTML browser, although torturingly slow.
A calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.
There was a small antenna, and the mobile phone could be folded up like a laptop.
Then there was a small keyboard and a black and white screen.
Pretty proud was the price: 2700 D-Mark, i.e. about 1400 Euro.
The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015.
No one could suspect in August 1996 that the communicator would become the beginning of the smartphone era.
Since then, everything is different.
The smart phones are a success story, although not for Nokia.
The Finnish cell phone division experienced an unprecedented disaster, was finally sold and handled to Microsoft.
Today, the market is dominated by suppliers, all of whom came much later than Nokia.
Being online all over the world, it's everyday for a lot of people today.
In 2015, there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide.
About 1.4 billion devices were sold, and Samsung and Apple alone account for 555 million pieces.
Worldwide sales with the devices amount to around 400 billion euros.
In addition, the well-established business of the countless app providers and of the telecommunications companies comes.
A whole industry has now been established around the smartphone.
The decisive breakthrough to the mass market came only in early 2007, when Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the iPhone on the Mac World.
He promised three devices in one: a music player, a telephone and an Internet communicator, everything via touch screen easy to operate.
Apple's victory move began, and today the iPhone is the Group's most important product.
Nokia, Motorola, and Blackberry, who dominated the market, had the checkup.
They finally disappeared, Blackberry has to fight.
The legend now has Apple and Asian providers like Samsung.
The smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after its invention.
On average today, every German looks at his cell phone 88 times a day.
"We all have to learn to put the smartphone away sometime," Janina Kull said, in charge of personnel on the Siemens Board of Directors.
Permanent accessibility is now regarded as curse and blessing at the same time.
England must guide the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London, but throughout the country.
For me, this was the biggest attraction in Heathrow, just like in 2012 in London, when we made a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games.
The Olympics brought great benefits to Stratford and the East End.
And this will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for locals and companies near Heathrow.
For our local communities alone, we will already create 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment.
As they were before us in London 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of enlargement is too great.
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be blaming on the world stage.
The Dwarfers were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong with Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcoming, but Heathrow answers every question asked him.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for many and not for individuals.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, $211 billion in scientific growth and to leave a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across the UK.
We have a great team in Heathrow, which has implemented a £11 billion high-cost infrastructure investment program in time and budget, from the T5 - which has been elected the world's best airport terminal for five years in a row, to the T2, which was built in the middle of the world's two most frequent runways.
Now they are ready to deliver a third runway, which is supported by £16 billion in private investment.
The 2012 London Games were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of Heathrow will also be one.
It is time for us to direct this Olympic spirit and extend Heathrow, as well as secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is chairman of the Heathrow Board and former Commercial Secretary to the Treasury

According to one of the software manufacturers, for companies that make money with online advertising, attempts to bypass advertising blockage are the same as a "cat and mouse game".
On Thursday, only two days after Facebook announced that it would block advertising on its desktop, Adblock Plus published a blog post in which it announced that users could update their filters in the program to re-block advertising on the social network.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that its desktop page would change the coding with regard to its advertising ads to make it difficult to recognize advertising blocks about which part of the site is advertising.
But Adblock announced that it has found a new way to bypass the new codes.
In a blog post, Adblock Ben Williams spokesperson wrote that "this kind of back-and- forth fight between the advertising-blocking open source community and the around is already underway since the invention of ad blockers," and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come up with a new solution.
The fact that the world's largest company has joined the struggle for social media is a strong indicator of how worrying indicators have become for the industry.
Worldwide, according to a study conducted last year by Pagefair and Adobe, around 200 million people use advertising blockers; nearly four times as much 2013.
With 1.03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook via their mobile devices, mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of the advertising revenue Facebooks.
The company excepted on ad blockers on desktop PCs, as mobile ad blockers have no effect on Facebook's mobile app for the social network and Instagram, a speaker said.
Advertising on desktop PCs represents a sufficient proportion of revenue, so that Facebook appears to be worth the investment of such a step.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that it would update his "advertising tool" to give people more control over their targeted advertising.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblock's new filters would be worrying because they would also block content on the page that is not advertising.
"For the users this is not a positive experience, so we plan to address the problem," said a speaker from Facebook in an e-mail message.
Ad blockers are a dull tool, which is why we have instead focused on developer tools such as Ad Preferences to put more control in people's hands.
In the event of suspected suicide, cross over on the Swiss motorway
The victim was on the highway in the middle of the night.
The police call witnesses after a woman was crossed on a highway during a suspected suicide in the early morning hours of Thursday by several vehicles.
The incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight.
A woman lay down in the dark "in an act of despair" on the street and was met by several cars, the police in Vaud explained.
It is obvious that a Swiss woman at the age of 49 who was overrun by several vehicles, including a truck, wanted to kill herself.
She died on site.
Several drivers have already been heard, but some have still not been identified, said the police who are asking them and each witness of the incident to report.
An investigation has been opened, which is a "logical" step in such a situation, and Gilles Hofstetter told the Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it remains to be seen if one of the drivers will be displayed.
Was a collision avoidable?
That's something the prosecutor has to decide," said Hofstetter.
Two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers are not responsible.
In each of the two cases - where a person was running in the dark on the highway - it was decided that the drivers should not assume that a pedestrian is walking on the highway in the middle of the night, as it was said in the newspaper.
Last year, a police officer was acquitted of the negligent killing after crossing and killing a man who was on the A1 one night in August 2014 near Payerne.
The 22-year-old victim had drunk and has become unconscious on the street, the court heard.
The court found that the policeman -- who had responded to an emergency call -- was driving in a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a "perfect extraordinary and unpredictable situation", said the judge.
Anyone who has more information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should report to the police under the number 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA Climate Model: Venus was once habitable
According to the projections of a new NASA climate model, Venus was probably once habitable.
Scientists at the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms similar to those of climate researchers.
The model was designed to determine whether the Venus could have had Earth-like conditions with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-tight atmosphere.
Scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin, earthlike atmosphere and was still slowly turning.
The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.
The planet probably had more dry areas than the earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to accommodate life and protect it from rapid evaporation.
The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matter.
"In the GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of Venus exposes its day-to-day side of the sun for almost two months," said GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.
This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like a umbrella to shield the surface from much of the sun's heat.
The result is average temperatures that are a few degrees cooler than those of the Earth today.
The model produced a history of Venus similar to evolution previously suspected by planetary researchers.
Although it was once probably habitable, Venus -- over the course of several billion years -- was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.
Their oceans evaporated and their water vapor was burned away from the ultraviolet light.
When their hydrogen escaped, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect remained -- the Venus we know today.

Patrick Roy resigns as coach of the Avalanche
Patrick Roy resigned as a coach and Vice President of Hockey Operations at Colorado Avalanche on Thursday, leading to too little co-determination in the decision-making process of the team.
Alternative President/General Manager of Colorado Joe Sakic confirmed this decision and noted that the club will immediately look for a new coach.
"In the last three years, I have fulfilled my duties as Chief Trainer and Vice President Of Hockey Operations of Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination," said 50-year-old Roy in a statement.
I've been thinking long and a lot about how I could improve this team in order to give it more depth, it needs it and bring it to a higher level.
To achieve this, the trainer's vision and vice president of hockey operations must be perfectly aligned with those of the organization.
It must also have a right to participate in decisions that affect the performance of the team.
These conditions are currently not met.
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his contributions to the team.
"Patrick informed me today about this decision," said Sakic.
We all appreciate what he has done for our organization and wish him the best for the future.
Roy was awarded the best coach in the league during his debut season at the Avalanches 2013-14 as winner of the Jack Adams Award.
He led the club on 112 points and first place in the Central Vision, but Colorado was beaten in the first round of the Minnesota Playoffs and missed the post-season in each of the last two years.
The Avalanches recorded a 39-39-4 mark in the 2015-16 season and dropped behind the wild for a second Wildcard spot at the Western Conference by five points.
As Hall of Fame Torwart, Roy won four Stanley Cups -- two pieces with the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers resume talks, suspend strike
The labour struggles concerning the remuneration for North Sea oil workers are suspended, while all the parties are on the table for a new round of talks, said negotiators.
Strikes against the oilfield service provider Wood Group were carried out sporadically on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
" Wood Group as well as the Unite and RMT unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the resolution process of the current dispute," says a joint statement.
We will hold a few full-day meetings in the coming weeks, which will start at the beginning of next year to tackle the problems again.
The trade unions said that their last strike, which is the first in over 25 years, is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent.
This year, Wood Group reduced the rates to its North Sea contractors by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure.
The company's rate reduction follows a 10% reduction for Onshore contractors in 2014.
The company said that additional reductions give the company the space needed to get through the market downturn.
Shell has released thousands of people for its part and announced plans to abandon its oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries, as it rationalizes its business activities as a result of its mega-composition with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure as a result of the lower voyage of the robin, an economic situation that was reinforced by the decision of the British in June to leave the European Union.
At the beginning of this week, Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with workers' leaders to discuss one of the biggest industrial disputes that have taken place in the North Sea for a generation.
The North Sea is important for the regional economy, he said.
"In the North Sea and throughout the country, we need an economy that works for many and not just for few," he said in a statement.
In 2016, less than $1.4 billion of expenditure is expected for new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of around $7 billion in the last five years.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of stars in the star cluster of the Plejades
The latest mission with the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers collect the most complete catalog of rotation rates among the stars of the star cluster of the Plejades.
The new data help astronomers to understand why stars rotate in the cluster at different rates and in what context the rotational periods are associated with planet formation.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other star clusters, we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.
The cluster of stars of the Plejades is 445 light years away from the Earth.
Many stars in this cluster, which came about 125 million years ago, are now reaching adulthood.
They're turning fast now.
At peak rotation rates, these mature stars emit large amounts of star winds.
As these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a braking effect on the stars.
When a star grows old, its rotational rate begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotational rate of each star by recognizing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- like sunspots.
The latest catalog of rotational rates indicates that massive stars rotate slower than less massive stars.
Rebull compares the stars to dancers, with larger stars turning slow pirouettes than smaller ones.
"In the "Ballet" of the Plejades, we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive, whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," said Rebull.
Since the cluster of stars of the Plejades is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities such as rotational rates.
"The cluster of stars of the Plejades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older," said Rebull.
There is still much ahead of us that we would like to learn more about how the how, when and why stars slow down their rotational rates and hang their "dance shoes" so to speak.
Rebull and her colleagues have reported in detail in three newspaper reports on their latest analysis of the rotational rates of the Plejades, which will soon appear in the Astronomical Journal.
A controversial baseball star takes place
The tears ran faster at Alex Rodriguez than the US baseball star in best days from base to base.
After his emotional resignation announcement, the 41-year-old professional will wear the jersey of his New York Yankees on August 12 against Tampa Bay Rays for the last time.
"I love this game and this team."
"I say 'Goodbye' to both," said the 14-time All-Star-Game participant of the Major League Baseball (MLB).
In 2009, Rodriguez won the World Series with the Yankees.
Since 2007, his signature under a ten-year contract has provided him with 27 million US dollars annually.
Until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017, he will serve as a consultant and youth coach - with full salary.
As a player it paid Rodriguez back with power for a long time.
With 696 Homeruns, 3114 Hits and 2021 points for his teams ("Runs") for the Seattle Mariners (1994 to 2000), the Texas Rangers (2001 to 2004) and since 2005 the Yankees he made some milestones.
With the Hall-of-Fame members Hank Aaron and Willie Mays, only two more baseball players have similar values in the most important statistics.
However, the 41-year-old should not be taken into the glory hall of the baseball.
Because so successful Rodriguez - nickname "A-Rod" - was on the field, so controversial is his appearance outside the square.
In 2009, the Superstar admitted to have banned steroids from 2001 to 2003.
In August 2013, he was blocked for 211 games by the end of 2014 due to involvement in the so-called biogenesis scandal.
Rodriguez is considered the main suspect to have received performance-promoting funds for years through an anti-aging clinic in South Florida.
After a dispute, the block was reduced to 162 encounters.
"The league could even have done me a favor for 2014 because I played for 20 years without a break," said Rodriguez at the time.
Also his farewell days are not noiseless.
While many baseball legends get the big stage again in their last games, Rodriguez often had to sit on the bench.
"My job doesn't include a farewell tour."
"My job includes trying to win any game," Yankees-Coach Joe Girardi put it.
After all, Rodriguez, who was married to the actress Cameron Diaz and who was told about the relationship with Popstar Madonna and the actress Kate Hudson, received sympathy messages from the fans of Yankee archrival Boston Red Sox.
"We want A-Rod", the followers sang at the 4:9 defeat against the Rodriguez team.
Olympia 2016: Chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekova and Adrian Zielinski are first doping cases
Catched: Due to a positive doping sample, weight lifter Adrian Zielinski from Poland should not start in Rio.
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are overshadowed by the first official doping cases.
A catched athlete would almost have won a medal.
Before the seventh day of the competition, the first official doping events became known to the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
The Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 3000-metre paratrooper Silwia Danekowa from Bulgaria and the Polish weight lift Adrian Zielinski were tested and excluded in Brazil - just before the start of the already critically alert athletic competitions, these news comes at present.
At Chen, the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide was detected last Sunday, which is used as a masking agent for doping substances.
The International Sports Court CAS confirmed its exclusion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon local time.
On Sunday the 18-year-old had the fourth place in the final over 100 m butterfly, only by 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal.
On Friday Chen should have participated in the foreclosures over 50 m freestyle.
Chen asked the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to open the B test and to hear it.
The national association takes the matter "very seriously and demands full cooperation from Chen in the investigations", Xinhua quoted from a communication: "We will cooperate with the International Sports Court CAS and will accept the judgment".
For the first time in history, the IOC is no longer responsible for the sanctioning of athletes with positive cases.
Also in the night of Rio, the news of the positive sample at Danekowa went through, the 33-year-old went into the offensive himself.
"I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," she said to the Bulgarian TV station BNT.
She was innocent, "the only explanation could be food supplements," the light athlete explained.
According to the report, the prohibited substance should be EPO.
Danekowa was suspended for the time being, according to BNT, the B-probe is already said to have been positive.
Bulgaria's Prime Minister Bojko Borissow immediately spoke out with criticism of the athlete.
"I don't understand why the athletes don't draw the right conclusions," he said, "we Bulgarians are under observation, so many have already been excluded."
For example, all weight lifters from the chronic doping-loaded nation are not allowed to participate in Rio.
On Friday the case "Adrian Zielinski" was also known, the London-Olympiager in the class up to 85 kg was tested positively for the anabolic steroid Nandrolone three days earlier, like his brother Tomasz.
Both dispute the intake, but both must not start in class up to 94 kg.
Before the start of the track athletes, especially the Danekowa case is another heavy blow for the reputation of the entire sport.
The World Federation of IAAF had banned the complete Russian team from taking off due to systematic dopings, and the run nation of Kenya also produces numerous bad news in Rio.
In addition, the previous crimes in China had caused violent conflicts between the athletes.
The Frenchman Camille Lacourt attacked Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang harshly.
"Sun Yang is pinking purple."
"When I see the stage over 200 m of freestyle, I want to hand over," Lacourt said on the French radio.
Sun was also at the centre of a discussion with Australian Mack Horton.
"I don't have time and no respect for doping fraud," he said.
Sun had been tested on the Stimulan Trimetazidin in 2014 at the Chinese Championships, but only had to hold a three-month barrier.
Data clause: So perfide hackers extort their ransom
Developers of extortion malware are currently targeted at companies - and are successful in doing so.
According to a recent survey by malware defence specialists Malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of the companies surveyed have been at least once in the past twelve months, some of them victims of an attack with blackmail software.
In Germany, nearly 20 percent of the companies were already the target of Ransomware blackmail.
40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ransomers required by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the attacked systems and data again.
According to the observations of malwarebytes, the perpetrators specialize in attacks in corporate networks.
If they are successful there, the ransom to be extorted will be significantly higher than for private users.
"We are currently watching a terrifyingly fast evolution of the malware software," explains Malwarebytes boss Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "world".
In 2008, most malware programs were still designed to send advertising.
Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for themselves.
First, private users were the target, but the change to corporate attacks has been frighteningly rapid in recent months.
Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: Once active on a victim's computer, it specifically searches for recently modified files such as word, Excel or database files as well as archives of images and videos.
These files encrypt the Ransomware and permanently delete the originals.
The software then presents the demands of the blackmailers.
In order to get the end encryption code to the files, the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of the Bitcoin cryptocurrency.
However, where the personal photo database is at stake in private users, companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases without which production is still quiet.
Accordingly, the damage is higher when a Ransomware strikes.
22 percent of the German companies concerned reported sales losses due to Ransomware, 13 percent even had to interrupt the business completely, and in one case people were at risk of death.
In Germany, several hospitals have already been victims of attacks whose patients may be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records.
"We always tell the victims: don't pay, you just promote the problem," explains Kleczynski.
But 80 to 90 percent of the companies that pay get their data back.
It is difficult for managers to reject the claim of the perpetrators in view of the downtime in the operation.
The hackers, in turn, know this and try everything to build a good reputation.
In a recent study, F-Secure's security researchers have examined the user interfaces and contacts with the blackmailers and come to the conclusion: the perpetrators are actually trying to build up a kind of customer service to take on more money.
They explain to their victims by chat as they can pay by bitcoin, set up freely accessible support websites one or decrypt for free example files.
And if private individuals are redeemed after payments of a few hundred euros, companies have to partially negotiate hard and pay five-digit sums to get their data back unencrypted.
In view of the potentially high and relatively riskless profits from the Ransomware blackmail, hackers become more and more professional and share the work, says safety expert Chester Wisniewski of the antivirus provider Sophos: "One person can write a Ransomware about one week."
However, it is more likely that these are three or four persons.
The programmers then sell their malicious software in the form of a software kit to the actual blackmailers.
The previous malware kits were created by buying the malware itself, consulting and additional tools for a unique fixed price between $1,000 and $10,000.
"The delivery includes a customization tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.
The blackmailers are looking for more hackers to distribute the freshly purchased software to the victims.
We live in a service industry.
So you get in one of the underground forums, buy the set from a criminal and order another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.
Payment is made per infected computer.
"Usually the criminals then commission spammers to spread," explains Wisniewski.
The risk of Ransomware is now known to many companies that better secure their data.
Over 50 percent of company IT managers in the malwarebytes survey trust to be able to resist Ransomware using file backups and scanner software.
Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.
"If the encryption of data alone is no longer a sufficient threat to success, the perpetrators instead threaten to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations," explains Malwarebytes boss Marcin Kleczynski.
Thus, the potential for damage is much higher than before depending on the type of data.
In future, the perpetrators could also introduce completely new goals on the Internet of Things.
At the hacker conference Defcon, security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control.
In the middle of winter, the activation of such a blocked heating could be worth a ransom.
If the perpetrators block an entire production line in a factory instead of heating in the future, Ransomware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0.
One for All Cases
HONDA HR-V is flexible and easy to use
In the small HR-V Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupé and also the versatility of a minivan.
Sounds quite overcharged, but the HR-V, which was built on the same new platform as the new jazz, actually proves to be very flexible in everyday life.
Although the HR-V is only 1.60 m high, passengers have a lot of space in both the first row and the fund, it doesn't work in any place.
The materials of the interior are well processed and look pleasant, only the cockpit top falls off.
More versatile than comparable vehicles is the HR-V in the storage space.
It is not only available with a trunk of 453 l with raised and 1026 l with folded backrests, but also with the "Magic Seats".
This is less magical than it sounds: the back seat seats can be folded up like cinema chairs and thus offer storage space, which is 1.24 m high from the floor to the ceiling.
The trunk can be loaded well, but the loading height at 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008.
The tested 1.6-l diesel with 88 kW/120 hp accelerates the HR-V very powerful thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.
However, he should do his work a little bit more quietly.
The daily consumption of 4.7 l/100 km is enjoyable.
There is another motorization: a 1.5 l petrol with 96 kW/130 hp.
An all-wheel drive is not offered.
Driving behaviour is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.
But the steering should be a little more direct.
The equipment leaves nothing to be desired in the tested top variant "Executive".
The safety systems include the city emergency brake assistant (worked up to Tempo 32), the collision warning system and the tracking assistant.
The collision warner sometimes irritates, because when ranking many obstacles he considers them to be "appropriate objects".
The long-distance light assistant works very reliably.
And the intelligent speed controller responds to the traffic sign recognition and, if necessary, pushes the speed.
The full connectivity, however, is only available for the top equipment: 7-inch touchscreen, Navi, app integration and more.
Two USB and one HDMI sockets are under the armrest and are therefore somewhat cumbersome.
The around 29000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are fine.
If you do not want to invest so much, you will receive the petrol from 20000 euros, the diesel from 23000 euros.
The engines comply with the Euro-6 exhaust standard.
With the HR-V, Honda offers a versatile and everyday car.
Airline is not liable: fall on passenger bridge
An airline is not liable for the crash of a passenger on the passenger bridge.
The Oberlandesgericht Düsseldorf (Az.: 18 U 124/14) argued that liability can only be imaginable in the event of dangers typical of air transport.
The plaintiff had broken a knee disc at the fall.
However, the accident could have happened everywhere - it is a general risk of life, the court said.
The airline didn't have to pay the man any damages.
Sickness case: When will the organizer pay?
Sick holidaymakers get money back after their trip only if the cause of the disease is undoubtedly to be found in the hotel.
This is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests show the same symptoms.
In the case under discussion, a family had a severe problem with diarrhoea and vomiting on the second day of their holiday in Turkey.
She spent almost the entire vacation in the room.
Their illness led the vacationers back to a defective sewage treatment plant that had supposedly polluted the sea water.
The family believed that the trip had been flawed with it - and complained against the organizer.
The applicants were unsuccessful in court.
Although the treatment plant was indeed defective.
But the organizer only learned about it shortly before the plaintiffs left.
He had to assume that the sea water was all right.
So he did not violate his information obligations, so the judgment.
No impurities were found especially in the samples of the water.
The disease of several hotel guests - possibly by infection with one another - is part of the general risk of life.
Of 691 guests, only 38 were ill.
De Maizière said that after the violence committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ansbach in July, many people were concerned about further attacks.
The state must react to terrorist threats in a sensible and determined manner.
It is certain that our country will not answer the violence of the perpetrators with hatred and division.
We won't give the terrorists this triumph.
If criminals had to leave the country faster, this would increase security and strengthen the support of the population for refugee policy.
De Maizière wants to achieve implementation of the proposals by the 2017 Bundestag election.
He also announced a further strengthening of the security forces, "in a medium four-digit order of magnitude for several years".
The promotion of sympathy for terrorism must be punished again.
Video surveillance is intended to improve the innovation of arms law in such a way that, in particular, the purchase of weapons on the Internet is made more difficult.
The last much discussed silence obligation for doctors should be observed according to de Maizière's words.
However, in dialogue with the medical profession, he wanted to look for solutions that could reduce the risk of the citizens, he said, for example, in view of mental conspicuousness.
In order to counter the radicalisation of refugees, the Minister considers that better social care is necessary.
Teachers should be better prepared to deal with traumatized people.
To persecute criminals in special areas of the Internet (Darknet) de Maizière plans to use hidden investigators.
SPD chief Gabriel said: "The SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further increasing security".
It is important that the Minister of the Interior has made a clear statement against actionism.
"This was a fig for the sharpmakers in the CDU/CSU," said Gabriel to the newspapers of the Funke Mediengruppe (Friday).
De Maizière had previously rejected calls from the Union for a ban on Burka and the abolition of double nationality.
It considers that a general ban on full-sleeping is constitutionally problematic.
You can't forbid everything you refuse, and I refuse to wear the Burka.
You can talk about rules such as road traffic or witnesses in court.
Green-chefin Simone Peter accused the Minister of constantly simulating action force and capacity with new anti-terrorist packages.
Left-wing party leader Bernd Riexinger said, "Fleet sayings and a strengthening of the right of residence no longer bring security to the people in this country."
Better traffic flow on the motorway
It is regularly standing on the bypass road - here a picture from November.
But this is to change: the right turn is to be extended.
This is a good news for all motorists who are in traffic on the surrounding road every night when they drive over the highway (A 43).
On the next Tuesday and Wednesday (16th and 17th August), in the area between Hammer Straße and the Weseler Straße exit, the state-owned road will extend the right-hand turner track by 700 meters.
Car drivers can go directly from Hammer Straße to the right.
The big advantage is that traffic is divided early, which improves the overall process on the busy section of the Bundesstraße 51.
The idea with the extended exit had the CDU fraction in the district representation Münster-West.
The road narrowing on the feeder bothers the drivers mainly between 5 p.m. and 7 p.m.
On working days, the backstrip extends to the bridge over the Albersloher path and sometimes beyond.
The reason is the needlehole on the B 51 shortly before the departure Weseler Straße.
From here, the traffic is managed only one-way across the motorway bridge.
The second track had to be remodelled about three and a half years ago.
The reason: Static calculations showed that the bridge no longer has the necessary load capacity to accommodate heavy duty traffic in two tracks.
How long this bottleneck and the associated working-day congestion will last, cannot be said by the competent state company.
However, years can be expected: because the bridge has an official residual life by the year 2034.
For the extension of the right-wing trail, the country company deliberately chose the less traffic time in the school holidays, because disability is expected.
On Tuesday and Wednesday traffic will be one-way past the construction site.
Intercultural journey: cultural offerings for schools
The international class of the forest school attended the play "The Invisible House".
The association Nima's and the Young Theatre are now planning a music project.
The association Nima's allows young people with a migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster.
The "Class International" of the Waldschule Kinderhaus visited a presentation of the award-winning piece "The Invisible House" of the young theatre Münster.
In the context of the "intercultural journey" initiated by the Nima's association, 19 students between the ages of 11 and 15 attended the production in the Kleine Haus.
Since the beginning of the year, the association, which has set itself the goal of the cultural integration of young people with migrant and refugee backgrounds, offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to attend cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project.
Most of the class’s young people came to Münster between September 2015 and March 2016, including Afghanistan, Iran, Serbia and Syria, and speak little German.
Thanks to the choreographies, the scenic images and video animations it was possible for them to follow the course of action, according to the press release of the Young Theatre Münster.
The association Nima's, founded by Dr. Tannaz Westerberg from Tagelel, and the Young Theatre will work together in the coming season as part of a music theatre project.
From October to December, young people with and without the background of escape and migration between the ages of 14 and 20 will be given the opportunity to attend professionally trained courses in the fields of singing, dance, acting and music.
Offers for children and families in the area of theatre play and theatrical language mediation are planned.
The "intercultural journey" project continues.
In view of the rising numbers of refugees, the association expects many classes who want to participate.
Rain instead of star sniffing: Hope for Weather Improvement
The weather has made a line through the bill to the Sternschnuppen-Guckern in the southwest of Germany during the night of Friday - but there is still hope.
The night had been badly suited for watching the celestial spectacle due to clouds and rain, said the chairman of the observatory Welzheim, Hans-Ulrich Keller, on Friday morning.
Our hope lies on the night of Saturday.
The weather should be good, then we will surely see many star snoops in the sky.
The stardecks are perseidens, which are among the fastest stardials at 216,000 kilometers per hour.
They have their name because they seem to come from the constellation Perseus, which rises in the northeast.
Relaxable Night: Tips for Sleep Disorders
In the evening you walk around forever, at night you are awake for hours, in the morning you can no longer think of sleep well before the alarm clock bell.
This is anything but relaxing.
After all, one is in good company with such problems: According to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep often or permanently as not relaxing.
How do sleep problems or sleep disorders express themselves?
There are several forms of sleep disorders, and they may be based on a variety of causes, stresses Hans-Günter Weeß, Member of the Board of Management of the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Schlafforschung und Schlafmedizin.
What one understands at national level is, however, the insomnia, i.e., an insomnia.
Many people feel that sleep is unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the board of the German Association of Doctors with practice in the Lower Saxony Varel.
What's behind sleep disorders?
The causes of sleep disorders are complex.
There can be organic, psychological or behavioral factors behind them, but also medications.
Not rarely is sleep disorder an expression of another disease.
"Very early awakening is common especially in the event of depression," Weeß says.
And it may be that different factors are conditional on each other.
For example, if you have a disc incident, it can be bad, wakes up every two to three hours, and perhaps begins to grumble about everyday problems and concerns, Weess gives an example.
This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.
From when to when should you have sleep disorders to the doctor?
If you do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and are affected by the day, you should go to the doctor, advise Weess.
The impairment may look quite different: You are beaten off, tired, unsleeved, has difficulties with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical discomforts such as stomach or headache.
To relieve sleep disorder, it is important to find out its causes.
Treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioral therapy or medications - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and for a maximum of two weeks.
There are hardly any established sleep doctors in Germany, emphasizes Prof. Ingo Fietze, Head of the Interdisciplinary Sleep Medicine Center of Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin.
Therefore, if you have sleep problems, contact your family doctor first, Weess advises.
This can be used to investigate whether the problems have a physical cause.
Who should go to the sleeping lab, and what's going on?
For example, doctors in the sleep laboratory advise in snorkels with respiratory excrements, in the event of infirm daytime fatigue, in sleep transducers, or if you do not find the cause of a slumber disorder, explains Fietze.
You really don't have to prepare for the investigation.
You should spend the day normally.
"Please don't sleep at lunch," says Fietze.
After wiring, you go to bed at your normal time.
In addition to the electrodes on the body, one wears a nose glasses, a chest strap and a sensor on the finger.
In addition, a camera on the ceiling records the sleepers.
How can those affected get to grips with the problems?
There are quite a lot of stand-up screws that you can put on for better sleep.
Weeß ist ein: Regular bedtimes and uptimes, not too long in bed, not sleeping in the daytime, not watching TV to sleep, avoiding alcohol and not watching the clock at night - then you start to expect immediately, and that is not at all beneficial.
What the jungle camp has to do with missing medals in swimming
The former German swimmer Markus Deibler has expressed himself via Facebook to the disappointing section of the DSV team at Olympis.
In December 2014, he won the gold medal at the Doha World Shortway Championships and at the same time set his first world record.
Now the former DSV athlete Markus Deibler has been protecting himself from his critical ex-teammates via Facebook.
"In a country where an Olympic winner gets 20,000€ premium and a jungle king 1500.000€ no one should wonder about missing medals," wrote the 26-year-old on his Facebook page at night on Friday.
The support system in swimming is bad, while doping controls are very good.
That is why we cannot compete with countries that promote a lot and do not look so closely at or even operate it in the field of doping.
"I am not saying that the controls should be stopped here," he continued.
If he wanted to start a comeback, Deibler would have to be reported nine months before his first launch of the National Anti-Doping Agency Germany (NADA).
That's the way to keep it with countries.
"Whoever cannot be controlled by independent WADA/FINA controllers for a certain period of time before the World Cup/OS is not allowed to participate," demands the Elector Hamburger, who now operates an ice cream section.
Airport: Bands of Baggage Thieves Arrested
Professional Thieves at Düsseldorf Airport
On Thursday, the citizens of the Düsseldorf Police were able to arrest two women and two men aged 50 to 61.
The suspects had committed several pocket and luggage thefts as gangs.
At around 9:30 p.m. civil servants in Düsseldorf Airport recognized a gang known to the police from past theft crimes.
The two women and two men had committed several crimes since mid-July of this year, taking part in the community and particularly professional activities.
The specialists of the Criminal Commission 34 can prove four acts to the thieves who had specifically come to Germany to commit crimes.
A total of more than 15,000 euros had been exploited.
Altbauten, a few linden trees, in between, still a rest of the cobblestones: Rigaer Straße in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not work like this at first glance, but the police count it among the "hazard places" of the city.
Walking along the road from east to west, you pass playgrounds, a freshly painted kindergarten and a bio shop.
Someone sprayed on the facade of a gray house "hospitable!"
Compared to a Lidl, which is to be torn down soon, a house with high windows and 133 new rental apartments will be built here until 2017.
In recent weeks, however, articles on this "trendy district", as the competent real estate company Friedrichshain calls, are preferably illustrated with burning cars.
The reason is the house with the number 94: Once it was occupied, the inhabitants now have rental contracts, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events.
Since the beginning of the year, Berlin's interior senator Henkel in particular had repeatedly called for a tough action by the police against the project, the area as a "no-go zone" for police officers and the 94 as the starting point for autonomous violence.
After the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, had been cleared with 300 police officers on June 22nd, the police patrolled official statements for three weeks with 30 to 40 officials and three crew cars on the ground, locked parts of the street and prevented visitors from entering the house with the number 94.
Meanwhile, construction workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown homeowners.
On July 13th, a Berlin Administrative Court ruled that the room had been illegal, and a day later, police and construction workers withdrew under the jubilation of sympathizers and residents.
On this summer afternoon, the street is peaceful: parents walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others are talking about late.
In the immediate vicinity of the house projects there is a primary school and kindergartens.
Left-wing violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in Kiez since 1999, and Jana*, who raised three children here, are especially affected by police presence.
With the inhabitants of the house projects, they share the concern about increasing rents and gentrification.
It doesn't sound like a kizez who mostly wanted police protection from vandalizing left.
The grave, which the Berlin interior senator and the police open between house-occupiers and their neighbors, apparently does not exist.
Friedrichshain in the East of Berlin was actually a traditional workers' quarter, which still has a low average income and a high risk of poverty compared to the rest of the city today.
Also house occupations and the housing projects that have been born from them have long been part of the Kiez: in 1990 numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost the entire Mainz Street very close to the Rigaers.
While the Mainzers had been cleared in a real battle, many of the projects in Riga were legalized and some of them still live today by the people they had occupied 26 years ago.
At the same time, the district has increasingly become a magnet for tourists and electors from all over the world in recent years: residents from GDR times and former house-occupiers now share their choice with them.
This is also evident in the rents, which have increased by almost 60 percent since 2009 in the case of new rentals.
Many of the new buildings in Riga are being attacked as symbols of this development: they are recognized on cast-in discs or freshly painted facades that have been cast with paint bags.
No other road was mentioned so often this year along with the words "left-wing autonomous violence".
One reason why not all neighbors view this as a problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: according to statistics, crimes such as injury are almost exclusively directed against police officers.
Most of the crimes constitute damage that tend to affect the new buildings and newly renovated houses.
Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a rented house next to the controversial 94 for 17 years, cannot speak of uncertainty.
As for violence, it is obnoxious: the people of 94 are their neighbors, who would not have been.
Also the famous burning cars were no longer available directly in Riga.
For the architect, her street is not a criminal focus, on the contrary: "Here you help each other, live together on the street and get more of each other than elsewhere."
Neugebauer was deliberately pulled into Riga's street - and stayed.
That's why it was so important for the locals to get back their streets: from the police, politics and the media, all of whom suddenly claimed the authority of interpretation over the district in July.
But in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer, the road continues to be taken away: through faceless new buildings in former building gaps, which the old inhabitants drive away.
"These are apartments of property that are not interesting for many here - rather people who are not so well-deserved live here," she says.
"I absolutely cannot approve of violence and destruction."
But what should you do if you never listen to anyone?
There is frustration on all sides, including the police and the residents.
Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding for those who are angry about color bombs: The house projects and the left scene were part of the Kiez.
Anyone who draws should be aware of this - just as someone who moves into a pub district can complain badly about noise there.

Urbach: Annika Deuschle is a new refugee commissioner
Annika Deuschle is the contact in terms of integration and organizer.
She is also a local social worker.
Annika Deuschle has been the refugee commissioner for Urbach since July.
The social teacher supports the administration team around Achim Grockenberger.
She sees herself as a contact for all stakeholders: refugees, working group refugee aid, administration, authorities and anyone else involved.
Regine's customer from the working group suggests that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle is now there, the egg-linging wool milk sauce, which has a problem in particular.
Some, for example, had meant - less mocking than rather targeting the variety of desired areas of activity - when the administration wanted to sign the job.
An administrative expert with a talent for languages and people, combined with a long experience in the field of social work, was sought.
But administrative work is not its central area, says Annika Deuschle.
Above all, it is about organization, working with the people on the ground and also behind the scenes as well as network activity.
The 31-year-old has been around for about six weeks.
It has a 50 percent job for three years.
"It was high time," says Regine Customer, "that Annika Deuschle supports honorary and principal actors.
There are big and small problems, organizational, human and understanding problems.
Soon new containers will be in the Wasenstraße
For some time now, it has been a serious problem to find homes for the refugees who have been recognized.
The municipalities are responsible for the accommodation.
They must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented homes.
The costs of building, renting or renovation of these accommodation must be borne by the municipalities themselves.
Responsibility changes from the Landratsamt to the municipality and job centre.
Problem: There are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.
The search has been very difficult for some time.
De facto the administration does not find private apartments.
It doesn't work yet, according to Deuschle, depending on private homes.
Therefore, local homes have to be rehearsed, as it is called.
So soon new containers will be set up in the Wasenstraße.
But only with apartments it is not done.
Perspective is the keyword, Regine Customer and Annika Deuschle agree.
In addition to a fixed stay, it is internships, training places, school places, one-Euro jobs and assistance activities for refugees and migrants who need to be found or set up.
"More places would be good," Regine Customer reports.
Many work in the construction yard or help housekeepers, do non-profit work - and this motivated and very neatly, as Annika Deuschle reports.
It hopes that work for the community will lead to a positive external effect.
That's "no employment therapy."
But activity doesn't just mean work.
The day needs a solid structure, say Deuschle and customer.
People would have to develop a sense of belonging.
So it needs offers such as sports, contacts with locals and, above all, language courses.
Professional courses are rare.
So here too, administration and volunteers jump in.
It is central that the refugees get the feeling that they are wanted and welcome in Germany.
The long duration of the procedures was a problem.
You have to tell the refugees that it takes a while and that they can easily bridge the time, for example with language courses.
Those who at some point develop the feeling that they can't help anyone in Urbach, don't work and don't be useless, they'll never integrate.
The clear majority was motivated.
But there are also cases of problems, says customer honestly, "people who have nothing to do with". Therefore, the work of Deuschle and Customer is always also to motivate others.
That's all a mammoth task.
A difficult question: According to the recent events, are the two afraid of radicalization, even in a small community like Urbach?
"No," Regine Customer clearly says, "what some people might call naive." However, a residual risk could and would not exclude them.
But the helpers are already sensitized.
These incidents were also the subject of the refugees.
They'd be afraid the attackers would call them all out.
"They want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine Klant.
Many would like to stay in Urbach.
So, the main and the volunteer must look for activities on the spot and in the region.
They always have in the background that soon a new shock of refugees and migrants could come to Urbach.
Does Germany need a ceiling?
To answer this question clearly is to be afraid of politics.
Actually, it's unfair to put them on site.
"We haven't arrived in Urbach where we wanted to go," says Annika Deuschle.
No new refugees, that would relax the situation.
Regine Customer also makes it clear that the Urbachers are already used to rationally integrate the previous people.
These are currently around 100 people, mostly young men.
But when people are in need, they have to be helped, both women agree.
The political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers.
Schorndorf: Breaker with helicopter sought
The police helicopter flew off different areas for about an hour - unsuccessful.
Two unknown men have forcibly invaded an apartment in a multifamily house in Lindenweg on Friday morning at 8.50 a.m.
The resident surprised the two and struck the holding in flight.
The two men were about 1.65 to 1.70 meters tall, probably masked, wearing both bluejeans and black hood pull.
They fled downtown.
The police used several strip crews and a police helicopter to search.
The warrant was unsuccessful.
Perhaps the unknown noticed before the deed near the apartment or on their escape.
Baden-Württemberg: Police investigates after Rocker attack on snacks
After an attack on an Ulmer snack, the police found out about six suspects from the rocker environment for severe land peace.
In search of housing, evidence and intoxication were ensured, the police told us on Friday.
About 20 masked men of a rock-like group had, according to police, thrown bottles and stones against the window screen of a snack in July.
After that, they're supposed to have attacked two guests and injured one easily.
Then they fled.
A damage of 10000 euros occurred on the snack and on the adjacent building.
According to the investigators, this is a dispute in the Ulm rocker environment between a Kurdish and a Turkish gang.
