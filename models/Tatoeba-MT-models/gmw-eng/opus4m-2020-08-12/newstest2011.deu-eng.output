What is she supposed to do, ČSSD? The Czech Social Democrats in Prague do not know any place of voldem, nor the "confectionery".
The new councillors of the capital from the ČSSD series will obviously have to overcome certain language barriers in order to understand their old-new colleagues from the ODS in the Prague Council and in the city's representation at all.
The newspaper Aktuálně.cz has once "knocked" members of the new Council from ČSSD, as they have mastered the notary snake, which in recent years has established itself in which today's coalition partners in Prague were on the row.
The coded vocabulary introduced by Mayor Pavel Bém of Prague's political elite in the lost era is a source of some of the most famous actors, situations and causae.
Surprisingly, it turned out that the new councils were somewhat in the dark regarding these new terms.
At least they claim that.
"Who is Voldemort?"
"No idea."
"I am more of a newcomer to Prague's politics," replied Lukáš Kaucký, the new councillor for culture, to the test of the "paten vocabulary".
But also the councillor Karel Březina - a political veteran - responded in a similar way.
For example, the term "golfhole".
"This is the only expression of those you present to me here, which I occasionally use."
"Other than that, I don't think much of Slang."
From the vocabulary published by Aktuálně.cz in June before the ODS election congress, the editorial staff picked out six terms, especially those that are notorically linked to the Prague Magistrate.
The Social Democrats should define the terms "voldemort", "largest Prague golf hole", "go to the confectionery", "baby snacks", "treason of the capital" and "bleach".
Three Prague councillors agreed to the test, the fourth - Antonín Wenert, the future head of the Prague school system - promised to take part in the conversation first, but then did not even take the listener off.
The fifth councillor, Petr Dolínek, rejected the test from the outset.
"I don't care about these things and how the bourgeois democrats talk to each other, I don't judge about them."
"For me, it is important how we understand ourselves within the framework of our programs," he countered.
As already indicated, Lukáš Kaucký in the above mentioned headline allegedly did not realize that the influential entrepreneur and friend of former mayor Bém, Roman Janoušek is speaking.
The term "voldemort" says nothing at all and the only term he correctly advised during the test was "the largest Prague Gulfhole".
"That's the Blanka tunnel," says Kaucký, adding to safety: "But I know that more from the newspaper."
And funnyly, "I'm going to have to take a language course."
The "Golfloch" is then detached not only by Matador Karel Březina, but also by the councillor for environmental issues Lukáš Plachý as a tunnel Blanka.
But both Social Democrats also know who the term Voldemort stands for and Lukáš Plachý even suspects where this figure is to be found, and thus also what it means to "go into the pastry".
"I think that means going to some Prague gastronomy business," Plachý is quite close to the puzzle solution when you know that this is the seat of Janoušek's companies.
In agreement with Březina, however, he claims to have drawn this knowledge from the newspaper rather than that this vocabulary would be his own.
According to the participants in the test, there does not seem to be any similar naturalised snake among the Social Democrats.
"I also asked my colleagues, but obviously there is no such thing with us."
"We call ourselves by name, occasionally we also use accelerator or nicknames," says the president of the Prague ČSSD Petr Hulínský - of his party companions called salopp "Hulda".
"In school I was called Bříza (Birke), but I don't know if my colleagues call me that," Karel Březina tells us his nickname.
The newspaper Deník Aktuálně.cz has tried the name and see - it works.
Counsellor Weinert is friendly to the party members of the "Opa" or less friendly of the "old", the representative Miroslav Poche, who drew attention to himself before the elections by making decisions in party sponsoring, is called by some colleagues "Igráček" (known Czech Lego figure).
These are the only nicknames that the Social Democrats allow for in-party language use.
Hulínský doesn't want to call him "Hulda", but Deník Aktuálně.cz registered another nickname of the Prague chairman.
His nickname "Doctor of Rubber Knoop Rights" is said to have involved Petr Hulínský's title Doctor of Law at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to stop the torture of "Hexen" and issued a brochure
Women who are stamped witches in Burkina Faso usually have some common social characteristics.
They belong rather to the older generation, they do not find work - for example for health reasons, they are single and have no children.
When one of these women becomes a witch, she is strictly isolated so that she cannot become dangerous to the rest of the village.
"Men are very rarely affected by this fate."
"Young and healthy women are also spared because they help with their work and give birth to children," a nurse describes the situation in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso in a special home for more than a hundred women who have been expelled from their communities.
The local government now decided to take action against this abnormal "social measure".
And for this reason, issued a brochure that is intended to prevent the persecution of witches.
But the thing has a hook.
"More than 70 percent of all adults in Burkina Faso cannot read," pointed out the newspaper "the standard" to the dilemma of written Enlightenment.
But being accused of witchcraft is also going and going on in other African countries.
In Ghana, the neighboring country of Burkina Faso, 27-year-old Ammy Hemmahová was tortured to death by three women and two men - they poured them over with petroleum and just set them on fire.
The BBC server also reported about this incident.
The perpetrators claimed, however, that the case would only have been a meeting of unfortunate circumstances.
According to their version, oil is ignited, which is used for ritual anointing.
After the group tried to "dispel" a "bad spirit" from the woman.
The isolation of "hexen" supports people here without regard for their education.
"The standard" quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso as saying, "Fresses of human souls are a threat in the past, as they were today," he said.
While the government in Burkina Faso is at least trying to detach the witch hunt, last year the Gambian President himself did well to join the president.
"President Yahya Jammeh, after the death of his aunt, triggered a monstrous witch hunt, since these allegedly had a share in their death and would now try to kill the president himself by black magic."
"To this end, he called for the help of shamans from nearby Guinea, who, accompanied by police, soldiers and the President's bodyguard, forcelessly kidnapped women and men from Gambian villages and brought them to the President's farm in Kanilai," said Amnesty International in her report.
On the farm, the incarcerated people were forced to drink an absud of plants with hallucinogenic effects, but which also caused intestinal and kidney problems.
Two of the arrested people did not survive the stay on the farm.
Only because of international pressure were the nearly a thousand prisoners released again.
A tenant of Bakala: He heats in the oven - still pays higher rent
An older underprivileged man is leaving the client center of the company RPG Byty of the "Coal Baron" Zdeněk Bakala, the largest private owner of rental apartments in the Czech Republic.
Under the arm a map with three new leases to three apartments: for their own and the dwellings of their daughters and his son, who is just fined a prison sentence.
All three have just been increased as part of the so-called "deregulation".
Instead of 3500 crowns of monthly rent, the son is expected to enter next year for a 2-room apartment with kitchen of the second category 4100 crowns.
"And there's not even hot water in the apartment and you have to heat in a simple coal stove," he gets angry with the finger on the new rental contract of the son, for whose signature he has an authority.
"But something - I signed it," he explains half-decided and half-resigned.
BytyOKD.cz, which described the new rental conditions as "accurate and immoral", advises tenants not to sign the new contracts and wait until 7 December to publish a guide on how to deal with such contracts.
But the man's just waving.
"One says this, the other says that," he makes a dark face.
The Ostrava region thus becomes a large "deregulation laboratory".
After New Year, this deregulation is expected to result in most rentals in the Czech Republic whose tenants do not pay market-oriented rent so far.
Aktuálně.cz therefore decided to visit this "lab" personally.
The RPG waiting room in Havířov is one of four in the Ostrava region and is already full of nine in the morning on this Tuesday.
Right next to the door are the bodyguards of a security agency and a caller.
"Miete 2011", says a special touch field on the touch screen.
Just tapped and the device spits out a number note.
Hardly have we deciphered the number 157" and already beeps it on the large display on the ceiling of the waiting room.
Half a second later, you're on the line.
A little later, an older couple entered the waiting room to ask for the rent, but the storm in the waiting room apparently does not have the new rent at all.
Most people are here to solve the usual problems - repair applications, insurance matters and similar.
From mid-November, in the Ostrava region, the envelopes with the new lease contracts will provide the most tenants of the total 44,000 apartments of the portfolio of the RPG to the letter boxes.
The RPG Byty proposes a rental increase of about 15 to 38 percent in the letter.
The special switch for the new rents in the client center has been opened since 18 November.
"The action is a little over a week, that is, only the beginning," the ladies behind the switch hesitate after a moment when the "client" turns out to be a journalist.
Deregulation and Bakala's former miners' homes are a challenging subject.
Prior to the elections, Vice-President Lubomír Zaorálek of the ČSSD had taken up this issue quite loudly, no wonder that today the newspapers are full of it.
"Twenty years I want a new floor from them."
"They couldn't even change toilet glasses," the man mentioned at the outset gets air.
According to the employees, pensioners in particular are on the switch to convince themselves whether they really receive the promised rent reduction that RPG promises them when they sign the special offer in good time.
The other tenants who sign the new lease will also be able to enjoy half a reduced February rent by 15 December.
So far, however, "deregulation switch" in Havířov is anything but overburdened with demand.
"From yesterday's 360 clients, only about 40 to 50 of the rent in 2011 were here," the switch officers appreciate.
RPG offers individual rental agreements on their websites, as well as wall panels, where it appears necessary.
However, if the rental parties do not agree on the new rent, they will be determined by an independent court.
"This should not be a threat, but rather an information about the only possible and completely legitimate legal approach," explains RPG on its websites.
"No one is going to court here," says one of the staff of RPG Byty, and a man on the street in front of the client center gives her at least part of the right.
"I have 13,000 (crown) pension, of which 5,000 remain for food, where should I take the money for a court battle," he says.
Then the employees will be insecure.
"Seeing times."
"Mr. Zaorálek tells them about the media that they should not sign and so people are still waiting," she says.
The regulated rent ends in the majority of the Czech Republic at New Year 2011 and RPG Byty says the increase in rent is an economic necessity.
"The existing amount of rents is not enough to maintain the housing fund," argues Pavel Klimeš, the director of the housing portfolio of the company RPG Byty and - precisely the neglect of the housing fund criticized by the tenants is the main reason for the increase in rent.
While RPG was able to invest four billion in the apartments between 2005 and 2010 from the received rents, in the four years from 2011 to 2014, it is expected to be 5.2 billion.
On the large-format LCD display on the ceiling opposite the upholstery chairs in the waiting room of Havířov, some red-lighting information emerges.
"The rent increases in 2011 by 15% and less concern 31 200 homes, i.e. more than 90% of RPG's homes."
"Always this means a maximum of 7.50 CZK per square meter per month", is to be read on the LCD monitor.
Only 400 apartments from the portfolio of RPG increase the rent by 38 percent.
"In these cases, it is about increasing extremely low rental prices of 19.66 CZK per square meter," argues RPG.
With 2600 apartments the rent remains at the same level next year.
RPG Byty promises that the deregulation does not drive the rents up, but gradually takes place within four and eight years.
What is more - the company imposes a further obligation: All revenue from the increase in rent (see diagram) wants to put the company back into the apartments, especially in heat savings - in new windows and in heat insulation.
But priority should be given to those people who sign the agreements on the increase in rent.
The architects saw - the office also belongs to a kindergarten
The office building Avriopoint in Brno is the new headquarters of the company Arch.Design.
But who would expect a mini-child garden here, with everything that belongs to it: colorful walls, creative furniture, a lot of toys and even a mini playground on the outdoor terrace.
This kindergarten has been available to Arch.Design employees since last year.
The Arch.Design design and architecture office, from which a number of well-known Brno buildings come, calculated from the first designs for the new building Avriopoint with the premises for its company mini-child garden.
In wise perspective, because most of its 90 employees are in the Babyboom age and the company is due to the fact that the project clients return to their workplace as soon as possible.
Together with the possibility to work shortenedly, the kindergarten is another bonus that Arch.Design has to offer its employees in the concept of its social programme.
The architectural engineers have made it so easier to bring together their demanding career and child care.
The Mini Kindergarten is an original idea of Arch.Design's employees, and with the support of management, they managed to win funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs for their project.
The Mini Kindergarten is financed by the Programme of Human Resources and Employment Policy from the resources of the European Social Fund and the State budget of the Czech Republic.
This funding (ECU 2, 8 million grants) has enabled the necessary facilities and equipment to be acquired and for the duration of 2 years qualified staff and operations are provided.
After the use of the funding (2 years), the company Arch.Design is obliged to continue to operate the Mini Kindergarten for 3 more years at its own expense.
The preparation of this project took place for a whole year, with the company Economy Rating providing active assistance in the application process.
The children care for qualified staff all the time - a nurse and a kindergarten teacher, the kindergarten can visit children without age restrictions, although most of them are over three years old.
And since this is a mini kindergarten, only 5 children may be present at the same time, but the day changes over several children.
The kindergarten business is flexibly adapted to the needs of the parents, the children of all employees have the same rights with regard to the use of the kindergarten - without regard to the company hierarchy and its respective position.
Although it is individual individual and care, the programme content in the Mini- Kindergarten is nevertheless comparable to the framework programme of pre-school education.
The children not only play here, but above all they are given excellent lessons - from basic knowledge to preschool lessons, by the way they also learn English.
The classroom is not only equipped with toys and creative games, but also with a computer that is available to the children.
What more - the presence of small children in the company contributes to a friendly and positive corporate environment.
The parents can take a look at the children at any time and thus the stress of late collection of the children from a distant kindergarten is eliminated.
Parents therefore use their working hours more productively.
No wonder that natural and loyal employers-employee relationships also develop here.
Arch.Design is thus among the Czech companies that offer significant benefits when recruiting new employees, who are family-friendly and who strengthen their personal marketing through such programs.
A Bone House is also fascinated after 100 years. Look at the interiors of Gaudi
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric lizard, the stairs like the spine of a dinosaur and the balconies are torn up fish mills.
This is the Casa Batlló by Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona.
From the local inhabitants, the house with its organic forms was nicknamed "Knechenhaus".
Organic shapes, wild colors, unusual use of stone, tile splinters and mosaics, the facades reminiscent of sheds and omnipresent soft lines, all these are typical features of the Art Nouveau style of Antonio Gaudi.
The facade of the house plays with beautiful lines, tender colors and textures that remind of nature and beings.
It is only on closer observation that everything is dominated by geometry, rhythm and thoughtful order.
During the night, the entire facade looks even more plastic, dramatic and the special illumination enhances the brightness of the colors.
The same winding lines and engulfed shapes also dominate the interior of the house.
Wave-shaped wood copies the window frames, railers, decorative elements of doors, even look holes and bars.
The house Batlló in the Eixample district on the lively Passeig de Grácia No. 43 shopping street was built by the reconstruction of a house from 1877 that architects Emilio Sala Cortese performed.
The reconstruction took two years and was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrialist Josep Batlló, originally insisted on the demolition of the old and the construction of a completely new building, but ultimately he agreed with Gaudí's idea of an unusual and also cheaper reconstruction.
However, the house Casa Batlló did not design Antoni Gaudí alone.
He worked with the architect Josep Maria Jujol.
The decorations for the representative apartment of the real owner and also the use of mosaics on the facade were created on its drawing board.
However, numerous other artists and artists also worked on the design of the facade.
The joint work on the designs for Casa Batlló was the beginning of a fruitful collaboration between Jujola and Gaudí.
Jujol also participated in the construction of Gaudí's house Casa Milá in the Park Güell, which also contains other works by Antoni Gaudí.
Shortly after its completion, the house was given by the local inhabitants of its organic forms because of the nicknames "Knechenhaus".
Others, in turn, called it the special window opening mechanism because of the "equivalent house".
It is also said that at the very top of the building is the sword of St. Georg, the patron of Catalonia.
But other sculpture elements also symbolize hidden religious motives.
Gaudí designed for the house a central heating system, unique for the time being, with ventilation channels and typical fireplaces.
Something bizarre already seems to be her 45-degree inclination.
In his work Gaudí consistently ignored all the building regulations at the time and was by no means allowed by them.
Before the construction began, he obtained the corresponding building permit from the city, but the information he had given about the planned reconstruction was so vague that two years later, when the city fathers were finished, they were so horrified that they demanded remedial action.
Among other things, the councillors also found that the construction with its pillars even intervened in the public sidewalk.
However, changes were no longer made, quite the contrary - only fifteen days after the city quarter's request was made by Josep Batlló to approve the rental of the two highest floors of the house - and it was granted to him immediately.
The homeowner himself moved into the lower floors.
In the gallery on the 2nd floor there was a social salon, on the third floor there were the bedrooms and private rooms of the apartment.
The ground floor was leased to a jewelry store.
The entire six-storey building runs through a staircase up to the roof terrace.
Through the basic elements of the conversion, all right angles and straight lines were removed and replaced by curved and curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with a modern concept for the mutual connection of rooms.
The social part can be completely connected by opening the salon doors and thus a larger society could chat comfortably without having to miss a certain intimacy in more confidential conversations.
The house received a rather unusual roof and two more floors by Gaudí's reconstruction in addition to a new facade.
Gaudí's play is also impressive with the light as well as the blue and white glazed tiles, with which the courtyard is disguised and the light courts.
The game of these two colors gives all floors of the house a maximum of light.
He simply took advantage of the principle that white reflects the light better than dark colors that, on the contrary, absorb the sunlight.
The house Casa Batlló, which was included in the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2005, can visit everyone today.
On the first floor, the most spacious and magnificent apartment is made accessible to the public.
The homeowners did not decide on this step until the year and this on the occasion of the 150th birthday of the famous Creator.
When it was found that this was a rather sensitive business, the visits were maintained, and they also extended to other common and attic rooms, including the roof terrace.
However, the price to visit the building monument is not a cardboard stick, it is 16.50 euros, students, pensioners, groups and holders of tourist cards get 20 percent discount.
This amount exceeds the admission prices to other Gaudí buildings in the city.
If you want to get to know the real atmosphere of the house with its dragon towers, try to make friends with one of the householders and visit him at home.
The right mattress and the right bed rust? Women have different wishes than men
Not the best bed frame, but the quality of the sunbed - so mattress and rust make up the good bed.
However, these need to complement each other harmoniously in order to meet the wishes of the specific user.
Many things play a role in the selection - the weight, the size, the health condition and, last but not least, the sex of the sleeper.
Also important is the interior in which mattress and rust have to be subordinated.
Typical example?
Latex mattresses are not well suited in a weekend house where heating is not regular, as they need much longer to "heat".
In addition, they are much heavier than common polyurethane mattresses.
And - they should be turned regularly.
If they do not have enough ventilating channels in the core and still lie on a fixed plate, moisture stands up: it is therefore not excluded that mold forms under it.
In the election, of course, there is also a role to play in what you are used to.
Those who have been abroad for a long time, where very high soft layer mattresses are common, will be able to get used to a low mattress with a hard surface.
"Woman all the ice hockey players who came back from the NHL complained to me that they can't sleep right here."
"For their shielded shoulders, heels and hips, they simply need a soft layer of visco foam (Memory Foam - a mold memory polymer). "
"I recommend these people, among other things, who suffer from a disorder of the nervous system, so that they can receive the "information" from the joints and the skin badly," explains Sylva Hadamcziková, who specializes in upholstery furniture.
That's why years ago I got many ice hockey players, but also other customers these mattresses with Visco foam (Memory Foam).
"Today this is no longer a problem, for such mattresses offer, among other things, the manufacturer Tempur, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico."
And you don't necessarily have to be a famous ice hockey player to appreciate the benefits of the visco foam.
This "wonder" actually works very easily.
The foam optimizes its hardness and shape according to the absorbed heat, in other words, it adheres to the warm body.
Nowhere does it press, in the night one does not wander around like after a hard fight.
You just sleep a lot better.
The viscoelastic foam also provides protection against dekubitus (wonderburn).
When choosing the size of the mattress, you should still add the length of the soles, i.e. about 21 to 34 cm.
Man like woman, who is 180 cm tall, needs such a 210 to 220 cm long bed.
Each sleeper should be available at least 90 cm of berth, i.e. 180 cm.
For single beds, for example for singles, 120 to 140 cm are attached.
For the sake of comfort and also for potential visitors.
Otherwise, the following rule applies to the ideal bed width: "If you are lying on your back, there should still be enough space for the slightly angled arms," advises Helena Prokopová, the master of the upholstery and room equipment, who has been devoted for many years to the problem of healthy sleep and ergonomics of furniture and who is also presenting this topic to specialist schools.
With a double bed, everyone needs their own rust and mattress, but watch out when shopping for the mattresses to be equally high.
Otherwise, nothing is left but to mount the rust at different heights and that is not possible for every bed frame.
foam mattresses should be at least 14 cm high, mattresses with spring skeleton 15 cm, of which at least three centimetres should be on the shape layer and the fine padding.
"You must not feel the feathers by hand or by sitting down," warns Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a special rust type.
Fully upholstered beds with mattress and underlay like grown Siamzwillings have nothing to look for in the bedroom.
These mattresses can't be ventilated and the cover can't be washed, which is already going and going on today.
And since one loses between 0.2 and 0.75 l of sweat in a single night, it is clear that after five to seven years, the mattress slowly becomes a huge (and blocked sieve).
This is also why professionals reject advertising logs that promise a lifetime of up to 25 years in mattresses, even life-long warranty.
Every thing has its ifs and Buts.
And therefore a practical advice from the dealers: In mattresses of 120 or 140 cm wide, you should not shy the hygiene of the washable, deductible covers, yet it is recommended to use a mattress cleaner that can be easily removed and washed.
Although today usually mattress covers are made with all-round zip, so you get two halves after opening (immensively important for the washing process and the washing machine size!), manipulation with larger mattresses, above all executed on its own, often like the uneven fight between David and Goliath.
Do they have a fixed plate in bed instead of a rust?
Get out of here!
Or at most for a bed for unloved guests and for a single night.
Even so, they should prefer to use the plate with ventilation holes (if not already in) and mattresses with spring skeleton and 15 cm minimum height with so-called pocket spring core and fine padding.
Polyurethane mattresses do not belong to such a layer.
Latex or sandwich mattresses (including combinations of latex and coconuts) are suitable for unadjustable lattices with 14 to 18 lattices (lattices) and always pay for rusts with a larger number of lattices, i.e. from 28 or more feathers, with Lordose support in the lumbar vertebra and the possibility of regulating the lattice hardness.
No mattresses with spring skeleton belong to adjustable lamella rusts, as they do not react to ergonomic adjustment.
In addition to setting the stiffness of the spring bars, special flexible shoulder modules are also offered.
This is a special feature of the spring strips, which enables the spring bars to be pressed or even angled in such a way that they enable the shoulder of the sleeper to sink in punctually.
Especially for men with broad shoulders an important thing.
There are even mattress manufacturers who have started to use soft zones for the shoulder area in "lord mattresses".
The ladies are also thought of - they are given these soft zones in the hip area.
For the most demanding customers, point-weight wing spring systems (lattoflex) or rusts with point-lastic contact pads with so-called multi-tortion suspension are intended.
The pressure is divided into several points, which reduces the tension.
But - if you use a bad (too big and full) pillow to get the right mattress and rust, most of the benefits are lost again.
Here too, a rule of thumb: the pillow should support the head, its tips should only reach the shoulders so that the shoulder muscles can relax.
Ideally, therefore, a 50 x 60 cm pillow appears, such as the Scandinavians.
In the side position, the pillow (together with the shoulder relief zone in the rust or the soft zone in the mattress) should equalise the shoulder height.
Our modern mattresses have something in common with the former straw bags (filled with hay).
Modern manufacturers use more and more natural materials or at least their additions.
Also in mattresses the new magic word is "bio".
Instead of petroleum raw materials, natural oils are used to produce polyurethane foams, such as castor oil and soybean oil.
Soya is probably used by all known manufacturers.
"Bio means mattresses that are made of materials of pure natural origin," explains Petr Vašíček of Tropico Plus.
Natural materials are also used in the production of mattress covers - one of the first was Aloe Vera.
You can also treat yourself to micro-capsules that spread fresh forest or lavender fragrance while sleeping.
Here, too, one makes a difference between man and woman.
While men use a "cooling" plant extract from birch leaves so that the mattress cover can absorb the heat and cool the body, the covers for women have "heating" effect.
Extracts from red pepper shots stimulate blood circulation, so the weaker sex gets warm when sleeping.
And today's favorites?
mattresses made of cold foam (it has larger pores with destroyed cell structure and is therefore more breathable than conventional polyurethane and also much more flexible).
The combination of the different stiffness (hardness) of cold foams and visco foams creates multi-zone mattresses that know exactly where the head, hips and heels are.
However, for a high-quality mattress you have 7000 crowns and more to wrap.
However, health mattresses are usually subject to reduced VAT, as they are considered medical devices.
Gumotex was the first Czech company to benefit from this advantage.
You can see, saving on the mattress and on the rust is not so easy.
Occasionally there are special offers from manufacturers and dealers that offer two mattresses at the price of one.
For example, the brand Magniflex offers the mattress Duofreeze with visco foam memory for 11.990 CZK.
The second one is free of charge.
It was the material Tempur that introduced the era of viscoelastic foams with open cell structure and high density at almost cosmic speed.
No wonder they were developed for NASA, because the astronauts are exposed to enormous overloads at the start.
Tempur becomes soft with heat, in a cool environment it in turn solidifies itself.
Thus it adapts perfectly to the human body and distributes the body pressure in an optimal way.
It is therefore not only ideal for preventing pressure fire, but generally increases sleep comfort.
However, viscoelastic foams are used not only in mattresses but also in other health products, such as special foot cushions, which are intended to facilitate the legs and vessels.
Local manufacturers, for example, use the foams Eucatherm C, Twinsaver or similar products.
More and more parents want human monitoring equipment to control the kids
The fear of your own children is growing and so more and more parents are considering monitoring them via GPS.
The system, which was originally invented to search for cars, is just as well able to locate people, which would also be helpful in such cases, as it was recently in the pathless disappearance of the nine-year-old Anička Janatková.
The device is currently about the size of a cigarette box, but soon it will not be larger than a watch.
Many people have put the case of the missing Anička in fear and terror, so they look for ways and means to better protect their children.
Also for the price of an impairment of their privacy.
"We are trying to tell everyone that this is not about pioneering around, but about an effective means to reduce the likelihood of tragedy," says Petr Pilin of Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of GPS placement devices on the Czech market.
"I admit that the abuse of such devices can occur in individual cases, for example when someone is put in the pocket without him knowing about it, but we haven't had such a case so far."
"Most customers really buy it for security reasons," adds Pilin.
In his opinion, however, the child should always know what purpose the "chattle" serves and how to use it in an emergency.
However, child psychologist Dana Bočková points out that if a child doesn't like to wear such a thing, it simply gets rid of him.
"Very small children also show great creativity when it comes to deliberately losing certain things if they do not want to be controlled."
"At first, the mobile phones raised great expectations among parents, but they can be turned off as easily as these new surveillance devices," says Ms. Bočková.
In your opinion, it is also controversial whether such an institution actually helps in the event of an attack.
"In the case of planned kidnappings, the kidnapper virtually always controls whether the child has any electronics with which it could be located."
"Today it's the cell phone."
"If such surveillance equipment were to be used more widely, they would also be looking for them, since their sale would certainly be accompanied by massive advertising."
"In these cases, the criminals of the police are always one step ahead," says the psychologist.
However, it acknowledges that similar devices can be quite helpful in the event of a sudden attack by a pedophile.
According to Roberta Čech of the company RC Monitoring, which offers location services for both automobiles and persons, the existence of a device can help even if it is destroyed immediately after the attack.
"The device can be set in such a way that it reports the respective position at certain intervals."
"Even if it was immediately destroyed, at least the last position of the data subject is available."
"In the case of more expensive devices, even a tilting knife is integrated, i.e. if you fall down and remain motionless, the device immediately sends a warning indicating the position," says Mr. Čech.
In his opinion, similar services could also provide intelligent intelligent ones with navigation, one only needs to play a special software.
The problem of the current positioning devices is that they are either devices in matchbox sizes, trailers are similar or smaller phones.
There is always the danger of losing them.
According to Mr Pilin of the Macro Weil, in the present time, devices that look like normal digital watches are tested.
"This has the advantage that the possible attacker does not have to realize at all that it is a surveillance or locating device.
"Or he doesn't notice that until after some time what the police give a time lead," he adds.
No matter in which direction the development goes - to bracelets or pendants, the same technology is always used, as in the vehicle location.
So to combine the location function with the GPS system (just like the Navi in the car) and the function of a mobile phone that reports the current position.
The army has so many ignition cords that one could wrap all of the Czech Republic you hold but only two years
The Czech army has bought 445 kilometers of ignition cords, with explosion sets being lit.
In the year before, the Ministry of Defence had already delivered 224 kilometres of ignition cord to the army camps.
It is reassuring to know that the armed forces have taken care of 225 years.
The problem is just the durability of the ignition cords - two but at most four years.
The army bought the ignition cords from the stock company STV Group, i.e. 40 million crowns.
In his justification for purchasing this huge amount of ignition cord, the General Staff MF DNES replied that the soldiers would consume 60 kilometers of ignition cord each year.
According to research by army pyrotechnics, who spoke to MF DNES, this statement shows that the entire army has to carry out an extremely intensive pyrotechnic training every year - from all the generals and officers of the Army Commando, to the secretaries.
Minister of Defence Alexandr Vondra and Army General Vlastimil Picek not excluded.
Only in this way could the considerable annual consumption of 60 kilometers of ignition cords be justified halfway.
By the way, this length corresponds to 25,000 detonations.
But even so, these army stocks would be sufficient for more than ten years.
However, if the old rule of experts applies that for the training of each new professional soldier, two meters of ignition line, then the army has created a soothing stock for the 225 years already mentioned, even from the point of view of the increased need of pioneer and special units.
Recently, soldiers from the rapid deployment brigade complained to the Minister of Defence Vondra that they had almost no more cartridges for handguns, so that shooting exercises of missing funds were severely restricted.
Not to mention the lack of underpants.
"I don't know why they're buying such a lot of ignition cords from us."
But that's their decision, they'll know what they need."
"For us, the army is a good customer, whom we as a dealer want to meet as far as possible," says the sales manager of the STV Group Jan Děcký.
Jan Pejšek, spokesperson of the Ministry of Defence, founded the purchase of hundreds of kilometers of ignition by covering the army for at least ten years with this "munition".
However, Jan Děcký of the STV Group speaks only of a four-year service period of the ignition cords and police and army pyrotechnics only two years.
"In the event of perfect storage, the four years mentioned above are probably possible," one of them admits, but he wants to remain unnamed, so as not to be accused of criticizing the army.
After the period of use, any ammunition must be thoroughly tested whether it is still reliable and not endangering the lives of the soldiers.
But these tests are not for nothing, but they cost more money.
Another argument of the Ministry of Defence is the quantity discount for the 445 kilometers of ignition line.
"They cost us sixty percent less than last year's 244 kilometres delivery," Pejšek spokesperson tells us the position of the buyers of the Ministry of Defense.
Only for comparison: The annual consumption of fire cords by pyrotechnics from the police, liquidating the ammunition from the Second World War or the Soviet Brother Army has been barely 1,500 meters for a few years.
And the police always order only those quantities of this ammunition that they can consume before the end of the period of use.
Even because of the safety of the pyrotechnics, the possibility of flexible purchases of more modern and thus also reliable ignition cords is kept open.
The Ministry of Defence has huge problems with the liquidation of tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the Warsaw Treaty when the two hundred thousand people of Czechoslovakia prepared for their campaign for the Rhine.
According to pyrotechnicists who spoke to MF DNES, the Czech armed forces expect the same problem in a few years to liquidate hundreds of kilometers of old ignition cords, which they have bought so "favorably" today.
To date, I have had the contacts I have won thanks to the competition.
The winning position in the "Small Businesses of the Year" competition helped Lukáš Pytloun sell the franchise of his hotel.
The winner of the last year's competition "Small Businesses of the Year" was Lukáš Pytloun from Liberec.
The story of his success seems like a film scenario.
Lukáš Pytloun liked to travel.
Only abroad did he realize that Liberec lacked good accommodation options at reasonable prices.
From the savings of his vacation work abroad and with the help of a bank loan he created a house with five apartments.
Considering that he was then a university student in the sixth semester, this was certainly a courageous undertaking.
"The price-quality ratio at that time annoyed me and so I tried to do something about it," says Lukáš Pytloun.
He rented the first reconstructed apartment to foreign workers.
He immediately invested the entire profit back into the house, which he then converted step by step to the pension with 54 beds.
Since then, he has managed to open four pensions, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of more than 300 beds in Liberec in just seven years of business activity.
The most comfortable of them was the four-star "Pytloun Design Hotel" until recently.
This year another first-class hotel was added.
"We have just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tisé, to which we sold our franchise concept and other people interested in the franchise of the Pytloun hotels have already signed up," says the entrepreneur Number One of last year.
"Too much of this license sale for the operation of hotels had just won the competition "Entrepreneurs of the year", Mr Pytloun acknowledges.
The victory has brought him greater fame, yes popularity in Liberec and the surrounding area.
"People recognized me on the street, often they even congratulated me after, and I have to say that did really well," he recalls.
I really recommend to all those who want to do something to participate in this competition.
You don't have to win at the same time, any visualisation is good.
He says that he still benefits from contacts and acquaintances that otherwise would not have come at all.
"I still have regular business relationships with some people I met thanks to the competition."
In his opinion, the fame associated with the success is also a little similar to each of his employees.
And that's where he's on the seventy.
"I note with them greater loyalty and pride that they are part of something that is given general recognition."
I really don't see this as just personal success, no, that's the result of the good work of all of us."
"My name has just come to the fore," says Lukáš Pytloun modestly.
I wish my successors a quieter year than we had in Farmet
The victory euphoria was quickly replaced by the consequences of the crisis.
Thanks to his determination, Farmet has the worst behind him.
The price for the first place of the competition Vodafone Company of the year last year received Karel Žżárský, the company owner of Farmet.
At the time, the jury appreciated the efforts he made to stamp a company out of the ground from the small tool building in Česká Skalice, making hundreds of millions of sales.
"I can say that this appreciation not only encouraged myself but also all my employees and strengthened our self-confidence in the fight against competition," says the previous year's winner.
At the beginning of Farmet's company history, the effort was made to do something useful.
And when the state offered a small workshop for rent to his father Karel Žʼárský as compensation for the property seized by the Communists, he did not hesitate for long, let his career in the company in which he had been employed until then sit down and founded his own company with a few comrades of his father for the production of plastic tubs.
A short time later, they began to focus on vegetable oil presses.
Within 18 years they have become the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in Central Europe.
But only through the success of the mentioned competition and its mediaisation has it also entered into the consciousness of non-professional publicity.
"Not only do our customers now perceive the Farmet brand much more intensively, but our foreign partners also began to work with a company that has achieved the greatest possible success in their country," says Karel ŽŽárský.
The last year at Farmet, however, was not just about victory euphoria.
The assessment was based on the economic results of the company in 2008 and part of 2009.
And in 2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of tool construction products.
The crisis, which shook even less citizens at the time, but above all companies, reached its peak - many companies were forced to stop their investment projects and restrict the purchase of new facilities and technologies.
"Of course, we couldn't escape this situation."
"The sales went down by 40 percent, we had to limit production and even resort to redundancies," explains Karel Žćárský
Such unpopular measures are sometimes required by a viable undertaking.
However, it managed to get the situation under control and keep the company in black, even with less profits than before the crisis.
In one case, the company was not willing to make ends meet - in terms of investment in research and development.
"From the grant we built a research and training centre, we strengthened our presentation at international trade fairs and won major awards at domestic exhibitions," says Žēárský.
Everything shows that we have overcome the crisis.
Sales are growing again and with them also the number of new employees.
"I wish the new winner a lot of joy in winning - but in a quieter atmosphere," says Karel Žćárský.
An opinion poll that clears up with absurd rules
The opinion poll on the "absurdity of the year" is for the fourth time part of the entrepreneurship competition.
Some crazy rules have succeeded in getting out of the world.
The questionable winner of the next year's opinion poll "Absurdity of the Year" has developed the obligation to create documents on authorities that are available online.
Thus, more than a third of not quite four thousand voice-delegating entrepreneurs decided.
For example, the social security administration requested a paper extract from the trade register, even if the official could have called him through two mouse clicks.
Thanks to the opinion poll, this is changing.
"The Czech social security administration will no longer require extracts from the trade register in the case of checks by social security payers," said ČSSZ Jana Buraňová, spokesperson.
The purpose and purpose of the opinion poll "absurdity of the year" is to review all regulations and regulations, to meet the businessmen in the Czech Republic and to remove the stupid ones.
This year, for the fourth time, this is part of an entrepreneurial competition organized by the Czech Economic Newspaper (HN) and enjoyed growing popularity in the public.
If last year the three thousand people participated in the vote, it was already four thousand this year.
No wonder, because there are still a lot of legal obligations that serve only to hinder business activity.
"For example, as far as the number of income tax forms is concerned, we take a leading position in the world," observes Karel Havlíček of the Czech Republic's association of small and medium-sized enterprises and commercial operators.
Simplification of entrepreneurship has been the declared objective of all governments in recent years.
However, the situation in the Czech Republic has hardly improved in comparison to the world.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic has 74th rank in terms of business conditions, compared to the previous year, with an eight-place lower ranking.
The competition Absurdity of the year was first announced in the year and takes place each year according to the same scenario.
Anyone can report administrative and bureaucratic nonsense from April to the end of the competition at the end of September.
For registration, the web address www.firmaroku.cz. Afterwards, the organiser of the competition selects seven candidates for the "anti-preis" and lets the public vote on the web pages www.firmoku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
It wins the absurdity that most votes get.
For this year's opinion poll, more than a hundred regulations and regulations have already been notified, more precisely 105 meaningless.
The tips come not only from entrepreneurs, but also from professional associations and journalists.
For example, among the nominated "finanlists" of the competition are provisions that maintenance vehicles have to pay for motorways and highways tolls or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets have to set up every two years.
The list of this year's "Sevens" is published on the competition pages.
The announcement of the competition at the beginning of November at the Prague Wenceslasplatz is part of a happening, in which regularly also personalities of political and public life participate.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodová, the director of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Commercial Operators of the Czech Republic and Petr Kužel, the President of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic, were at the height of the competition with the party.
"Where the state throws the businessmen between their legs, there can be no real economic upturn, so my goal is to remove at least thirty paragraphs each year that unnecessarily make business more difficult for entrepreneurs today," said Martin Kocourek, Minister of Industry and Trade.
Efforts to create senseless orders from the world are effective.
In 2007, people most frequently disturbed entrepreneurs' obligation to report to the commercial office on the site of their permanent establishment three days in advance the intention to go with an exhibition stand to an exhibition or Kirmes.
This obligation has been abolished by means of an amendment to the Commercial Law.
The obligation to report to the employment office the second largest number of votes in 2007 - the duty to report to the employment office of employees up to 30 days - was abolished by the law on them so-called "Green Card".
And - all good things are three:
For the absurdity of 2009, the regulation imposed on physiotherapists to have a mirror, refrigerator and two personal scales in the office.
This regulation was somewhat reduced by the Ministry of Health this year - the refrigerator duty was abolished.
A new category honors socially responsible companies
Assessment criteria are humanitarian, environmental, educational or sports projects
A new feature in this year's fifth year of the competition of the Wirtschaftsszeitung (HN) is the category "Responsible Company of the Year 2010".
The basic idea of this competition is to promote reasonable and fair business.
"We want to support companies that are aware of the consequences of their entrepreneurial activity on the environment and support socially responsible initiatives," says Patrik Bartholdy, the regional manager of the mobile phone company Vodafon, who announces and guarantees this competition, as well as the competition "rebellion of the year".
To this year's first year of this special subcategory of the main competition Vodafon Company of the year registered companies for which success is not the only long-term goal.
The story of each of them is extremely inspiring and offers enough material for an independent article.
Although they are diametrically different on the subject of their activity, their efforts nevertheless have a common denominator - support and consideration.
For example, people with disabilities are concerned about personal problems or the health of their own employees.
Among the fourteen finalists from all over the Czech Republic, for example, the Prague software company Et Netera also appeared, which promotes the creation of non-formal sports teams among their employees, who then participate in numerous tournaments in various sports.
Another example of a responsible company from the Pardubice region is the company Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main sponsor of a foundation fund for disabled children for seventeen years.
A paper factory from Poděbrady also takes exemplary care of its health disabled workers, who make up 70 percent of their workforce, for which she was honored with the title "Responsible Company of the Central Bohemia region" and in the competition Vodafone Company of the year she held third place in this region.
In the Olomouc region, MiRyz Soft won the annual accounts, which introduced, among other things, a running working time reduced to an average of 35 hours per week, without a proportionate reduction in wages.
The jury also honoured the fact that the company buys mainly from Czech manufacturers, supports citizens' initiatives in their environment and works according to environmentally friendly principles.
"We strive to recycle as much as possible in order to minimise the impact of our entrepreneurial activity and administration on the environment," explains her managing director Miluše Ryznarová.
The responsible IT company Enlogit from the region of Ústí nad Labem, in turn, is committed to the health of its employees and therefore it has acquired ergonomic armchairs and keyboards for all notebooks, and it also promotes homework among its employees and uses catering services offered by a home-protected workshop in company actions.
"In addition, we support the Foundation "People in Not" which provides concrete assistance to the local Roma community," says Ondřej Suchý, the company's representative.
Last but not least, the activity of the cleaning company "Praní a čištění" from the Karlovy Vary region is worth mentioning, which contributes to their pension insurance to their employees in the form of extra bonuses.
"We provide our employees with contributions to food, work, increase their qualifications and vacation," says Josef Strapáč of the construction company Czasch from Bruntál, the winner in the Moravian-Silesian region.
All district finalists of the Vodafon Company competition of the year were automatically notified to the category of responsible company of the year, which answered the questions of the questionnaire attached to the application and sent it to the organizer by 15 August at the latest.
Incorrect or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were excluded from the evaluation by the organiser.
"If the representatives of the competing companies left the questions unanswered, they were excluded from the competition "Responsible Company of the Year", but in the main competition Vodafone Company of the Year they were not disqualified."
"A separate application only for this competition is not possible, as it is only a subcategory of the main competition company of the year," explains Karel Goldman of the organizing agency Bison & Rose.
Pilsner Bodenfonds - Police arrests in a public tender
In the building of the Land Fund in Pilsen, the anti-corruption police have taken arrests in the last few days.
The local media entrepreneur and real estate dealer Luboš G. was handcuffed by the detectives.
The latter had allegedly tried to manipulate a public competition just taking place in order to deal with restitution claims in such a way that the land offered in the competition belonged to a concrete interested party.
This is supposed to have paid Luboš G. half a million for it.
"At that time, I can only confirm that the police are persecuting a person in a public competition for the crime of fraudulent machinations," said Antonie Zelená, chief of the Pilsner Public Prosecutor's Office of the newspaper "Právo", who is unable to provide further details regarding the ongoing investigations.
24 hours later, the 46-year-old entrepreneur was released by the police.
In what way he could manipulate public competition, one can only speculate about it in view of the sparse official information.
The spokesperson of the ground fund Lubomír Černá pointed to the question of Právo that the police had actually made arrests in the Pilsner subsidiary of the ground fund and this during a public competition.
"It was about a client and nothing about one of our employees," she said.
According to the public competition, Ms Černá had the correct designation "Request for the supply of claims for the transfer of land under the Soil Act" and would take place in cases where several applicants show interest in the land offered.
"These persons offer a higher value of their restitution claims to be paid by the transfer than the declared value of the property."
"In line with the claims offered, the order of potential purchasers is determined, and then the Land Fund transfers the property to the person with the highest offer," explains the speaker of the Fund.
Luboš G. obviously had information available, who had signed up for the request and since he himself was a legitimate person, as he had purchased a number of restitution claims, he offered a real estate interest that he would withdraw from the competition.
Obviously against a fat payoff.
That would also be a sufficient explanation of why he had such a large amount of money in his arrest.
Luboš G. already had too good contacts with Pilsner Bodenfonds in the past.
He also played a role in the Causa of the former head of the Land Fund Václav Sankota, which was prosecuted for issuing land in replacement refunds, to which site decisions had already been made on construction projects.
At that time Luboš G. acquired land from the Land Fund, for example, land intended for the construction of public roads, more precisely where the construction of the access magistral to the commercial area Borské pole was planned.
Later he exchanged these very cheaply with the Magistrate for a house directly in the historical center of the city, which exceeded the value of the land.
At the time, the town hall had to give a heavy heart in order not to endanger the construction project by blocking the plots.
Households' housing costs rise by a few hundred monthly
From January onwards, households will not only have to expect higher costs for all types of energy, but also higher water and wastewater charges, and for district heating and some locals rents will also grow.
As of January, families will have to pull several hundred crowns out of the wallet more monthly than before.
Electricity is up to 4.6% more expensive, gas by 2 percent and more, and in some cities up to one tenth more will have to be paid for water supplies, and in some places district heating supplies will also be expensive.
The price of electricity alone costs housing households several hundred crowns more each year.
Strong electricity prices have been reduced by all major suppliers, which means that the clear promotion of electricity generation from renewable sources, in particular from photovoltaic plants, is due.
While gas is only getting relatively expensive, it is precisely when people have to heat the most and have the highest consumption.
Here too, a few hundred crowns can be expected per year.
While electricity and gas are becoming more expensive throughout the Czech Republic, prices for district heating vary from city to city.
Especially larger places plan price increases.
For example, the households in Pardubice and Hradec Králové will have to pay up to 50 crowns per month for district heating, more than 1000 crowns per year for families in Liberec.
The inhabitants of Prague, on the other hand, are threatened with 9 percent higher water and wastewater charges, in the event that the city increases the infrastructure rental.
If the rent doesn't change, it's only 6.8%.
The price in Prague, however, is still among the lowest in comparison with the whole of the Czech Republic.
In northern Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and wastewater charges are expected to rise by 7.4 percent.
Enormous rental price increases can be expected, for example, in 140,000 rental apartments where the so-called rental regulation will be abolished from January.
For example, the housing company CPI Byty, which owns 2500 apartments in Ústí nad Labem, plans to increase rents by a hundred percent from January onwards.
If you do not agree to this increase in rent, the company wants legal interests.
The regulated rents paid today in nearly 300,000 apartments are expected to rise by more than 10 percent next year.
Czech children are drinking themselves with Fernet and Rum beer is out - it just seems too slow
Fernet, Rum and Vodka, except for a good whisky that was stolen from the house bar by the father.
These are the drinks, after which drunken Czech teenagers under fifteen need to be treated most frequently.
No exception are children who have to sleep their hangovers repeatedly in the hospital.
This is reflected in the experience of doctors who are confronted with similar cases in the reception of the children's departments of clinics.
"Bier or wine are completely out of fashion, because it just takes too long to get drunk."
"Today's trend is clearly hard alcohol," said Právo Luděk Pelikán, the head doctor of the Children's Department at the Central Bohemian Hospital Hořovice.
"Whisky, if the father succeeds in avoiding a bottle from the house bar, and if not, at least Fernet or Vodka.
"Wodka has the advantage of mixing it with Juice, he doesn't smell so strong," explains the chief doctor.
The spokesman of the faculty hospital Motol Eva Jurinová gives him the right.
"Most often it's about Fernet or Rum."
"This is today's alcohol trend, especially in primary schools."
"Sometimes it was also about Slibowitz, which is taken away from home," said Ms. Jurinová.
According to Chef Pelikán, thirteen-year-old or fourteen-year-old drinkers are not an exception in the hospital admission.
In front of the hospital in Hořovice, which he has been working on since this year, he worked for ten years in the Paediatric Department of the Motol Hospital, where the ambulances delivered drunken students from nearby and far.
"A girl had to be hospitalized four times."
"She started her career at the age of 12 when she was first delivered with 3.5 per mille of alcohol in the blood and in combination with "extase", the doctor described a particularly serious case.
"She was in the exhibition grounds in Holešovice at some dance party."
"The interesting thing was that her mother didn't seem strange that her daughter didn't come home for 48 hours," the chief doctor wonders.
It is precisely the lack of interest of parents or their incredible tolerance when starting with their own offspring that is considered to be one of the main causes of the growing alcoholism of children.
According to experts, it is not a matter of genuine dependence in the true sense of the word.
"Alcoholism is a long-standing chronic dependence on alcohol and all associated phenomena, and this is not the case with these children."
In those who repeatedly enjoy alcohol, a negative family-social background is usually characteristic," explains chief physician Pelikán.
According to the Spokesperson of the Motol Hospital, Ms. Jurinová, about forty drunk children were sent to the local Department of Child and Youth Medicine by mid-November.
However, only the cases of severe alcohol poisoning, which required hospitalization, are included in the statistics.
Intoxicated children who are taken home after outpatient treatment by the parents or, where appropriate, by the police are not registered.
In addition to the cases where children drink only one bottle of schnapps in the school bench, there are, in Mr Pelikán's view, three annual amplitudes, which are a hundred percent dependent: Walpurgisnacht, New Year's Eve and the end of the school year.
"The latter for two reasons - either because of grief over the bad witness or because of joy on the holidays."
"On Walpurgisnacht, I've already experienced seven drunk children at once in the recording," says Dr. Pelikán.
Paradoxically, a drunk child who spends the night under medical supervision is better off than a child who only has to fight an unpleasant cat the next day.
The headache the morning after, which is caused by dehydration and glucose deficiency, can be eliminated in the hospital with a liquid infusion with glucose and nutrients that the organism lacks.
"They are clearly better off, because after the "fine" experience in the evening, they wake up with good mood without hurting anywhere."
"They're just a little confused about where they are," Dr. Pelikán admits, sometimes perverting the patient's good mood by counting on them the cost of the treatment.
Because the transport with the truck and the night in an acute bed is good and likes a few dozen crowns.
"I used this as a means of education once and for all, when I predicted the children at the visit, what their drunkenness cost, and that it may happen that they have to work all the holidays to earn the money for a single such fete," added Dr. Pelikán.
In his opinion, however, the health insurance companies do not intervene in regress procedures to require the parents to pay the costs necessary to cure the drunk children.
Two training aircraft L-159 for the first time in foreign hands - in Spain
Two light fighters L-159 out of a total of five, which the Czech Ministry of Defence has exchanged for the Casa C-295M transport aircraft, flew on Tuesday to Seville City, where Spanish aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS is located.
It is the first time that machines of this type are owned by a foreign army.
They were seen abroad only at maneuvers or flight shows.
This is about the flying two-seater L-159T1, which was operated by the Czech army.
The remaining three aircraft are L-159 single-seat.
These are still preserved in the Aero Vodochody, the intermediary of this business - the company Omnipol - took over last week.
According to Jan Pejšek, spokesperson of the Ministry of Defense, when she physically departs the aircraft from Vodochody.
The L-159 single-seat fighters were separated from long-term aircraft, without further deposits and investments by the Ministry's department.
"The double-seat L-159T1 were exchanged in current state and appearance," said Pejšek of the newspaper Právo.
He added that the army would not have to do without two-seat fighters, as the Ministry of Defense signed a 200 million contract with Aero Vodochody in May 2009 for the conversion of four superfluous L-159 to a two-seat version.
A new plane took over the army in July, the second wants to take over until the end of this year.
According to Pejšek, EADS has committed itself to putting the fighters into the equipment of one of the NATO countries.
"The contract clearly states that the EADS company is L-159 aircraft customers and that it is intended to train NATO pilots.
"It is therefore up to the customer how he realizes the matter," Pejšek said.
The business newspaper (HN) had previously reported that the Spanish government had no interest in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 against a transport aircraft Casa and the purchase of more aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns had been approved last year by the government of Mirek Topolánek.
At the time, the Ministry of Defence had not issued a tender procedure for purchasing, but had addressed EADS directly.
At the time, the Office argued that this exchange would support the future export of the L-159 abroad.
The Czech army bought out Aero 72 machines, of which only 24 were used, and the rest wanted to sell them.
By the way, the purchase of the Casa aircraft should also have a legal follow-up.
The European Commission has sued the Czech Ministry of Defence to the European Court of Justice for the reason that it should have chosen the aircraft on the basis of a whole-European invitation to tender and not by a single manufacturer.
The army has already taken over three aircraft Casa, the last to land at Kbely Airport within fourteen days.
A longer finger than ring finger means a lower risk of developing cancer
Men whose index finger is longer than the ring finger are clearly at lower risk of developing prostate cancer.
This is the surprising result of a study published on Wednesday by the British Journal of Cancer.
This is supposed to be related to the mirror of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our results show that the relative length of the fingers can serve as a simple test for the risk of prostate cancer, especially in men up to sixty," said the co-author of the study, Ros Eeles, professor at the cancer research institute at the University of Warwick.
The finger could help to determine which men should necessarily undergo a prostate cancer test, especially if there are genetic risks or other risk factors, such as family health stress, Mrs. Eeles added.
During the period 1994-2009, she and her colleagues in Britain persecuted more than 1500 prostate cancer patients, but also 3,000 healthy men.
In more than half of the participants in the study, the index finger was shorter in the right hand than the ring finger.
For these men the same probability of prostate cancer as for 19 percent of those men whose ring and index fingers were equal in length.
However, in men whose index finger was longer than the ring finger, this risk decreased by 33 percent, in men to 60 percent even by 87 percent.
The ratio of the length of the two fingers mentioned, which are already in the prenatal age, clearly reflects the different mirrors of sex hormones to which the child was exposed in the uterus.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer index finger.
Previous research has shown that testosterone in particular accelerates the growth of prostate cancer.
Václav Pačes, a leading Czech geneticist and former chairman of the Academy of Sciences, said ČTK that this study was well-known to him, yet he did not consider the relationship between the finger length and the cancer risk to be "full".
Czech Republic in the snow - D1 and D5 are locked
Just like most of Europe, the Czech Republic is also under a snow cover on Thursday morning.
On the streets and walking trails there is mostly stuck snow, the winter servicers were on the axis all night long.
The D5 motorway between km 89 and 90 towards Rozvadov is closed due to some accidents of trucks and cars and also the D1 at Brno "stands" towards Prague.
This was said by Novinky.CZ, the dispatcher of the Central Auto-Moto Club (ÚAMK).
At kilometre 91, a truck crashed, and at kilometre 93, two trucks collide, and in this accident there are injuries.
There are also a few cars in the street trench.
There are also problems at kilometers 185 of the D1 motorway towards Prague.
Here, too, two trucks came together.
The drivers should drive right behind Brno at kilometre 190 or drive over Brno and drive at kilometre 182 at the village of Kývalka.
This is because there are kilometres of traffic jams.
An accident happened on the D11 as well, right on the way to Prague.
In Prague itself there is a several centimetres thick snow cover and the thermometer shows minus seven degrees Celsius.
Autocolons form, for example, in the Prosek district, and the Štěrboholská road is completely blocked.
The safest transport is definitely the metro.
The trams run with delays, for example on the line between Karlsplatz and Friedenplatz.
At eight o'clock in the morning, the Prague crisis staff will meet.
There are also problems with the railway and airfield.
The Czech state railway had to cancel seven quick train connections because of snow removals.
For example, there are problems on the route Prague - Kralupy or Prague - Beroon.
Travellers should be aware of the current situation.
Ruzyně Airport has been closed until 5 a.m. on Wednesday 11 a.m.
Most roads in southern Moravia are only accessible with increased caution.
Around Vyškov there are three side roads completely unpassable, in the vicinity of Brno there are some snow-coverings and in the vicinity of Blansko one is forced to use snow milling on some higher roads.
One of the most affected areas is Výškov.
There are still three streets completely blocked: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Šaratice - Milešovice.
Here, too, you will have to use snow milling to clear the snow.
When they become reusable, they can't be estimated so far.
In the Hodonín region caution is recommended in the area of white carpathians.
On the streets, which can only be spread with inert scatters for nature conservation reasons, lies a snow cover up to five centimeters thick, led ČTK.
In the Czech Republic, from two to ten centimetres of new snow fell, most in northern Bohemia - in some places up to 18 centimetres.
In the Moravian-Silesian region, up to 15 centimetres of new snow fell.
In the Czech Republic, however, it slowly stops snowing.
American soldiers have a new "intelligent weapon".
The American troops have used a new "intelligent" weapon in Afghanistan for the first time, known so far only under its code name XM-25.
The generals hope that this new automatic weapon will influence the conflict with the Taliban there and shift the power ratio to their favors.
The new weapon is something like a super-precise gun.
Their projectiles are directed to the goal by laser with a safety of only a few meters.
The special calibre 25 mm shots, designed for this gun and containing highly explosive explosive explosives, work practically like small grenades.
The shots can be programmed in such a way that they can explode not only when impacting the target, but at any point in their ballistic trajectory.
That is, you can use them against an enemy who is hiding behind an obstacle - a wall or in the trench.
It is usually not protected from above, so the murderous steel splinter rain from above can easily put it out of battle.
According to Richard Audett, who participated in the development of the XM-25, the new gun is the first infantry weapon to use "intelligent" technologies.
"The soldier is basically doing this: he visibly sets the target and sends out a laser beam that determines the distance, so he wins a precise point of view, after which he corrects the angle of increase, then he only needs to press off.
"Let's say you measured 543 m."
"When pressed, the gun loads up and shoots the shot at the distance 543 meters plus minus one, two or three meters.
400 jobs are relocated
The Fujitsu Group moves its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July of next year, 400 employees will move their jobs from the former office building at the Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to the Astro Park.
The Japanese group Fujitsu moves its branch to Bad Homburg in Frankfurt.
According to the industry giant specialized in computers and their maintenance on Wednesday, 400 women and men will move their workplace from the former office building at the Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to the Astro Park in July next year, which is a large office complex on Lyoner Straße in the Frankfurt district of Niederrad.
A speaker from Fujitsu explained that in the medium term there should be another 100 jobs of the group, which have been distributed to the region so far.
The rental offer had been extremely attractive, and the large space offices in the Astro Park would be better able to address the operation of the employees.
Fujitsu had also been a tenant in Bad Homburg.
The responsible managing director Bernd Wagner said, "With Frankfurt-Niederrad we have found a central location with excellent infrastructure".
The excellent connection to the airport was particularly important for a global company like Fujitsu.
The recent move of an important company within the region yesterday brought joy to the winners and disappointment among the losers.
The Frankfurter Wirtschaftsdezent Markus Frank (CDU) said that once again a "Global Player" had been won.
That's a "great commitment to the location."
Fujitsu passed the city that the settlement was an important impulse for low wheel.
The Bad Homburg mayor Michael Korwisi (The Greens) regretted Fujitsu's decision.
The city had been informed of the intention by the management early on.
"Of course, we offered our help to the company," said Korwisi.
However, the friendly contacts could not have changed the difficulties of the computer manufacturer with the owner of the property at Marienbader Platz.
In the end, economic reasons had given rise to the problem.
Now it is about preventing such a long emptiness in such a prominent place.
"I hope the owner and landlord of the building is cooperative."
The house used by Fujitsu at the town hall square so far and the neighboring "Small Vertical" were among the most controversial construction projects in the spa town with the rest of the buildings at Marienbader Platz ten years ago.
As a joint project of the city and a private project developer, a new city entrance emerged between the station and the town hall, which caused criticism both because of the massive construction of the previously partly used as a parking lot and the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the investment consulting and rating company Feri, the software manufacturer for travel distribution systems, started Amadeus, as well as the then Siemens-related computer manufacturer Fujitsu took over the houses.
The buildings used by Fujitsu were purchased in 2006 by the Frankfurter Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Group together with the Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund and sold one year later to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
Fujitsu, who is home to Tokyo, is the third-largest IT provider in the world.
For example, it provides computers and servers and also provides the necessary service.
The branch in the Rhine-Main area is one of the largest in Germany, but Fujitsu counts far more employees in Munich.
The subsidiary Fujitsu Technology Solutions from Bad Homburg is moving to Frankfurt-Niederrad, and the other subsidiaries at this location are supposed to be Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
They rented 7000 square meters in the Astro Park office building.
In the twenty-year-old complex - the name refers to its star-shaped layout - the Central Association of Electrical Engineering and Electronics has its seat, among other things.
Amazon locks off server - threats against Assange
Wikileaks are increasingly in distress.
The Internet service provider Amazon has banned the disclosure platform from its servers.
Perhaps there is political pressure behind this after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomats.
Wikileaks founder Assange is said to be staying in England.
The Wikileaks exposure platform is increasingly under fire in the United States.
The Internet activists lost access to their previous American server and are now looking for an Internet home in Europe.
The prominent American Senator Joe Lieberman called in other countries and companies to the boycott of Wikileaks.
And Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is on Interpol's search lists, is supposed to be in the UK after a newspaper report.

"Free speech in the Land of the Free," the revelation activists informed Twitter on Wednesday (local time) via a short news service.
Recently, the Internet company Amazon had banned the Wikileaks documents from its servers.
The Internet activists had recourse to the Amazon Web Service (AWS) when publishing secret diplomatic depes in order to handle the high numbers of access to the documents.
On Twitter Wikileaks continued: "Excellent - our dollars are now being spent to employ people in Europe."
If Amazon had such a problem with freedom of speech, "they should stop selling books."
Amazon stopped using its servers by Wikileaks after Senator Joe Lieberman's employees had made investigations, the TV station CNN reported on the Liebermans office.
The president of the Senate Committee on Home Affairs threatened Amazon with a boycott, reported the British Guardian.
"I would have liked Amazon to take this measure earlier in view of previous publications of classified information by Wikileaks," said the Senator.
Lieberman called for the platform to be banned from using servers in other countries as well.
"Wikileaks' illegal, immense and unrelenting approach puts our national security at risk and threatens life around the globe," said a communication from the non-partisan Senator.
"No responsible company - whether American or foreign - should help Wikileaks in his efforts to spread stolen material."
Wikileaks founder Assange, who is sought for rape by the authorities in Sweden, is on Interpol's search list.
According to a report by the London newspaper "The Independent", the 39-year-old Australian in Great Britain is staying in Scotland Yard.
The Internet activist has always referred to the investigations in Sweden as the intrigue of its opponents.
Wikileaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London there were threats.
"There were even calls for a murder of Julian Assange."
That's why Assange is justly afraid of his safety, said Hrafnsson.
The Wikileaks founder will therefore remain hidden.
Hrafnsson apparently responded to statements from North America.
In America, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, had demanded that the responsible for the Wikileaks disclosures be charged and executed for treason.
In Canada, an advisor from head of government Stephen Harper - obviously ironic - said on television, Assange should be "killed" and Obama could "use a drone".
Between the White House and Assange there was an exchange of beats.
The spokesperson of American President Barack Obama, Robert Gibbs, called it "a ridiculous and absurd" that Assange had demanded the resignation of Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton, if she is responsible for recently announced espionage requests to diplomats.
"I'm not quite sure why we take care of the opinion of a guy with a website," Gibbs says.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more significant than its one website."
The American Government is now putting the protection of its databases to the full test.
As Special Representative, the Vice Director of the Centre for Anti-Terrorism Measures, Russell Travers, had been appointed, the White House announced.
Travers is responsible for developing "necessary structural reforms" that have become necessary following the disclosure of news reports by Wikileaks.
The White House also wants to check the ways in which the entire government exchanges and protects information.
The U.S. government also announced its intention to ensure the safety of dissidents and activists, should they be threatened by the Wikileaks publication.
"We've done everything we can to get in touch with them," said Philip Crowley, spokesperson for foreign affairs.
"We are ready to protect them if necessary."
Ice University
Ice confectioners are prepared for better seasons at Gelato University near Bologna.
The three-day basic course for future Gelatieri has the largest entrance and visitors from all over the world.
Where does the whole ice cream come from?
From the Gelatier and the Gelataio.
The gelatier, in German a little ancient of the ice confectioner, manufactures the cream according to all the rules of Italian icemaking art.
The gelataio takes the ice cream out of the refrigerator with a spatula, paints it in the waffle and then sells it.
To know that, you don't have to drive to Anzola dell'Emilia in Bologna Province.
But if you want to know more about ice cream, don't pass the "Gelato University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The Ice University set up the manufacturer of ice cream machines in 2003, so that the ice cream from its machines will meet the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day basic course for future Gelatieri has the largest entrance and visitors from all over the world.
However, there are also multi-day special courses around chocolate ice cream and internships in the in-house ice cream section.
Some dream of a new career in the Midlife crisis, others just venture on the smooth ice of their vague longings.
This time it is 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents - from Brazil over Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, California art teacher, loves the slow food movement and wants to offer a European quality product in the industrial Ice Cream country in the future.
Anke from Berlin is a business consultant and after years wants to put something in his own hands in a nervous job.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an ice cream parlour in Cairo.
A man from Malta and one from Brazil wants to improve the quality of the ice cream in their bars - and Canadian housewife Julia comes because her children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro gelatiere Luciano Ferrari first explains to the participants the ideal properties of the perfect ice cream.
The decisive thing is not only good taste, but also silky suppleness and good consistency.
Luciano does not forget about his training, but also about the creaming of the national and even southern superstructure: "Italian Gelato is simply the best - and then there is a lot of romance."
The first step towards production seems quite simple.
Luciano tilts the basic ingredients milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large mixing device, which heats everything to 85 degrees with an electronic program and then immediately cools to four degrees.
Then he turns a cock on the machine, and comes out a pasteurized white base cream, basis for all types of ice cream.
The lecturer is immediately being stormed with questions: Can ice cream only be produced with natural substances without a stabilizer?
How can you let your own desire for experimentation run free?
Luciano warns against being led astray by the spirit of time.
Those who speak of ice cream "only from natural ingredients" may have used stabilizers anyway - usually a natural product, such as guarcoon flour.
Of course, you can also make ice without a stabilizer, only then it has to be sold within one day, otherwise it falls into itself, and the customer bites on loud ice grains.
Certain variations on the base mass are allowed.
It's getting more exciting with the flavors.
For the taste in the ice cream, Maestro Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients you buy in the fruit department or at the sweets of the supermarket.
There are also powders and pastes.
"The suppliers will all try to turn dozens of aromatized additives on you."
"But you should just experiment."
Either with the fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or just in the ice cream from the white base, which becomes a yellow cream with eggs and with cocoa powder as the basis for all kinds of chocolate seductions.
Now the students are allowed to go to the ice machines.
Luciano lets them produce four different types of vanilla, chocolate, mocha and hazelnut ice cream - with or without eggs in the base, with more or less vanilla aroma or other natural additives.
The same experiment is also subject to the fruit ice cream varieties.
More flavourings, more fruit-purée - tasteful is not necessarily better.
Hazelnut ice cream does not necessarily taste nutier when it contains more hazelnuts.
The most popular Kiwi ice cream manufactures the working group that uses more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
Only a balanced mixture highlights the taste of a gelato correctly, says Luciano.
Icemaking is a calculation task: if peach puree is used with a lot of sugar, the sugar content in the basic recipe must be reduced.
An extra portion of sugar is needed for lemon ice cream.
Luciano pulls out a device with which it determines the sugar content of the fruit varieties (winzers measure the oechsle in the grape must).
Luckily, tables facilitate the computing.
Making ice cream no longer requires as much physical use as it used to be.
Not only the device helps for the automatic production of the base mass.
There is also a device in which the finished ice mixture is creamy beaten at the same time and cooled at minus temperatures.
In spite of all automation, small pans do not fail.
The Brazilian Gustavo clutters himself and his classmates from top to bottom with fruit purée when the oversized bar mixer gets out of control.
"In every course," says Maestro Luciano, "it's just a matter of time until something like this happens."
Controllers in the twilight
The European Food Authority, Efsa, has been undermined by the plant experimenting industry.
The expert group Testbiotech, which understands itself as an independent institute for the impact assessment of biotechnology, now makes this accusation.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we have documented it well," said Testbiotech CEO Christoph Then in Munich on Wednesday.
The head of the Efsa expert group on genetically modified plants, Harry Kuiper, and another Efsa expert have been under contract for years with the Ilsi Lobbyist Association.
It is paid by companies such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper has played a major role in the Efsa test regulations for gene plants and is therefore in a clear conflict of interest, Then criticises.
The Efsa regulations are literally identical to the Ilsi position papers, thus concealing the handwriting of the industry, which is to be controlled by the Authority in the Italian Parma.
It is already the second time that Testbiotech has had a conflict of interest.
A high-ranking Efsa manager, for example, was recently without a requirement or a transitional period to the Swiss agricultural group Syngenta - and had thus changed sides.
Central German Broadcasting (MDR) has also recently revealed human connections between controlling EU authorities and industrial lobbying, which has made the Federal Environment Agency and the EU parliamentarians very belonging.
However, the Efsa cannot recognise any conflict of interest.
A statement states that all serious data can be accessed, including those of industry, as long as they are of high professional quality.
The experts working for Efsa are not required to have any contacts with the industry.
But you'd have to reveal them.
Kuiper awarded his work to the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the USA.
This calls itself a neutral forum for experts from science, industry and politics - including risk assessment for biotechnology without lobbying.
In the case, independent experts such as Then criticise that genetically modified plants are currently approved in animals without any feeding attempt and that the response of gene plants to environmental influences is not tested.
"We want to know what, for example, is doing genetically modified maize on the field," says Then.
Present practice is to test only isolated proteins, but not the whole gene plant, which does not provide reliable results.
"If you don't look for the risks, how to find them?" asks Then indicting.
That's what Angelika Hilbeck sees.
The scientist has been researching genetic engineering since 1994 and is currently working at the Zurich University of Technology.
In this area, as in the USA, industry is increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists in Europe.
Therefore, there are hardly any more researchers who have not been interconnected with corporations.
For companies critical studies would normally not be published.
"Industrie controls safety research," says Hilbeck.
The trail of the stones
Uli Gsell also got some, a total of about 400 kilos.
On Monday evening he was standing at Stuttgart station, the tuba on his back.
It was demo.
It snowed.
The story is known: in September the excavators had been hit and had begun to break off a large piece of the north wing.
The Stuttgarter Welt was no longer the same: Zig thousands demonstrated against S21, the billionth downfall of the station.
When it came to the construction stop, most of the wing was in ruins.
Broken in 6000, 7,000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a soft coarse stone, built between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
He's secured some of the pieces.
"These stones are relics."
"You mustn't disappear."
He swarms: "A cheaper and poor stone, simple and earthly."
When he saw one, he smelled like a cigarette agony.
He doesn't know what he'll do with the crumbs yet.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell too.
The trail of Stuttgart's stones leads to a forest near Tübingen on a former ammunition depot of the French army, where Manuel Rongen built his stone empire.
The 44-year-old is dealing with old stones.
He's bought all those who hit the demolition in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they were ground into gravel or disappeared into the landfill," he says in his office, a wooden box that was once a watchhouse.
He was insulted and threatened when he was told in September that he had bought the remains of the North Wing from the demolitionist.
But he talked to the S-21 opponents for days.
And he told them he couldn't do anything for the demolition.
And if it happens, then it would be the most reasonable if the stones were used further.
Some 200 S-21 opponents then took one of the 80 kilos (on average), unit price 6.50 to 14 euros.
As a reminder, but also in the hope of being able to return him during a reconstruction.
500 tons had bought Rongen, 25 large trucks.
About half are still stored in the forest, the rest is sold for a long time.
Garden owners, landscape gardeners, cottage farmers.
They had come from everywhere and had towed away what luggage and trailers could carry.
The Stuttgart stones of the blast have long turned into "mauerle" or into restrictions of herbal beds.
"In fact, this stone is nothing special," says Rongen.
"Wasn't the political component."
He climbs into his field car, makes a tour through his 20-hectare empire.
He studied and quit law, later biology, then he became interested in computers and eventually became stone dealers.
And stone lovers.
It stores 40,000 tons of stones.
From all over Germany he carts his treasures together.
He says he's the largest stone dealer in the Republic.

There are artificially carved sandstones in the snow.
"They once belonged to the Dresden Marienbrücke," he says.

It goes up the way through the forest.
He points to a pile of red sandstone, formerly part of Karlsruhe Railway Station.
And on.

Once the square was part of the gallery of the Stuttgart Neckar Stadiums.
All over the snow Stones and stories, Cannstatt Travertin from the Stuttgart Police Presidium, reddish granite from the Cathedral of St Blasia, Tuff from the Heilbronn hospital.
What work, what effort, what sweat.
When Rongen thinks about how the stones were cut by hand earlier and moved with simple bottle trains and ox carts, he becomes quite apprehensive.
"It would be a scandal if you were to shredder such a thing."
He didn't become rich, he didn't get rich at all.
But 14 people employ the stone dealer today, and in addition, up in the forest stone knife, a sculptor, a forge, a glassblower and a garden farmer have settled down.
"We're working hard, but it's satisfying," says the residuer.
He'll have to go to Cologne soon.
There are stones to save, too.

There's a lot of rush on the buffet.
16 students rush around salmon rolls, tomato soup and sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the Autobauer Volkswagen invited the mechanical engineering and design students to a workshop.
In a kind of idea competition, they are supposed to become involved with VW developers about the car of the future - and get to know Volkswagen quite by the way.
In the competition for the smartest heads, many companies now go into the close competition and, like VW, rely on cooperations with universities.
Their mission: to recruit the most talented graduates as early as possible in the lecture halls before they enter the labour market and are recruited by others.
And because the universities do not publish any statements about the achievements of their students, one tries to find and bind the exceptional talents in practical projects.
On the second day of the workshop at the TU Braunschweig, the car group recruits the talents.
A young lady from the personnel department distributes ballpoint pens, rubber couples and folders with VW logo.
She tells the hopeful young talent about internship programs and student jobs and shows them ways to the group.
Nico Selle from TU Braunschweig manages the project with VW.
He sees the advantages for both sides: "The students come into contact with the industry and gain experience."
"VW can at the same time get to know students, look at interesting candidates and think about who would be in question as an employee."
Such cooperations, Celle said, are not unusual.
It is new that the students are being struggled so offensively.
"Otherwise, the focus was more on the technical project," says Selle.
The fight for the fresh graduates will probably become even harder.
In many sectors, companies are no longer able to select their employees from a large number of applicants.
But they have to be admirable and particularly high-skilled workers.
Especially graduates from the engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiating position.
According to the Association of German Engineers VDI, more than 40,000 engineering posts remained unoccupied in October.
And the so-called engineering gap will get even bigger according to VDI forecasts.
For the financial audit and consulting company KPMG, Roman Dykta is going on the talent hunt.
He organizes elaborate recruiting events such as the KPMG race, a kind of modern carpentry hunt, in which participants have to find their way through GPS coordinates.
Eight promising students want to send the company across the United States next year.
By the way, participants can look at KPMG branches and get to know the company.
Anyone who is allowed to join will decide in advance in two selection rounds.
Only the cream de la cream of the many candidates flies to the USA.
According to Dykta, the guns are getting bigger when cutting and stabbing around the high potentials at the universities.
"We want to take the race out of the crowd."
"Only a simple sailing session was too little for us."
For talent hunter Dykta the bill seems to go up.
"We still have contact with all participants of a similar action last year."
"Some are about to graduate and want to apply to us soon," he says.
In addition to the direct bust on the campus, small and medium-sized companies also go to the Pirsch in a classic way at professional fairs.
"We are trying to reach graduates at trade fairs."
"Either way at Intersolar," reports Sitha Stübe, head of personnel at Solar Technology Manufacturer Solarworld.
The Bonn company employs around 1500 employees in Germany.
Stübe knows about the problems of young people.
At present, 35 posts are on the company's website.
"It's just very difficult to occupy vacate positions."
"It takes a lot of time and money," she says.
Another way is to contact the university professors.
Solarworld cooperates with various universities, such as the University of Freiberg.
"The professors give us clues that we can do internships or write his diploma thesis."
Expensive promotions are not available at the solar specialist.
For this purpose, the company tries to advertise with other advantages: personal atmosphere, flat hierarchies and easy communication.
"That is often not possible for a large group," says staff manager Stübe.
Money no longer plays the leading role in the job search.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good climbing opportunities are other crucial factors.
Solarworld took 55th place among the 100 best employers in Germany in a study conducted by the Great Place to Work Institute.
The Institute creates an annual Best List of German Employers.
To this end, employees are asked how satisfied they are with their work and their job environment and are looking at the framework conditions for employees.
Head of staff Stübe hopes that the placement will also have a positive effect on job seekers.
"I think applicants are looking especially at external assessments about a potential employer," she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler from the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies who want to build up a good reputation as employers with a long-term strategy.
He advises his customers to be more authentic.
And that means, according to warriors, especially internal measures.
"The best way to make yourself attractive as an employer is through your own employees," he says.
In the sector jargon, the internal employer is branding, i.e. employers' branding within their own workforce.
"Satisfied employees are the best ambassadors."
If you treat your people well and identify them with the company, they would advertise for their employer all by themselves with friends and acquaintances.
"This is like a game with gangs," says Kriegler.
Obama stops new oil drilling
There will be no new oil drilling in the coming years off the Florida coast in the Gulf of Mexico.
The government in Washington has issued a similar ban - thus finally withdrawing its previous plans.
New drillings remain prohibited even off the Atlantic coast.
This was announced by Interior Minister Ken Salazar on Wednesday.
Triggering the strict ban, which will apply at least for the next five years, is the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon drilling platform in April.
Before the disaster that cost eleven workers lives and led to the largest environmental disaster in the US, President Barack Obama, under pressure from the opposition and industry, had signalled his willingness to allow new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
The proponents want to reduce the U.S. dependence on oil supplies from abroad.
Whoever bears the responsibility for the devastating oil plague in the Gulf is still not fully explained.
At the heart of the criticism is the British energy group BP, which is faced with billions of demands.
A committee of inquiry on Obama's behalf will present its results during December.
In October, Interior Minister Ken Salazar lifted the drill stop that had been suspended after the explosion.
Following that, several oil companies had applied for new drilling projects.
With more stringent controls and stricter safety regulations, Obama and Salazar want to exclude a new disaster.
At the moment, the competent control authority, which has been criticised after numerous accusations of corruption, is being fundamentally reformed.
In parallel, Obama announced that it would close lucrative tax loopholes for the oil and gas companies.
Industry is now publicly warning that the volume of funding in the Gulf would be significantly lower than in the past due to stricter regulation.
"The government's plans are the biggest brake on the growth of the oil and gas industry," says the result of a recent industry survey by the consultant BDO - even before the ban on drilling from Wednesday.
The American Energy Alliance also complains about the insecurity in the industry: "No one knows what exactly will change with the regulation."
Investments in new funding projects would be delayed until further notice - at the expense of growth.
Ogoniland burned down
The water in the rivers is oil brown, it smells like at the gas station: billions of liters of crude oil have destroyed nature in the Nigerian Ogoniland.
People live on theft, corruption and illegal oil cooking.
Celestine Akpobari thinks it's good.
"Don't bother," the eco-activist reassures the journalists: "You will still get enough oil sludge in front of the lens today."
The 37-year-old Nigerian has followed the attempt to highlight a boy wading into the water's chest with the abrasions surrounding him: In the rainbow-colored water gloss, the scene seems almost pretty.
It can't be seen that brown oil swabs float beneath the surface.
In the past, she had probably collected shrimp here, says Esther Badom on the banks of the Bodo Jetty River.
Meanwhile, the sluggish flowing waters have been completely dead.
Five years ago, vast amounts of crude oil poured out of a brushed pipeline into the huge wetland.
Fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo now have to row for six hours to reach fishy waters: the Ogoniland, located in the heart of the Niger Delta, is considered one of the worst polluted regions in the world.
On the journey through the mangrove swamps crossed by river runs, the entire extent of the destruction becomes obvious.
Instead of bright water, the motor boat stirs up brown broth, who dips his hand into the water, pulls out oily fingers.
The roots of the mangrove trees rise like black lacrits from the ground, causing sad palm trees to hang their wedel.
Bird swarms, as is usual in wetlands, are far from being sought: As soon as the outsider is silent, the former paradise spessical calm, which smells like a gas station, spreads.
"What's happening here is ecological warfare," says Celestine Akpobari Kerk: "We live in constant danger to health."
The comparison of war is appropriate.
The settlement area of the Ogoni is a battlefield that has been fighting for decades: more than 60 years ago, the first explosions from Europe invaded here, where the first resistance was organized in the 1980s with the later executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, where the shell group had to stop its production in 1993 because it became too dangerous for its oil workers.
Today, the company is still denied return to Ogoniland: While more than two million barrels of black gold are pumped out of the entire Delta region of the three-fold size of Switzerland with over 5000 wells and 7000 kilometres of pipelines a day, the oil fields in Ogoniland are broken, too unstable is the company's position.
Every few hundred meters of steeling frames like bizarre sculptures from the water: "Christ trees" are called the heads of the holes much too tender.
They are up to 50 years old, most corroded to the mark.
Again and again, such a drill head breaks apart, says Akpobari, then a constant stream of crude oil runs into the water.
More than two billion liters, according to experts, have flowed into the Delta's ecosystem in 50 years: Year after year the amount of oil they pushed into the sea 21 years ago in the field of the supertanker "Exxon Valdez" - one of the biggest environmental disasters in the history of mankind.
Whoever is responsible for the ongoing eco-GAU is disputed about it.
While the shell-groups of sabotage and organized oil theft account for more than 90 percent of pollution, environmentalists see brushing drill heads and lick pipelines as the main cause.
Shell set much lower safety standards in Nigeria than usual in the world, U.S. scientist Richard Steiner accused the Group in 2008 of having only the rate of defects on the lines "of a lot higher than elsewhere".
In a place that from a distance looks like an abandoned oil-smeared workshop under the open sky, the mangroves appear: they are fragmented naked and oil-smeared to the neck.
Among many barrels, which are partly connected with tubes, partly randomly scattered on the site, a fire flares: an illegal little refinery.
In the barrel the crude oil is heated over the fire for several hours, explains Michael, the head of the group.
First, petrol penetrates the pipes into the receiving pot, later trickles out at the end of the line kerosene and finally diesel.
Thus Michael and four employees produce up to four barrels of diesel of 300 liters a day: "This brings us 34,000 naira" - around 22 dollars.
Delta residents use the chronic fuel scarcity in the largest oil state in Black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
With just under 40 Euro cents per litre of ridiculously low diesel prices, the illegal cooks can still undercut the price: because they get their raw material for free.
It comes from "Bunkers", who tap the pipeline network across Ogoniland: According to experts, the country loses at least 16 million liters of crude oil a day.
However, only a missing small part of the intermediate raw material is illegally refined: the lion's share of organized criminal networks, including politicians and high-ranking military, are being filled in tankers and are killing him on the world market.
The debate, whether the environmental disaster is more due to the local population or the lax production mode, considers the activist Akpobari to be purely academic.
"If oil companies had not been perceived as invaders and had not destroyed the fishermen's livelihood so thoroughly, there would be neither sabotage nor theft and illegal refineries."
In the meantime, however, the relationship between Ogoni and Shell was so destroyed that only a deduction of the Group would be called into question: "Maybe other nationalities like the Chinese are more likely to prove themselves."
There Michael gets nervous.
"Highest time for you to disappear," says the muscular oilman.
"Every minute the soldiers can come."
If the illegal oil refiners are caught by the special unit of the armed forces, they are not threatened with arrest, but with a painful lubricating money.
The soldiers, like all Nigerians, also want to benefit from the raw material.
"This damn stuff has brought our country to the dog in every way," says Akpobari.
Investigators discover dangerous faults in A380 engines
The A380 seems to have a major security problem.
In investigating an emergency machine, investigators have discovered a possible fault of construction that could lead to a "catastrophic engine failure".
The Qantas airline now wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
The passengers of the emergency Qantas-Airbus at the beginning of November apparently had much more luck than they had previously known: the Australian Air Safety Authority has identified a major safety problem with the engines of some A380-machines in its investigations - and is now warning of a possible fault of construction.
The potential defect would have serious consequences: in the case of an oil hose connection, it could cause fatigue cracks and leaks, according to an opinion of the Atsb Authority published on this Thursday.
This could have led to "a disastrous engine failure".
These were produced by Rolls-Royce in 20 aircraft in the A380 series.
Among them is the Qantas-Airbus, which was forced to land in Singapore on November 4.
The Australian airline has now taken legal action against the British turbine manufacturer.
It filed an action with an Australian Federal Court in Sydney, which allows it to take further legal action against the company.
Qantas Chief Alan Joyce said his airline would demand compensation for the incident at the beginning of November.
When the engine was burned, parts had dissolved and the surfaces had been damaged.
Rolls-Royce made an oil fire the cause of the damage.
After the incident, up to 40 engines have to be replaced worldwide.
The Australian investigators announced that they would carry out further safety tests on the superjumbos equipped with the engines concerned.
The safety recommendation is the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, said ATSB spokesperson Martin Dolan.
The safety problem had been considered to be sufficiently important to inform all concerned.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas-had the airline had kept its A380 fleet on the ground for weeks.
Singapore Airlines left about three of its eleven A380 temporarily on the ground.
The Lufthansa replaced the engine as a precautionary measure in an A380.
The double-story aircraft is the largest passenger aircraft in the world.
Landwide snowfall triggering traffic chaos
Germany all in white: Over the night snow fell all over the country.
On many roads there are chaos, trains and flights.
In car accidents, at least three people were killed.
Winter freezes Germany: At icy temperatures almost all the republic is snowed on Thursdays at night - which leads to traffic chaos in many places.
In the north and in the east there are partly 15 centimetres of thick snow.
On several motorways and many roads traffic is severely restricted.
On the A7 at Flensburg, the winter service was in continuous service, but was not finished with the constantly re-surging snow.
In addition, violent waves swept across the Baltic coast.
On the Baltic coast of Schleswig-Holstein, the Federal Office for Maritime Navigation and Hydrography (BSH) expects storm floods with water levels of 1.2 meters above the standard level from the morning.
In Saxony, snow-coverings on the motorways and federal roads led to considerable problems.
According to the Meteomedia storm centre, alarm levels in Saxon Switzerland were therefore high - the highest level at all.
In part, 30 centimetres of new snow fell there, fresh and strong winds caused dispersal.
There were several trucks and cars stuck there at night.
In Saxony-Anhalt, the police also reported major disturbances on the streets.
On the A2, snow and wind led to steady traffic and congestion.
The A4 and A9 were affected by the snowfalls in Thuringia.
According to Deutsche Bahn, significant disturbances occur in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and in the north of Bavaria.
Snow on the tracks, fallen trees on the tracks or destroyed overhead lines and distances are the main problems.
In Saxony, long-distance transport from Leipzig to Nuremberg had to be stopped.
In the Thuringian Saalfeld, an ICE had to stop his journey to Munich.
The 165 passengers were supplied by firemen and rescue workers with wool blankets, food and drinks on the train.
Snowwinds swept across the streets.
At large German airports, the snowwinds lead to numerous flight failures.
In Munich, according to a speaker of the flight information centre, a number of cancellations have already been reported.
According to a Fraport speaker, 40 flights have already been flights in Frankfurt am Main.
The winter service is in continuous service.
Although only a few stranded passengers are at the airport, they still have almost 400 field beds ready.
There were accidents on many roads on Wednesday night.
In the evening, a truck driver was killed in the collision with a train on a railway crossing in Ostholstein.
The driver was slightly injured.
A similar accident occurred near Nuremberg due to snow-covered roads: Here too a truck was recorded on a railway crossing because the vehicle remained stuck.
The driver died.
On the train four passengers were injured - the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was therefore blocked until the morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after crossing on a smooth road with her car near Aschaffenburg.
However, the meteorologists have a good news: Although the snow will still be loose and powdery and will therefore already resonate with light trees.
But the wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea is hit by rapid and stormy winds.
However, it remains very cold - locally up to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for their twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to separate itself from its landmark: According to a newspaper report, the Moneyhouse is looking for buyers for the two office towers at its Frankfurt headquarters.
The property could contribute up to 500 million euros.
The Deutsche Bank has just made its Group headquarters pretty: The twin towers in the Frankfurter Bankenviertel have been modernised; the bankers have now been allowed to return to their old workplace.
But now the financial group apparently wants to recover the costs of renovation - and is looking for a buyer for the two high-rise buildings, as the Financial Times Germany writes, calling on a spokesperson.
The speaker did not mention reasons for the planned sale.
"We always check whether it makes more sense to own or sell real estate and then rent it back," he said.
Thus, Germany's largest credit institution is relinquishing its headquarters after a short time.
The bank had not taken over the double towers until mid-2007 for 272 million euros from the investors of an in-house fund and subsequently elaborately renovated.
Energetic conversion took the data to around 200 million euros.
A sale would probably bring the bank a lot of money.
According to industry experts, the newspaper's towers now renamed "Greentowers" are estimated to be around 500 million euros.
Whether the buildings are sold again to a fund owned by the bank or to an independent investor is still open, said the speaker.
Thousands mourn for dead mates
More than 10,000 people in New Zealand have thought of the spilled miners who have been declared dead after several explosions in a mine.
Still, the bodies could not be recovered because the security situation in the accident shaft is still precarious.
About two weeks ago, a violent explosion had occurred in the Pike River Mine near the city of Greymouth.
29 miners between the ages of 17 and 62 were buried under days.
A probe had been dropped into the accident shaft, but had not discovered any trace of survivors.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and subsequent explosions, no rescue forces could descend for safety reasons.
After the second violent detonation, the authorities and experts had assumed that there was no chance of survival for the pals.
The bodies could not be recovered so far.
Now relatives and friends remembered the dead with a commemoration.
Ten thousand people had gathered in the bright sunshine in Greymouth on the South Island of New Zealand.
They'll be silent for two minutes.
In honor of the scattered miners, 29 tables were set on which helmets, lamps and the names of the pals were to be seen.
Images and personal items, including clothing and surfboards, also found their place here.
In front of the government buildings of the country the flags blew on half mast.
New Zealand had hoped that the miners would return to the surface "from the depths of the earth," New Zealand's Prime Minister John Key said to the participants in the commemorative celebration.
"But they never came home."
He could not conclude with the death of his son as long as he had not seen his body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was thrown into the pit.
In addition to the Prime Minister and family members of the victims, several foreign diplomats participated in the commemorative celebration.
At the first explosion on 19 November, miners of British and South African origin had also been spilled.
Rescuers began to extinguish a fire inside the coal mine on the South Island of New Zealand.
As soon as the explosive gases were dissipated, the start was to cool down the burning temperatures inside the mine, Police President Gary Knowles said to journalists.
Hell, warriors!
Does Splatter fit into the art cinema?
The director Nicolas Winding Refn reopens old genre boundaries with his fighter-epos "Walhalla Rising".
What audience might the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have thought of when he shot "Walhalla Rising"?
A captive Viking warrior with only one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his punishments and, with almost superhuman forces, turns his opponents around in a row - sounds ideal for young male spectators in search of bloody action, precisely because our hero likes to use rabid killing methods and even rips his enemies from the living body when he has bad moods.
On the other hand, Eineye does not say what he is actually called a word about the whole movie, and the other figures can at most tear one or two sentences or a few painful death cries.
Otherwise, silence is silenced and engulfed in Scotland's creepingly beautiful hilly landscape, which the Viking world of about a thousand years ago offers the scenery.
Ideal for adults with interest in existentialism and very quiet camera rides.
Nice, if a movie has several target groups, only if they exclude each other.
Director Winding Refn has been regarded as a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino since his wild and stylish drug dealer trilogy "Pusher", but he refuses to make his works accessible to the Arthouse with a little more humor to the mainstream or a little less brutality.
Most of the art cinema friends are likely to be deterred from the spraying brain mass and the genders.
The action fans die of boredom at the latest, when eye-eyes, for free-to-interpretable reasons, with a force of violent Christian missionaries by ship go to Jerusalem and lock an eternity in flaw and fog before the team appears to arrive in America and remain silent there.
No wonder that "Walhalla Rising" has not found a cinema rental in Germany and has now only appeared on DVD.
This is particularly a pity because of the magnificent pictures, but also because behind the pretentious to blood-throwing facade there is a sometimes exciting piece of cinema that has deserved some attention.
In this film it is not about dialogue or a stringent action, it is all atmosphere, a filmed fever room.
And there's no escape for the audience.
Refn hardly gives him a moment of relaxation, and with his icy pictures and the dark trance-like soundtrack, he slowly gets his throat, but above all with the inconceivable hatred that beats him from the hearts of the figures.
Only a little blonde boy, who stands by the eye faithfully, preserves something like innocence, all the others are driven by anger.
Most of all, the one-eye hero whose motives are never explained, but who becomes enemies and temporarily allies from hell at some point, possibly the ambassador of the devil himself.
He means corruption, perhaps only for those who are already corrupt.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that can be hated and admired to anger, excitement and amazement.
An experience.
Mysterious Earthwork
The nuclear energy authority IAEA has new references to a secret nuclear programme in Syria.
However, the country refuses to comment - it still allows controls.
Around midnight from September 5th to September 6th, 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighters attack a mysterious, cube-shaped building in Syria.
It is located on the banks of the Euphrates; the next larger city, 30 kilometers away, is Dair as-Saur.
Its name appears in documents from the International Atomic Energy Authority (IAEA) when it comes to the reactor that Syria has supposedly built in the square with the help of North Korea, hidden in a valley that flows from the electricity.
According to a briefing by the US foreign secret service CIA of late April 2008, the reactor commonly used under the name of the nearby town of el-Kibar would have been well suited to produce plutonium - from which nuclear weapons could be built.
For other purposes, however, the technique from the fifties is hardly good.
The CIA presented a video presentation with blurry satellite images.
By computer animation, she demonstrated where which components of the reactor should have been before destruction, which is a reduced copy of the North Korean model from the Yongbyon nuclear center.
In addition, she presented photographs showing the building from nearby or even the interior.
The reactor was standing shortly before the commissioning, it was said, but not yet equipped with fuel rods.
Today, more than three years after the bombardment, hardly more is known than at the time, yes, the puzzles became larger over time.
The former U.S. President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that the CIA was quite sure, before the attack, that Syria was building a reactor in el-Kibar, but hardly saw any evidence that there was "an active nuclear weapons program" in the country.
Some secret servants in Europe prefer to be more cautious and speak only of an "opportune reactor", even if they think the CIA presentation is "plausible".
They lack hard evidence, as is the IAEA.
When asked how sure he was to have a reactor in front of him, a high UN diplomat in summer only answered lapidar that the IAEA had "just enough material to ask questions".
Although the Syrians were in a hurry and planned the site thoroughly, the rubble of the alleged "unused military building".
However, in June 2008, an IAEA team under the former chief inspector Olli Heinonen found traces of uranium produced by humans in el-Kibar.
In addition, through a Member State, the IAEA received satellite images of commercial operators from the time immediately after the attack, which are likely to be more meaningful than those presented by the CIA.
However, these recordings cannot be obtained on the market because the unknown client - perhaps Israel - bought them exclusively.
Therefore, the IAEA cannot independently verify its authenticity.
Syria has always claimed never to have operated a secret nuclear program or built a reactor.
The uranium stems from the Israeli weapons, said Damascus.
However, after analysis of the particles, the IAEA rejected this as unlikely.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss it - as has the satellite images.
In addition, it refuses the controllers a second inspection in el-Kibar and access to the ruins of the broken building.
But Israel too is silently silent.
"We will never comment on this," recently Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, who was in office at the time of the attack, reaffirmed the official position.
Thus, the investigation of the case since June 2008 slows down and "is increasingly developing into a serious problem of credibility for the authority", as a high Western diplomat at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna admits - after all, there is a serious violation of the nuclear blockage agreement in the area over which the IAEA is guarding.
The IAEA clearly sees as key to progress in reconnaissance three other institutions that are supposed to be "in a functional connection" with the alleged reactor - and, unlike this one still exists.
The inspectors have not so far disclosed what equipment it is, what function it has or what it makes appear suspicious.
According to information provided by the Süddeutsche Zeitung, they are internally referred to at the IAEA as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, in turn derived from nearby cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) has identified these locations and identified a complex of buildings at Masyaf on satellite images, which is most likely one of the suspicious objects.
It may be located in or directly next to a military base - precisely with this justification, Syria refuses access to the three places.
In Vienna it is said that the Syrians feared a fishing expedition - that the IAEA was sent by the U.S. to search out military equipment.
Because the nuclears had become aware of the facilities through a tip of US intelligence services.
The IAEA has indications, including satellite photos, that material has been transported back and forth between the three places and the square at the Euphrates.
A high Western diplomat in Vienna said that at least one of the plants could be "related to fuel production".
However, there is "no indication of sensitive activities", i.e. uranium enrichment or reprocessing; processes necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The reactor type is operated with uranium which is not enriched.
But where the uranium should have come from and where the plutonium for the bomb should have been separated from it later, there are at least plausible presumptions on these central questions.
It is also unclear whether ruins that could store valuable traces were stored in the three places.
As if the hundreds of truck loads had disappeared from the ground, no one wants information about where the rubble has remained.
The salt mine al-Tibni, located just a few kilometres from el-Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates, which Syria examined in 1998 for its suitability as a radioactive waste storage site, is considered unlikely by the IAEA.
The former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley recently linked her to the reactor in an analysis of satellite images for Jane's Intelligence Review magazine.
However, recordings from the orbit show that Syria took groundwork in the three suspicious places and removed large containers after the IAEA had requested access.
This can be a coincidence, but has hardly contributed to eradicating the suspicion.
In addition, it is said in diplomatic circles that the IAEA has spent several months developing a plan of inspections there that should allow Syria to keep any military secrets - only the effort shows how great the interest of inspectors is.
In fact, Damascus also rejected this proposal.
Had Western diplomats in Vienna a year ago complained that the reactor had been destroyed, therefore the matter did not have a high urgency, for example, US ambassador Glyn Davies has been involved in so-called special inspections for a few months, one of the sharpest means the Vienna nuclear authority has to enforce controls.
IAEA chief Yukiya Amano, who would have to propose these inspections, has already spoken of "an option for which I am open in the future" but he still hesitates.
There is a high risk in this way: on the one hand, it takes a majority in the IAEA Board of Governors, and some of the 35 countries represented there are anything but looking for an escalation.
On the other hand, like a diplomat gives thought to: "What if they find nothing at all in the end?"
Love in times of war
Since Angelina Jolie started working on her still nameless debut in the summer, there's been trouble.
The script she wrote herself, a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a Serbian man.
Much more you don't know about it - but that's enough for restlessness.
The rumour, the woman, a Muslim, falls in love with her Serbian rapist during the war of Yugoslavia.
Bosnian women's associations immediately protested, and some shooting days planned in Sarajevo were moved to Hungary in the short term.
Meanwhile, the film has been shot in Hungary and in post-production, but it is still being protested in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the Organisation of Female Victims of War wrote about the UN refugee aid agency UNHCR to Jolie and demanded a meeting with the actress, a Bosnian newspaper has now reported - Jolie is himself Ambassador to the UN Refugee Relief Agency.
She is not a diplomatic - she offered women a meeting in Hungary weeks ago, but this is what they rejected.
The meeting had to take place in Bosnia, says Hasekic.
There was no love stories in rape camps, and Jolie's attitude towards the victims tells her enough about the script.
According to the UN Refugee Aid Agency, her organization has recommended to release Jolie as an ambassador, reports the Guardian.
What exactly did Jolie write for scenes?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which got her script to read, after a few moments gave a film approval for Sarajevo - it is not quite clear why Jolie did not come anyway.
The young author herself pretends that she does not pursue political intentions with her film, has worked hard in the Yugoslavia conflict, wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and give a voice to all the parties involved.
However, it remains vague in its contents.
This is how a second synopsis of film on the web, which sounds quite different: the lovers knew each other before the outbreak of the war and meet again when she, a Bosnian Muslim, is dragged into a Serbian camp in which he works as a guard.
Which sounds a lot different than the "rape victims" variant.
That Jolie's film actually starts before the war - so much is safe.
The pressure on her, Jolie said, was "unfair and based on misinformation."
Now, all you can do is bring peace to Hollywood hackers: by illegally putting the script on the net, as so many have before.
Nothing like away here.
This evening it's finally going around for the Irish again.
No trace of grief.
The home team dominates its guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA too much.
Fans jolly for joy at cracking loud music, stamping with their feet.
The Bailey Pub in the Southern Irish Cork trembles because the players throw table tennis balls over a three-meter distance in beer cups - and meet.
"Bierpong" is called the bizarre spectacle, to win there are 500 euros victory premium plus tickets to Las Vegas for the Beerpong World Championships in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy; this shrill drinker and the restrained computerist, that doesn't really fit together.
And yet the 26-year-old tries to amuse himself, to divert himself from the drilling question of what the future will bring.
His plan does not include playing fun in Las Vegas, he will hold interview interviews in New Zealand in January.
"I have a multi-feeling feeling," he says.
"It's so far away from home and I don't have a job there."
After all, his girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland - "she had ruck, toiled her wish job as an event manager, maybe a good sign," says the young man and smiles.
Because of bad prospects at home, two of Tanner's three siblings have been looking for their luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a job as an IT consultant in London.
The boys go: It looks like the tanners on the island in many families.
100 000 Irish will probably leave the country in the near future, experts from the ESRI Economic and Social Research Institute predict in Dublin.
By 2015, they even expect 200,000 immigrants.
For the small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants a severe loss.
If the forecasts are true, there will be a wave of immigration comparable to that under which Ireland suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of the upsurge, which brought great prosperity to the Irish, Tristesse is once again spreading.
The economic crisis is particularly uncertain of the young, well-trained Irish, for whom up to now only uphill.
Job loss and social decline seemed absurd in the boom years.
Everyone was needed, money was in abundance.
In the meantime, however, three out of ten women and men are under thirty without work.
In the Irish Times, there are a lot of readers' letters from young emigrants who complain: "Everything goes down the stream in Ireland."
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers - but whoever can, will leave and our country will lose a whole generation."
"The last one will turn off the light."
Jura-student Leanne Caulfield, President of the Irish Student Union, sees a gloomy future raising, because the government is merely squandering and the young people no longer have prospects for the future.
"They reduce minimum wages, but they do not have a strategy to create new jobs," says the 20-year-old.
She observes how her fellow students hang from an unpaid internship to the next.
Her greatest concern, she says, is to have to emigrate in four years' time.
"This thought is sad and depressing."
Men like Stephen McLarnon try to occupy the subject positively.
McLarnon organizes the WorkingAbroadExpo, a trade fair that offers an all-round service on work abroad.
"For career starters, work abroad is a great opportunity to take the first steps on the career manager," says the manager.
On his website photos show surfers in Australia and snowboarders in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not a galley service, but it also brings freedom and fun.
How it feels to build something else, Seán O'Donovan has known for half a year.
Because there was nothing to do for the 29-year-old engineer in Ireland, he is now working with 15 Irish colleagues on the construction in Germany.
In Gelsenkirchen they are just moving up a fashion house.
In January it will continue to Hanover or Berlin, to the next project.
His home now sees O'Donovan only rarely, because he makes extra layers to pay off the credit for his home at home.
"The situation is a little crazy," he says, when he first enters the threshold of his house after a long time.
"I earn money in Germany for a house in Ireland where I am almost never again."
He laughs a little shy and goes through cooled-out rooms.
The small house is located in a fine residential area with well-kept gardens, in the entrances parking large, expensive cars.
Together with a sister, O'Donovan bought the house four years ago for 380,000 euros - 100 percent credited.
"There were crazy times, there were simple money without many questions," he says.
Is he afraid the loan might go wrong?
O'Donovan thinks for a while, pours hot tea and says, "I don't have children to feed through and I'm young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start from scratch."
The engineer doesn't like the pain he hears at the moment.
"No one has to starve - our situation is by far not as dramatic as in earlier times here on the island," he says.
"For a while working abroad, that's not the worst thing that can happen - maybe it'll make us feel like Irish only."
He laughs and then tells of his father, who went to England in the last great economic crisis.
"After seven years he was back and life went on in Ireland, quite simply."
Cian Tanner likes this idea.
Leave the future open and just see how life is going elsewhere.
A few years of work in London he's already been behind him and why shouldn't it work well for him and his girlfriend in New Zealand?
One thing is still there, however, that concerns him in these days: the celebration of his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
He's afraid it could end up in a good-bye party.
"Just don't get too many emotions," he says, drinking a big swallow of his beer.
"Well, that sounds scary."
"Let's call it a walkaway, easy, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games."
The Democratic Routine
The democracy movement in Latin America is getting stronger, as is the support of private companies.
Crime is a bigger problem than unemployment.
In many parts of the region, the influence of Brazil is greater than that of the United States.
This was the result of the Latinobarómetro survey, which was conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively in The Economist.
This survey has been carried out regularly since 1995 and thus shows the exchange of views in this region.
Two facts are particularly evident in this year's September and October survey.
First, the good mood in Latin America
Secondly, the growing interest in democracy and its most important institutions.
In many countries on the South American Pacific coast, the democratic movement has increased sharply (see Table 1).
In Peru, for example, where the economy has been growing by about 6% annually since 2002, the number of democratic supporters rose from 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
This trend can also be seen in Mexico, where the economy has been recovering since last year's strong collapse.
But only half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the most populous countries in the region, are convinced democrats, which lowers the regional average (see Chart 2).
About 44% of the respondents said they were satisfied with the democratic practice of their country, as many as last year, but 25% more than in 2001 (Graph 3).
About 34% trust the Congress of their country and 45% trust its government. Both values are similar to those of last year, but show a significant increase compared with 2003 (17% and 24% respectively).
A decade ago, Latin America's economic crises undermined efforts to increase democracy.
This also continued during the global economic crisis, possibly because the countries of Latin America experienced only a short period of recession and recovered quickly.
In addition, the poor were caught by a stronger social network.
(According to reports from the UN Economic Commission for Latin America this week, the poverty rate in Latin America rose only slightly in 2009 and fell again by 32% this year.)
However, there are strong differences in mood from country to country (see Chart 4).
Brazil's strong economy and the popularity of the outgoing President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva are reflected in a widespread thinking of progress.
This is less the case in Mexico and Central America, where the recession has been more noticeable and violent crimes have increased.
Only for the second time since the start of the survey have many respondents in Latin America seen a greater problem in their country's crime than in unemployment (see Chart 5).
Some 31% say that either they or a family member were victims of a crime last year. However, compared to 38% last year, the values fell and thus reached the lowest level since 1995.
The increase in economic performance is reflected in the stronger support given to the private and market economies: about 71% of those surveyed above-regional stated that the private sector is essential for development, and 56% in 2007 (see Chart 6).
About 58% said that only the market economy can make progress in their country, compared with 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of the respondents in Venezuela have maintained this view (and 80% are for a private sector), although their left president, Hugo Chávez, nationalizes many private companies.
According to 19% of respondents (18% last year) Brazil has the largest weight in the region, followed by the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9% compared to 11% last year).
The respondents in Mexico and most countries of Central America, on the other hand, see the most influential country in the United States, taking over this role in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua of Venezuela.
An Electoral Vessel
No one had expected the elections to be perfect in Haiti on 28 November.
However, the facts far outweighed the fears of the electors who rushed to help the affected country.
Overcrowded constituencies, multiple votes, constituencies in the Rinnstein, destroyed polls and intimidation were only part of the problems.
Electoral locations opened with hours of delay.
Many Haitians, many of whom had become homeless by the January earthquake, were wandering around in search of a choice.
Some of them finally gave up.
A dozen presidential candidates, including some alleged top riders, demanded the removal of the election results due to alleged fraud.
Some violent protests took place throughout the country.
Nevertheless, Edmond Mulet, the head of the UN mission in Haiti, referred to the election "as quite good in many matters".
According to a careful statement by observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community "these irregularities, however serious they may be, do not necessarily invalidate the process".
In other words, the show goes on.
The electoral authority, which is supposedly obliged to the unpopular outgoing President René Préval and his candidate, Jude Célestin, will announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
The expected turnoff is planned for January.
There's still hope in the election.
The two leading opposition candidates, the rap musician Michel Martelly and the former First Lady Mirlande Manigat, have withdrawn their initial indifference complaint.
If Jude Célestin, who has only little or no vote at all in the electorate, declares that he is the winner of the election, this could lead to problems.
Due to the cholera epidemic and the fact that more than 1 million of the earthquake victims still live in tents, a small election was feared.
On the election day, many Haitians were prevented by a lack of organization from voting.
Shortly before the start of the election, about 250,000 cards needed for the election were not yet distributed.
There's a lot at stake.
The donor countries consider a legitimate, recognized government an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
The Haitians themselves are of the same opinion.
Home in the middle
In the weeks after your husband's sudden death, Argentina's president, Cristina Fernández, experienced a wave of sympathy that drove her popularity rate up by 20 points to over 50%. That's the highest value since her election in 2007.
However, the fact that you are helping this to re-election next year depends on whether the clearly grieving Cristina Fernández is more compromised than her late husband, her predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner.
The signs are not clear.
Néstor Kirchner, who also guided economic policy after his wife's election, often drew up budgets that did not take full account of tax revenue, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the President-in-Office to issue the extra revenue according to his own opinion.
On paper, the Fernández government lost the majority in Congress last year.
But the opposition is divided and Kirchner's death after a heart attack on October 27 led to further destruction.
Some regime critics from the reigning peronists stood behind Cristina Fernández.
But after chaotic meetings (in which one parliamentarian hit another and others accused the government of bribery), Congress failed to adopt the 2011 budget.
"I will not discuss it," said the President.
The 2010 budget will now also apply to the next year, which will give the President even more opportunity to spend money according to its own opinion.
The economy is running hot: it is likely to grow by up to 9% this year.
The official inflation rate currently stands at 11.1%, but many private estimates - and wage demands from the trade unions - have a value of almost 30%.
Kirchner, who took office in 2003, when Argentina was shaken by economic crises, explained growth and poverty reduction as his main objectives, not inflation reduction.
He refused to cooperate with the IMF, harassed the private sector and cleaned up the National Institute of Statistics and Population Survey INDEC, which subsequently beautiful the official inflation statistics.
Can Fernández now take a more moderate course?
She called on the private sector and the trade union leaders to talk.
According to official statements, wage increases will be limited to 18% next year.
The high world market prices for Argentina's agricultural products have given the economy a strong boost.
But inflation undermined growth by a large devaluation in 2002.
For this reason, Cristina Fernández may want to join Argentina again in the financial sector with the rest of the world.
At the beginning of this year, the government reached an agreement with security holders who had refused the country's earlier re-indebtedness in 2001.
Now Fernández seems to be pushing for an agreement with the donors from the Paris Club, to whom she owes about $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners had always refused a review by the IMF, as is usual elsewhere.
But last month, the Minister of Economic Affairs, Amado Boudou, announced that the fund will provide "technical support" in the preparation of a new national consumer price index, as if it were the first step towards cleaning up the INDEC.
It is not known whether Fernández will be politically active even after the end of her term of office without the support of her husband.
If so, it needs the support of the middle class, which has largely enough of the Churchism.
When the Argentines return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy brought to them will be abducted.
If she wants to win another election, she has to decide whether she is silent and silent in lifting many political decisions of her husband.
Weak applause for China
Taiwan's voters are slowly approaching a closer connection to the mainland.
What does Taiwan think of his great brother beyond the sea narrow?
On 27 November, more than 7.5 million voters were elected, which is 70% of the electorate, to elect mayors and city councils in the five districts of the city. This is regarded as a broad assessment of President Ma Ying-jeou.
By building groundbreaking business relations, including a partial free trade agreement, Ma is itself a symbol of relations with the mainland. His policy has changed the relationship with the Chinese mother country for the first time since 1949.
Ma passed the exam, but only barely.
Although his Kuomintang party (KMT) represents three of the five mayors, she received no majority vote.
Instead, the Democratic Progress Party (DPP), which advocates greater independence from Taiwan, received almost 50% of the votes that KMT received 45%.
In a presidential election, this would have meant problems for Ma.
Since his election two years ago, his party's share of votes has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP even moved into the city councils together with the KMT.
During the election, there were the usual events in Taiwan, such as truck convoys with scratch makers, flag-swiveling mass parades and only sparsely dressed dancers.
There was even the compulsory, mysterious attempt at murder.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan and honorary chairman of the KMT gave a speech on the eve of the election to a KMT candidate,
when a man shot him from the crowd in the face. Lien was wounded and a nearby spectator was killed.
Bizarr is not clear whether the shooter wanted to kill Lien or resolve a dispute with the candidate.
Regardless of that, the attack, according to Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the DPP, has affected the election and brought the DPP into a bad light, which has given the KMT more votes.
Perhaps China was the biggest winner of the campaign.
Remarkably, relations with the mainland have not been discussed.
Instead, the candidates discussed plans for social housing and job creation.
The Taiwanese love their actual independence and reject China's military threat.
For this reason, the KMT does not like to put its relations with the government in Beijing in the foreground.
But this time, the DPP also avoided provoking the anti-Chinese feelings too much.
She responded to the new awareness that Taiwan's economy cannot survive without China.
Ma, for his part, would like to confirm that the majority of Taiwanese support China's policy.
The government in Beijing will continue to pursue its strategy of attracting Taiwan back to the Community with economic incentives.
China immediately sent a negotiator to Taipei to prepare a summit on investment security and medical cooperation.
Surely it also wants political integration, but first of all it is important.
It is preferable to wait until the 2012 presidential elections.
The DPP has now reinvented itself.
Two years ago, she was severely weakened: former party leader Chen Shui-bian was in prison for corruption.
During his presidency from 2000 to 2008, he advocated absolute independence.
But under Tai's rule a new generation of moderate politicians developed and the DPP fights for the voices of the professionals and the youth.
Tsai, as a presidential candidate for the DPP, received great approval, such as Su Tseng-chang under Chen.
Her party now does everything to show that she too is able to establish close relations with Beijing.
Tsai is planning forging ideas as a point of contact between the DPP and China. However, this requires non-prejudicial discussions.
Tsai publicly stated that her party offered a "trustworthy alternative" to Mas a premature approach to China.
Chen seems very angry about this change.
From his cell he said that the DPP candidates had done better to insist on Taiwan's independence.
He even urged Pragmatist Su to renounce the presidential candidate.
Even without Chen's interference, the DPP is hard to choose its potential candidate.
The KMT will have to undergo its own self-analysis.
Mas values are bad, despite rapid economic growth; the KMT candidates wanted to lead their election campaign without him.
The main reasons for his unpopularity seem to be unemployment and the ever-increasing number between the poor and the rich.
According to a KMT speaker, he will remodel his cabinet as well as the local facilities.
The strong appearance of the DPP suggests that Taiwan only supports a limited approach.
At the same time, most Taiwanese people see economic cooperation with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, "there is already no return."
Grammy nominations: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding was surprisingly awarded in the category Newcomer of the year
If you appear at the request of a president, people will notice it.
President Obama himself asked Esperanza Spalding to perform at the 2009 Nobel Prize ceremony. Now, the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer was finally nominated for this year’s Grammy in the Newcomer category of the year.
In view of the fact that Spalding has been a celebrated star since her album "Esperanza" in 2008 in the jazz scene, the nomination appears a bit unusual. However, it corresponds to the Grammy rules according to which an artist may have released at most three albums before the release of the album, with which he became known in the general public.
Her ambitious 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society", is certainly a step forward. And with her swinging voice and a good sense of pop, funk and Latin music, you can compare Spalding calmly with Norah Jones 2003, whose great success comes next in 2003 as a jazz performer in this category of nomination Spaldings.
The album "Historicity" of the Vijay Iyer Trios was also nominated in the category of instrumental albums. This favorite of the critics experienced a huge success.
The competitors Iyers include Moody 4B of the experienced saxophone player James Moody and Positotly of keyboard player John Beasley.
Trombone Shorty, a rogue favourite of New Orleans and a frequent guest in HBO's "Treme", has been awarded in the category of contemporary jazz, where albums by Stanley Clarke, John McLoughlin and Jeff Lorber can be found.
The Secret Societ of the wild Steampunk musician Darcy James Argue was well deserved attention in the category of large group. Thus, he opposes the Billy Childs Emsemble with his chamber jazz and the adventurous Dave Holland and his octet, whose life-ablum "Pathways" is a good example for a bass player as a democratic bandleader.
Grammy nominations: Michael Daughty, Steve Mackey lead in classic categories
The classic nominations for the 53rd Grammy Award contain a colorful mix of musicians and composers from all over the world.
The list of Michael Daugherty's "Deux Ex Machina" for piano and orchestra with five voices, and Steve Mackey's "Dreamhouse", an eclectic orchestral work, with three voices.
Among the nominees with connections to Southern California is the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt with his symphony No. 4 "Los Angeles". This piece was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and premiered in 2009 at the Walt Disney Concert Hall.
The L.A.-based composer Avner Dorman was also nominated for his mandolin concert.
Classical nominations are divided into 13 categories, from orchestra, opera, choir to solo recordings.
In the category of classic producers, five artists were nominated this year - Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Among the nominated classical albums are Bruckner's symphonies No. 3 and 4 by the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty's "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" by the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey's "Dreamhouse" by the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati" by various artists; and Verdi's "Requiem" by the Chicago Symphony Symphony Orchestra and Choir.
In the opera category, Berg's "Lulu by the orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasse's "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho's "L'Amour de Loin" by the German Symphony Orchestra Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin's "The Enchanted Wanderer" by the orchestra and choir of the Mariinsky Theatre; and Arthur Sullivan's "Ivanhoe" by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
As composers, Pärt was nominated for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer" for a Grammy.
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 was premiered and recorded by the L.A. Philharmonic under the direction of Esa-Pekka Salonen at Disney Hall on 4 January.
The 30-minute piece bears the title "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the former oil magnate Mikhail Chodorkovsky, who is in prison in Russia.
Dorman's "Mondolinenkonzert" received a nomination in the category instrumentalsolo with orchestra.
The composer from L.A. claimed that he had written the 15-minute piece specifically for the mandolin artist Avi Avital, who performed the concert with the New York Metropolis Ensemble.
"I used sounds from the Middle East and numerous North African sounds and rhythms," said Dorman in a telephone interview.
The conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the orchestral performance category for recording Stravinski's works with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under his direction.
As instrumental soloists, the pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin, organist Paul Jacobs, violinist Julia Fischer and Harfinist Sarah Schuster Ericsson were nominated.
As vocal soloists, only women were nominated this year, including Anne Sofie by Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Nehrx and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the category Classic Crossover, the soprano Jessye Norman was nominated for her recording "Roots - My Life, My Song".
Mosque in Temecula wins the approval of the Planning Committee
The construction of a mosque in Temecula found the unanimous commitment of the local planning committee after a five-hour, often heated public hearing.
Critics accused the project of promoting both terrorism and traffic congestion.
However, according to a statement made by the Commission on Wednesday evening, the new religious centre will comply with local provisions and become an aesthetic eye-catcher.
"The project is supported by many good people - by Christians, Jews, Bahais, and many others," said Hadi Nael, chairman of the Islamic Center of Temecula Valley on Thursday morning.
"As an American, it makes me proud."
"It shows that justice reigns."
"There are only a few opponents," he added.
"They're only very loud."
"In this valley, wonderful people live."
The meeting began at 18:00 and the discussions for and against the construction of the center lasted almost until midnight, the votes on both sides being fairly evenly distributed according to the press business.
The debate was continued on the newspaper's website.
"There's no longer any America," said a comment.
"It's another planet of monkeys, and the Statue of Liberty is dead in the sand."
"America is at the end."
Planned Islamic centers have also led to protests in other parts of the country, e.g. near Ground Zero, the scene of terrorist attacks on the City of New York on 11 September 2001.
In the Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud called Harmoush for non-violence.
His community with about 135 families has been living peacefully in Riverside County for years, but they wanted a larger and better place than the warehouse they rented together with a water filter plant manufacturer.
The new, approximately 2,300 m2 mosque in Mediterranean style is supposed to have two minarettes and grow up to about 13m high.
It is to be built on the approximately 17,500 m2 plot on Nicolas Road near Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still object to the project at the city council.
Arsenic-resistant microbe could allow new life forms on earth or elsewhere
The discovery of a foreign species of bacteria, which can live on arsenic, among other things, opens up new opportunities for new forms of life on earth and elsewhere.
Although scientists have discovered this unusual bacterium here on earth, it is, in their view, a sign that life is possible even without the elements that have been considered vital so far.
"This organism has two possibilities."
"It needs either phosphorus or arsenic to grow."
"This makes it something very special, although it is almost a kind of 'foreign' form of life," said Paul C.W. Davies of Arizona State University and co-author of the report, which appears on Thursday in the online issue of Science magazine.
To date, six main elements have been considered vital - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur.
However, as the scientists found out, the bacterium in the California Mono Lake grows even further when it replaces phosphorus with arsenic.
"You wonder what else is possible," said the co-author of the Ariel D. Anbar report from Arizona State University.
The discovery is an important step in the search for extraterrestrial life, as scientists must recognize life and its forms, according to Anbar.
The study deals with microbes found on Earth.
The announcement of a press conference, in which no details of the discovery were announced, gave rise to widespread speculations on the Internet that the report could act on the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
This is not the case.
The discovery "shows that organisms can start biochemical processes in other planetary systems with the help of other elements and that the 'standard elements' that we believe are absolutely vital are not necessarily predetermined," said Charles Cockell, Professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute of the Open University of Milton Keynes in the United Kingdom.
Cockel was not part of the research team.
"This work is a novel because it shows that in basic biochemical processes and structures, one element can be replaced by another," Cockell added.
This discovery was not by chance.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon from NASA's Astrobiological Institute, which led the study, chose Mono Lake because of its high arsenic content.
Since arsenic and phosphorous are chemically similar, it assumed that microbes exposed to both may be able to replace one element with the other.
"The toxicity of the arsenic is mainly based on the fact that it behaves chemically similar to phosphorus."
"This makes it difficult for organisms to distinguish one element from another."
"But the difference is so great that arsenic is different from phosphorous. It comes into our biochemical system, where it almost lubricates everything," explains Anbar.
The researchers suspended the GFaj-1 bacterium from increasing arsenic concentration. It adapted and grew.
Although the microbe grows better in phosphorus, it can also survive in arsenic, shows that an arsenic-based life form can occur naturally, either on Earth or on another planet or moon, on which arsenic occurs more frequently.
According to Jamie S. Foster, professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, the idea that phosphorus can be replaced by arsenic is not new, but so far there has been no working example.
Arsen was more common in the early Earth years, she says, so science has assumed that early life forms used it.
"This is a reason for the assumption that life may have evolved differently than in the early Earth age," said Forster, who was not a member of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Health Authorities.
Other stolen exhibition dogs found in Compton
The remaining two of the four exhibition dogs that were stolen in front of a Bellflower motel were found according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff of Thursday.
The four exhibition dogs - two Akitas and two Pembroke Welsh Corgis - disappeared on Tuesday when unknowns stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express-Van, where the animals were housed in front of a Bellflower Motel 6 at night, according to the authorities' statements.
Two of the dogs were discovered on Wednesday afternoon, and the last two on Wednesday evening, explains Steve Whitmore, a spokesman of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
"The good news is, the dogs are up," Whitmore says.
"You're in good condition."
"They were returned to their rightful owners."
Whitmore did not give any precise information about the location of the dogs or the circumstances that led to their discovery.
"The investigations are still under way."
"We don't want to say that anymore," Whitmore explains.
"We're tracking some tracks."
The dog owners Kristina Rickard and David Peek were not available for information on Thursday.
They welcomed their two dogs on Wednesday afternoon in a district shelter in Downey.
Representatives of the sheriff found the van and the two dogs in different places in Compton.
The Akitas Trace, a three - year - old male, and Didi, a 10 - month - old bitch, were unharmed according to the authorities.
But the Corgis Bunny and Peter, who wanted to present Rickard and Peek on the competition this week on behalf of their Japanese owners, remained missing until Wednesday evening.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were on this weekend because of the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship in Long Beach in the city because Trace was to participate in the competition.
As Peek of the Times announced on Wednesday, the other dogs were to participate in other competitions on the days before the AKC/Eukanuba show.
Southern California is a stop on the almost one month tour of the couple from dog show to dog show.
On Monday evening Peek and Rickard checked in at the motel.
They often stay in Motels and park their van in front of their room window.
They took three more dogs - a boxer cub, a Parson Russell Terrier and a Brittany - into their motel room.
The thick Akitas and Corgis stayed in the van because it was cooler there.
They left the window a gap wide, so that the dogs had fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported their car on Tuesday at 6:00 as stolen.
Peek promised anyone who could give an indication of the Corgis a finder’s wage. Microchips for identification were implanted to the animals.
On Thursday it was not yet clear whether a finder's wage was paid.
The lion roars again after judicial approval of the MGM restructuring
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM finally got green light for a new start.
On Thursday, a New York bankruptcy judge officially blessed the "prepared" glauber plan to clear the debt of $5 billion and pave the way for the 86-year-old entertainment company for new movies and television shows.
According to the statements of Thursday, the plan meets the requirements of US bankruptcy law, so that the restart of MGM under the direction of Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, the founders of Spyglass Entertainment, will no longer stand in the way of Barber and Birnbaum.
The number of employees is reduced from over 400 to about 320.
For MGM, Chapter 11 will actually enter into force only after JPMorgan Chase has completed a planned $500 million bond to finance the new MGM productions.
At the moment, a consortium of the investment bank, which itself brings in $75 million, is leading the company. The financing is scheduled to stand by mid-December.
The restructuring of the studio began in May 2009 with the order to the Investmentbank Moelis & Co, the management who fought with interest payments of $300 million/year to help solve their financial problems.
In August, CEO Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO of Enron and restructuring expert, who became known for his work with Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis & Cooper's efforts to solve MGM's financial concerns and pay out the studio's more than 140 believers took longer than expected.
After months of discussions, the parties decided at the end of 2009 to offer the company to buy.
But the auction attracted only a few bidders and no one wanted to pay the $2 billion required by the creditors.
In spring of this year, everything started from the beginning of the MGM team's restructuring plan, which was finally signed by the creditors after months of debate and internal disputes at the end of October.
If MGM has officially survived bankruptcy in the coming weeks, Moelis and Cooper will receive a bonus of several million dollars for their work.
The share for Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, is $9.5 million.
Cooper, who was paid $375,000 a month for the management of the company, received a "success bonus" of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM. This year, the studio released only one film and created a year plan with seven or eight films to be released in early 2012 at the cinemas.
They also plan two films after "Der kleine Hobbit" in co-production with Warner Bros.
The studio needs a separate bond between $265 million and $275 million for its financial share in these two films, to be created under the direction of Peter Jackson.
The investor Carl Icahn, who financed about 18% of the MGM loan, attempted a merger of the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, whose largest shareholder he is.
However, the last negotiations between the two companies did not lead to any result.
Tech Toys balances your gift budget
This year’s favorite among the gifts is the iPad, possibly followed by a Microsoft Kinect video console. Both players can tear a considerable hole into their gift budget.
An iPad costs as much as five BMX wheels for $99, while the price for a Kinect game corresponds to about 10 classic jump ropes or about 48 doses of play-doh.
But you can save your gift budget.
Recently, I was looking for three electronic toys under $80 three national toy dealers - a Wal-Mart, a Toys "R" Us and a BJ's Wholesale Club.
I immediately realized that Moore's law had come into force. This year, the technology toys are more powerful and cost a little less than last year.
And although fewer new toys appear with their own website, on the most famous of this kind, Webkinz and Club Penguin, is a broader offer.
There are more and more button cells-powered toys on the market, and many contain rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(Unless otherwise specified, all prices of Toys "R" us.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, for children from 3 years of age) are plush figures, as big as sea pigs that sing a note when you press on their belly.
Once press corresponds to a note, by pressing several times you can play a song.
Several Sing-a-ma-jigs sing in harmony.
Attention: Once you start pressing, you can't stop.
For a combination of sand and dance, the dance star Mickey (fisher price $60, for children from 2) is the best choice.
Based on the Elmo live technology developed last year, the animatronic doll offers interplays such as 'Simon says', and thanks to its new hinge feet with wheel blocking it dominates the Moon walk.
Children who tested the device use Mickey as a dance teacher. However, their parents complain about the lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 80s, remember Alphie, one of the first computerized learning toys.
Now he is back (Hasbro/Playschool, $40, for children from 3), with a whole bunch of question cards that can make a car ride a lesson hour, with a better knower with auto corrective function as a teacher.
If you don't want to entrust your smartphone to your child, there are three independent alternatives here.
MobiGo by VTech ($60 for children from 3 to 8) is the cheapest and most user-friendly solution, equipped with a qwerty keyboard. However, the games included on it are not as instructive as those on the Leapster Explorer ($70, for children from 3 to 12), which is equipped with a new, brighter screen after Leapster's first major revision of Leapster series.
None of the versions are compatible with older cassettes.
Fisher-Price iXL ($90 for children from 3 to 7) uses a system similar to iTunes for the games and eBooks, and thanks to the SD card drive, family photos can also be viewed on it.
Finally, there is Scrabble Flash ($30 from Hasbro, for children from 8). The five blocks are not larger than a matchbox and have their own LED screen.
The game is about concatenating the blocks before the time runs out. It is great for an improvised spelling competition.
More and more toys have some kind of online connection.
If you go alone after the offer in the toy shops, Webkinz and Club Penguin are the most important.
To give your child an online animal at the Club Penguin, you can buy a Disney Club Penguin 2 Mix 'N Match Figure Package ($5 for children from 6 to 12) containing a coin with a secret code.
If you enter the code online, your child will receive enough credits for two more parts at the Club Penguin Store.
They can be roller-shoes or a Puffle stuff.
The latest head cell-powered micro robot, Hexbug Nano ($10 for children from 5) is no bigger than the head of your toothbrush.
The beetle moves quickly on 12 vibrating silicone legs in any direction.
It's fun to send him through an errand of clumps.
And he's holding out a lot.
Ours fell from the kitchen table and even survived some time in the mouth of our dog.
Police operations in China are becoming softer
Like a training officer, Tang Shenbin walked over an urban square, checked his nervous subordinates and issued orders with military authority and damp voice.
He wanted his female members of Chengguan - China's robust guards of the urban order, feared and despised for their arbitrary razzies and their tendency to violence - to impress the audience.
"Stand right!"
"Look straight out!"
"Show them," he whispered to them, "how pretty girls are!"
Four girls, barely growing up the teen-age, with white gloves and identical olive green jackets and pants stood rigid.
Four pairs of black pumps were in a straight line.
Four orderly hats sat perfectly on the hair held with blue-white striped loops.
"For me, they look on average," Mr. Tang said.
"Models are pretty."
Several governments have already tried to polish the image of China's city inspectors.
In a city, all new applicants must have a university degree.
The province of Guangdong introduced a bright blue uniform instead of the greyish green.
Wuhan in Middle China replaced violence with low-staring: in 2009, 50 officials reportedly circled an improperly positioned snack truck and stared at the operator until he packed up and left the place after half an hour.
Xindu, a district in Chengdu with 680,000 inhabitants, wants to change the image fundamentally.
Since 2003, 13 women have been strengthening the urban police strips. They have been specially selected because of their appearance, their good figure and their youth.
They're supposed to give the gross police a softer, feminine aspect.
Unfortunately, Scarlett Johansson would hardly be able to improve the bad image that the Chinese have of these city commands.
Right, so the critics.
Unlike the police, these officials may enforce urban laws only through fines or other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese media routinely show a different picture.
In January 2008, officials in the province of Hubei beat a spectator to death when he filmed her with his cell phone, as they put down a protest campaign against a garbage dump.
Last year, a training manual of Beijing officials was stolen and published on the Internet, describing how criminals can be beaten without bloodshed.
This year, a Shanghai watermelon dealer was injured after a handful of five officials.
A violent video game that can be downloaded from the Internet shows officials trained in China in an attack on road dealers.
"Chengguan scares the government," the national newspaper China Daily said last year, after further controversy regarding the tactics.
The newspaper demanded "really thorough cleansing".
Skeptics believe that the current approach is far from adequate.
When the district sought eight female recruits per ad in October, an editorial in the Beijing Evening News asked whether women should have real tasks or only serve as an optical distraction.
Probably both.
According to ad, women aged 18 to 22 were looked for with good figure and "harmonic features".
You should be above average - over 1.5m or 5 feet, 2 1/2 inches.
The employment relationship ends with reaching 26 years of age.
According to the officials, the activity for women over 25 is too strenuous physically.
"The most important thing is their image," said an unnamed district official at the nearly government website Rednet.com.
"Whether the candidates get the job depends first on their external appearance, such as size, weight, facial features, etc."
Then come temperament and "inner qualities".
"Female Chengguan are like flower vases," he said, adding, "but they still have other duties."
Zheng Lihua, Deputy Head of the Town Administration of the District, does not wish to include this description,
However, it admitted that in China sizes in job ads for both sexes are not uncommon.
The same applies to uniform features.
It is controversial in China whether this is to be treated with good appearance.
But people with disabilities or physical disturbances do not need to apply.
"Unfortunately, we can't use lambs or bucks here," says Mr. Zheng.
"Your image wouldn't be good."
Liu Yi, who patrols on the Baoguang square near a monastery, is 22, has apple biscuits and a probably shaped mouth.
She did not feel that she was being sexist so much valued on her appearance.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asks with ironic glance.
Her colleague with the dimples, 21-year-old Xu Yang, commented, "We have the task of representing the image of the city."
According to their information, they do not regret the short-term attitude, as they have more ambitious career plans than simply shying dealers through the streets to prevent them from doing business.
Every morning, the strip deals with about twelve road dealers who try to sell as many rolls and cakes as possible on foot or bicycle before they are chased away.
"Mr. Wang, please get out of here."
"We have told you so many times!" explains Ms. Xu to a merchant who had fled on foot and had temporarily abandoned his pasta kitchen fixed on a bicycle cart.
According to the officials, the activity is more monotonous than strenuous.
"It's the same almost every day," explains Huang Jing, 20, who studies sales in leisure.

One reason for this is that female officials are not allowed to confiscate the merchandise of traders, like their male colleagues.
They can only threaten to report them to their male superiors.
This is intended to protect them from public attacks that officials in China are often exposed to.
This year, hundreds of residents of Kunming, the capital of Yunnan Province, ransacked after the rumor had been cursing, Chengguan officials had killed a merchant.
More than a dozen police officers and Chenguan officials were injured during the night incident, 14 government vehicles were thrown down or set on fire.
Xindu has so far been spared from such outrages of violence.
But unrest is not to be excluded.
Just two blocks away from the quiet Baonguang square where the female officials patrolled this morning, over 50 people gathered on a street corner.
Officials had confiscated a motorcycle that was repaired against the rules on the sidewalk instead of in a workshop.
The owner shouted Zeter and Mordio.
After 15 minutes of reluctance, the officials with a gruesome face walked the way to their vehicles and continued with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator of male stripes, remained behind, turning his white name tag around to remain anonymous.
Like their running, the coordinators - men over 40 - play a purely supportive role.
But they were not trained to present a clean image.
"Sometimes we go verbally."
"Sometimes but also physically," explains Mr. Li soberly.
"Most of the time people start fighting."
Attorney will not sue Senator Ensign
Attorneys of the Ministry of Justice have acquitted Senator John Ensign of the accusations made against him after his affair with a former electoral assistant and his attempt to provide her husband with a lobbying activity, the Senator’s lawyers announced on Wednesday.
This decision ends the most serious legal charge against Senator Ensign, the Republican from Nevada. Until the scandal that provided headlines throughout the country and put a damper on his career, he was considered as a possible presidential candidate of the Republicans for 2012.
As Senator Ensign's office announced, he was "highly pleased" about the judgment after the one-year investigation.
However, the Senate's Ethics Committee could still impose a disciplinary penalty.
According to Ensign's lawyers, they were informed by the Ministry of Justice that the investigations against Senator Ensign had been stopped and that no further charges had been made in this case.
The Ministry of Justice did not want to comment on the case.
The judgment was a surprise for many ethical lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice. In their opinion, there was sufficient evidence that Ensign disregarded the lobbying ban.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents, which were first published in the New York Times in October 2009, gave rise to the suspicion that Ensign Douglas Hampton, one of his constituencies, helped to secure orders to buy his silence about an affair with Hampton's wife Cynthia.
Cynthia Hampton worked as treasurer during an election campaign Ensigns.
Ensign contacted some political friends to get Hampton to work. According to the documents and interrogations, he took over for them after Hampton's lobby work.
Since Hampton was recently in Ensign's election team, he was not allowed to do lobby work for his former employer or the entire Senate for a year.
According to ethics experts, the unusual agreement between Ensign and Hampton, who were closely friends in front of the affair, infringed the so-called prohibition of turning-door lobbyration.
According to the published indices, "it seems that it is all about an agreement and the violation of the rotary door statues," says Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in the defense of clients who are in the government's vision.
While the Ministry of Justice officially refused to disclose the reasons for the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethikan lawyers said that the ministry seemed very cautious in taking political charges after a number of defeats, which were followed with great interest by the media, including the decision last year to drop the charges against the former Senator Ted Stevens for misbehaviour by the prosecutor.
Attorneys "are obviously terrible," said Melanie Sloan, the chairman of the Association "Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington" (an organization whose aim is to combat corruption in the US's parliamentary and governmental circles), a group of lawyers who brought various charges against Mr. Ensign to justice.
"This basically means that senior government officials can now assume that the laws do not apply to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, Chief Defender of Mr. Ensign, said in an interview that he had received a phone call from an attorney on Monday and another the next day he was told that the ministry would not file any complaints against his clients.
Mr. Ensign's defenders had cooperated with the prosecutors to convince them that, as his office repeated in a statement on Wednesday, the Senator had "acted in accordance with the law".
Mr. Coggins refused to explain in more detail the legal arguments he had made to the prosecutors.
"I don't think I can go into the details of the talks between the Ministry of Justice and me. Only so much is said: We believe we have made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Electoral Commission decided to terminate investigations for a separate complaint by the Ethics Group, after which a payment of $96,000 from Mr Ensign's parents to the Hamptons had infringed the Federal Electoral Act.
The Electoral Commission said that there had not been enough evidence that the money had been something other than a gift.
NV Energy, a large company in Nevada, which for a long time supported the Senator, was one of the companies where Mr. Hampton found lobbyist work thanks to the help of Mr. Ensign.
An e-mail dated December 2008 shows that, after Mr. Hampton had passed on as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensing's Chief of Staff, John Lopez, had a conversation with Mr. Hampton, in which he told him that he was "beating" at the Ministry of Interior for one thing.
Mr. Ensign was also meeting with Mr. Hampton and another customer from Nevada, Allegiant Air, for lunch and asked the Minister of Transport to arrange a meeting on behalf of the airline after that Mr. Hampton had stopped for lobbying.
For the first time last year, for the first time, information about this affair had been given to the public, Mr. Ensign apologized to his voters and gave up his position in the Senate, where he had stood fourth in the rank of Republicans.
After not having noticed many months, Mr. Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he was pursuing a third term in the Senate.
In the announcement that Mr. Ensign is no longer the goal of police investigations, his press spokesperson Jennifer Cooper, the Senator hoped that the Ethics Commission would follow the example of the Ministry of Justice very quickly and stop its investigations.
"Senator Ensign is looking forward to continuing his hard work in the service of people in Nevada," she said.
Cheshire's call draws attention to Twitter
Half a dozen of them were in the crayons in the courtroom.
In a minute's time, they sent their reports on cruel witness statements via Twitter.
In the end, the defense said, there were more than 140,000 Twitter messages about the process of rape and bed-chained children in a house that started in flames.
On Thursday, Steven J. Hayes' attentive trial, accused of killing three members of a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, will find an official end when the judge's sentence on the death sentence the jury has pronounced.
However, Mr. Haye's lawyers have already filed applications with the court, the reasons for an appeal and which the courts will employ for years.
One of the most provocative reasons is that the intensive reporting of the process - also through the extensive use of Twitter by average reporters - has resulted in a "circulatory atmosphere" and a so widespread, immediate penetration of insidious details, so that the jury was not allowed to be influenced by public indignation.
This objection could lead the appellation courts to consider whether the new technologies will make new rules necessary in the courtroom.
"As I have experienced during this trial, I believe that it is really a danger if the entry of new technologies into the courtroom influences the right of each individual to a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Haye's main defender.
The presiding judge, Jon C. Blue of the Supreme Chamber Court, briefly rejected the applications by decision last week when he said that the New Media would be "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury had been driven by passions.
But that was certainly not the last word on this matter.
For decades, court appeals have found that reporting on famous and notorious cases raises doubts about the fairness of a trial.
In his historical decision of 1966, the Supreme Court of the United States repealed the judgment against Dr. Sam Sheppard, an osteopath from Cleveland who was supposed to have killed his wife, and said in his decision that there had been a "carneval atmosphere in the courtroom" because of the New Media.
Some people believe that the TV series and the feature film "Fleeting" are based on this crime.
Some lawyers say that court appeals, which Mr. Haye's convictions consider half a century later, could follow the argument that new rules have become necessary to regulate the channels of communication from the courtroom that were still unimaginable at the time of the case of Dr. Sheppard.
"There is a good reason to be alarmed about the influence of the New Media in processes being persecuted by a general public," said John J. Donohue III, professor at Stanford Law School, who investigated the death penalty in Connecticut. According to his report, she is arbitrarily imposed.
Professor Donohue said that some appellation dishes might be fascinated by the idea that limiting immediate communication out of the courtroom could make the processes fairer.
The Twitter issue is just one of many who explain Mr. Hayes' lawyers to discuss for years and thus delay a conviction.
The defenders also claim, for example, that Mr. Hayes could have already been prejudiced when Judge Blue had not allowed them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them cruel crime scene photos during the jurors' selection.
Some of the jurors have said that photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48 years old, and their growers, Hayley, 17 years old, and Michaela, 11 years old, would have filled them with horror.
The defenders say that they would also call into question the constitutionality of the death penalty Constitution, arguing that the judge had mistakenly exchanged a jury that had been a critic of the prosecutor's office, and that he had put undue pressure on the judgment when he made the unusual decision to release the jury over the weekend.
The jurors were not isolated.
However, their arguments about the influence of detailed reporting on the process may be of the utmost interest.
In a judgment challenge they filed last month, they found that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed by the candidates during the election campaign for the governor's office and for the American Senate.
They argued that the New Media would have continuously aroused the flames of emotions about the case.
"This is the daily urge of the media, cameras and reporters outside the courtroom," the lawyers wrote, "you haven't experienced before in New Haven and perhaps even abroad."
Your focus on Twitter reporting is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists said that the claim that these direct messages are more up-to-date than reports that are more slowly being returned is an anti-technical look that is impoverishing reporting on future processes.
However, some lawyers said that appellation courts were often confronted with the argument, social and technical changes required adaptation by the courts.
Mr. Hayer's lawyers reinforce this claim.
In her opposition, she referred to the decision of the Supreme Court of 1966 in which Dr. Sheppard's judgment was lifted on the basis of the reporting and made it clear that the New Media required new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "represents Sheppard against Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can courtesy connect the separator?
After a campaign of insults and negativity, little courtesy broke out in Washington this week.
Is it the omen of a real two-party cooperation or a moment of illusion before you quickly return to the struggle of the parties in the capital?
The meeting between President Obama and Congress leaders on Tuesday did not make a breakthrough into the big issues that had to be dealt with during the so-called "lame duck session", the meeting at the end of a government period in which decisions are no longer taken.
After all that one hears, it was not a polite discussion between two different sides nor a respect for their shared responsibility to rule, but rather an empty episode of a party point collection.
The public meeting of the President's deficit commission on Wednesday was also civilised, despite the political differences that continue to exist between the members.
It seems clear that close interaction over a period of months creates mutual respect that conceals the ideological gap that continues to separate members.
This is hardly enough to claim that a new era of cooperation has arrived.
Both sides are now in a test phase - in which one demands from the other sign of cooperation and compromise, while one tries to weigh the limits of public opinion and the patience of voters after a renewed party warfare.
Therefore, the meeting on Tuesday itself and its assessment by the participants was limited to a minimum of claims or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too big and too deep to expect a rapid change in the atmosphere that has prevailed over the last two years.
Whether it's taxes, donations, health or careers, the two sides are miles apart.
Last but not least, the November election of Washington has mildly voted for at least a short time.
"No question, the tone has changed," said Pete Wehner, an official representative of the Bush government, who is now working for the "Ethics and Public Policy Center".
"This is inevitable after elections.
Elections awaken partial passions that die again.
And that's good."
In some questions, especially those on the agenda of the "lame duck session", Republicans and Democrats have little choice but to find a solution."
Bush's tax cuts end at the end of the year, and no one's in favour of that.
Both sides want to find a way to get some or all, whether it is temporary or permanent.
Similarly, a compromise can be expected with regard to the increased unemployment benefits, although only because Republicans cannot afford to believe that the preferred tax reductions for the rich, while refusing to support unemployed workers.
After the meeting on Tuesday in the White House, optimism has increased that one can agree on these issues during the "lame duck session" and at the same time ratify the New START Treaty.
But William Glaston of Brooking's institution warns that a successful cooperation on urgent issues of the lame duck session must not necessarily lead to a lasting cooperation of the parties when the new 112th Congress is convened in January.
Instead, he says, a phase of non-conformity is more likely, perhaps even indispensable.
"After the things that need to be done, this short-term psychology will turn into confrontation," he said.
Wehner is also skeptical - and this scepticism is shared by many - the courtesy leads to true cooperation.
"I see a lot of what is happening from today to 2012, as a prelude, or shadow boxing, for the main event of 2012," he said.
The reasons for this have a lot to do with the presentation of the new Republican majority in the White House and with the tea party voters who served their education.
However concerned the Republican leaders may be that they are too high poker, they know that they must try to keep their promises to lower government spending and out of power the health reform.
These party lines are already reflected in the initial reactions to the recommendations of the Committee on the deficits, which include tax reform and the raising of certain taxes, the raising of pension age and the reduction of government expenditure.
The Vice-Presidents Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken over one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, in their own opinion, have urged so much to put the deficit issue on the public agenda that they can no longer be ignored.
But they need 14 out of 18 votes within the Commission to make their plan an official recommendation and they are fighting very hard to get to this number.
The largest resistance can be found in the elected representatives of the body, as financial issues, at least today, have little room for manoeuvre or little sympathy for compromises.
Galston predicts two phases in the fight between the White House and the Republicans in Congress.
The first battle will take place next year in the form of party conflicts when Republicans challenge Obama with regard to the state budget, taxes and the health system, later followed by a phase of greater two-party cooperation.
What will lead to this change?
Public opinion.
It has been proven that, despite the partiality of the current election, the majority of Americans still wish the two parties to work together.
If confrontation leads to a dead end, as it did in 1995, then both parties must take care to ensure that the public response is taken care of.
Whoever is condemned to lose will have to change the course and seek the compromise.
This may indeed be an optimistic view.
Participality and polarization are larger today than in the mid-1990s, and they seem to be a greater ideological gap between Obama and the Congress republicans than between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans at the time.
At the same time, the activists of both parties see 2010 as a pure foreplay for a far more far-reaching election in 2012.
In this way, the courtesy shown this week may be welcomed by many Americans.
But on both sides it will take much more effort to find a common denominator in the questions that still separate the two.
Swift US document portrays Moscow as a port of corruption
The control of the city lies in the hands of the "cloptocracy" and it passes on some of the bribes and the protection money it collects to the Kremlin. Thus, in February the American Embassy in Russia reported in a memo.
Both the police and the State Security Service are extorting high protection funds so that they can keep their expensive standard of living in Moscow, it is said.
They collect money not only from legitimate transactions, but also from organized criminal gangs.
Every layer of bureaucracy - what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called "vertical authority" - takes its part of the money that the ladders are moving up.
The memo, sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was published on Tuesday by WikiLeaks on his homepage.
The memo is based on sources whose names have been edited.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still Moscow's mayor, and it accuses him of corruption.
He was fired in October by President Dmitry Medvedev, but there is hardly any evidence that in the meantime had been cleaned up.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a well-known construction company, have repeatedly rejected allegations of corruption over years, and he has won numerous charges of slander against such accusations.
In September he explained to a Russian television station when he was asked for a documentation suggesting he was corrupt: "It's crazy, it's dirty, it's dirty."
> An incredibly large number of Russians believe that their society is corrupt, which has resulted in surveys.
But it is unusual that, as in the Ambassador's report, individuals are called, and it is not heard that this is done by a diplomat of a foreign country.
"The direct link between the government of Moscow and crime has led some to call it "disturbed" and to the conclusion that the government acts more like a kleptocrat than a government," the memo states.
"Criminal elements enjoy a "kryshna" (a term from the world of criminals / mafia, which literally means "roof" or protection), which extends over the police, the state security (FSB), the service supervisory authority (MVD) and the office of the prosecutor as well as through the entire Moscow government bureaucracy.
Experts have discovered a three-layer structure within the criminal world of Moscow.
"Luzhkov is at the top."
"FSB, MVD and the militia are on the second level."
"Lastly, the ordinary criminals and the criminal inspectors follow at the lowest level."
"This is an incompetent system in which criminal groups in some areas close a gap because the city does not offer any help."
The report goes on to say that the FSB collects money from the largest companies and that the police arrests small businessmen.
One source, it is said, is "explained that Moscow's business owners understand that it is best to get protection from MVD and FSB (and not from organised crime) because they have not only more weapons, resources and power than criminals, but also because they are protected by law."
"For this reason, protection by criminal gangs is no longer as desirable as it used to be."
The memo notes that, while collecting money is comprehensive, protection itself is not very modest; even those who pay are sometimes arrested.
Those who don't pay find their business very quickly closed before - due to one pretext or another.
Medvedev has talked several times about combating corruption, but at the same time has noted that he has made little progress.
The memo of the message contains descriptions of men going to the Kremlin with suitcases that were probably full of money.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev has to rely on the bureaucrats," said Georgy Satarov, director of Indem, a Moscow expert commission, recently in an interview.
"But he's part of this bureaucracy."
"It's not part of the political class, because a political class in Russia no longer exists."
Without politicians, without opposition, without separation of forces, he says, corruption is inevitable.
Nationally, estimates By, corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
The country ranks at number 154 of a recent investigation into the global perception of corruption by the non-governmental organisation Transparency International ( countries are listed from "minimum corrupt" to "most corrupt").
The revelation of the memo of the American Embassy, which took place after Moscow time late in the evening, will certainly cause displeasure within the Russian government, although, as Luzhkov can be accused of the errors of Moscow, it can also be a possibility for the Kremlin to claim that one solves the problems.
In an interview with Larry King for CNN, Putin claimed that the WikiLeaks documents could be a forgery and responded angryly to the revelation that American diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth is that this is about our interaction, which is an important factor of domestic policy in this country," he said.
"But to be honest, we didn't expect this to happen with such arrogance, with such pressure and so unethical, you know."
Khmer Rouge veterans forced to confront the past
The director of the Anlong Veng High School reminds of the man who built him of the later Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok in a poorly illuminated, concrete classroom with dirty and leafy walls.
"Each one here loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good guide and he took care of his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42 years old.
Because of his brutality during the Khmer Rouge rule known as "the butcher", the commander remains popular in this remote former Khmer Rouge stronghold in northwest Cambodia, where he built hospitals and bridges, developed the infrastructure and where thousands of former soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the capitulation of Khmer Rouge to the government, many years of adherents in Anlong Veng are challenged.
In April, a local Truth and Reconciliation Forum allowed victims public confrontation with the people who once supported the regime.
In June, the government distributed a schoolbook telling the history of Khmer Rouge for the first time children of former soldiers.
And in July, a community tribunal of the UN and Cambodia sentenced for the first time a former member of Khmer Rouge, when he sentenced the former head of the infamous Tuol Sleng Torture Chamber, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, to 35 years in prison.
With each of these developments, fear grew under the Khmer Rouge Veteran Alnlong Vengs, making their efforts to reconcile and reintegration into the society of Cambodia difficult.
"There is still rejection and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything," said Chhang Youk, head of the Cambodian Documentation Centre, an independent organization that explores the regime.
"For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"It even splits families."
During the Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or died of illness, rework or hunger.
When the Vietnamese invaded and the Pol Pot-Ied government fell in 1979, the leftovers of the regime and its military fled to the Cambodian border to Thailand.
Here they spread unrest until December 1998, when the last movement capitulated.
When Pol Pot, Nuon Chea, and Ieng Sary fought the guerrilla war from their base in the west of the mountains and jungles of Cambodia, Ta Mok drew the next generation in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, when a UN-funded peace agreement led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to cross over to the government, leading to the capitulations of Ieng Sary 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural death in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had not given in, was arrested by government forces at the Dangrek Mountains in 1999.
He died in the Phnom Penh Prison in 2006, where he was waiting for his trial.
When their patrons no longer protected them, most of the former Khmer Rouge fighters fled to the crushing poverty of rural Cambodia and many kept the movement in nostalgic memory.
Even though some of the few elitist officials of Khmer Rouge kept their local government posts because they laid down their weapons, the simple soldiers remained poor, uneducated peasants.
"These people have benefited very little from capitulation," said Sok Leang from the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation, which holds public forums throughout Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
"They are anchored in the Utopian agricultural ideology of the regime."
"They grew up without any professional knowledge."
Sor Lim, 55 years old, who had joined the Rhmer Rouge in 1974, fought in the jungle for Anlang Veng before he settled down in 1998 to live as a poor rice farmer.
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"Ta Mok gave everyone something to eat."
"But now life is hard because we have to take care of ourselves."
The running Khmer Rouge Tribunal has also awakened concerns here.
Early next year, the court will try to bring Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife and Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister, to justice.
The task of the court is to condemn the old leaders and those who are mainly responsible for the atrocities, but it is not said whether it will pursue further acts beyond these four cases.
This has contributed little to mitigating the fears in Anlong Veng.
Current media speculation has focused on Im Chaem, 64 years old, who had been district chief in Manteay Meanchey Province during Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she had told agents from the Cambodian Documentation Centre that she had led the construction of the Trapeang Thma Dam, a project that probably killed thousands of forced workers.
On a hot evening, the Chaem returned from work on the fields to her wooden house on a dirty street outside of Anlong Veng.
When the sun cast long shadows on the withered grass, Im Chaem refused to discuss her past at Khmer Rouge.
Should the court invite them, she would refuse to go, she said.
"Cambodia lives in peace and stability," she said.
"If there were no more persecutions, war would be here."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who fled the Khmer Rouge in 1878, has also repeatedly warned that the situation would become uncertain, the court would accuse more suspects, although experts and historians discuss this.
"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But the confrontation with the past is what Cambodia needs to do to move forward, said Chhang Youk from the documentation center.
"Reconciling with Khmer times means bringing together the broken pieces," he said.
"It is our duty to put these broken parts together so that they can understand everything."
The Centre created the first government-approved schoolbook on Khmer Rouge, the 75-page "History of Democratic Cambodia".
It distributed the book in June in Anlong Veng as an annex to the history book for the High School of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four pages about the Khmer Rouge.
As often in Cambodia, the young people in Anlong Veng know little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city's connections to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19 years old, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said that the new schoolbook helps students to understand an important part of their history.
But his parents responded skeptically when he brought the book home to read it.
"My family rejects many parts of the book and the court," he said.
"They are suspicious because they are not sure how many people are condemned by the court."
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process complex and complicated, Sok Leang said.
But the public forums, the schoolbook and the court gradually gain influence," he said.
The Khmer Rouge still has a powerful attraction here.
Up in the Dangrek Bergen leads a road covered with shrubs overgrowed with plastic waste to a rectangle of black soot, covered with a rusty tin roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned here after his death in 1998 on a pile of tires.
Nuom Sothea, 31 years old, a mobile salesman on the streetside, said she didn't know much about the man who had been burned here.
"But he has a strong spirit and many people here go to him to pray," she said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday and later in the day she wanted to go to Pol Pot's last resting place, where she will take a bush of mature bananas - in the hope that he will bring her happiness.
Belarus agrees to no longer acquire weaponsable uranium
In a surprising victory for President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear materials worldwide, the Belarus government announced on Wednesday that it will no longer collect highly enriched uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was announced in a joint statement following a meeting of Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton with the Belarusian Foreign Minister Foreign Minister Martynov in an additional article of the security summit.
For years, the U.S. government had tried to convince Belarus not to collect highly enriched uranium and seemed to have reached a barrier last spring.
However, US government officials told the Washington Post that in the past two months two secret secrets have been struck with Belarus to remove 187 pounds of weaponsable uranium from a Belarusian research institute.
This prepared the stage for the agreement on Wednesday to remove the rest of the material - according to an official employee who remains anonymous due to the sensitivity of the topic, about 500 pounds.
The agreement seems to be one of the most important results of Obama's April "Nuclear Security Summit of the 47 Nations" that Belarus had excluded.
And it was obviously good enough to secure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next summit 2012.
"I was really thrilled by the fact that they want to have a seat in the nuclear safety summit (of 2012).
"This proves to me that it works," said Ken Luongo, president of the Global Security Partnership, a group to promote nuclear safety.
Clinton called the agreement "a very important, important step" of Belarus.
Obama promised in April 2009 in Prague to secure everything precarious nuclear material within four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries to get rid of their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A dozen countries did it under the government of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama's Nuclear Security Summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko declared that the nation will never give up its uranium.
"How to keep highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilos, which is fundamentally weapons, and less enriched uranium," said Lukashenko at the time.
"This is our raw material... we will not make dirty bombs out of it, and we will not sell it to anyone."
"We use it exclusively for research purposes, that's all."
Belarus was still approaching the US a few months ago when it showed interest in the meeting of an agreement.
The first attempt to remove the uranium of Belarus in October was particularly complicated, because the material was slightly radiant, say official.
It has been loaded into a special train that has more than 1,300 miles to a Russian factory for storage and disposal for, say official.
The second launch was decided on Monday and was carried out by plane according to the official.
The U.S. government pays $14 million for these efforts, with much of the money flowing into Belarusian research with poorly enriched uranium, which cannot be used for nuclear weapons.
"This was extremely carefully coordinated and coordinated to trust confidence," which led to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, a representative of the Ministry of Energy working on the Global Hazard Reduction.
The James Martin Center for Non-Extensive Studies estimates that Belarus had at least 88 pounds of weapons-like uranium this year and hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus intends to terminate its camp by 2012.
Relations between Belarus and the United States were tense for years, mainly because of Lukashenko's harsh disregard for human rights.
But the statement from Wednesday suggests a possible approach.
"Welcoming the progress of these global security issues, the United States of America and Belarus announce that increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central issue in improving bilateral relations and it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens," she explains.
No objections by the Spanish Government to CIA flights
The Spanish government had no objection to the CIA flights with Taliban and Al-Qaida prisoners via Spanish territory to Guantánamo, as evidenced by a telegram from the U.S. Ambassador to Madrid.
This is reflected in the documents published by Wikileaks and forwarded to the daily newspaper "El País" (by cable). It is added that former Deputy Head of Government María Teresa Fernández de la Vega demanded that the Spanish government be informed "to prove that foreign aircraft flying over Spain are adequately monitored."
In June 2006, following the publication of a report by the Council of Europe in which the aid was charged with human rights practices in a dozen countries, including Spain, the former North American Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega discussed.
The Deputy Head of Government admitted that the report of the Council had " met Zapatero in the distance" and confirmed that Spain had nothing to hide on this matter.
"De la Vega underlined that Spain had no objections to the secret service flights over Spanish territory."
"You just want to be informed", not to be "unprepared for surprise", reports Aguirre by cable.
The former Foreign Minister, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, also pointed out to the Ambassador that "the Spanish government does not want to pay much attention to this matter, although the government has few possibilities to influence it, as they lie in the hands of the judges."
In January 2007, Public Prosecutor Vicente González told the Embassy that he would not block the judicial initiative to apply for the declassification of the documents of the Spanish Secret Service Centre (CNI) and the Minister of Defence about the CIA flights.
"These reports do not contain any burdensome or sensitive information," said the ambassador after a conversation with the prosecutor.
Nevertheless, the US was more concerned about "the apparent coordination between the Spanish prosecutor and the German prosecutors" than about the declassified information of the CNI and the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to deal discreetly between governments," laments Aguirre.
At a lunch in March 2007, where the US ambassador and Spanish Interior Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba participated, the latter commented that "although the Spanish judges were mad at their independence and did what they considered appropriate", he gave his employees instructions, "to avoid inflated rhetorical comments in order to let the tension melt off."
The Ambassador also expressed his concern about the actions taken by the PP in this matter.
"Despite their generally pro-American attitude, our experience teaches us that the PP will not doubt it, from a note that the government of Zapatero will tolerate or deliberately ignore US actions that could be interpreted as human rights violations, even if these revelations might have a negative impact on the US government," he emphasizes.
The child murderer confesses that she complained on the Internet about the "mortem" of motherhood.
The young woman spoke of the child when she was already dead and she had a blog: "Terror in a Galician way"
Monica Juanatey Fernández is on the Internet "Muki".
Under this nickname, which she shows from a small age, she keeps in touch with a cousin and at least one friend. Both come from Noia, a village in the province of La Coruña, where she was born.
The communication dates back to 2008.
To understand these, you need to know their love life, which the daily ABC reconstructs on the basis of testimony from their family members.
The 30-year-old Galician woman began a relationship with Iván Túñez, an industrialist in 1998.
She held a year.
Shortly after she broke up her relationship, it became known that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his, but his former was never allowed to perform a DNA analysis.
Shortly thereafter, she entered a different relationship.
The selected was Alberto, a young man from Lousame, a neighboring community.
She lived with him for a long time.
César lived with them.
When the young woman went to the Balearic Islands to look around on the labour market, the little one stayed with her partner, who even accompanied her to Palma for a week.
But from the content of their news, it can be concluded that their love relationship broke and they separated.
In March 2008 she is alone on Menorca and writes: "Alberto is very strange and mad because I came to work."
"When I told him that, he liked it, but now, of course, he realizes what it means to be alone with the boy all day long and not to be free, to do and to be able to let what he wants."
Later she mentions a message she just received on the phone: "I want you to come back this month or send me an address to which I can send you to the boy."
She complains, "If he doesn't like me leaving the boy with my mother, I'll pick him up when I get back."
In May she talks about returning to her village: "This week I'm going there, but I'm only going to stay there until 19th, because I have to imagine a job on 20th if I don't want to lose it."
She explains she'll take her firstborn with her when everything goes well.
"He will be with him who has to be, that is, with me. Never in life will I leave him with anyone but my mother again", a dubious intention, considering their bad relationship.
In July there will be another mail.
When she writes this, it is assumed that the boy who came to the island on the 1st of the month and was allegedly murdered on the 10th is dead.
"On the one hand, César is satisfied, on the other hand, not."
"On the one hand, he is with me and the place he likes a bit, but on the other hand, he has to go to school every day."
She's talking about moving to Mallorca.
"There he (the boy) will attend a summer course, so I have less expenses for the nanny."
On 17th: Memories and complaints.
"A giant kiss of César asking me when you're coming."
"Alberto says he sent me some videos on the email. You see, if he wants to, he finds me, such a mess."
On the 30th: "The boy is fine. He goes to a summer course to learn Catalan."
From Víctor, her current partner, there is one: "He sends me money."
On the Internet, in Anime and Mangablogs, there are messages from her.
She even had her own blog in MySpace, which is now locked, and in which she called herself "Muki, the prison release.
"Terror a la gallega (heading) ".
The last man who lived with her, a sworn hunting overseer, explains that he was guilty of conscience.
He can't believe everything happened because she didn't tell him she was a single mother.
Monica was transferred from the Centre for Prisoners to Menorca in Palma Province Prison yesterday.
The Obligatory Defender, Carlos Maceda, stated that she could not recall the outcome of the matter, "and she had no intention of harming the Little One."
Before, however, she had confessed to drown César in the bathtub and to have put his body in a suitcase.
Defense and prosecutors requested a psychiatric opinion.
Partido Popular won 4 seats in Congress and PSC lost 9
The results of 28 November could play a decisive role in the cities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona
Following the significant increase in votes and Members in the last regional elections, the PP is already looking forward to the parliamentary elections - preferable or not - because its expectations are more than positive, because the number of votes that this party has reached in these elections is usually twice as high as those in the elections in Catalonia.
For example, the Catalan People's Party received 610,473 votes in the 2008 parliamentary elections, while the number in the 2006 regional elections was only 316,222.
Last Sunday, the PPC won 384,091 votes.
If this rising trend - the result of the redirection of the PSC's voting share and the binding of the election of the PP - were to continue, the PP analysts predict that the PPC could rise from 8 to 12 Congress members in the parliamentary elections, while CiU would also win four (she now has 10) and the PSC would lose at least 9 Members (of 25).
These calculations demonstrate the fundamental importance of Catalonia for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the People's Party, the ERC would lose a Member - currently it has three - while ICV would hold its Members or win one.
However, if the electoral calendar is maintained, the next date will be May 2011 with the municipal elections. Even then, the People’s Party (PP) can be the tongue on the scale to put an end to socialist domination, in four provincial capitals and with its majority in the Council of Barcelona, one of the city administrations with the largest budget: EUR 661 million for 2011.
Both the Nationalists and the People's Party agree that the PSC will lose the cities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the socialists will not achieve a majority or resort to their traditional allies (ERC and ICV).
According to the Republican debacle, it is not inconvenient that this party will lose its representation in the Council of Barcelona, where it will have to reach 5% of the votes.
The PP, on the other hand, had an increase in its share of votes in the four provincial capitals and could become a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced to be able to play the leading role in Tarragona’s transformation. There they had ruled before the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros, together with the PP.
And Lérida is the PP only 500 votes behind the PSC. The mayor, Ângel Ros, has good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during the last election campaign they met several times.
Also in other important places, such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus, the People's Party was able to record a significant increase.
The PP is currently represented in 34 city administrations of Catalonia and aims to create lists in as many places as possible.
The Catalan cell provided Al Qaida with thousands of passports
In addition to the seven arrests in Barcelona, there were three more in Thailand
The seven Pakistani and Nigerians arrested by the police officers of the Barcelona Police Department formed the jihadist cell controlled by Thailand, the different Al Qaida groups, including the "Motion for Liberation of Tamil Eelam" (LTTE) and "Laschkar e-Taiba" (Let) - the latter was the author of the attacks in Bombay that claimed 106 dead in 2008 - with passports.
The Spanish Minister of Interior assigns great importance to these investigations, which goes so far as to assure him that with the "Operation Kampai" the forgery Al Qaidas has been "weakened" and "so their ability to act".
The researchers assume that during the two years in which the cell was active in Catalonia, thousands of passports were sent to Thailand, where they were faked and then sent to the groups from which the criminal galaxy Al Qaida was formed, so that their "fighters" could cross the borders of European and other Western countries without impunity.
The discovered cell is not the only one of the jihadist network that was active in Europe. Therefore, other European police forces have also participated in the investigation in addition to the Thai investigating bodies. It is not to be excluded that in the EU area there will be similar attacks in the coming days as that carried out last Tuesday in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were arrested) another was carried out in Thailand, where the Pakistani Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt as well as the Thai Sirikanlaya Kybumung were arrested.
They had led from Bangkok the cell established in Spain and other European countries.
The Catalan network - part of which had been destroyed in 2009 - in particular stole tourist passports in accordance with the requirements of the so-called "International Islamic Front".
This means that the documents were issued to the names of men aged 25 to 45 and had to be valid for several years; they were not allowed to have visa stamps.
In investigation circles it is underlined that, until now, no links have been established between the attacks arrested in Catalonia and the attack in Bombay, although the author of this attack, "Laschkar e-Taiba", was one of the recipient groups of passports stolen in Spain and then faked in Thailand.
Nevertheless, it should be recalled that a few days before the Catalonia attack, several thousand dollars had been sent by means of a money transfer company that had been "invested" in the purchase of prepaid cards for mobile phones, which were later used by the members of the "command" that put an end to the lives of 106 people.
The police seized an extensive documentation.
PP calls on Mas to postpone the tax agreement
The chairman of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, took the opportunity yesterday to personally present Artur Mas's terms of office as Prime Minister of the Generalitat, which do not differ from those already set during the election campaign and can be summarised with the priority of economic recovery and the omission of regionalist independence adventures, such as a financial compensation agreement proposed by the regionalist leader at the height of his mandate.
The president of the Catalan People's Party certainly addressed Artur Mas, who had awarded her the 18 Members who had won her last Sunday - a paragraph that is more than sufficient to feel indispensable, because the candidate of the bourgeois regionalist party CiU is dependent on at least one of the opposition parties to vote when he takes office.
The future alliances that the regionalists want to enter in the upcoming parliamentary elections in Congress depend on a possible Entente with the PP. However, the talks that Mas is currently holding with the other party leaders revolve around Catalonia.
With regard to the party chairman of the PPC, the latter calls for "all discourses relating to the sovereignty and independence of Catalonia" and an agreement on the financial compensation between the State and the Autonomous Region - similar to the Basque Country - and which the Head of the Party of CiU even wants to submit to a referendum to the latter.
Both political leaders are commonplace that they want to make the built-up political apparatus of regional administration slimmer and abolish inheritance and gift taxes.
The details of the negotiations on Mas's take-up to office are on the part of the PPC Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who announced a tough opposition - and Joan Herrera (ICV). Today he will meet with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The nursing home confirms that the deaths are not due to "missing measures"
The owners of the Altenheim in Olot do not rule out the fact that their caregiver killed over eleven older people
Yesterday, those responsible for the care centre La Caritat in Olot (Gerona) gave a press conference in which they found out what damage the criminal acts of Joan Vila Dilmé - the caregiver who had killed at least eleven old people for whom he was responsible - had done to the institution.
The head of the Altenpflegeheim, Joan Sala, joined his lawyer, Joan Cañada, in court and announced, "La Caritat wants to accuse the person responsible (for the deaths)", but "the law and our liability force us to accept the trial and civil liability".
The institution must not only accept a loss of social standing because it did not detect the criminal acts of the caregiver in good time, but now also pay a high amount of compensation, which is calculated by the legal representatives of the family members of the victims.
Joan Vila Dilmé admitted that the first crime dates back to August 2009 and that he has been further murdered since then.
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the nursing home - since he suspected that no doctor had personally examined the deceased but the formalities due to their age and diseases were handled by telephone.
The head of La Caritat denied this point all around and said that "the absence of measures could not have been the reason for the incidents."
La Caritat's lawyer added that "in the dispute there was no evidence of negligent acts by a person other than the accused."
The baptized man who was already baptized as a "death angel" before yesterday 11 murders and declared that the first crime was committed on August 29, 2009 and one and a half months later the second old lady was murdered.
In this case, he killed with an overdose of insulin, as opposed to the first crime in which he administered a mixture of various sedatives.
The head of La Caritat said that access to the drugs was difficult to control.
The insulin syringes and the sedative cocktail used the caregiver in six out of nine crimes to free patients with death from their suffering.
But the results of the laboratory tests will determine whether Vila is lying and actually chose a less cruel death for his first victims or whether he burned it from the inside by giving them bleaching as he had done, according to confession, to three women whom he murdered between 12 and 17 October.
In La Caritat one does not believe in the statements of the caregiver, not even as regards the number of committed murders that could be quite more. This attitude is justified by the fact that Vila made very different statements in court and that it makes no sense to change his approach suddenly after eight successful murders.
They say they made themselves available to them for this reason and to clarify the scope of these incidents.
Threats of the European Central Bank (ECB)
The investors responded strongly yesterday to the threat of the ECB President Trichet, who warned that "the markets should not underestimate our ability to react."
Euro-Peripheri countries' risk charges have increased dramatically and the shares of European banks have increased by more than 5%.
However, we should not underestimate the possibility that the ECB can be deceived and that the euro has hardly made any points that cause concern.
The events yesterday are typical of an illustrious market, which, to the extent that it collapses, recovers, however, as a result of the closure of short and highly speculative positions.
The institutional investor will not yet lose his fear.
Today, a month ago, the European Central Bank called on us to reverse our liquidity measures, which require the ECB to withdraw for the fourth time in two years tomorrow, and probably several times in the future.
The Bundesbank called for the end of the plan to buy sovereign debt, as it was ineffective, and for the abolition of all exceptional temporary liquidity measures. Only a week-long unlimited access should be maintained.
After the Irish crisis, we expect the current liquidity measures to be extended "at least until March" and the quarterly calls for tenders with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity by at least June.
We also expect the program to continue to purchase bonds and issue a strengthening signal.
If the expectations that have been created are not met, the excellent response of the markets will be thrown back from yesterday and if it is stubborn to insist that we take back our liquidity measures, only God can help us!
As with the ECB meeting in May, which confirmed that the Bank would not consider buying sovereign debt and that the markets would collapse, this story could be repeated tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May she showed her teeth and on Wednesday she said she had already bought a lot, provoking a new collapse of the market.
Yesterday, the auction of one-year state titles in Portugal was rather weak.
The government administration spent only 500 million to 5.28%, compared with 750 million to 4.81% in the previous auction.
Nevertheless, the interest rates in Portugal fell by 30 basis points throughout the curve, reflecting a change in the perception of the markets according to the words of Trichets.
In Ireland, Allied and Bank of Ireland's debt hole figures were published.
The sum is estimated at approximately 10,000 million short-term and possible additional 15 000. There is time by February to acquire private capital or these banks are nationalized.
Although Ireland has lost its credibility completely after not recognizing the stress tests problem in July, the rescue plan figures are acceptable and help to reduce uncertainty.
However, the government will have to receive parliamentary approval of its new budget next Tuesday, and since it still does not have sufficient support, Ireland remains a source of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel moderated her discourse with regard to the summit of Heads of State and Government on December 14th, where political unity is required to show that we are playing the same score together.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the other countries the ninth symphony of Beethoven.
The Spanish President of the Government yesterday presented the plan of action to be adopted by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in the autonomous regions such as financial institutions, reduction of the state deficit, liberalisation, privatisation and job creation measures. Measures that sound in the ears of investors like Vivaldi's Four Seasons.
The double effect of Zapatero and Trichet explains why the Spanish stock exchange has increased by 4.5 percent, twice as much as the rest of the European stock exchanges.
Compared to February, the response of the government and the Spanish central bank was quick and convincing, and we benefit from the surprise effect.
Today, there is a significant auction of a three-year government bond that will benefit from the trichet effect, which is why we are looking for a strong demand that will eliminate all doubts about our re-indebtedness.
For Spain, the application of an aid plan would be a self-sacrifice.
We would receive liquidity that we do not need. The Treasury has 40 billion euros available, three times as much as in March. Interest rates are extremely expensive and access to markets would be closed in time.
Nevertheless, our strategy should be in line with the motto of Caesar's wife: "Now not only being but also appearance counts."
Just courage, we can do that!
The Chairman of Eulen’s Board of Directors, at the request of his children, challenges Vega Sicilia’s shareholders’ meeting
The storm in the open conflict of the Álvarez family, owner of the companies Eulen and El Enebro, does not disappear.
David Álvarez, founder of the company gurppe, will challenge the company meeting of El Enebro, which will take place at the request of five of his seven children on the 16th, since he considers it "absolutely void". His children will try to obtain a majority to control the administrative organs of the company - owner of the winery Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his children Jesús David and María José are preparing the legal measures for a new judicial chapter in their dispute over the control of a part of the corporate group.
The founder of the largest holding company services does not appear to be willing to give up in his dispute to control the organs of El Enebro.
He was expelled from the Board of Directors by five of his seven children, who were appointed members of the Board of Directors at the shareholders' meeting on 18 January of this year, which is already registered in the Commercial Register as contested.
The meeting of the shareholders of El Enebro, which was convened by the judge of the Madrid Commercial Court for the 16th, has triggered a new thunderstorm in the Álvarez family's lap.
The Court of Justice's appeal to the Assembly is the only legal way to ensure the convocation of the Joint Assembly.
The last strategy of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta y Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is interpreted by David Álvarez as a "desperate means of the applicants - his five children - to be recognized by means of legal sprinklings, fraudulent machinations and abuses of justice the annulled meeting of 18 January", as official spokespersons explain.
This argumentation is the basis for the retrofitting challenge of the congregation to declare it "absolutely void".
The same protagonists, encased in discreet silence, already tried unsuccessfully to convene a meeting on a judicial basis in June.
At El Enebro's property company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, alongside other assets, David Álvarez's seven children control 100 percent of the capital.
On the other hand, according to family protocols, the founder of the service group demands the right to use more than 51% of the capital.
This is the actual background of the case on which the judge has to decide in the hearing to deal with the appeals for which no date has yet been set.
Red Bull wins in the F1 with a secret weapon by Siemens
The cars are improved with a software in real time.
Since Red Bull entered the world of Formula One in 2004, its history in this exquisite universe is marked by the speed of surprises and successes.
At the beginning, no one paid attention to the newcomer and despite his steep ascent during the last season, all of them took the victory of Fernando Alonso's Ferrari at the end of November.
Without wishing to lower the capabilities of the German pilot and world champion Sebastian Vettel or the power of the Renault engine, the "secretive weapon" that the Multi Siemens Red Bull laid in his hands and thus created a winning team has become a legend.
In reality, this is a powerful software to simulate processes that the German company launched in 2007 for purposes that do not have to do with car racing.
This software, known as PLM, was used for the development of assembly chains in factories around the world, energy plants and highly precise instruments.
The purpose of a faithful reproduction or simulation of a product or process is to avoid errors and unnecessary costs before it is actually built.
PLM has facilitated the development of the Canon cameras, the Sukhoi aircraft and Nissan's most famous commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, Head of the Siemens Industrial Department, explains that with the use of this software in Formula 1 - Factory Red Bull "in a few hours, almost in real time" the changes and improvements that can be found on the races and during the tests can design and execute.
Russwurm explains that in 1992 an average of ten technicians worked in the racing stables, who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements in one season.
In Red Bull's team today, 180 highly qualified young people are employed. With powerful computer systems, they perform analyses and all kinds of changes to the race car.
The Siemens Manager stated that the PLM software was able to analyse and improve all components of the Red Bull racing cars, except for the engine for which Renault is solely responsible.
The materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are modified.
The changes can be transferred from the virtual reality of the simulator to reality within less than 24 hours thanks to advanced production facilities and high-tech autoclaves.
The only limit set for this crazy technical perfectionism is the 40 million dollars a Formula 1 team can spend for its race in a season.
Red Bull has built its high-tech factory for the development and manufacture of its racing cars in a location 50 kilometres from London.
These are two buildings where visits - especially by journalists - are very limited.
All that happens there is Top Secret.
The workforce comprises 580 people, including the two pilots, the world champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
But Red Bull's true Formula 1 hero is undoubtedly the newest world champion Sebastian Vetell.
Behind the enormous technological resources put by the energy drink manufacturer in the services of his participation on the racetracks are other protagonists, whose support is invaluable and whose reputation is equal to zero.
The plant's technologist Steve Nevey emphasises that five years ago it was possible to say that the R&D progress in the field of racing cars contributed 50 percent to the victory and the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today the share values have changed. Technology accounts for 85 percent of the success, while the contribution of pilots is estimated at 15 percent.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel and Webber can never be replaced by computerized, because they are "unpredictable gladiators".
HP will open twenty own stores in two years with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) opened his first exclusive shop in collaboration with his partner Ront Reyes yesterday in Barcelona.
It is the first of a network of 20 shops, each with 80 to 100 square meters, which the multi intends to open in Spain over the next two years.
The company agreed to this initiative with the existing 16 sales areas in multi-brand operations, such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The deputy chairman of HP España, Helena Herrero, mentioned as an example the converted shop at Gran Vía in Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with which HP has been working for thirty years.
The North American Group intends to set up 200 sales outlets in Europe by 2010, of which 20 are in Spain.
The first were inaugurated last week in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia). Barcelona is the third business.
Herrera did not want to betray the upcoming openings, but did not rule out that Madrid could be the next goal.
The deputy chairman, who is also the head of HP Personal Systems, assured that the philosophy of shop opening is always the same. They rely on a local distributor with experience and industry knowledge.
The North American group of companies advises them and takes over the exclusive shop equipment (with interactive products to touch).In Europe, all stores will look the same.
HP is also responsible for training shop staff.
Helena Herrero said that it is not a franchise system and emphasized that the exclusive sales outlet network is intended to "optimise customer service and consulting small and micro enterprises when purchasing and after that, even packaging."
The shop in Barcelona has a pioneer pilot program that solves the technical problems of HP devices with warranty.
An online service connects to the technical headquarters in Maastricht (Holland).
"This way we can solve problems in ten minutes, which sometimes take up to two days."
"This system has been developed especially for small and micro enterprises and private customers, because large companies already have their service contracts for technical customer service," said Helena Herroro yesterday.
Sabadell wants to steal a million customers from his rivals in three years' time
The Executive Board member of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, is more optimistic than other managers. He believes that 2001 will be a tough year for the banks, but initially rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the debt war.
Nevertheless, it foresees a fall in interest rates which banks are trying to offset with increases in fees and prices for loans.
Sabadell expects to catch a million private customers in three years' time - a subject still too existing.
Sabadell has found the way to take advantage of the next three years and thus survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The Bank will introduce a new three-year guidance plan in 2011.
The objective is not only to survive without using public aid from the FROB, but also to increase the market share by a million private customers - 700 000 if the customers who will lose the bank - which is the major challenge facing this bank, as it has so far paid more attention to its business customers than to its private customers.
This year it has added 250 000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Their market share in private customers is 3.5 percent, while business customers account for more than 10 percent.
Another principle of the business plan 2011-2013 is the increase in productivity, i.e. austerity, cost reduction. The challenges facing the bank will be presented together with an annual financial report.
Few banks dare to set and publish targets in these difficult times, as the financial crisis has confused all the banks' plans around the world.
This year, Sabadell will complete its guidance plan on Optima, which was originally designed for three years, but was extended by one financial year as a result of the market situation.
The clients who will leave the savings banks are the main objective of the bank.
At a breakfast organized by the API, Guardiola stressed that 2011 would be a "silence" year "with great reach".
The manager assumes that Spain will only be "slow" out of the crisis.
In addition, it would be "very difficult" to "create work" in two or three years - fundamental for the survival of the banks.
Even if he assumes that the war for liabilities - which punishes the interest margins - will be averted, the risk surcharges, banks and savings banks will have to pay for their emissions to preserve liquidity, as compensation for declining profit margins will already shift to the price of loans.
"The topics of liquidity and financing are structural and they will exert pressure on the loans."
"We didn't turn the cock off, but the interest differentials are very high," admitted Guardiola.
On Thursday, Banesto issued an order to its branch network to limit the granting of long-term loans and to increase interest differentials (cf. Cinco Días of 22 and 27 November).
The manager also agreed that the banks were currently pursuing the government , "to increase fees", but "within a competitive framework".
Sabadell's timetable is based on organic growth, even though the group, as always, does not exclude corporate business.
Not in vain, he assures that in Spain "larger companies are necessary."
"In the coming year, everything will change," he assures.
He stressed that the need for capital is currently "increasingly high" and did not rule out that some Spanish financial institutions would slip in red numbers.
He believes that the FROB could replace the money market in the case of captitata stockpiles.
After ensuring that Sabadell can also survive a temporary closure of the markets, he dispels the argument of some bankers who are already predicting a new liquidity crisis.
He stressed that there could be nothing in circulation, but unlike the incidents in June, one could achieve short-term financing through repo transactions and thus reduce the crisis.
CECA excludes a second wave of mergers of savings banks
The Director-General of CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday rejected the possibility of a wave of mergers between the savings banks and stressed the speed with which the industry was being restructured.
When the concentration process of the Spanish savings banks began, several savings banks did not participate in the first phase. They reserved the second round.
On the other hand, the Director-General of the Spanish Sparkassenverband (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured that this second round would not take place.
"I believe that most of the mergers have been completed. The inclusion of Cajasol in the Banca Cívica group cannot be considered a second round, rather it was adjustments."
"Most of it is completed. It may be that we have thirteen or fourteen instead of seventeen, but all the important processes have already been completed. They have been controlled by Banco de España, who has strongly supported all the processes."
At a breakfast organized by the Association of Managing Directors and Managers of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarrieta stated that the concentration process "was carried out as soon as possible and that we must be satisfied with the time-consuming process set in earlier times, not now, as part of the business plans with Banco de España," he stressed.
"The transition from 45 savings banks with an average of 28 000 million assets to 17 with 75 500 million each is a historically incomparable process. The number of financial institutions has been reduced by 62 percent and they are now much larger, which we have fulfilled the Basel Agreement," he emphasized.
Olavarrieta said, "There are a number of unabated opinions about the slowness of the process, which revealed unscrupulousness and insanity," because "Banco de España exhorts us to close it in time before the end of the year."
CECA Director-General José Antonio Olavarrieta assured yesterday that Spain had one of the most rigorous financing systems in Europe and "perhaps" in the world and added that those who doubted this "without deeper knowledge".
The manager noted that in the current economic economy, we must not worry about the situation of financial institutions and savings banks that have experienced a "very significant" concentration process that will be carried out "as soon as possible".
He also recalled that the Spanish banks had passed the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July very well.
Zapatero and the red line of Germany
Berlin has opted for the maintenance of the euro, but at the same time has set conditions for the whole of the European Union.
The tensions in the markets have triggered a double response from the government.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has presented new adaptation measures, starting with tax reductions for small and micro enterprises, the regulation of temporary workers or the abolition of the EUR 426 for unemployed who do not receive unemployment benefit, up to the privatisation of 49 percent of AENA, the management of Barajas and El Prat airports, and 30 percent of the state lottery.
On the other hand, with the help of former President Felipe González, the Deputy Head of Government, Elena Salgado, supports the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel as the person responsible for the current crisis.
How can these processes be understood?
It should be anticipated that Merkel's position is not a mistake in her public relations work.
On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of redefinition of the euro.
Germany is taking on a fundamental new perspective on the design of our future, which collides with the maintenance of the old-fashioned traditions of a large part of its partners.
In view of the resistance in Europe, one begins to speculate in Germany about three possible ways out of the crisis.
The first: A strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the south had to leave the euro area.
The Second: The re-introduction of the German Mark - although it is now more like Science Fiction -, supported by a large majority of public opinion, about 50 percent of the population.
The third: a reorganisation of the euro according to German proposals. This means: greater macroeconomic control; strict budgetary management; punishment of countries that exceed the targets; possibly the adjustment of some countries and the extension of the cost of potential adjustment measures to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been emerging for some time. Therefore, there are no excuses now.
First in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission created incentives for deficits and the German government drew out of the sleeve a constitutional reform to prevent this from happening from 2016.
This was the first sign of the disintegrating between what Germany considered necessary (severe tax plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France.
The second sign put the Central European country when Merkel painfully pushed out the decision to save Greece.
But the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public and the published opinion were absolutely against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October, Merkel has come out with a clear position, calling for a reform of the European Union's agreements to enable a country's salvation and, at the same time, for private lenders to bear part of the costs.
This position was interpreted as anti-European, as it was driving the Irish crisis and all the following forward.
But their proposal, although sweetened, has been adopted, and in the coming months we will participate in the reform of the European Union, which will enable these measures to take place from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that does not intend to exceed it.
It tells everyone that, even if unpopular measures have to be taken now, the old functioning of the euro will no longer exist from this date.
2013 will be the year of the birth of a new currency area in which the infringinging countries will be severely punished, forced to declare themselves ineffective and in this case the private sector will have to bear part of the costs.
Germany shows us that we have to take a hard growth rate, with high savings and investment rates, consumption moderation, improved productivity and competitiveness, as well as positive external balances.
The other alternative, which is based on debt and construction with huge holes in the balance of payments, as pointed out by Spain in boom times, will simply not be accepted.
The offer is clear.
And we'd do bad not to understand.
It's not just about cutting the state deficit down to three percent by 2013.
The demands are much harder.
And the worst thing we could do under these conditions is cheat ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulences will go into more calm.
And that we will use the opportunities offered to us by spring 2013.
It seems that Zapatero understood this too, and his double announcement (the promised reforms after the meeting with the big companies last Saturday and the announcement of new measures yesterday) points out that despite the criticism of Merkel, the hypothesis of creating order in one's own home has set its course.
But the red line drawn by Germany is there, and it doesn't look like something would change.
Among the options considered, we should not exclude the fact that we should leave the euro area fully stuffed with few serious countries.
In this case, Germany could still tell us it warned us.
Sports and regulation
Tricks like those of Alonso and Ramos in the game against the Ajax show ingenuity, but not the will to circumvent a sanction.
The exclusion in the game of November 23 against the Ajax in the Champions League (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) supposedly led to a lot of ink being poured over whether it was an unsportable act or not and whether both players should possibly be sanctioned by the UEFA.
As is common knowledge, the two players lost time a few minutes before playing (their team had already clearly won) and played several fouls so that the referee showed them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since Real Madrid would lead his group, the two players will meet the prescribed penalty at the next game against the Auxerre and thus enter the next stage without cards.
Finally, UEFA's disciplinary committee punished the club's coach José Mourinho with two games and the players involved with different amounts of money.
The provocation of a yellow card under such or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is more common in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos - the unwritten rules, but followed in this sport.
Part of the debate on the case presented is based on the fact that a team of the Real Madrid football club (who pretends in his anthem of grace and honor and on other occasions punished his players for similar incidents) played the leading role in this, and the dramatisation by Mourinho, who added an episode more to his long history as a theatrical and provocative technician.
In any case, the debate is about whether this behaviour, which is not explicitly prohibited by the statutes, contradicts the principles of sport, i.e. whether these actions constitute a regular circumvention. In fact, this approach adheres to the statutes of sport, but seems to circumvent its meaning.
In this case, the damage caused to the sports spirit should be examined.
The sports spirit defends the physical integrity of the opponent, an aspect that was not threatened by these actions, for it was no aggressive game.
Another aspect of a clean game is to prevent the offending players from taking an unjustified advantage of the opposing team, and that didn't happen either.
The paradox of the action of the players of Real Madrid is that it does not correspond to what we normally mean by cheating or evasion, because the circumvention of the rule has not been carried out secretly to avoid a sanction, but it should be as striking as possible to be punished by the arbitrator.
The players waited and accepted the sanction joyfully.
Another question is what kind of advantage the infringers drew from the intentional fouls.
It should be stressed here that the rival was not brought into a more unfavorable situation or gained benefits for the game played, because the obvious result of this action was that the team had to continue playing with fewer players.
It is also not a useful strategy for the next game, because the club does not have these players.
The advantage is obviously that players begin the next stage of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future game.
But it's a long-term, to a certain degree uncertain advantage, as the team could eventually leave. Moreover, the players receive a penalty with this procedure and move into the second card cycle, in which they leave for card accumulation with a card less than in the first cycle.
It is not so clear whether this is really an advantage.
Finally, such actions are not directed against the sports spirit, including strategic decisions to benefit from the rules as much as possible.
In this case, the players did not want to circumvent a sanction (that would actually be a clear case of regular circumvention), but rather they wanted to choose when they were going to undergo it.
They made a strategic decision without avoiding or fleeing a punishment.
Although the boundary between inventiveness and the environment is blurred, I believe that this matter is a clear case of invention.
I have the impression that the polemics was created as a result of two factors: because it was two self-exclusions and because of the nature of the provoked transmission of rules.
The damage done to the principles of sport by these actions is less ethical than aesthetic.
Offer for customer catch for group Christmas dinner in Barcelona
The dictatorship of the calendar will drop this year an avalanche of reservations to the days 16 and 17 December.
The celebrations paid by employees themselves spread out. They do not want to spend more than 20 to 30 euros.
Like the Turrón and the Christmas lottery, there are also group dinners in the pre-Christmas season that lead the hospitality and leisure business of Barcelona. But as a result of the economic crisis, they trigger a price offensive to catch the customer segment that represents the great mass: almost everyone would like to spend between 20 and 30 euros for a lunch or dinner, confirm the surveyed entrepreneurs and entrepreneurs.
To make the accounting even more complicated, the calendar (silvester falls to one Friday) dropped all orders in the week of December 13, with the result of an avalanche of reservations of dinner on two top days (the 16th and 17th) and almost no orders in the week before.
Since 2008, when the bad times began, many companies have stopped the group dinner for household reasons.
In order not to have to give up this tradition, many workers pay them out of their own pocket.
In any case, whatever the economic situation, the lowest prices are required, confirms Gaietà Farràs, chairman of the Barcelona Gastronomy Board.
So far, the representative of the Roof Association dares not predict what the holidays will look like this month.
"People think about it forty times before they reserve."
"They would like to go out, but they pay great attention to the prices," he emphasizes.
The business will go well with those who "offer quality at good prices with a good service," he adds, and reminds us that customers are saving in times of crisis, which is why prices around 25 euros are most requested.
In a survey in several centrally located restaurants, it turns out that the evening of December 17 will lead the provider to the collapse.
The group Soteras says that the demand for this Friday with the intention of spending less than 30 euros would be booming. The group has adapted its menus with complete offerings between 25 and 35 euros to the economic situation.
With another leading group, Andilana, which has 16 restaurants in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar has led to preferred reservations, even from the beginning of November.
"We have made it possible to maintain the previous year's prices with menus for every taste from 19,95 to 30 euros," he explains.
With AN Grop, which manages El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 locals, optimism is not lost after the revenue has been flourishing again since the second quarter, and good prospects for the Christmas business, even though they are focused on a few days.
Sources of the group emphasize that the 18th will also be an overactive day with groups of friends who celebrate Christmas.
A Christmas menu for 30 euros or more has been added to the six group menus. It is felt that customers are willing to spend 10 percent more than in the previous year and want more details in return, such as Cava.
In some companies too, green sprouts can be seen, which is why the employees are invited again. This gives the impression that the group dinners are back on the rise.
From the roof association Fecasarm (with associations such as the Bar, Restaurant and Leisure Association of Barcelona), the deputy chairman, Enric Gomà, trusts to see the end of the tunnel and notes that the reservations in general are quite "living", although customers "beat out a maximum".
The fun of celebrating, however, has not gone back, no matter who pays.
The Pakistani nuclear programme is a source of great concern in the USA
Islamabad "makes nuclear weapons faster than any other country".
Revelations of Wikileaks confirm relations between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the North American Embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. Department revealed by Wikileaks' Internet portal confirms the enormous concerns of the Pakistani nuclear program Washington.
On the brink of the clearing and juicy details that the documents on the content of the talks and the thinking of the accredited North American diplomats in Islamabad reveal that cooperation between the two countries is not strengthened in terms of nuclear security, but rather "reduces" and that the unstable Asian country produces more nuclear weapons "to a faster rhythm than any other country".
In particular, the peculiarity of the Pakistani nuclear programme - that the weapons are not composed, but their parts are stored to make their destruction difficult in the event of a possible attack - prepare Washington sleepless nights.
The following risks include the Ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, in a report before the visit of the former Head of the National Security Council, James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear installations to the area under attack by the Taliban, the likely scattering of the nuclear material and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear material."
The large number of people involved in nuclear and rocket programs is not only regarded by the US, but also by Russia as exodus and reason to exercise caution.
"Pakistan has to recruit strictly believing personnel to monitor nuclear installations; due to the low level of education and culture, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who participate in nuclear or rocket programs," said expert Yuri Korolev from the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs in a meeting with his North American offices.
New to the documentation revealed by Julian Assange's Internet Portal is that cooperation between the US and Pakistan in the field of nuclear distribution is falling and the increased pace in which Pakistan manufactures nuclear weapons.
In May, an office of the Embassy, which describes communication with Pakistan as "frustrating", explains: "There is often no transparency; we do not receive any answers or they will be rejected on aid offerings."
In another communication, Peter Lavoy, official of the state intelligence service for South Asia, confirms that "despite the economic disaster of Pakistan, nuclear weapons are produced as quickly as no other country."
Ambassador Patterson asks Washington, during a visit by the Chief Army Chief, General Ashfaq Kayani, to "clarify" the responsible person that "Pakistan's army has to stop its silent support for terrorist groups."
On the hunt for Wikileak's boss
Obama appoints a high responsible for the anti-terrorism struggle to prevent new revelations.
Interpol issued a red warning for the persecution and discovery of Assange.
Everything related to Wikileaks and its founder, Jullian Assange, is a complicated labyrinth in which the facts are difficult to explain.
Yesterday, Interpol issued a "red warning" to Assange's "finding and persecuting".
However, this is not a traditional order for arrest.
Besides, it's not new, it's from November 20th.
It has nothing to do with the last revelation of more than four million diplomatic documents from the United States, but with the accusations of sexual abuse that the Australian has to face in Sweden.
In addition, the lawyer of the founder of Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, "the police knew where and how to contact Mr. Assange."
Already on the 20th, the international police authority based in Lyon, France, issued the order at the request of Sweden, but it was not announced until yesterday after receiving the authority from the Swedish authorities.
The 188 Interpol countries need to identify and find Assange, "to arrest and deliver it for the time being."
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red warning, according to the statements of the organisation, many member countries consider the red warning to be a free letter of arrest - which must be carried out by the national police - especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, such as the case of Sweden and England, where Assange is likely to be present.
The procedure annoyed Assange’s lawyers, who had written a letter informing them that the 39-year-old founder of Wikileaks is willing to answer the questions of the Swedish authorities by video conference.
They also recall that Assange applied for departure from Sweden and was granted the appropriate approval by the prosecutor, who is compared with the legendary Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, head of security of Stalin.
"It's like a hunt, not like a legal persecution," is charged in the letter.
While the world is looking for him - and his mother from Australia is proving her son's innocence - Assange is staying in an unknown place, but not silent.
On Monday, he gave an interview to the director of Time per Skype magazine from an indefinite location. During the discussion, he requested the resignation of the Secretary of State of the United States, Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be demonstrated that it was responsible for the arrangement of North American diplomats to spy out the UN and thus breached international agreements signed by the USA, it would have to resign," he said.
His opinion was condemned yesterday by the White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, who called the application for resignation "a ridiculous and absurd".
"I'm not sure why we should value the opinion of a type with a website," he explained to the station CNN.
Obama himself has commissioned a high-ranking leader for the anti-terrorism struggle, Rusell Travers, to prevent new document revelations.
The attempt of the speaker of the presiding Barack Obama to pay less attention to Assange is contrary to the opinions expressed by conservative politicians and commentators these days.
Congressman Peter King, who will be chair of the National Security Committee of the House of Representatives from January onwards, has asked the State Department to examine the possibility of placing Wikileaks on the list of terrorist organizations, "to seize their funds and to track anyone who supports them or makes a contribution."
Tom Flanagan, advisor to Canadian President Stephen Harper, was still on his way, and he had to withdraw his statement, Assange had to be "mordet".
"Obama would have to turn him into a target and use an unmanned plane or something."
Those who did not apologize were Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate.
"Whoever it was that sent information to the government, he was guilty of treason, and everything that is not an execution is a mild punishment," he told Fox.
Puigcercós seeks peace in the ERC with an eye wink to the Carod
The Republican leader shall allow the party a secret vote on its continuation in office.
Huguet proposes a more pluralistic government and the end of the general assembly principle.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found a recipe for the tenth time to avoid an internal riot in the ranks of the following the loss of 11 MEPs and half of the voter ERC.
The party leader is aware that his threat of resignation is not enough for the close-up of former party leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but he also knows that the influence of this sector today is as weakened as its mentor itself and will not give him the same headbreaks as other former currents.
Therefore, the leader of Esquerra tries to win the new critics with an eye wink, which would secure his position until the next municipal elections.
For the beginning, yesterday announced that the more than 200 regional council members of ERC could express a secret opinion on his remaining in office.
With constituencies, not with uplifted hands.
If the Carodists want to miss out on the President, they could do so without fear of repression.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid both the impression of division and the impression of submission among his person.
In several interviews he confirmed that he would feel unconfirmed with half of the votes plus one, and he added without stating percentages, a result "in Bulgarian style" would not be good either.
The members of the Carod call upon the President to make his office available more than only to the Party. An inadequate gesture, as Puigcercós controls the highest organ of the Congresses.
But since they do not have a sufficient majority to force resignations, they will agree with the Board of Directors a plan of action from now until May.
They expect to be able to participate in the preparation of the document on strategic reorientation, which will be submitted to the Council for vote on the 18th.
Their intention is to guarantee Puigcercós. In return, he is to promise to present the congress in autumn 2011, which the top of the party already considers to be a fact.
The party chairman of the ERC considers that the "polyphony" is harmful to stability and he tries once and for all to enable the organization to wash their dirty laundry behind closed doors.
In this sense, the article signed by the acting conseller Josep Huguet in his blog is symptomatic.
In view of the fact that Puigcercós is an ideologist, the owner of Innovació considered it a fact that the party chairman was supported "in exchange for different goals".
He counted five, of which two are in the foreground.
First, the "restructuring" of the board so that it represents at least 90 percent of the party members, that is, the inclusion of new faces from Carod's environment.
The second could be the big news.
Huguet suggests that ERC should finally abandon the general assembly principle as a functioning.
He thus defends a reform of the Statutes, which will allow Congresses to hold with elected delegates.
From the end of the general assembly model - an exception in the Spanish party system - Puigcercós' team, which already fought for it at the last two congresses, is as possessed.
In fact, at the 2008 trembling assembly, the Party leadership was commissioned to review the principle of the assembly at a congress to deal with the reform of the Statutes.
This appointment is still pending, since information on the internal rest of the last few years has not been advisable in dealing with this matter.
Now, without the critical sectors on the watch, the time may have come to take up this matter again and to close it forever.

Next to him, the police found a cardboard with a message.
China continues to maintain its greenhouse gas reduction targets
At COP16, the representative of China stated that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce carbon traces and that it would maintain its offer to reduce 40 to 45 percent of its greenhouse gases by 2020.
China holds its offer to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, says Su Wei, the representative of this country at COP16.
At his first public appearance at the 16th World Climate Summit of the United Nations (COP16), Su Wei assured that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce carbon traces and to convert its industry.
He stated that in the last four years, his country had invested 245 million dollars to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
On the other hand, he stated that China would not change its goals, but would work on this issue together with the international community.
He explained that the Chinese strategy for climate change is divided into four aspects: dialogue, capacity building, institution building and support for pilot programmes.
In all aspects, progress has been made, including the adoption of a new energy law last year, which includes the objectives of reducing the emissions of gases.
On the other hand, it stressed that in China the authorities of the states cooperated with those of the central state and the municipalities in order to achieve the objectives of energy saving, effective use of energy and reduction of emissions.
In addition, he pointed out, some multiannual plans have already been launched or completed, both those financed by the Chinese government and those received funds from other countries.
For example, he referred to the programme for the effective use of energy, which has been introduced over the last five years and received investment from the United Nations (UNO), the government and private hands.
There is also a project at the provincial level on climate change, another on the exchange of traditional bulbs by energy-saving bulbs and another on mitigating and adapting, he said.
Martin Krol, Scientific Government Advisor on climate change in this country, confirmed that China's efforts would be far greater than generally assumed.
He pointed out that the per capita greenhouse gas emissions in China amount to six tonnes per person, while in the United States it is 100 tonnes. China is responsible for a nine-percent total contribution to environmental pollution.
It is also making unprecedented progress in the field of energy use. Energy efficiency has been increased by twenty percent over the last five years and is expected to take place by 2020, he said.
Legal exclusion Espinos: César Nava
The National Leader of the PAN stated that the former Panist Party chairman had the right to contact the National Committee on the Rules of Procedure and to demand what the right would be to him.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that Manuel Espino Barriento's exclusion was right and that the former party chairman of the PAN had the right to contact the National Committee on the Rules of Procedure and ask what the right would be to him.
In an interview that took place before the complaint Gabino Cué Monteagudos as governor of the state, he stated that the exclusion of Espino was a decision taken at local level.
"This is an independent decision of the Rules Commission in Sonora."
"Mr Espino has the right to address the Comisión de Orden del Consejo Nacional in his case, so that a decision is taken by a competent body," he added.
On the other hand, he stated that it was not time to think about 2012 and that an alliance to the presidential candidates had never sat at the negotiating table.
Nava Vázquez was convinced that Acción Nacional was strengthened by the internal vote on the next 4 and 5 December in which his successor was elected.
"This (an alliance in 2012) is a topic that was never on the negotiating table, at least not until now. It was a proposal for the municipal election, it was successful and fulfilled its purpose," he said.
The Panist leader said that the PAN looks back on 71 years of dialogue, so "don't scare us of internal competition; on the contrary, "we enjoy it and it strengthens us," he commented.
He said that the Council would no doubt choose the one or the best chairman, who needs Acción Nacional for the next three years, and that is why he would hand over the staff "to those whom the Council would determine."
"I am very unconcerned and open there. I would be proud to delegate the office of party chairman to each of the Five."
He predicted that the party's upturn recorded in the last elections of July 4 would be reflected in the next elections, although "it is not time to think about 2012."
"Now it's about supporting Governor Gabino Cué in his task."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments, which emerged from alliances between Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa, carry the flag and would be observed throughout the country. Therefore, "many hopes and longings are placed in it and I am sure that Gabino is at the level of the requirements."
When he was asked about the criticism of the PRI to President Felipe Calderón for his discrepancies in the framework of his four-year government, César Nava called on the followers of the PRI to reflect on the six-year period of former President Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI believes that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calderón, they should start defending them, they should finally come out of the closet," he affirmed.
He believes that the owner of the federal government would make expressions like those he could make in his discourse in the Auditorio Nacional, because in this country there would be no mouth ban and even less a censorship.
Obama stands up for the law in behalf of undocumented students in Twitter
"If you are in favour of the adoption of the Dream Act law, call your senators and insist on the adoption of this law," the president of the United States tweeted in the popular social network.
President Barack Obama today supported national mobilization to support the Dream Act - Law on the legalization of undocumented students with a message on his personal blog on the social network Twitter.
"If you are in favour of the adoption of the Dream Act law, call your senators and insist on the adoption of this law," Obama tweeted.
Its short notice contains a cyberlink to a more extensive document that calls on the public to contact its senators, as the vote of the law is imminent.
"With your voice we are waiting for, the time has come to listen to you," he emphasizes.
The news was spread after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block all votes for any law, except the extension of tax reductions from the Bush times and the financing of the government would be extended.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican Senators, could affect the vote of the Dream Act - law and other projects such as the ratification of the new START agreement with Russia against the spread of nuclear weapons.
Commenting on the blockade of Republicans of the Dream Act Act and other projects, President Robert Gibbs said he trusted that once the tax issue has been resolved, a timetable could be set for the other projects.
"I think we still have a lot of time..."
"We all agree that tax matters must be settled before the end of the year..."
"I think we can make an agreement on this at any time and then we can plan the rest of it," he said.
The chairman of the democratic majority in the Senate, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday that "he would request the vote at the end of the debate" so that the Dream Act - law, with which the initiative to legalize undocumented students could be voted in the Senate from the next Thursday, although the next week would be more likely.
The version of the Dream Act law or the law of the American dream would legalize about 800,000 young people who emigrated to the United States when they were not yet sixteen years old, lived in that country for the last five years, and enrolled in a higher educational institution or army.
But the advocates of the law need sixty votes to adopt the initiative, which is why they depend on the voices of a handful of Republicans. Currently, the organizations of the advocates of this project organize an intensive influence on the adoption of the law.
The Democrats, of which the majority support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, one of them, Senator Ben Nelson from Nebraska, said he would vote against it and only one Republican, Richard Lugar from Indiana, announced his support of the law.
Therefore, the defenders of the Dream Act must get several Republicans to their side if other democrats choose to turn their backs on the initiative.
Among the most advertised Republicans are those from Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as Senator George Lemieux from Florida, who took over the mandate of Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch from Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson from Texas, but they declared that they no longer support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who voted in favour of the law, John McCain, has not yet determined his attitude.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, the analysts agree that the Dream Act in the Senate is facing the biggest obstacles.
Put your finger in the wound with literature
The second round of 'The Lust of the Language' was a walk in which the participants made themselves strong for the narrative
"I understand that with the sex in the language, but... The finger in the wound? What is expected of me?", asked writer Luisa Valenzuela, who was to open the second round of 'Los placeres de la lengua', a cycle that celebrated Spanish literature and used the subtitle of her question on this occasion (at another event, the round table was dedicated to sex in the language, she explained).
The finger in the wound... "brings us in trouble," the Argentine writingist sweetly spits out to the audience, composed mainly of young people who met at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara (FIL) to attend this round table moderated by Marisol Shultz, in which Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero participated.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio and then marked the Shultz as a great story. Luisa tells in the first person and is the protagonist who is looking for what is a "wound" and goes from doctor to doctor, of whom she does not receive an answer, but gives clues to the guide to her narrative.
She leaves the infectologist convinced: "Patience is not my strength, perhaps it is my wound."
Finally, after a frustrating approach to the traumatologist, who took her breath in the middle of the corridor, and who explains to her that wound is not a scientific term, the psychoanalyst reveals the mystery: "The wound is really open, the symbolic is the scar."
The main character of the story sighs and concludes that she " only learned from the wound that it is really open and does not exist." But she is convinced that the desire for language and its traps mix.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also introduced a delightful story, which he called 'Lob of invention', and in which the finger in the wound is not mentioned, but discovered.
With allusions to magical realism, he tells of a famous sorcerer who touched the clouds, brought back far-traveled men, or restored the virtue lost by a girl. The narrative made a turn of events and reported on America, the great novel that did not lack his own chronicles from the beginning, and he quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who criticized the abundance of the stories told by the conquerors.
"Cervantes, who invited all of us (the writers), mocked the pretended witnesses who appeared in the stories presented as true, but in other ways the history of America would never have been told - with imagination, who even lost the feeling of shame."
However, he emphasizes that "it is the crazy and liars who best imagine things", and there reality and lies approach each other, where one no longer knows which side the narrative belongs to, where fictitious literature reaches the summit.
He actually calls it the 'Tradition Cervantes'.
"We have inherited from him what is told."
When Mayra Montero was on the line, the writer commented and praised the diversity of interpretations to which the Fil's invitation to the Round Table 'The Finger in the Wound' had contributed.
The Cuban and Puerto Rican devoted her contribution to the great wound of social violence that invading her country - like all of Latin America - as a result of the struggles for drug trafficking.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a silent, not intentional commitment," she explained, after stressing that literature is communication and commitment that builds up between the author and the readers as in a "chemical reaction".
The evening was decided by the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose contribution also "this finger of the committed writer in the wound of the writer" hevorhob.
He noted that in a fast-moving world the intellectual habits and control of consciousness on dogmatisms also run out, and will forget, "that behind every confirmation stands a small no and behind every denial a small yes."
"To be in possession of our thoughts and reality, we must nuance: And nuances often mean putting our fingers in the wound and harassing those who feel much more comfortable when they think in the form of cartoons, in black and white, in prefabricated ideas without nuances, and also harassing the powerful who prefer to divide the world into black and white, and invited one to rediscover the meaning of writing.
Romano fights for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano looks back at three defeats in endgames, he has experienced Aufs and Abs in his career, but he played decisive games three times.
In the duel between Santos Laguna and Monterrey at the end of the game, there are also two different styles set by their respective trainers, and their opposite-marked encounters are reflected in the results.
Rubén Omar Romano looks back at three defeats in endgames, he has experienced Aufs and Abs in his career, but he has had decisive games three times, and so far he has kept himself well, which is why this opportunity is of particular importance to him.
The Argentinian has played his second champion with the medal, he is a step behind the winners, and surprisingly he has played with the same team in consecutive matches.
The Santist strategy reached the first final match as a coach at the 'Torneo Apertura 2002', when del Morelia had the reins in his hand, with which he experienced a great defeat against Toluca with 4-2; later, at the 'Clausura 2003' he achieved the decisive duel he lost with 3-1 against Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna on the 'Torneo Bicentenario 2010', in which they played against Los Diablos, Rubén had to strike back again, as the game ended with 2-2 against Los Choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but at the Elfmeter he came forward with 3-1 and got two ways to put his title, but eventually three of his players missed the eleven steps and the game turned to a 4-3.
Rubén had already lost two finals with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his great rival. Therefore, he does not want to be persecuted again by the accident and free himself from the evil spell in order to be able to celebrate a title for the first time, although he affirms that the most important thing for him is the game itself.
"I want to become a champion, I don't want to break any statistics, that's for a club, for my affection I give myself, and that's why the title will come to me, but what happened before is the most important thing," the tax collector commented when he was asked about the lost endgames.
The last final game has remained in his memory, he assures him that he has learned a lot from it: "The only lesson we can draw from it is that until the arbitrator does not whistle the end, we cannot celebrate, we are prepared on the line, the players too, because the last time we were prepared to leave with two eleven meters, and I believe that this is a teaching, until the game is not finished, there is no occasion to celebrate."
Knowing that this series could be decided by elf-meter shooting does not concern him, because he trusts his players: "You never want to arrive at the elf-meter shooting, you want to finish in the regular season, but sometimes there is no alternative and you have to be prepared for it, in the previous tour we were prepared, but unfortunately fate prepared us a bad game, sometimes due to nervousness or the intense desire to hold the title in our hands, which left us something for this final game, and we hope that it won't happen this time."
It is in Romanso power to be no longer just the second champion and to taste the glory the titles bring with them for the first time.
The US amends the rules for obtaining a visa
People must introduce themselves to the visa application services before they talk to the consulate; costs will be reduced in this way.
From 10 January 2011, the procedures for applying for a visa in the Embassy of the United States and in the Consulates will change.
In the new procedure, most applicants must present themselves to the visa application services (ASC, the initial letters in English) prior to their consultation in the consulate.
The staff of the ASC shall record the applicant's biometric data, which shall be reviewed by the consulate prior to the discussion.
The new procedure has certain advantages for the aspirators, including:
The total cost of processing the visa is reduced, since it is no longer necessary to pay separately the appointment date, the processing of the visa application and the transport service with which the document is handed out.
The applicant shall provide only one payment covering the three services.
The current price remains unchanged: the counterpart to 140 dollars for a tourist visa, 150 dollars for visas with application (including temporary visas) and 390 dollars for hands and investors.
Those who only want to extend their visas do not need to have a conversation in the consulate, they only have to imagine themselves at the next ASC, where they present their documents and their fingerprints are taken.
As the biometric data is collected in the ASC, applicants who need a second date for the consultation in the consulate remain there less time than before.
Those who apply for the visa in the consulates of Ciudad Juice, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo no longer have to pay the service charge of 26 dollars.
Additional information on the new visa application procedure can be found on the following website: http://mexico.usembasi.gov/boletines/sp101201_Visas-FAQs.html
NASA announces the discovery of extraterrestrial life
The North American Space Agency called a press conference to present tomorrow a find that will have an impact on the search for living beings in space.
The National Aerospace Authority (NASA) of the United States announces tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery that could confirm the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The find will be presented by astrobiology experts at a press conference at NASA's headquarters in Washington tomorrow at 1 p.m. This is a science that examines the origin, development, distribution and future of life in the universe.
When the press conference was convened, NASA assured that it would present "a supervisory fund for the search for extraterrestrial life", which led to speculation among experts from other countries.
The discovery could prove the theory that it could exist in enemy environments that have been thought to be uninhabitable so far, human-like creatures. The hypothesis was raised that these could transform into intelligent living beings - like humans - if their living conditions improved.
It seems to be a microbe found on the ground of Mono Lake in Yosemite Park Park, California. It lives there in an environment that was considered too toxic for all possible forms of life, as the lake is highly arsenic.
In some way, the microbial uses the arsenic as a survival resource. Taking this ability into account, the chances that there could be similar life on other planets that do not have our protective atmosphere.
When these organisms metabolise arsenic, it is proven, according to astrobiologists, that "there is a different form of life, a second form of life, which differs from that known to us."
The Space Agency will announce the actual reach of its funds at the press conference tomorrow, Thursday.
The conference is attended by geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who examines the possibility of life on Mars, and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who studies Titan (the largest moon of Saturn) on the question of whether its chemical composition resembles the Earth.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergencia and Patrón form an opposition block
With the reform of the Organ Law on Congress, the two-party system is introduced, they complain.
The 60th legislative period had just begun, and an opposition block had already been installed, led by the PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo delegates, who imagined himself independent. The four questioned: the introduction of the 'two-party system' into the chamber.
Before the beginning of the introduction session in the 60th legislative period, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez von Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo of the PRD and Patrón Montalvo weathered against the reform of the organ law, as it would exclude them.
With this reform, they repeated, a two-party system would be introduced, because now there would be two people, the same number as parties controlling Congress.
These four delegates, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones who voted against the Bureau led by the Panist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca in his capacity as Vice-Chairman.
Corvera Quevedo stated that the parties PRI and PAN had institutionally introduced their political margins with these reforms.
He pointed out that in the next few days they would talk to the representatives of PAN and PRI to change the scheme, starting from their political will and if they did not, they would again be unjust by both parties, which would put an end to the opposition coalition.
"Besides here I (the opposition coalition), that's what I see, because we are excluded from all decisions, they don't even take into account the opinions of the rest."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez von Convergencia declared that there were similarities with PRD, PT and Patrón and that therefore a pluralist group would be formed.
It cannot be admitted, he continued that after being monopolistic, the Congress should now be "duopolistic".
"It is not the spirit of law reform that an eternal two-party system should exist in Congress."
"For the beginning, this group starts with five Members and they talk to other colleagues to make them more," said Convergence's member.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of PT pointed out in allusion to PAN and PRI that the Congress was currently transformed into a 'beet' for two.
"Before that, it was just a party, now they split it up for two."
Patrón Montalvo requested that Members be respected and assigned their place to the negotiating tables.
"The five who are currently seen as being divided into different political groups have decided to unite in order to take our place at the negotiating table, because it is because of the reform carried out and agreed upon by the others that we have remained outside and we do not agree with this reform."
200 000 peso more for the "supplier"
The city administration of Mazatlán pays another check to the controversial owner of the company for electrical material.
Another check over just over 200,000 peso in favour of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuenos was issued by the city administration.
Thus, the sum paid to the owner of the company for electrical equipment in the second half of the year is 1 200 000 pesos.
According to the page for greater transparency of the city administration, the check issued on 200,144,56 peso with the number 9258447 was issued on the last 16 November with the purpose of "acquiring open invoices".
Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had already sent forward that more money would go from the community to this delivery agent. It is observed by the Auditoría Superior del Estado because it sells at overprices.
What has not been mentioned is the total amount still owed to it and, as a result, the number of cheques still being issued in favour of Camacho Palazuenos.
"There was nothing purchased from her, just the debts are paid, just like the other suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last checks "re-appeared" in the last quarter of the year: 24 September, two of 15 October, 19 October, 29 October and the last of 16 November.
Although the supplier has not yet been published in the Official Journal, as required by law, if a company is challenged by the ASE in order to avoid other administrations applying for their services, the treasurer assured that their services would not be recovered.
After the Noroeste newspaper had published on 25 July the audit of checks issued by the city administration to its suppliers, it was known that the municipality had already paid over 10 million pesos with 42 cheques to Camacho Palazuelos from March 2008 to 9 July 2010 during the three-year term of office of mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez.
Businesses with Jumapam also took place where they collected cheques worth more than 3 million peso.
Tourist places need to be improved
Tourist companies regret the accident of foreign tourists due to the bad condition of Glorita Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist into the collapse of Glorieta Sánchez Taboada, the tourism industry of Mazatlán asked the authorities to pay special attention to the areas in poor condition and to the port city.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, chairman of the Zona Dorada dealer association, recalled that on different occasions it was called upon to maintain the destination and to transform the bad conditions that tourists find into new employment opportunities or routes.
He said that the bad condition of the roads and walkways would have had a negative effect, as the tourists would be swerving and the disorder would see whereupon they would turn their backs on the nearby shops.
"The politicians don't know what it means to close a company one day and they don't think about how much money you lose, because otherwise they wouldn't do the construction in this way slowly and planlessly."
The hotel owner José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the fall of the tourist had drawn attention to the absence of prevention and maintenance work on the part of the city.
"The community must assume its responsibility and avoid such a thing happening again. How should it do this? Well, by means of preventive maintenance instead of improving everything afterwards," he explained.
"We are waiting eagerly for a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist area, it has to be maintained, but also we inhabitants have a right to a clean habitat. The city administration has to change its strategy to keep the city in good condition."
"There are other places that also look unfit and unfinished," he said, "for example, el Escudo y el Venadito by Mazatlán."
"Today we need more than just advertising to attract tourists. A good product has to be offered, a city that cleans its beaches and streets, and keeps the tourist attractions in constant fire," he added.
"These arrangements have not been given enough attention and these kinds of incidents are simply what is obvious to all: maintenance is urgently needed."
Raúl Llera Martínez, Under-Secretary of Promoción Turística, expressed the importance of saving the touristic places of Mazatlán, because they would not be used properly and made a bad picture.
He mentioned a number of places that would have to be brought to the fore with the city. To make the city clean, orderly and attractive for tourism should be priority.
"Happyly, Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural sites, which would initially have to be cleaned and cleaned in order to make them attractive to tourism and lead them to the inventory with which we advertise for this destination.
IP requires Congress results
Eduardo Dávalos, chairman of the CCE, proposed that the Members should take on the great responsibility to give an example of a better Sinaloa, which faces many challenges.
The Mazatlán business sector calls for a worthy Parliament, free from agreements between the parties and the government, because Sinaloa is upset and faces great problems.
Yesterday the 60th Parliament was inaugurated, consisting of seven political forces, 19 representatives of the PRI, 13 of PAN, three of Partido Nueva Alianza, two of PRD, one of PT, one of Convergencia and one of PVEM, making a total of 40 representatives.
The new members of the State Congress are expected to do a clean job, to feel obliged to society and to the different social groups dependent on responsible parliamentary work, and not to repeat the same patterns of partyism and paternalism.
Eduardo Dávalos, chairman of the CCE entrepreneurship Coordination Council, proposed that the new Members should take on the great responsibility to set an example of a better Sinaloa, which faces many challenges.
"We hope that the Members will really exercise their right to act freely between the parties, for it is common for them to agree on agreements with which they represent their own interests, which will transform them into carnival comparses of the rulers and leaders of the parliamentary groups."
He said they should demonstrate their commitment to building the necessary bridges to support the current government.
"We make sure that they carry out a trustworthy work and above all work for society and its groups, because it was the inhabitants of Sinaloa who expressed their trust in the last elections."
José Ramón Mangoart Sánchez, chairman of the Tres Islas Hotel Association, believes that one of the major challenges facing the 40 representatives is the drive and joint work for the economic growth of the state, because today the economic situation is extremely complicated.
"The most important thing is that they drive economic growth, create investment incentives and infrastructure measures, which in some way will promote job creation."
With regard to the tourism sector, he called on the new Members to give the Ministry of Tourism the necessary priority in the government budget to promote it.
"I have understood that it is the Ministry with the second few means, which is incompatible with an important economic activity that brings foreign exchange and investment into the country and is in direct competition with the agro-industry."
It is necessary to allocate funds to tourism projects, to support state security and to update the Alcohol Law, which has not been recast in previous legislative periods.
Holy King Seeked
Dolls, cars, bicycles and other toys wish the children of the family Coronado Valenzuela.
It will be difficult for parents to fulfill these wishes on the next day, because the household is no more and no less than 12 people and a goat goat.
Nevertheless, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan and Miguel do not give up the hope that Melchior, Caspar and Balthasar will give them the toys and the clothes they desire.
The family lives in a modest house in the settlement of Salvador Allende. They live by the hand in the mouth, because the father has no fixed work.
"Sometimes hard times are told because my husband doesn't have a job, but we sell mandarins and potatoes... Already in the afternoon I'm going to the streets with the gourds for sale," said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
Four-year-old Adelaida would like a doll or a bicycle while her three-year-old sister Isabel wants a Barbie doll.
Ten-year-old José Alfredo wants to have a 'monster car' for some time and for his eight-month-old brother Jesús, Cayetana proposes clothing in size for one-year-olds.
" (José Alfredo) told me, 'I would like this monster', but I answered him, 'Let's wait, boy', because it was very expensive," Cayetana lamented.
For the older children who were in school, clothing and shoes would be ideal.
Eleven-year-old María Guadalupe has the size of 12; ten-year-old Isaías has the size of 10, while eight-year-old Miguel has size 8.
The 14-year-old José Juan lacks tennis shoes. A couple in size 5 1/2 or 6 would be very helpful.
If you would like to help realize the dreams of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family, you can participate in the campaign 'Holy King Is Wanted' by donating a toy or cash in the reception hall of the Noroeste newspaper.

On Wednesday, as part of the destruction of a production and sales network of cannabis around ten searches were carried out in the administrative region of Estrie.
Fourteen people have been arrested and will face various charges.
The house searches took place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, in places that are supposed to have served mainly for the production of drugs.
"About 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hash, cash and equipment that served the production have been confiscated," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesman for the Quebec Security Police.
A total of eleven men and three women were arrested, of whom two of the men who are considered to be the main wire-drawer of the drug ring were from Sherbrooke.
The arrested persons are said to have appeared hours after their arrest in front of the Sherbrooke judicial building.
They could be accused, among other things, of accusing the production of cannabis, its possessions for sale, the plot, and the service of crime.
These searches were carried out as a result of a lengthy investigation that took place over a year.
"The information received from public authorities has enabled us to carry out these arrests," M. Ruel explained.
Around 70 police officers from the Estria Regional Investigation Unit of the Security Police of Quebec, the Sherbrooke Police Department and the Memphis Police Department participated in this police operation.
Secret immigration could easily be pursued
The draft law of the Conservatives, which, according to the government, is intended to address the problem of ships loaded with secret immigrants, will be stamped for all intents after the three opposition parties have announced on Wednesday that they cannot support the proposal.
"I strongly object to this Charter."
"I hold with a party that has laid fetters on your feet," said Michael Ignativ, head of the liberals, after the weekly Caucus session in front of the assembled Members.
The Liberals claimed that the draft law, which allows any person identified as a person for the transport of illegal immigrants to be detained for up to one year, infringes the Canadian Constitution of Law and Freedom, as proposed.
Gilles Duceppe, head of the Bloc Québécois, also suggested that he could not support the draft law, as he opposed the wrong target group.
"We are against it and it seems that all opposition parties are against it, so we will wait for what the government is doing," said M. Duceppe.
The criticism regarding the immigration question of Olivia Chow, NDP, rejected the critics who demanded that their party did not behave steadfastly enough against the secret immigrants.
"The neo-democrates agree that measures are being taken against blind passengers, and this is what we are trying to enforce by means of another bill, C-35," Chow said.
We therefore do not support the draft law of the Conservatives because he seeks the blame of the refugees and holds children captive for at least one year," Chow explained.
The immigration minister Jason Kenney accused the opposition parties of playing with politics and ignoring the will of the Canadians.
"The Canadians strongly inform the Members that they do not tolerate this kind of secret immigration, these criminal acts affecting Canada and treating the country as a pedestrian."
"You expect Canada to take tough action," said Minister Kenneys.
"The government has not announced any vote of confidence regarding its draft law which could have led the country to elections that the government would have rejected.
However, a conservative has said to the QMI agency that the government would convene a vote so that each opposing parliamentarian would immediately explain himself to his constituents.
The new unit does not find unanimity
Despite the announcement of the possible creation of a new, standing unit to fight corruption and collusion on the part of Jean Charest, many observers continue to call for the formation of a public investigation committee on this issue.
Robert Dutil, Minister of Public Security, claims that this idea was not from yesterday: Quebec had already consulted the New York Department of Investigation on this issue last January.
Since 1870, the metropolis has had a standing unit against corruption.
Nevertheless, the announcement of Wednesday has surprised more than just one.
It must be said that this measure was not discussed least at the meeting of the Quebec Police Committee on 29 October last year, despite Robert Dutil's presence.
Nor was it lacking that Stéphane Bergeron, critic and member of the parti Québécois, qualified this announcement in terms of public security as "the conjugated rabbit" and "the rightfully crafted solution at the end of the table".
Minister Dutil, in turn, had addressed those who feared that political power had too much influence on the future unity in question.
"You will see the result when we announce it," he affirmed.
"You're aware of this problem."
According to Réjean Parent, the president of the CSQ, nothing can replace the conduct of a public survey.
"The more M. Charest insists on preventing the formation of this investigation, the more people like you and I think he has something to hide," he said.
"The only means to be able to form an investigation committee is the resignation of Jean Charest," explained Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and political systems at the ENA (State University of Applied Sciences).
In order to get out of this deadlock, he suggests to Quebec that a special mandate be given to audit the audit so that it can carry out appropriate investigations on corruption and secret agreements.
"One should be able to extend the mandate of audit control," he decided.
He also believes that Quebec could grant the same power as Commissioners in audit control, which would also allow you to oblige people to make statements.
The formation of a standing unit is not the only project in the drawers of the Charest government.
Quebec will also demand Ottawa to amend the criminal law in order to be better placed on this kind of crime.
This demand is from the Chief State Attorney of Operation Marteau, who informed Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the case law in this form of prosecution is not clear.
Vic Toews, Minister of State for Public Security, confirmed that his colleague, Rob Nicholson, was currently dealing with certain amendments concerning this dossier.
During the 2001 Operation Printemps, which concerned the groups of motorcycle police, 131 persons had been arrested, although the criminal law had not been amended.
Ottawa has therefore enforced the law against gangsterism.
Rivers under strict surveillance
Due to the high rainfall in some regions of the province since Tuesday, several rivers remain under strict surveillance.
In Shawinigan, in the administrative region of Maurice, there was a landslide on Wednesday afternoon.
Two houses were evacuated preventively.
In the evening another landslide took place in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in the administrative region of Lanaudiere.
A road has fallen into itself.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening heavy rainfalls of 40 to 70 millilitres have spread to several regions.
Between 20 and 40 further millimeters of rainfall were expected here according to the regions until Thursday evening.
The areas north of the river and the valley of the Outaouais region were most affected.
A total of up to 100 millimeters of rain showers had gone down here.
As the snowmelt already accumulated in certain subareas is added to these rainfalls, the crossing of several watercourses is feared.
On Wednesday evening the Quebec Security Service issued warnings on the flood alarm concerning the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in the region of Lanaudiere.
The river runs in the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentine Mountains and the Chêne in Lotbinière become an object of flood monitoring and remain under observation.
In the region of Lanaudière, the heavy rainfall has caused the crossing of some lakes in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kiltare as well as in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, an elusive bridge was torn away due to the heavy rainfall.
Ten residences had to be evacuated as a preventive measure.
In Outaouais the crossing of certain lakes has caused the closure of several roads, especially in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The Security Department remains in a state of alert and monitors the situation with the utmost precision, says Security Councillor Annik Bouchard.
On Wednesday, the Quebec Landeswährszentrum issued warnings of the strong rise of several rivers, in particular of Maskinongé, Assompionie, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont partially remitted
The Quebec radio moderator Stéphane Dupont suffered a partial setback before the Canadian Broadcasting Standards Supervisory Board (CCNR) because of his controversial statements on social care and Haitians as well as because of his late speech on radio.
While the CCNR is of the opinion that M. Dupont and his CHOI 98.1 FM team would have the right to express their own views, certain statements would have "inadequate information on the social care and unauthorized negative representations of the Haitians, as well as such an unscrupulous speech which is not appropriate for the day-to-day broadcasts."
The Supervisory Board had also concluded that a discussion on suicide involving the dissemination of the names of two persons who committed suicide infringed the broadcasting code.
The CCNR received several complaints concerning the comments made during the 2008 and 2010 broadcasts.
The first order was filed following a complaint from the "Front Communin des personnes assistées sociales du Québec".
The activist organisation had complained that the amounts mentioned in the consignment were inaccurate.
Moderators should rather provide solid and misleading information.
With regard to suicide, moderator Stéphane Dupont thought that the suicide was an expression of cowardice.
The majority of Supervisory Board members had concluded that the mediated message was that suicide should not be considered a solution to life crises.
"The majority of the Supervisory Board takes into account that the consequences of the "Dupont le midi" broadcast would have raised a sensitive issue in a family-friendly and appropriate manner."
Therefore, he was not charged with any blame against his person.
The last issue was the statements relating to the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had come up with a media-effective dispute in this regard that caused a lot of reactions.
The CHOI presenter had declared that he had not donated in favour of the Haiti aid, since one did not know for sure whether the needy would actually receive the donations.
The Supervisory Board considers that these comments have not been abusive, but that their cumulative effect presents an unwarranted negative representation of the Haitians.
"I have already paid off my three-day suspension sentence in this case."
"My file has been virgin for a year and a half," the moderator explained.
In all decisions, the Supervisory Board condemns the spread of an unwarranted expression.
In all cases, the CHOI-FM had acted "outside its obligations".
The consequences for the broadcaster, which, among other things, should have been reported once during the main broadcasting period within a period of three days, are minor.
A King of the Kung Fu in Montreal
Nacereddine Zemmal, Montreal Algerian origin, has taken a very special course.
The athlete, who excels in "Sanda" (full contact Kung-Fu), in the kickbox and in the Thai boxing, now rises in search of new challenges on the Tatami and in the boxing rings of the world.
"I started martial arts such as Kung-Fu and Kickboxen 12 years ago in Algeria," Zemmal said, who has been based in the metropolis since 2008 to develop among the professionals.
I personally seek the battle everywhere, because for those who do not like the ground fight as the mixed martial arts present it, competitions in North America are rare."
Recently, he had been working as a security officer, and at UPS, he had given his rivals bad news, in which he won two gold medals from the World Karate and the Kickboxing Association (WKA) in Edinburgh, Scotland, between October 23 and 30.
"I have won in the categories of full contact kickboxing and Thai boxing," he said.
"At the moment, I'm preparing for the world cup at San Shou in China."
"There were those fighters from every category who had placed themselves among the first four at the last World Championship."
"I brought bronze to Toronto in 2009.
"In 2005, I went to Vietnam Achter."
"In 2007 I finished the tournament in China in fifth place, while in 2009 I became third in Toronto," he added.
"It is worth noting that I have made progress in every competition."
"With this rhythm I will become first this time or next year!"
"San Shou" or "Sanda" are disciplines originating from China in which fists and footsteps are permitted as well as flooring.
The two struggles usually take place on a platform, more rarely in a boxing ring.
The most renowned boxing fighter, which emerged from this kind of martial arts, is the American Vietnamese origin Cung Le, which is probably known in the world of martial arts.
If Nacer Zemmal only retained a single event in his career, he would surely call his presence at the "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl of the Kung Fu.
"This competition is the highest and highest in China," said the sympathetic pound guy.
"It is a bit like the equivalent to the stadium Lumpinee (the largest stadium in Thailand).
"That was a super experience."
Zemmal had won his first battle in the semi-finals of his category (80kg) before losing in the finals.
"The one who defeated me was a real professional," he analyzed.
"There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 95 kg). "
"The winners of the semi-finals meet each other in the final of their category."
"Then the winners of each category will be on the verge of crowning a single champion, the King of the Kung Fu."
450 million in contracts without tendering
Hydro-Québec has agreed to grant project planning companies 450 million dollars in contracts for the hydropower project Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert.
In the middle of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts there is a consortium consisting of BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which has received the most important share, namely that of the project management, to a sum of 295 million dollars without tendering.
This consortium, called "Énergie gérance", was formed in 2004 to accompany the decision of Hydro-Québec, the private sector to hand over this important hydroelectric project to a sum of $5 billion.
At the beginning of 2005, the "Énergie gérance" consortium met the lucrative contract without a public tender.
For the Québécois part, recourse to business consortia is a serious ethical problem that creates the risk of anti-competition and an increase in prices.
"This is a new way of playing a carded game and disarms the competition."
"This means that instead of playing carded games in secret rather than in open form," said Sylvain Simard, PQ MP, at the press conference yesterday.
In the early morning, Simard raised the question before the National Assembly, for it seems difficult to understand how the public interest can be served in this way.
Minister of Resource Nathalie Normaneau had responded in the afternoon by vehemently acquiescing that this was a carded game.
"I remain faithful to my line," she weathered by strengthening that the PQ was "unreasonable" and "she lacks hardness".
She said it was "be the least" that the PQ apologized.
The consortium's model is common practice worldwide.
It is usually such a temporary alliance, allowing two or more companies to pool their expertise on a bid to tender for a complex project.
The "Eastmain" project has a high level of complexity in terms of its work scale.
The construction process is under way and is expected to be set up by 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without a competition being able to take place; there had already been negotiations.
Moreover, even in relatively simple projects, the model of the Quebec consortium is no longer an exception.
As the newspaper "Le Devoir" noted last week, the model of the consortium used in the field of civil engineering and consulting is the subject of government investigations.
A short flight of the Quebec business register allows to name more than 200 consortia, some of which seem to be of a permanent duration.
In this way, Dessau works in partnership with the majority of its core competitors, including CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin or Roche and Tecsult.
Every link, and of it there are several dozen, leads back to one and the same legal person, namely Dessau.
As far as the consortium "Énergie gérance" is concerned, Minister Normaneau stressed that "the territory of Baie James is subject to special labour dynamics and that Hydro-Québec has been taking this fact into account in a special way since the 1970s".
Réal Laporte, the great employer of the Société d'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has made a statement that the nose on the fact that the project management contract was approved after agreement.
"If you make a tender and there are only a few candidates, your prizes will be up quickly."
"So you have two options: either you take the people who are on this march and tell you: you will negotiate a satisfactory agreement at a good price."
"The idea, however, is that not the price is crucial, but the expertise of the people," Laporte said.
This contract granted to the consortium "Énergie gérance" is part of a long list of contracts over 50,000 dollars received from the Parti Québécois.
The contracts were either approved by the Hydro-Québec or the SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After review, the newspaper "Le Devoir" had more than 100 engineering and consulting contracts approved by companies or their branches, including resource laboratories, between 2002 and March 2010.
SNC-Lavalin had lost 22 contracts, Génivar had 16 received Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without including their participation in "Énergie gérance".
All these contracts have been negotiated.
They total 449 783 344 dollars, including the contract with "Énergie gérance" over 295 131 564 dollars.
Sylvain Simard had announced that the four companies that form the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) were probably known to the "Parti libéral du Québec".
Minister Normaneau had made it clear that the PQ was equally linked to the companies they "financed" before she specified that it was rather their executives.
Barometer responsible consumption - The "green" label is unreliable
Green, but unmistakably skeptical.
The Quebec consumer has little confidence in the main players of sustainable growth, but neither the marked brands nor the eco-labels to control his choice.
It is a shame, although it bathes in a media-active universe, where information in favour of a more responsible consumption is only so abundant: the barometer of responsible consumption has a lack of credible information to complain about, an inadequacy that is known as a brake on its commitment, as the first reading showed, which was held yesterday.
Although they promoted consumption of the so-called socially compatible products in 2010, Quebecers still seem to be paying little credit to those who are trying to sell them.
Two-thirds of the Quebec population admits that they do not believe in the environmental commitment of companies as much as in the green advertising of businesses, so the instrument of measurement, which is sophisticated by the responsible consumer centre of the University of Sherbrooke, reveals.
Another finding: half of consumers doubt the reliability of the official certificates attached to the supposed fair products, but also the credibility of the products and brands, which are declared to be environmentally conscious, says the barometer.
Following the same pattern, politicians' discourse on this subject is taken seriously by only 14.6% of the Quebec population.
However, information on responsible consumption seems important to stimulate this consumption segment, which is currently being revived by almost one third of Quebec consumers.
Indeed, emptiness and dubious nature of the information dampened the zeal of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the barometer at the higher price of the products.
In addition, one third of Quebecers are suspicious of the declared performance of the green products and services they are trying to use.
According to another communication, more than half of consumers had changed their habits in 2010 and had mainly changed the brand of one or more products in order to express their conviction.
According to Barometer, they also preferred 61% of purchases from traders in their district and favoured the purchase of food grown in their region.
Greener and more responsible - the index of environmentally conscious consumption had reached a 64 of the maximum value of 100 this year - the Homo consumer of Quebec loves to present himself as king of recycling, who tries to reduce his traces left in the environment by taking care of animal welfare.
However, social and ecological awareness seems to stop in front of his car, says the barometer: just 28% of Quebecers have stated that they used public transport in 2010 or preferred the car centre to demonstrate their ecological interest.
The addition and cycling were also supported by 39.1% of the participants in this comprehensive behavioral survey, which the clichés feed.
State bond for the acquisition of eXcentris
The Quebec Government, which was invited by Société Angus and Parallèle to participate financially in the acquisition of the cinema complex eXcentris, agrees with a cooperation, but only in the form of a competitive bond.
The developer company Angus and the company Parallèle, who had hoped for a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to take over the Daniel Langlois-owned cinema complex, eXcentris, on the Boulevard Saint-Laurent, in order to return it to its actual cinematic function, obviously do not receive what they demanded.
The government has accepted that it is involved in this, but on its own terms.
Instead of the expected donation, the Quebec Government offers a bond less than the initially hoped-for amount that could create an existing solution on favourable conditions, at least in the opinion of sources that can be removed from the state rumor kitchen.
A first action plan and a request for 12.8 million had already been rejected by Quebec last spring, and the petition has been corrected once again in a row.
A proposal together with an action plan has already been sent by the President of the "Société de développement des entreprises culturelles" (SODEC), François Macerola, to Minister St-Pierre, who heads the eXcentris file.
Several days ago, he had sent her a final report.
However, the counter-proposal of the cabinet was submitted to the SODEC on Wednesday.
Parallèle and Angus now have time until 31 December to respond to them.
In any case, the premise of the state donation really seems to have been pushed aside.
Let us remember that the Quebec owner community of cinemas and cinema complexes had leaned against a direct state investment in support of the acquisition of eXcentris by arguing that the minister of culture did not provide financial assistance for real estate projects there, which he did not provide to other cinemas.
However, several other market participants in the segment claimed substantial economic aid.
After the self-financed construction of the cinema, director Daniel Langlois had presented the cinema in the premises of his cinema complex for more than ten years under great difficulties, which could justify the exemption from the State Fund.
The lack of cinemas showing independent films is more than obvious in Montreal, and eXcentris knew how to hold his clients by the rod.
The Société Angus and the Parallèle company, with Christian Yaccarini at the top, set up a privately funded campaign, of which they are hoping for a sum of $700 000 to stimulate the acquisition.
Since spring 2009, only one canvas has continued showing films in eXcentris, namely Le Parallèle.
The goal of the future acquirers is to reopen the three cinemas on 27 February next year with the performance of the very successful film by Xavier Beauvois "Des hommes et des dieux".
Christian Yaccarini, however, did not get the newspaper "Le Devoir" and they were ignored what he and his group think of the down-corrected proposals they made.
Secret of the complex shaken Canada ventilated
The new American diplomacy lines spread through WikiLeaks reveal the mystery of what the United Nations considers to be the inferiority complex of Canadians to the Americans, but with the same blow they reveal the latter feeling of superiority towards Canada.
Consequently, the American diplomats are amazed that the Canadian electorate does not have Canadian-American relations in mind during the election, and they believe that President Obama's visit would have helped the conservative government to enforce its 2009 budget!
The four new communications between the American Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, which were publicly distributed yesterday, offer even more spicy details than the mere substance of the substance you have to nibble about.
A connection dated 22 September 2008, i.e. during the period during which the federal election camp was in full swing, reports on the point from which the United Nations no longer participates in the operations discussed by its political leaders.
To the great amazement of David Wilkins, the American ambassador employed in Ottawa.
Mr Wilkins offers different ways of explaining this situation.
"The Canadians' almost indwelling inferiority complex may cause Canadian political leaders to talk much more about internal issues of everyday life than to push the United States to the black Peter in this election (as in 1988 in the campaign on free trade)," he describes.
The United Nations, he concluded, is thus "the proverbial Goliath of this election: omnipresent, but potentially too threatening to speak of it".
The Ambassador all the less understands this "ear-dumping silence" as the two countries have intensive political and economic relations.
"Logically," he assesses, "it should be the ability of a candidate, a party, and much more of a party leader to lead an essential relationship that the voters have as a key factor in urning."
The other expression of this feeling of importance is read in the communication sent on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, managing director in Ottawa, to prepare President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your journey will help to ensure the government's continued vote on the federal budget at the beginning of February, where Canada will announce its first deficit after more than a decade, which was created as a result of an upsurge of 30 to 40 billion dollars," says Breese.
Nowhere did he mention that the government had had to postpone the parliamentary session before Christmas in order to prevent Parliament from being overthrown by the coalition and the so-called continued existence of the opposition parties would have an impact on the quality of the proposed recovery programme.
Another communication, dated January 2008 and written by Ambassador Wilkins, agrees with Washington of the increasingly negative picture that the dramatic series broadcast via CBC are spreading from the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about shows such as Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which there are few subtle allusions to Maher Aar, the "No-Fly List" or even abductions for the purpose of hearings conducted by CIA muscle protuses.
Another communication also explains in detail how Hillary Clinten asked her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner at her first bilateral meeting whether Europe was prepared to take certain prisoners from Guantanamo.
Mr Kouchner is said to have answered the question with yes, but on the basis of an individual case-by-case decision.
At the end of the meeting, he described, "he handed the Secretary of State a paper in point Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The Secretary of State has promised to review the file again."
Finally, let us note that the mind is heating up with respect to the WikiLeaks website.
Tom Flanagan, an old and Stephen Harper very closely standing consultant, had explained about CBC that those responsible for this massive leak should be "killed".
He had referred to Mike Huckabee from the United States.
Global lighting renewal plan
Yesterday, in Cancun, the UN proposed a plan to renew the lighting of households, trade and industry in 100 countries with a view to reducing greenhouse gas emissions (CFCs), which corresponds to almost one third of the additional reduction needed to stabilise the global climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan takes its place in the steps of the concrete major projects that the UN hopes to implement in Cancun in order to compensate for the absence of mandatory reduction obligations of the developed countries.
According to the plan put forward yesterday, the main problem in the form of 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of CFCs delivered to the earth due to the lighting would be avoided if the white-burning pears, which still represent a monopoly of 50 to 70% on the market, were replaced by fluorescent or even better, by light diodes (LED).
The lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This corresponds to an equivalent of 70% of the exhaust gases from the global fleet.
In Copenhagen last year, the major exhaust gas emitters, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed themselves to voluntary reduction plans that were supposed to lower global CFC emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, 5 Gt should be deducted from this balance sheet in order to stabilise the increase in climate by 2 degrees Celsius from today to 2020 in order to prevent it from being out of control.
In the white-burning pears, 95% of the energy escapes in the form of heat, and the remaining 5% produce the light.
With the compact bulbs the energy consumption is reduced by 75%, with the new LED bulbs this energy requirement is reduced by two times.
The compact fluorescent bulbs hold between 6000 and 10,000 hours on average.
The new LED light bulbs, such as those put on the market by Philips this week - this company has, by the way, participated in the UN study - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a white-burning pear, which gives an indication of the savings potential of the exchange plan to be applied in 100 countries.
In addition to the fact that the completely new bulbs give very little heat, they can also work with a rule resistance.
And they don't contain any mercury.
Several specialists have shown that compact light bulbs have reserves because they contain mercury and therefore have to be disposed of as special waste, which is not always possible in the developing countries, except for producers, provide an acceptance point.
According to the report, however, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet does not represent the compact bulb bulb, but rather the coal-fired power plants, which emit much more mercury to generate the electricity wasted by the white-burning pears.
In the United States alone, these coal-fired power plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury annually.
The report sets out in detail the profits that each country would gain from this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would save one billion dollars annually in the purchase of electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2, which means an equivalent of 3.5 coal-fired power stations, whose construction would cost Indonesia 2.5 billion.
Côte d'Ivoire is excitedly expecting the announcement of election results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called for the "unfavourable" publication of the results of the presidential election of the Ivory Coast immediately after its deadline.
"The Secretary-General emphasises the need for the independent electoral commission to maintain its work and to announce the preliminary results without further delay," said a UN chief press spokesperson.
"He invites all parties and institutions of the Côte d'Ivoire to demonstrate their responsibility and to include every initiative until the provisional results are announced."
Despite the pressure exerted by certain foreign governments, the Electoral Commission had passed the deadline, which was set on Wednesday at midnight, three days after the election on Sunday, without publishing the results.
About forty minutes before the deadline, the President of the CEI had confirmed on TV that the Commission would "go on working" to announce the results.
On Wednesday, many calls from all over the world have become loud, and CEI may finally proclaim the name of the winner of the second round of elections under Laurent Gbagbo and his opponents Alassane Ouattara.
However, the Gbagbo camp is expecting the cancellation of "deceptive" voting charges in the north by the Constitutional Council achieved by the ex-rebel camp of the Forces nouvelles (FN) during the coup failed in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, head of the Ivory Coast presidential campaign, had confirmed that the FN-practice maneuvers in order to intimidate voters in the north of the country had deterred the President's followers from going to the election.
The whole election could be cancelled if the complaints filed by Gbagbo were taken into account by the Constitutional Council.
However, the Gbagbo contractors now feel that the highest court in the country is not neutral, as it is managed by Paul Yao N'Dré, a politically closely linked Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man of the north who deny any connection with the ex-rebels, has considered the delay in proclaiming the election results to be "unacceptable" and has asked Gbagbo to respect them, even if he has not gone so far as to claim victory.
His allies reaffirm that Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results, knowing that he has lost; and file a complaint before the Constitutional Court after the election commission has been prevented from publishing the results, it is illegal.
The second round of the presidential elections on Sunday was held for the crowning of the unification and reconciliation process of a country that had been divided into two parts for years.
On Wednesday, the United Nations warned the Ivory Coast politicians that it could be held responsible for any outrages.
Laurent Gbagbo had held the first round of elections on 31 October with 38% of the votes against the 32% for Alassane Ouattara, who enjoyed the public support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round) as top candidates.
Unemployment rate in France remained stable in the third quarter
For the purposes of the International Labour Office (IAA), the unemployment rate in France is stable at 9.3% (with the inclusion of the overseas departments to 9.7%), the provisional seasonally adjusted data published on Thursday by the Federal Statistical Office of the Insee show.
The unemployment rate in the metropolis is 2.631 million.
The data for the second quarter amounted to 9.3% of the working population in the metropolis and 9.7% in the overseas departments.
Over the year, the unemployment rate increased by 0.1 percentage points.
In the third quarter, 3.4 million people employed in the French metropolis were not employed, but they wished to find a job, including whether they were operational or not every two weeks or whether they were job-seeking or not.
The situation of young people on the labour market has continued to deteriorate with an increase in the unemployment rate of 24.2% in the metropolis (+ 0.9 percentage points within three months, +0.5 percentage points over the year) and 25% with the involvement of the overseas regions.
In the third quarter, 637,000 of young people aged 15 to 24 were unemployed according to the IAA.
The elderly, for their part, have seen a slight increase in the unemployment rate of 6.4% in the metropolis (+0.2 percentage points over three months and over the year), i.e. 482,000 of the more than 50-year-olds, 6.6% involving the overseas departments.
Only the 25-49 year olds could have benefited from the stability of unemployment in the third quarter; 8.3% in the metropolis (-0.1 percentage point over three months, +0.1 percentage points over one year) and 8.8% in France as a whole.
Following a discussion of its calculation procedures, the Federal Statistical Office of the Insee has not published the monthly unemployment figures since 2006.
Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union, on the other hand, continues in this method and announced on Tuesday a quota of 9.8% in France for October (including overseas departments) compared with 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini indicted and arrested
An investigation was initiated against Alexandre Guérini, 53, head of a disposal company and brother of the President of the General Council of the Bouches-du-Rhône region (PS), and was sent to the prison in Luynes near Aix-en-Provence in the course of an investigation into the public and suspected markets.
Alexandre Guérini was accused of underprivileged social property, misappropriation of public goods, hounding, co-operating in corruption, illicit bribery, and possession of weapons, according to his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini is ready to fight and intends to speak out on all questions that the prosecutor will ask him instead of spreading brains."
"It is easy to submit to him a number of criminal charges, another thing is to prove them," said his lawyer Florence Rault of the AFP (Agence France Presse) before hearing his client.
Mr. Guérini, brother of Jean-Noël Guérini, the first man of the PS (Parti Socialiste) in the department, had valued to give the judge a memorandum of justification before his hearing by means of his lawyers.
A member of Guérinis, Philippe Rapezzi, was also charged and detained on Wednesday evening.
According to lawyer Lucien Simon, her client had never done anything other than keep his landfill, which he had to run.
As regards the business competence or the destination of the related funds, he would never have known, Simon said.
In this affair, Daniel Pinna, former Director-General of the Aubagne Public Service, was again charged on Wednesday with subversion and complicity, but then under the obligation to stay away from the protagonists of these acts under judicial supervision.
"My client was able to explain the facts that were accused of him."
"The Chief Prosecutor has taken into account not to rob him of his freedom, said his lawyer Yann Arnoux.
Four others had been charged and released from prison on Tuesday to Wednesday, including two of them under legal supervision, according to Deputy Chief State Attorney Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, Deputy Managing Director of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is prosecuted for "unauthorized influence and passive bribery".
Two state officials of the agglomeration area Aubagne, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, were also arrested, one under the title "Investigation and misappropriation of general goods by a public service commissioner", the other because of "co-operatorship in the misappropriation of public funds".
The companion of Alexandre Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, was also accused of "healing and smiting of social assets".
Among those who were confronted by Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently imprisoned for a similar affair of fraudulent public machinations that affected Corsica.
The suspects suspected his society to have contributed to the money laundering of "high" criminal circles.
The investigation against X for alleged fraud in the award of public contracts, particularly in the disposal sector, was conducted in April 2009 following anonymous letters in the files of open investigation procedures.
It can be found from nearby sources that the investigation focuses in particular on the conditions of the surcharge and the operation of a landfill site in La Ciotat, which also covers waste from the territory of the Aubagne, as well as from certain cities of the Marseille (MPM) urban catchment area.
Affair Clotilde Reiss: The Elysée Palace surpasses its intermediate function for Syria
Within more than six months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher who was detained in Iran for "spionage", held the French public in breath, put diplomacy in alarm and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All of this under the attention of the diplomats of the United States.
The American documents received by WikiLeaks and reviewed by the newspaper "Le Monde" reveal some backgrounds of this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée had explained its strategy to the Americans, which went so far as to give these advice on how to deal with their own crisis of "violence" in Iran (a small group of walkers).
They point out how the French authorities have tried to convince Washington that the liberation of the young French woman did not have the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian prisoner in France and sought by American justice on the basis of trade in material in favour of the Iranian nuclear programme.
Finally, they put the way in which the French Bureau has tried to manipulate the media for the purpose of making this idea credible, the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad has played a central role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss, in a bright light.
In truth, he had done nothing in this regard.
A diplomat telegram edited in Paris on 12 August 2009 is entitled "Iran: French Commentaries on the Way of handling hostages".
François Richier, Elysée's consultant on strategy issues, met Patrice Paoli, director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle Orient with American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explained the French method to her.
They advised the Americans to make every effort to bring back their own nationals who would be held violently in Iran.
"Might noise," they said, "articulates loud and clear and without omission" the words "basic human rights", "innocent", "smooth release" in the media.
This is necessary in order to embarrass the Iranian regime, which is very sensitive to its image.
"If so, do this all the more, especially since the Iranians ask you not to do so."
For "silence doesn't solve anything," past the discussion attempts about inconspicuous ways, the Iranians are "masters in escape maneuvers".
Mr Richier adds that the arrest of foreigners is a "common Iranian tactic": "Gift taking for the purpose of political extortion".
He announced that the release of Clotilde Reiss from prison (which was due to come on August 16, on the day she fled to the French Embassy) "belonged the payment of a large sum of money to the Iranians" (230,000 euros deposit).
And he lets declareable, the Elysée anticipates further hostages, a phenomenon that will "enhance".
The Iranians could "in the near future arrest another of the approximately 1,800 French citizens living in Iran," he said.
Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image
Clotilde Reiss was released from prison 12 days ago, but is still being held in Iran.
Information has been circulated: Iran’s Majid Kakavand, whose extradition is required by the United States for illegal trade in sensitive electronic material to Iran, has been released from prison after a judge’s decision in Paris.
The American Embassy, like many other observers, is asking questions about this disturbing coagency.
For Washington, which pursues the illegal Iranian networks of acquisition of the material intended for the nuclear program, the release of Majid Khakavand is a bad news.
Did France buy a cow trade ?
The liberation of the Iranian against the French?
On the occasion of a further discussion with Kathleen Allegrone on 4 September François Richier assures that this is not the case.
The Elysée, he says, was not only "fully surprised by the judge's decision", but also tried to rebel against it.
"There has been a great exchange between the French Bureau and the French Minister of Justice" (now Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French Government cannot change the judicial decision," he explains.
Mr Richier would also like to point out that Majid Kakavand continues to be under the "hard" supervision of the French intelligence service.
The Elysée consultant chooses a telephone number, reschedules, then informs the American diplomat, the Iranian "currently engaged in the buildings of the Iranian Embassy in Paris".
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysée does not spare its efforts to believe by means of announcements and media-organized "flight trials", Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad plays a "important" and "influential role".
The Americans do not observe this activity without irony and note that manipulation bears fruit as several press articles reflect the official French version.
A telegram dated August 25, 2009, conjures up "the media flash of the French authorities".
On what is so much "thank you" to Mr Assad, the Paris Embassy asks himself.
"Despite their statements of praise, the French authorities secretly admit that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians have actually done."
The document then deals with the reasons which led the Elysée to decay this fiction.
The intensive communication efforts " aim to confirm Sarkozy's policy of openness to Syria", he analysed.
A policy launched in 2008 that was perceived "by numerous critics in France and abroad as premature and undeserved".
"The Syrian role building up" tries Paris "to show Syria what praise can be achieved by playing a constructive role in the region".
The aim is also to "sow discord between Syria and Iran".
The American Embassy knows this from a good source.
On August 11th, François Richier told her: "Of course we don't know if the Syrians have done anything."
"But we thanked them despite everything."
"This should at least create confusion among the Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy welcomes her to the Elysée.
In a communiqué, he thanked the President of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in favor of the release of our countryman".
No online games for young Koreans after midnight
The South Korean government will adopt a law called "the ashbrödel", which will forbid young people to play online games after midnight by blocking their access, so indicated government leaders.
A draft law to call on online game operators to deny young people under 16 years of age after midnight access to these games will be presented to Parliament in December, described representatives of cult and family ministries.
"Many children play these games all night long and then have difficulties learning at school and also having a normal life during the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary in order to ensure their health and their right to sleep," said Jo Rin, Ministerial Representative responsible for the French press agency Agence France Press with this draft law.
The online games will then be available again from 6 a.m.
The producer companies would have been preparing for the implementation of the law for one year, he explained.
The government also intends to ask the manufacturers to cut down the time limit granted daily to access these games to those young people whose parents ask for it, the person responsible added.
It will also provide free programs to those who wish to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "networked" countries, and newspapers regularly report various events associated with intensive Internet use.
The country is also an undisputed champion in online gaming competitions worldwide.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals in the World Cyber Games against 58 other nations.
World Championship 2018-2022: FIFA appoints the host country
On Thursday, in a bright excitement due to suspicion of corruption, the FIFA Executive Committee appoints the World Championships 2018 and 2022, a highly political choice in which ranking for influence and lobbying threatens to push the technical criteria into the background.
One thing, however, is certain: the 2018 edition of FIFA's royal discipline will take place in Europe, its traditional stronghold (the 4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, the Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 edition will then be slightly more exotic; the International Football Association hopes to be able to win new territories (Katar, Australia) for itself after the premiere on the African continent in 2010, or to continue tracking its branch in the United States or in Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of persons belonging to the delegation (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch Heads of Government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) gives the measure of economic and political commitment to a world championship.
So the machinations behind the scenes are threatening to stop until the last minute.
Hard otherwise to establish a hierarchy of the candidates.
According to the FIFA evaluation report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) files offer better arguments than their competitors.
But these considerations will not be so important for the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of election.
The Sunday Times, which was at the beginning of the revelations with the completion of the suspension of two members of the Exekutifcommitee (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could also have ruined the chances for their own country, the cradle of football, which was only once allowed to hold the World Cup, in 1966.
The BBC had once again given it nourishment on Monday by sending out a documentary that took three influential members of the committee, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou under fire.
Reason enough to anger FIFA and embarrass the English responsible, who primarily had been lobbying intensively with David Cameron in these last weeks.
The head of government is hoping for a new edition of the chess move that was successful by its predecessor Tony Blair, who had achieved the 2012 Olympic Games organisation for London in 2005.
Would this intensive effort be sufficient to upgrade England's image before the committee?
Nothing is less safe, because the Duo Spain Portugal is not lacking in any of its already finished stages, its expertise (WM 82 in Spain, Olympic Games 92 in Barcelona, EM 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
But the economic and financial sides of the two countries could dampen their ambitions.
The possible repressions against the English, as well as the doubts about Spanish and Portuguese solitaireness increase Russia's chances of becoming a weighty outsider despite its gaps in the file (stadia, hotels, transport).
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has decided to condemn the unmistakably hinting at the charges of the English press "an unfair competition in the preparation of the vote" by the members of the committee.
"You throw them with dirt, you try to compromise them," Putin weathered.
For 2022, the United States, strengthened by the experience of 1994, seems to be the logical favorites.
First economic world power, headquarters of FIFA's main sponsors, the country seems to have a long list of advantages over Japan and South Korea, which have set up a very beautiful project separately.
But these new candidates seem to be premature for two countries that had co-organized the competitions in 2002.
Another threat: the approval of the World Cup in 2026, which the FIFA is looking forward to, for China, to drop the Asian chances to 2022.
With Australia and Qatar, which had drawn all the registers with the anticipation of futuristic stages, FIFA is pursuing its expansion towards new areas, but these two countries are at greater risk than certainty.
Australia, as well as Japan and South Korea, may suffer from the weakness of television rights (due to the shift of time), which has been acquired by European countries, the sensitive nerve of FIFA.
Second mandate: openness
De Gaulle had really supported it.
Mitterand had let him believe that he was puking.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not show the slightest hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than this one.
One mandate at the Elysée calls the next.
The current head of state will be Ergo candidate in 2012.
But openness is not good at the side of the mystery attached to the presidential function.
So you have to pretend to be in doubt from now on.
On the one hand, as well as in the other.
In 2006, the followers of Jacques Chirac claimed that a third mandate was not excluded without believing in it.
On November 15th, Nicolas Sarkozy assured in serious tone that he would make his decision "sometime in the autumn of 2011".
That on Tuesday evening in the Elysée in front of the UMP parliamentarians he would give up the perspective of "two mandates", had therefore spread a little feverishness.
Was that the official announcement of his candidate?
Far from it.
The President simply reminded us that the 2008 constitutional amendment restricts the number of five-year term of office to just two.
He made a statement, no announcement.
It is not the first time that he mentions the presidential election at such meetings in a humorous tone.
"You have seven and a half years with me, or at best," he told them in July 2009.
New in May 2010: "Don't believe I don't think about the next phase."
His words of yesterday make him no more candidate than the day before; but also no less.
Should they create comments, then for a twofold reason.
The acceleration of the race for the candidate with the PS on one side.
However, it is not the start of the competition with Ségolène Royal, which drives Nicolas Sarkozy to reveal himself.
On the contrary, it is his obvious candidacy in 2012, which reminds many members of the PS more early than accepted to fight.
The bad surveys on the other side.
For the first time, the right voters would prefer a candidate of François Fillon of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate, and there is no discussion about it with the UMP," responded immediately and carefully to the Prime Minister's environment.
"If he were a defeat as possible, he wouldn't be a candidate," Jean-Pierre Raffarin says.
"He will always believe in being able to win," said Alain Juppé, who has finished out with openness.
Euro: the ECB is forced to maintain its purchases of government papers
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB last year should provide an opportunity to identify ways of coming out of the crisis or at least to announce the arrangement of a large number of unconventional monetary policy measures to be concluded by the end of the year.
The crisis of European public debt commits the central bank in Frankfurt to fail to fulfil today's more than tense situation on the European bond markets in order not to bring about its aggravation.
The political costs would be far too high.
French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde welcomed yesterday, at a press conference, the active role played by the ECB in solving Europe's public debt.
It has not dared to say whether it believes that the central bank can do more, for example by boosting its programme of purchases of government bonds.
"I reserve my considerations for my European trading partners (...) ".
Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB, at the hearing of the Economic and Monetary Committee of the European Parliament in Brussels on the day before, did not show a great deal of interest in his projects, but rather was pleased to point out that the programme of purchases of state-owned papers would "re-establish" on the secondary market and that we will see at the Assembly on Thursday "the way in which decisions are taken".
The only certainty: The ECB will remain unchanged at 1%, the historically lowest level since May 2009.
In practice, the Treasury's bond purchases were doubled by the ECB last week to about 1.35 billion euros.
And according to the indiscrimination of some traders, yesterday it was said to have made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese state papers.
Overall, the Eurosystem central banks have made purchases of EUR 67 billion since May 2010.
Among traders, the anticipation of continuing the purchase price is by no means questionable (see page 29).
The economists do not expect any more remarkable change in the course.
If the borrowing operations of more than three months have already disappeared from the ECB's arsenal, the latter will still be able to create unrestricted reserves of money in a free manner, over a period of one week up to three months.
The economists are already looking forward to this measure extending by a few months.
"I cannot imagine that the ECB will substantially amend its programme".
"Otherwise, she would take the risk of provoking new tensions in the short term," says Michael Schubert, Volkswirt of Commerzbank.
"A progressive exit planned for the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely to me," anticipates Norbert Bräms, Volkswirt at Sal.
Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image
In the area of its intervention on the sovereign debt market, "the ECB should maintain such a buying-in volume of bonds that will boost the indebted market," adds Norbert Bräms.
In view of the relevance of the exposure of European banks to sovereign debt markets in the euro area, the central bank has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
"It must, at any price, join the market for the missing investors and act in such a way as to prevent the speedy enthusiasm over the returns paid to the weakest countries," one major bond holder testified yesterday.
For if the interest rates set to rise, the States would be even more hindered from reducing their debt or even just stabilizing it.
This is the price to protect the euro.
The Berlusconi Government covers Italy
After a startling week for Italy, the situation yesterday, with the decline of the corner interest rates to 10 years, was a little relaxed.
A return to the deceptive silence.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister for Economic Affairs, the presidents of the region Giulio Tremonti had qualified the situation as "unnumberable" and had heard him expect an "unpredictable" weekend, but this was immediately demented by the person concerned.
On Tuesday, however, the German interest rates had reached its record of 210 basis points, and the prices of the contracts to cover the risk of bankruptcy had increased to 263 points, which had caused a certain headlessness in Rome.
Silvio Berlusconi had pointed out to his Council of Ministers that Spain's discrepancy with the German interest rates was 400 basis points.
However, his right hand, Gianni Letta, had expressed himself as "heavy concerned" by the "market turbulences" and a possible risk of infection from the direction of Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third of the eurozone, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that Italy is like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, economist at the Hudson Institute.
In the clear text, its problem is the absence of economic growth and the associated, dizzy tax receipts that put the state at risk of not being able to meet its financing needs.
The last Brussels forecasts were a cold shower for the government.
In the future, Italian growth is expected to be 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... although the budget budget for the Senate for auditing is expected to be 1.3% and 2% respectively.
Under these conditions, the EU Commission calculates, the budget deficit will represent 4.3% of GDP next year (in contrast to the 3.8% forecast by governments) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Therefore, the uproar for a new household collective, which could be used after the holidays to a sum of 7 billion euros.
"If necessary, new austerity measures must be taken," says auditor Olli Rehn.
At the hour, Italy receives support from international institutions.
"The fundamental festivals of Italy's economy are in order and its accounts are regulated, we have been repeating this for a long time," assures Arrigo Sadun, Italian trustee of the International Monetary Fund, who is entrusted with Italy at the IMF.
"At the moment, there are no problems, neither in the short term nor in the long term, as Italy, despite its high indebtedness (119.2% of GDP in 2011, A.d.R.), is demanding lower stabilisation progress than other countries," observed Pier Carlo Padoan, OECD's Chief Economist.
The question of political inconsistency remains.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censure from the Chamber of Deputies, which would allow the early elections to be organised at the end of March.
So there is a little favourable period for a decision-making in relation to a serious crisis.
Europeans think about the expansion of anti-crisis measures
Christine Lagarde explicitly emphasized it yesterday at a press conference in Paris: "I believe it has been proven on Sunday afternoon and also in the evening: Europeans clearly hold together, are ready and committed to defending their currency and their monetary territory."
Although completely relative - yesterday's deduction from the interest rates of the European government bonds was water on the mills of governments and the ECB.
However, there is still no mention of a beginning of normalization.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's had announced that it could reduce Portugal's debt note, which is probably the most effective target of speculators today.
"As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political perceptibility, which is particularly dependent on banking systems," says the Exane BNP Paribas economists.
Above all, especially since "political time is much slower than that of markets".
The European countries, which are well aware of both this gap and the danger that it poses, are intensifying the discussions to strengthen the anti-crisis measures already in place.
Informal consultations between the most directly concerned finance ministers and in the wider sense with their counterparts of the G20 are going well.
And this also in view of the meetings of Eurogroupe and Ecofin at the beginning of next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
On the plan is the loosening of the unconventional measures to strengthen the back of the eurozone countries in the crosshairs of the markets (see below).
As far as the EU Stability Funds are concerned, its Executive Director, Klaus Regling, started his Asia tour on Tuesday in Singapore to inform investors in the Far East about developments in the crisis in Europe.
If the goal of his visit is not explicit fundraising, he certainly prepares the terrain for this.
The first advertising expenditure on the part of the EU Stability Fund is scheduled for next month.
Yesterday, an official American representative of the Agency Reuters had entrusted the United States with a possible increase in the funds mobilised by the additional direct commitment of the IMF.
Portugal and Spain, the first countries, are, in turn, seeking structural reforms, particularly in the field of labour market organisation.
Reforms that are to be added to the austerity measures, but are to show effects in the near future.
Lisbon and Madrid take a different path than Greece and Ireland did.
Both the one and the other is to avoid asking for international assistance at all costs before setting up their own budget corrections and deciding on indispensable structural reforms that will permanently bring them back to their trust.
European investors, in turn, are discussing the options available to accelerate the normalisation process of government bond markets.
Axel Weber, who was on his way through Paris on 24 November, first came up with the idea that if the 750 billions of euros mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to get back into its pocket.
Barclays Capital's economists, with regard to the European sovereign debt market in the forefront of the market, judge that an extension of around EUR 100 billion would be sufficient, "preferably" in the form of a direct liquidity syringe.
This means that the European mechanism of financial stabilisation is currently worth EUR 60 billion.
An advisory board that has every opportunity to be carefully examined in the European capitals.
Especially when market conditions are rising.
Snow and smooth ice: 24 Departments in Alert Level Orange
Snow episodes continue to cause traffic difficulties, especially in the secondary transport networks of Brittany and threaten to affect various economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now in emergency orange due to the imminent risk of snow and smooth ice.
The regions Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienne have been added to the 20 departments already in alert Orange; 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, then later at night.
According to Météo France, the intensive snowscrapers tang the north of the Gironde as well as the Charentes, it snows easily on the et Ile-de-France.
Snow coverings from 2 to 5 cm are expected in the relevant departments, from 7 to 10 cm in some cases, as well as 1 to 3 cm, even up to 5 cm in the Paris region.
The regions concerned are Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and the Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin.
The snowfalls are notable enough to cause traffic obstacles and to affect certain economic activities, says Météo France.
In the Côtes d'Armor region, several regional roads are closed for heavy traffic of more than 7.5 tonnes, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac transport axes.
The transport situation of secondary transport networks in Brittany is very difficult, according to the traffic police who do not recommend using their own vehicle only in the event of an emergency, and the use of some TER buses has been deleted throughout the day.
In the Picardy, school traffic was lifted for Thursday.
No specific restrictive measures were envisaged for heavy goods vehicles on Wednesday evening.
The prefecture "is calling on drivers to take utmost care on the roads and to adapt their driving behaviour accordingly."
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) called on the airlines to remove 25% of the scheduled heavy snowfalls from the Roissy airport in Paris on Thursday and 10% of the flights starting from Orly.
The DGAB recommends that passengers contact their airline.
Gatwick Airports in the south of London and Edinburgh Airport in Scotland are closed until Thursday morning.
Métro Grand Paris: first financial sketches
Since the debate on the modernisation of the transport industry on the Ile-de-France is in full swing, it rains billions.
At least in the discussions.
One remembers in particular the 23 billion for the Grand Paris Metro, which is to be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
In order to lead to the start of construction of the SGP, the state has issued a capital dot of 4 billion euros.
In the theoretical scheme, this is the sum that would then allow the SGP to give part of the financial sum to its double in the markets.
Finally, today's accounts have come first.
The 2010 supplementary budget, which was reviewed by the Financial Commission of the National Assembly, includes the measures envisaged to raise the first part of these funds.
These are two measures: the creation of a special tax to determine and increase the taxation of offices in France.
The former, according to Article 15 of the draft law, goes "to the farthest part of the public-law institution Société du Grand Paris".
The figure is: "The product of this tax amounts to 117 million euros per year".
The second is a reorganisation of the existing corporate tax system: "to modernise it in order to increase the product resulting from it and to transfer this increase to the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would that bring?
A mystery.
This sum is not numbered in the text.
Of the 4 billion, one is far away.
"It is stated that the tax resources are added to the 4 billion euros of the capital dot, which are raised by the state and are gradually being made available to the Société du Grand Paris for the project," explains the explanatory statement.
With the SGP, this system is not offensive at all.
"Since the moment you book revenue (the two taxes, that is, R), you can cover the projection over three years and then only draw from the 4 billion," it is explained.
"This is recorded in the budget and is gradually deducted."
The SGP estimates that 2013 will start to record the 4 billion for the 2014 budget.
This measure, whose 4 promised billions will be able to be sought for for a long time, is in danger of creating a rather moving, parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will take place on 7 December.
Bullying hackers and embezzled spies
The WikiLeaks affair has a double meaning.
On one hand, it has turned out to be an obvious scandal, a scandal that is merely a scandal in the sense of hypocrisy that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at international level and gives a foretaste to the regression-dominated future.
But let's go ahead in the row.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that each file (an x-any nation) created by a intelligence service consists exclusively of newspaper cuts.
The "extraordinary", American revelations about the sexual habits of Berlusconis throw away nothing more than what one has read for months anyway in every x-voluntary journal (except those whose owner is Berlusconi), and the terrifyingly caricatured profile Gaddafis has been offering cabaret artists material for their sketch for a long time.
The rule by which the secret files may consist only of already known news is essential for the dynamics of the intelligence services, and not only in this century.
When you go to a library dedicated to esotherical publications, you will realize that every work (via the Grail, the Mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, the Templers or the Rosenkreuzlers) repeats exactly what has already been written in previous works.
This is not only because the author does not want to publish occult texts (not yet that he did not know where to find news about the non-existent), but because those who devote themselves to occultism believe in nothing but what they already know and confirm what they have already learned.
This is also the success mechanism of Dan Brown.
So is the secret file.
The informant is lazy, and lazy (or limited spirit) is also the head of the intelligence service (otherwise he could be anything, e.g. editor at Libération), who only considers what he recognizes to be true.
The top secret information about Berlusconi, which the American Embassy in Rome sent to the State Department, were the same as those that Newsweek had already published the week before.
So why was such a removal made for the revelations of these dossiers?
On the one hand, they say what every educated person already knows, that the embassies - at least since the end of the Second World War and since then also the Heads of Government can call each other or take an airplane to meet for dinner - have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of some small representation tasks, have turned into espionage centers.
Any viewer of investigation films knows this very well, and it does not happen out of hypocrisy that one does so to ignore it.
Nevertheless, the fact that it repeats publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy and serves to set American diplomacy in a bad light.
Second, the idea that an x-voluntary hacker can grasp the most secret secrets of the most powerful country in the world holds the significant blow against the prestige of the state department.
In addition, the scandal brings less victims, but rather the "sharpen judge" into distress.
But let us devote ourselves to the profound nature of what has happened.
Formerly, at Orwell's time, all power could be combined like a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Orwell's prophecy could have turned out to be perfectly correct since then, where you can control any movement thanks to the phone, any transaction done, the visited hotel, the chosen highway and so on; the citizen would become a total victim of the eye of power.
But if one looks at what is happening today, that even the secret crypts of power can no longer escape the control of a hacker, then the control course ceases to be one-sided and becomes circular.
The power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - chosen as the revenge of the citizen - can learn the secrets of power.
But how can a power no longer be able to keep its own secrets?
It is true that Georg Simmel has already said that a real secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that any knowledge of the character Berlusconis or Merkel is basically a mystery free from mystery, since it reveals the public sphere; but in the style of WikiLeaks, revealing that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets means to rob them of any power.
WikiLeaks did neither Sarkozy nor Merkel wrong, but Clinton and Obama did.
What will be the consequences of this affliction that has been added to such a mighty power?
It is obvious that in the future the states will no longer place any reserved information online - that would be like a hangout stuck on the street corner.
But it is equally obvious that with the current technologies it is in vain to hope to keep confidential reports by phone secret.
Nothing is easier than to find out whether and when a head of state moved on a plane and contacted one of his colleagues.
How can relations be maintained in the future in private and only for certain ears?
I know that at the moment my prediction sounds like science fiction and romance, but I see myself required to introduce myself to the government agents, secretly moving on uncontrollable march routes, bearing their messages nowhere else than in mere memory, and also hiding the few written information they have received in the shoe heel.
The information would be stored in a single copy in closed drawers: basically, the Watergate espionage attempt had less success than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is moving forward like cancer these days, that is, backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communication, the Internet reconstructs a telegraph with (phone) wire.
The (analogous) video cassettes had enabled the film researchers to explore a film tape for tape, by being able to play from the back to the front and ventilating all the secrets of the assembly, while the (numerical) CDs nowadays do not allow anything but jump from chapter to chapter, i.e. in macro portions.
The high-speed trains take you from Rome to Milan within three hours, while this requires three and a half hours by plane.
It is therefore not exceptional that politics and communication technology come back to the car and horse.
One last observation.
In earlier times the press tried to understand what secrets were forged between the messages.
At present, it is the messages that demand confidential information from the press.
Climate: how France speaks up its financial promises
One year after the Copenhagen Treaty, it is time to investigate compliance with the rapidly resolved financing promises (also called "Fast Start" or early finance) realized by the developing countries.
And already the rough French beauties have been discovered.
With the Copenhagen Treaty, developing countries have committed themselves to providing 30 billion dollars between 2010 and 2012.
The EU has promised EUR 7.2 billion over three years, France EUR 1.26 billion (i.e. 420 million per year).
On the occasion of the opening of COP16, the EU has drawn all the registers to convince its partners of its commitment to fast start-up financing: detailed progress report from its Member States, press conference, major side events, brochure distribution.
The operation transparency is notable and highly appreciated for its true value: developing countries and civil society like to see it when all developed countries did the same at the same level of precision.
The EU announces that it has released EUR 2.2 billion in 2010, which will bring it on the right track to respect its commitment of 7.2 billion in 2012.
But when you look into the details, things are a little more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen Treaty, this money should be "new and additional" in order to ensure that an additional commitment has been made without compromising public development aid.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what "new and additional" means.
While the EU Commission had proposed harmonisation, certain member states, including France, have blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the benchmark he considers best.
For example, the European Commission has chosen to be a benchmark for those of 2009: international funding will be maintained, and in the context of financing "Fast Start" for over three years will add 150 million.
Other countries have chosen similar benchmarks, either in terms of year or conditions at the level of public development aid.
In return, France considered that the financing of "all new projects" in 2010 was "new and additional".
In other words, there are no indicative values for the expenditure of the previous year or at the global level of public development aid.
In concrete terms, the total amount of French assistance from developing countries can remain stable (or decrease) - France claims to comply with its commitment to "new and additional" financing.
Another crucial element is the breakdown of donations and loans.
There is no rule yet, and everyone chooses his calculation mode.
Some, such as France, are 1 € borrowed as equivalent with 1 € donated.
Obviously, this is difficult to understand: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans for certain profitable investments (often emission mitigation projects based on the most effective technology) can be justified, it is deceptive to present the euro that is taken up as equivalent for a donated euro... In addition, only the cost of the loan to the investor country should be counted as a commitment (i.e. the equivalent of an interest rate).
But France has nothing else in mind than the following consideration: it "respects" its commitment of 420 million euros by borrowing 91.5% of loans (389.8 million euros) and spending 8.5%) 36.1 million euros) - see also the EU document to convince itself of it.
France is the only country in the EU that uses loans to a large extent.
Germany demands 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (including Slovakia) are paying 100% of their contributions.
In other words, if the vast majority of the European Union spends € 1 in order to fulfill its obligations, France will give only 10 cents and will include a comparable commitment.
Nice hocus pocus!
All in all, France operates in its fast-start financing with a double dizziness: partly with a further development of the action over time and partly with the reality of financial commitment.
France succeeds in allowing it to believe that it has spent 420 million "new and additional" millions in line with its promises, saving 36.1 million euros.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems that it was Bercy who carried out the arbitration) could have a double negative effect; once EU-internal (why do the other member states continue to donate if it is enough to borrow?) and then in the negotiations, as the developing countries do not completely deceive...
The chapter of early financing is only a small issue over a relatively short period of time compared to the total discussion on climate.
But it could be the drop too much in the immense machinery of the UNFCCC.
Let us hope that this will not be the case.
In any case, it is essential to learn his lesson from this first year of early financing.
In the first place, France could announce a change in its type of booking for 2011 and 2012, in the spirit of respect for its obligations and fairness with the other countries of the European Union.
In particular, however, France could raise the issue of the issue of long-term financing (another crucial and currently under discussion): one cannot escape the question of "predictability" or the method of booking its loans.
France could change its position to be as advanced as it is in other matters.
So the hope is based on the new Environment Minister Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprising announcement of France's fast-start and its vision of "predictability" as well as the use of loans would naturally increase the international trust base, which is necessary for further discussion.
Alarm - pesticides taken by children
A child of 10 years takes in 81 different chemical substances over the day, according to a study published this Wednesday by the Association of Générations Futures (former movement to protect the rights and respect of future generations).
The association, which explains that its results "in view of the low number of samples analysed do not represent statistically significant values, but rather illustrative nature of the problem addressed", had bought the usually within four foods consumed by an approximately ten-year-old child to the meals, plus a mid-term meal in the supermarkets in Oise and Paris between July and September.
These typical meals - including the official recommendations of five fresh fruit and fruit parts, three dairy products and 1.5 litres of water per day - have been examined as well as wethereries of laboratories in search of chemical substances, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The plate balance is flattering: 81 chemical substances, including 42 classified as potentially or probably carcinogenic and five as safe cardiac substances, as well as 37 substances with endocrine interference factors, according to studies of several institutions such as the International Cancer Research Center.
"Even if the legal limits for each chemical, individually taken substance are not exceeded in the nearing total of cases, this survey is very well taken from the fact that the reality in which the consumer may be exposed to carcinogenic substances or substances with endocrine interference factors is worrying," the association notes.
Already at breakfast alone, the butter and tea with milk already contain more than ten of the potentially carcinogenic residues and three safely proved to be carcinogenic, as well as more than twenty residues that can affect the hormone system.
The apple imported from Brazil, as an intermediate meal for the study, has traces of six chemical substances, including a fungicide prohibited in France.
The same applies to green beans from Kenya, including in lunch, where the study has identified traces of an insecticide strictly banned in the EU.
Furthermore, the hack steak, the tuna from the can, even the baguette and the chewing gum of pesticides and other chemical substances were spewed.
In tap water, analyses have revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroforms.
During dinner, the salmon steak with 34 determined chemical residues was the "richest", and even the plastic plate used to warm the meal in the microwave was not unladen.
The final risk of this "pollutant cocktail" for the consumer "is probably undervalued", the study says.
The "Alliance Europe Ecology-Les Verts" (EE-LV) has in turn proposed "in view of the urgency of the situation" to introduce a moratorium on the use of pesticides to stop the "increasing of civilizational diseases".
In July, a European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) study identified 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables, which are consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
